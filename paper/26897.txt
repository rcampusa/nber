The Virus of Fear: The Political Impact of Ebola in the U.S.

JEL No. D72,D91

                                           ABSTRACT

We study how fear can affect the behavior of voters and politicians by looking at the Ebola scare
that hit the U.S. a month before the 2014 midterm elections. Exploiting the timing and location of
the four cases diagnosed in the U.S., we show that heightened concern about Ebola, as measured
by online activity, led to a lower vote share for the Democrats in congressional and gubernatorial
elections, as well as lower turnout, despite no evidence of a general anti-incumbent effect
(including on President Obama's approval ratings). We then show that politicians responded to
the Ebola scare by mentioning the disease in connection with immigration and terrorism in
newsletters and campaign ads. This response came only from Republicans, especially those
facing competitive races, suggesting a strategic use of the issue in conjunction with topics
perceived as favorable to them. Survey evidence suggests that voters responded with increasingly
conservative attitudes on immigration but not on other ideologically-charged issues. Taken
together, our findings indicate that emotional reactions associated with fear can have a strong
electoral impact, that politicians perceive and act strategically in response to this, and that the
process is mediated by issues that can be plausibly associated with the specific fear-triggering
factor.

1       Introduction
Emotions are widely recognized, both by practitioners and scholars, as a powerful force conditioning
voter behavior.2 Among those emotions, fear stands out as a particularly potent one. The idea that
one can mobilize voters around perceived threats ­ from crime, conflict, terrorism, diseases, and often
from people (e.g. immigrants or ethnic minorities) seen as associated with those threats ­ is a staple
of political campaigns and discourse in many different contexts. At the same time, it is often difficult
to isolate the impact of "fear itself" ­ that is, the emotional response ­ from policy judgments. Are
voters indeed changing their behavior as a result of fear, or is the latter simply correlated with policy
or ideological views that ultimately guide behavior?3 If it indeed has an impact, is the strategic
exploitation of fear by politicians a channel through which that takes place?
    To help answer these questions, we exploit a natural experiment that affected perceptions of threat,
while arguably having a negligible impact on the actual risk environment: the Ebola scare episode, as
experienced in the US, in the fall of 2014. While the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was then
the largest and most complex since the virus was first discovered in 1976 (WHO, 2017), it was well-
understood by public health experts at the time that the likelihood of an outbreak of the disease in the
U.S. was extremely low. Still, the episode triggered substantial fear and anxiety in the country, given
the gruesome nature of the disease, its associated fatality risk, and the absence of effective prevention
or treatment at the time.
    The Ebola scare is particularly interesting because it took place during campaign season, on the
weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, in which all U.S. House seats, as well as a number of U.S.
Senate seats, and state- and local-level positions, were being chosen. Ebola was a prominent topic of
media coverage at the time, and the idea that the episode was strategically used and had a political
impact in favor of Republicans in those elections has often been mentioned in media reports (e.g.
Gertz and Savillo (2014); Yglesias (2018)).4
    This paper shows causal evidence that Ebola concerns indeed had a significant effect in worsening

      See for instance Brader (2005), and references therein.
    3
      Research in political psychology has documented that threat is associated with political conservatism (e.g. Jost
et al. (2003), Thórisdóttir and Jost (2011)), but this has typically been done in a lab via experimental manipulation,
leaving open the question of to what extent this translates into practice in the context of an actual campaign with real
stakes.
    4
      In fact, studies have shown correlational evidence that voter intentions moved towards Republicans in places with
more intense concerns about the disease (Beall et al., 2016) and that Republican candidates were more likely to raise the
Ebola issue during the campaign (Cormack, 2014), as well as experimental evidence that partisan mentions of the topic
were associated with more negative attitudes towards immigrants (Adida et al., 2018).


                                                           1
the electoral performance of Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections. Moreover, it shows that this
did not happen because of a general anti-incumbent impact, whereby the perceived crisis may have,
for instance, affected the perception of effectiveness of President Obama, either rationally or through
misattribution. Instead, the effect seems associated with the strategic use of the crisis by Republicans,
who mentioned Ebola in connection with topics typically perceived to be favorable to them. The
response of voters in terms of reported attitudes, however, was only present when it comes to anti-
immigrant sentiment, suggesting that not all of the attempted associations actually stuck with voters.
   Our research design exploits the timing and geographical variation in the salience of the Ebola
threat perception. Specifically, between September and October 2014, there were precisely four di-
agnosed cases of Ebola on U.S. soil. First, a Liberian national visiting the U.S. was diagnosed in
Dallas, TX (September 30); then it was two nurses who had treated that patient, one of whom had
then traveled to Akron, OH (October 14); and finally, an American doctor returning from Guinea was
diagnosed in New York, NY (October 23). We show that distance to these places strongly predicts
Ebola concerns, as captured by web searches and social media (Twitter) activity, with the timing
consistent with the emergence of the cases, while not systematically associated with previous electoral
patterns. This allows us to instrument Ebola concerns with the distance to the closest Ebola location,
controlling for those previous patterns as well as a number of demographic characteristics.
   We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in Ebola concerns, as expressed in tweets or
searches, induced a lower Democratic vote share, by just over four percentage points in the House,
and three percentage points in Senate and gubernatorial elections. This corresponds to just over 1/7
of the average margin of victory in House elections. Alternatively, 40 House races would have been
swung by such a change ­ fifteen of which won by Republicans. Flipping those seats would have
erased Republican majority gains between 2012 and 2014. It also depressed turnout, with a one-
standard-deviation increase in Ebola searches associated with a drop of about 1.4 percentage points.
Interestingly, the 2014 midterm elections registered the lowest turnout (36.7%) since 1942, and the
percentage points corresponds to about one third of the drop relative to the preceding midterms in
2010 (40.8%) (McDonald, 2010).
   In contrast, we find a precisely estimated zero response of presidential approval ratings, as measured
by daily Gallup polls, to the timing of and distance to Ebola-related events, as well as no evidence of
Republican incumbents being punished. This suggests that the electoral impact did not come from
changes in the perception of incumbents and their performance in dealing with the threat of the
disease.
   We then look at the strategic response by politicians, using data on newsletters sent by members
of Congress to their constituents (Cormack, 2017), and on TV campaign advertisement by candidates.
We find that Republican members are more likely to mention Ebola and to appeal to fear-based
content after the emergence of the U.S. cases. They do so in conjunction with mentions to Obama,
and with traditionally Republican issues, such as immigration and terrorism, that can be associated
with threats. We also show that the members who respond more strongly are those who are involved
in races classified as competitive (as of before the Ebola episode), further establishing the strategic
motives behind the increased mentions. The strategic response is not particularly related to distance


                                                   2
to Ebola cases, suggesting that the response of voters is not simply driven by political messaging, and
that politicians are not merely responding to the voters' concerns.
    Last but not least, we look directly at the attitudes reported by voters, using data from the
Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). Compared to respondents interviewed in 2013,
exposure to Ebola in 2014 (again, instrumented using geographical proximity) is associated with more
negative attitudes towards immigrants. We do not find, however, any evidence of an impact on other
kinds of attitudes typically associated with conservatives in the context of the US, such as pro-gun
rights or opposed to same-sex marriage, nor on self-reported conservatism.
    In sum, we show evidence of fear being strategically exploited and having a meaningful impact
on an actual election, but mediated by issues that can be plausibly associated with the specific fear-
triggering factor, at least in the mind of the public, as opposed to a general move towards more
conservative attitudes, or to the threat being blamed on an incumbent. This could certainly depend
on the characteristics of the specific threat in question ­ for instance, the coronavirus (Covid-19)
episode of 2019-20 has meaningfully affected the public health risk environment around the globe, and
as such might have a different impact in terms of how voters evaluate the performance of incumbents.
Yet our findings suggest that the strategic possibilities available to politicians are constrained by
the associations that can be plausibly drawn by voters: they must be able to establish a connection
between the threat and a topic that favors them in the minds of voters.5
    Our paper relates to several strands of literature. A number of papers have studied the political
impact of threats such as terrorism in actual elections (Montalvo, 2011; Getmansky and Zeitzoff, 2014).
Our context exploits a perceived threat that is not political in nature, and documents the strategic
behavior of politicians in exploiting that perceived threat. Others have looked experimentally at the
impact of emotions on political behavior (Jost et al., 2003; Brader, 2005; Thórisdóttir and Jost, 2011)
or at correlations between emotions such as fear and disgust and conservative ideological views (Inbar
et al., 2012; Shook et al., 2017). We show the causal impact of these emotional reactions in an actual
election, and that this impact is not necessarily associated with more conservative attitudes in general.
A separate strand looks at the impact on incumbents of shocks unrelated to their actual performance,
such as lottery winnings (Bagues and Esteve-Volart, 2016) or the death of a spouse (Liberini et al.,
2017).6 Our results very much differ, as we find no evidence of the evaluation of incumbents being
affected, or of incumbents being generally punished.
    Last but not least, we relate to the contributions that have studied the social, economic, and
political effects of the Ebola crisis of 2014 (Beall et al., 2016; Adida et al., 2018; Maffioli, 2018; Kostova
et al., 2019; Gonzalez-Torres and Esposito, 2017; Flückiger et al., 2019; Bandiera et al., 2019). To the
best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to study the causal electoral impact of that crisis in a
country largely unaffected by that outbreak, from an epidemiological perspective.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the context and background
   5
      Note also that our empirical setting does not allow us to distinguish between the effect of the initial fear-triggering
shock ­ in this case, the Ebola infection cases ­ and that of its strategic exploitation by politicians. One should interpret
our results as identifying the causal impact of a fear shock that is in fact exploited by politicians.
    6
      This general idea goes back to a longstanding debate in the literature on the effect of "shark attacks," starting from
Achen and Bartels (2004). For a survey, see Healy and Malhotra (2013), as well as the discussions in Fowler and Hall
(2018) and Achen and Bartels (2018).

of the Ebola crisis and the 2014 midterm elections, and Sections 3 and 4 present the data and empirical
strategy, respectively. Section 5 discusses the results on voting and presidential approval ratings, and
Section 6 examines the politicians' strategic response. Section 7 considers the impact on reported
attitudes. Section 8 concludes.


2       Background
2.1     Ebola outbreak
The 2014-15 Ebola outbreak, the largest ever recorded for this virus, can be traced back to December
2013 when in a village in rural Guinea a 18-month boy suffered a bat-related infection. Following
several additional cases, and after the disease reached the capital city Conakry, on March 13, 2014 the
Guinea's Ministry of Health issued an official alert about an unidentified pathogen which would later
be confirmed to be Ebola. Over the following months, the epidemic grew exponentially expanding to
the rest of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. On August 8, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the outbreak an international public health emergency (WHO, 2014). The vast majority of
the Ebola-related deaths recorded worldwide were in Guinea (2,543), Liberia (4,809), and Sierra Leone
(3,956 deaths). Yet, over the following months the virus spread to various other countries - including
Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the UK - where, however, the death toll was much lower (i.e.,
between 3 and 20) (CDCP, 2019).
    The first case of Ebola in the U.S. was confirmed on September 30, 2014 when the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national
visiting the United States from Liberia, had been diagnosed in Dallas, Texas. Following an initial
misdiagnosis, Duncan's conditions quickly deteriorated until he died on October 8. Two nurses that
had assisted Duncan were later diagnosed with Ebola: Nina Pham, confirmed on October 11, and
Amber Joy Vinson, confirmed on October 14. Vinson's case was particularly alarming since days
before being diagnosed she had flown from Dallas to Cleveland, Ohio and visited her family in Akron,
Ohio. Both nurses were declared Ebola free after a few days. The fourth case was diagnosed in New
York city on October 23 and concerned Dr. Craig Spencer a physician who had just returned to the
U.S. from working with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea. Dr. Spencer was declared Ebola free
and released on November 11 (Bell et al., 2016).7
    Despite the limited number of cases, the presence of Ebola in the U.S. caused a major public
reaction. The issue rapidly attracted massive news coverage. In the five weeks following the first case,
over 3,000 news segments mentioning Ebola were aired on the top five cable TV networks alone.8
Indeed, according to a report by the Pew Research Center,9 the Ebola outbreak generated more
news interest than any previous public health crisis (including SARS, swine flu, and anthrax), and
    7
      Seven additional people, mostly medical workers, became ill while in West Africa but were transported and cared
for in the US. Six of them made full recovery, one passed away.
    8
      According to data from the Internet TV News Archive (https://archive.org/details/tv), precisely 3,148 distinct news
segments containing the word Ebola were aired between October 1, 2014 and November 4, 2014 on ABC, CBS, CNN,
Fox News, and NBC.

was comparable to some of the most important stories featured on U.S. media since 2010, such as
the killing of Osama Bin Laden and Hurricane Sandy (Motel, 2014). Media coverage of the Ebola
outbreak was criticized by many as excessively alarmist and even hysterical (Ihekweazu, 2017; Kelly
et al., 2015).
   Popular concern about the possible spread of the virus also raised rapidly. Polls conducted in
late October indicated that 36% of Americans were worried or very worried that they or their family
members might be exposed to the virus (SteelFisher et al., 2015), and that a staggering 16% perceived
the probability of contracting the virus within six months to be above 10% (Carman et al., 2015).
Furthermore, when asked to identify the most urgent health problem affecting the nation, respondents
would rank Ebola above other diseases such as obesity, cancer, and diabetes, which are three of the
main causes of death in the U.S. (SteelFisher et al., 2015). Fear of contagion was fueled by widespread
misinformation about the way the disease spreads. Indeed, according to another poll, 85% of Americans
believed that Ebola could be transmitted through sneezing or coughing and 48% that asymptomatic
carriers could be contagious (SteelFisher et al., 2015), both claims with no scientific base.

2.2      The 2014 U.S. midterm elections
The 2014 elections were held on Tuesday November 4, 2014, halfway through Barack Obama's second
presidential term. American voters were called to elect 435 House representatives, 36 senators in
36 states (including three special elections), and the governors of 36 states and three territories.
According to data from the United States Elections Projects, nationwide turnout ­ computed as the
ratio of total ballots cast to eligible voters ­ was 36.7%. This was about five percentage points lower
than the previous midterm elections held in 2010, and arguably the lowest since 1942.10 The 2014
election resulted in a large victory for the Republican party. In the House elections, Republicans won
247 seats (a net gain of 13 seats) against 188 for the Democrats, winning the popular vote by almost
6 percentage points and obtaining the largest House majority since 1928. Republicans also regained
control of the Senate winning 24 of the 36 available seats, a net gain of 9 seats and the largest Senate
gain in a midterm election since 1958. Similarly, in the gubernatorial elections, Republicans won 24
of the 36 state governorships, for a net gain of two seats, and two out of three in the territories.
   The Ebola outbreak, and the way federal authorities responded to it, also generated a heated
political debate, just a few weeks before the 2014 midterm elections. Republicans harshly criticized the
Obama administration for not preventing the virus to enter the country, and demanded the President
to ban all flights from affected West African countries, a measure that the administration opposed and
that public health experts deemed as ineffective and even potentially harmful (Ferrel and Agarwal,
2018). Anecdotally, there has been a widespread perception that Ebola was an important campaign
theme in the weeks leading up to the 2014 election (e.g. Gertz and Savillo (2014); Yglesias (2018)),
backed up by correlational evidence that Republican candidates were more likely to raise the Ebola
issue during the campaign (Cormack, 2014).

3     Data
In what follows we describe the data used in the various parts of our empirical analysis.

3.1   Ebola concerns
We use two measures of popular concern about Ebola based on users' online activity. The first one is
the volume of Google searches for the search topic "Ebola," available from the Google Trends website.
We collect data by media Designated Market Area (DMA) and by week for the 5-week period between
the first Ebola case and the elections, as well as for the month of August 2014 - i.e., when the World
Health Organization declared Ebola as an International health crisis but prior to the first case in the
U.S. - which we use for a placebo exercise. For each DMA, Google provides a measure of the search
volume defined between 0 and 100 relative to the highest point in the time series. The second measure
is the weekly number of messages containing the word "Ebola" or the hashtag "#Ebola" published on
the Twitter platform over the five weeks before the elections and over the months between March and
August 2014, which we use for a placebo exercise. Data were collected via the Twitter API. We focus
on tweets that are geo-located, which we can attribute to a specific DMA, and divide their number by
the DMA population.
    Figure 1 shows the evolution of the volume of Google searches about Ebola between January to
December 2014, and of the aggregate number of Ebola-related tweets from September to December
2014. The three vertical lines represent respectively: i) the day when the WHO declared Ebola an
international public health emergency (August 8), (ii) the day when CDC announced the first Ebola
case in the U.S. (September 30), and (iii) the day of the 2014 midterm elections (November 4). It is
evident how both searches and tweets are extremely responsive to Ebola-related events, with a local
peak after the WHO's declaration and global peak right after the first case. Furthermore, Ebola-related
online activity remained relatively high in the weeks before the elections, losing intensity immediately
afterwards.

3.2   Electoral results and presidential disapproval
For the analysis of the impact of Ebola concerns on voting, we use county-level data on turnout and
candidates' vote share for all elections held on November 4th 2014 ­ i.e., House, Senate, and Governors
­ available from the Dave Leip's Electoral Atlas. To control for pre-trends in political preferences, we
also use similar data for previous elections, i.e., 2012, 2010, 2008, 2006, and 2002 for the House, 2012,
2008, 2006, and 2002 for the Senate elections, and 2010, 2006 and 2002 for governors - available from
the same source.
    To explore the hypothesis that concerns for Ebola may have influenced voters' opinions about the
incumbent president, we use daily data on president Obama's (dis)approval ratings, available from
the Gallup daily tracking. Specifically, we construct a dummy variable equal to 1 for all respondents
that reported disapproving of the way Obama was handling his job as president at the time of the
interview. Exploiting the daily nature of these data, we look at the evolution of Obama's disapproval

                        Figure 1: Google Searches and Three Crucial Locations


in the 15 days before and after the occurrence of the three Ebola cases. We also perform our analysis
for the entire period between September 1 and the day of the elections.

3.3   Newsletter, ads, and race competitiveness
To investigate whether and how candidates reacted strategically to Ebola, we analyze the content of
the electronic newsletters sent by members of Congress and the campaign ads aired by candidates in
all the three races. Data on members' e-newsletters come from the DCinbox dataset assembled by
(Cormack, 2017). The data include every official e-newsletter sent by every sitting representative and
senator to her/his constituents. For each newsletter, the data report: the name of the politician, the
state of origin, the party affiliation, the congressional district, and the subject and the full text of the
newsletter. We use data on all e-newsletters sent between August and December 2014, for a total of
over 2,300 newsletters. We identify as Ebola-related all newsletters that contain the term "Ebola"
either in the subject or in the body of the newsletter, which represent about 10% of the total. Based
on this information we construct both an indicator variable for whether a given politician on a given
week sent at least one Ebola-related newsletter and a variable for the number of newsletters.
   Comprehensive data on the campaign ads aired on broadcast TV across 210 media markets by all
the candidates running in the 2014 elections are available from Kantar Media through the Wesleyan
Media Project (WMP). The data cover over 5,550 ads accounting for over 2.6 million airings. For each

airing the data reports the following information: date, time, media market, channel, length, sponsor
(i.e., candidates, parties, or interest groups) and the estimated cost. The data also include several
qualitative variables - coded by the WMP staff through a semi-automated procedure - regarding the
content of each ad, namely the issue(s) mentioned in it and the tone used. Crucially for the purpose
of our analysis, some of these variables indicate whether an ad - through its script, images, and music
- appeals to specific sentiments such as fear, anger, sadness.
      Finally, to examine whether candidates competing in closes races are more likely to use the issue
of Ebola in their campaign, we use information on the competitiveness of elections available from
the Cook Political Report (CPR). In particular, for each congressional or senatorial race, the Cook
Partisan Voting Index (PVI) indicates whether the election is likely to be close (i.e, "Toss Up", "Lean
Republican" or "Lean Democrat") or not (i.e., "Likely Republican" or "Likely Democrat"). To make
sure the measure of competitiveness is not itself affected by the Ebola episode, we use data from
September 19, 2014, i.e., before the first case.

3.4     Other variables
In all regressions, we also control for a wide range of variables both at the county and at the DMA
level. County-level controls includes: population density, median age, the share of white population,
the share of population with a college degree, income per capita, and unemployment rates all available
from the U.S. Census Bureau. DMA-level controls include instead: the level of cable penetration in
2010 (Sood, 2016), and the volume of Google searches for the terms "virus" and "anxiety," which is
meant to capture the general attitudes of the local population on issues related to infectious diseases.
Finally, for our empirical analysis we compute the shortest-path distance of each county or DMA from
the three locations of Ebola cases (i.e., Dallas, Cleveland/Akron, and New York City) as well as the
distance to the nearest one of the three.


4      Empirical Strategy
In order to unpack the political impact of the Ebola crisis, we start by asking how it affected voting
behavior. For that, we first implement the following basic specification:

                                               2010-06
                   V ote2014
                        c,d =  + Ebolad + V otec,d     +  Xc +  Dd + r +           d,c ,            (1)

where V ote2014
           c,d is the Democratic vote share in county c, located in DMA d. Ebolad, is the proxy for
Ebola concerns (Google searches or tweets per capita) in DMA d, during the five weeks immediately
before the 2014 election ­ that is, starting from the report of the first case diagnosed in the US.
                     -10
The vector V ote2012
                c,d      includes the Democratic vote share in 2010 house (midterm) election and its
change between 2010 and 2006 elections. The vectors Xc and Dd include county- and DMA-level
control variables, as described in the data section, and r stands for Census region dummies. Finally,
d,c   is a heteroskedasticity-robust error term, clustered at the DMA level.
      We are interested in the coefficient  , describing the impact of Ebola concerns on the Democratic


                                                    8
vote share. Simply estimating (1) via OLS is not enough, however, as the coefficient of interest may still
be biased for multiple reasons, even after conditioning on our control variables. First, Ebola concerns
are not randomly assigned: searching information about Ebola on the Internet, or tweeting about
it, are evidently endogenous decisions that may be affected by things such as access to information,
susceptibility to biased news, or beliefs that may also shape voting preferences. This is not to mention
the potential (arguably classical) measurement error in the main independent variable, which could
introduce attenuation bias in the estimated effect of Ebola concerns on electoral results. To address
these issues, we turn to the geographically uneven spread of Ebola cases, as a source of variation in
the perception of potential exposure to the threat of the disease.

4.1   Proximity to Ebola Cases as a Source of Variation
We identify the three key locations within the US, as described in Section 2: (1) Dallas, TX, (2) the
Cleveland-Akron area, in Ohio, and (3) New York City, NY. These were the only areas where the CDC
and state public health officials implemented contact-tracing procedures to surveil 458 individuals who
potentially had close personal contact with Ebola patients diagnosed in the U.S. (CDC 2014).
   It seems natural that people living closer to those key locations would display a heightened concern
with the potential threat. Figure 2, depicting the geographic variation in Ebola searches and the
location (in red dots) of the aforementioned three critical locations, suggests that this was indeed the
case. It is easy to see from inspection that Ebola concerns are associated with proximity to Dallas,
Cleveland, and New York.




                       Figure 2: Google Searches and Three Crucial Locations

   The point is underscored by Figure 3, showing the evolution of Ebola-related Google searches and
Twitter activity over time, for the three locations. The timing of the reactions to each case being


                                                    9
public should mitigate concerns that the association suggested in Figure 2 was due to mere chance, or
to other confounding factors unrelated to the perceived threat due to proximity.




                   Figure 3: Timing of Ebola-Related Google Searches and Tweets

   We can show this pattern more systematically, for our entire sample, by estimating the following
equation, exploiting the daily variation in Ebola-related tweets:

           T weetsd,t(c) = P ost - Onsett(c) × ln(Dist.Ebolac )d + d + t + t × d +         d,t ,      (2)

 where T weetsd,t(c) are Ebola-related tweets (per 1,000 inhabitants) sent from DMA d, on date t.
P ost-Onsett (c) is an indicator taking the value of 1 after the diagnosis of Ebola case c  T X, OH, N Y .
The variable ln(Dist.Ebolac )d is the (log) distance (in miles) of DMA d from the location of Ebola
case c. (d and t are DMA and day fixed effects, respectively, and t is a linear trend.) We will
cluster the standard errors at the DMA-level.

                                                   10
    Table 1 presents the main results. In columns 1 to 3, we first focus on the eve of each case, by looking
at 15 days before and after the diagnosis of each case (i.e., Dallas, Cleveland, and NYC, following
their chronological order). In each case, the coefficient for  closely mirrors the usual interpretation in
a standard multiple-period differences-in-differences (DD) specification with a continuous treatment.
In all cases, the volume of Ebola-related tweets increases with the proximity to the case, upon its
detection.11 Column 4 then displays a staggered DD model, estimating the three coefficients together
without restricting the sample to the eve of each case. Results suggest that the occurrence of and
proximity to the first two cases strongly predicts the increase in Ebola tweeting.

Notes: the table reports the coefficient of the interaction between the distance (in logs) to an Ebola Case and a dummy indicating the post-onset of that
case. The dependent variable is the number of ebola related tweets per 10,000 inhabitants in DMA (using 2010 census population). The unit observation is a
DMA-day. The coefficients are estimated from separate regressions in which we control for DMA fixed effect, day fixed effect, and DMA-specific linear trends
while restricting the sample as a function of the proximity each Ebola Case. The sample includes daily data by DMA 15 days before and 15 days after the
ebola diagnosis of the case. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the DMA-level are reported in parentheses.



    To summarize the association between geographical proximity and Ebola concerns, we compute
the distances (in miles) between the centroid of each DMA to each of the three locations, and then
take the minimum value to compute a variable we refer to as Distance to Nearest Case. We will use it
as an instrumental variable in the main regressions. As with any valid instrument, our variable must
be correlated with Ebola concerns but, conditional on our full set of controls, uncorrelated with any
unobserved characteristic of a locality that may affect voting behavior in a systematic way.
    We can examine the strength of the relationship between our instrument and the measures of Ebola
concerns, by estimating the first-stage regression:

                                                             -06

Table 2 presents different specifications estimating equation (3) and shows that, indeed, proximity to
the nearest reported Ebola case is a strong predictor of Ebola concerns. Column 1 establishes the

    Figures A.1, A.2, and A.3 in the appendix show how point estimates in columns 1, 2, and 3 of Table 1 become even
more negative as we constrain our regressions in terms of the proximity to Dallas, Cleveland, and NYC respectively.


                                                                             11
basic result using the search measure. Adding the full set of DMA controls (column 2), pre-trends in
voting (column 3), or regional dummies (column 4) does not substantially change the point estimate
for the instrument. The implied Kleibergen-Paap F-statistics for the first stage suggest that our
setting is not subject to a weak instrument problem: all F-statistics are substantially larger than the
standard Stock-Yogo critical values. Further, removing population weights in column 5 does not alter
our results. Columns 6 and 7 of Table 2 then confirm the results using the Twitter measure.

Notes: The variable Ebola Searches accounts for the google search volume of the term 'ebola' during the 5 weeks before the 2014 election. The variable Ebola
Tweets accounts for the number of tweets about 'ebola' per 10,000 inhabitants in DMA during the same period. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates
clustered at the DMA-level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for
two-sided hypothesis tests. County-level controls are population density, median age, share of white population, share of population with college degree, income
per capita, and unemployment. DMA-level controls are cable TV penetration 2010, Ebola Searches/Tweets before first case in the US, and google searches for the
terms 'anxiety' and 'virus', both in 2013. Previous election controls include the Democratic vote share for House in the midterm election of 2010 and its change
with respect to the 2006 midterm election.



     As for the exclusion restriction, Table 3 presents a few checks. We can see that distance to the
nearest Ebola case does not predict Ebola-related searches before the first diagnosed case in the U.S.
(column 1), and its correlation with Ebola tweets before the first case is a precisely estimated zero
(column 2). Nor does it predict Google searches during the swine flu pandemic of 2009. In short, our
instrument does not seem to be picking up some general interest in Ebola unrelated to the perception
of threat, or geographical variation in some persistent characteristic related to reactions to infection-
related risky situations in general.12 Similarly, and importantly, it does not predict political outcomes
prior to 2014: it is uncorrelated with the vote share of Democratic candidates for the preceding House,
Senate, or gubernatorial elections (columns 4-7).


5        The Political Impact of Ebola
5.1      Ebola and Voting: Baseline OLS Results
We first look at the basic correlation patterns, by estimating (1) via OLS. Table 4 presents the results
for U.S. House election outcomes, in order to maximize coverage and sample size, since not all states

     This is an important check since there is evidence that psychological mechanisms that have evolved to promote
disease-avoidance may encourage the endorsement of socially conservative beliefs (Terrizzi et al., 2013).

had Senate or gubernatorial elections that year. (We will discuss those elections later.) We weigh
regressions by DMA population, which does not qualitatively affect the results, as we will show, but
generally improves the precision of our estimates.
     We start by showing, in Column 1, that Ebola searches before the first case in the U.S. do not
predict the Democratic vote share in the 2014 midterm election. In contrast, column 2 shows a strong
unconditional correlation between Ebola concerns after the first case and the vote share for Democratic
candidates. This remains true even after controlling for possible confounding factors, captured by
regional dummies and by our county- and DMA-level variables (columns 3 and 4), which include
demographic characteristics, as well as media access (cable TV) and intensity of Google searches for
"anxiety" and "virus" (as of 2013), all of which might correlate with Ebola concerns and information,
as well as political views. The point estimate suggests that Democratic vote share is significantly
negatively associated with Ebola concerns: a one-standard-deviation increase in Ebola searches is
associated with a decrease in vote share of one fifth of a standard deviation (about four percentage
points).
     Democrats thus did poorly in areas that display greater Ebola concerns. This, however, could be
partly explained by selection: it could be that areas where Democrats had been doing poorly would
also be disproportionately concerned about Ebola. Column 5 suggests that this is indeed the case:
the coefficient of interest drops substantially once we control for the Democratic vote share in 2010
(the previous midterm election), as well as the change between 2006 and 2010.13 A similar pattern is
   13
     Results are remarkably similar if we look at presidential election years as well, namely controlling for 2012 vote
share and the change between 2010 and 2012.

present, if somewhat less starkly, when it comes to Ebola concerns as measured by tweets (columns
6-7).
    In sum, the basic OLS results show a correlation between Ebola concerns and the electoral perfor-
mance of Democrats, but also that selection on pre-existing political patterns is an important issue.
In order to establish a causal effect, we need a source of variation in Ebola concerns that does not
suffer from such selection. Table 3 has shown that the geographical patterns of Ebola cases provide
us with such a source.

5.2      Ebola and Voting: Instrumental Variable Results
The nature of the variation behind our IV strategy is quite apparent from Figure 4, which plots the
residuals of the Democratic share of the House vote in 2014 (regressed on our full set of control variables
described in equation (1)) on a map of U.S. counties marked with our three key Ebola locations. It
is apparent that Democrats seem to have performed relatively poorly in the areas around the latter,
especially for the Texas and Ohio cases.
    This basic intuition is confirmed by Table 5, which presents the main IV results for U.S. House
elections. Columns 1-2 show the reduced-form results, with distance to the nearest Ebola case strongly
predicting Democratic electoral performance. Columns 3-6 then show the population-weighted and
unweighted IV estimates, implying a negative and highly significant effect of Ebola concerns on the


                                                                             14

       Note: The figure shows the geographical distribution of the residuals obtained from a regression of Demo-

Democratic vote share, whether they are measured by Google searches or tweets. Broadly speaking,
we estimate a quantitatively large impact of Ebola concerns on Democratic vote shares: from column
3, a one-standard-deviation increase in Ebola concerns leads to a decrease in vote share of about 4.5
percentage points (just over one fifth of a standard deviation). This is indeed a meaningful effect:
40 House of Representatives races were defined by a margin of nine percentage points or less, which
would have been flipped by that change. Fifteen of those were won by the Republican candidate,
and flipping those seats to the Democratic column would have completely wiped out the Republican
majority's increase relative to 2012.14
    We can also look at the impact of Ebola on other electoral outcomes. Table 6 shows results for
senatorial and gubernatorial races, as well as overall turnout rates, with odd (even) columns using
the Google search (Twitter) measure. We find that Democrats are also negatively affected by Ebola
concerns in the senatorial and gubernatorial races. The magnitude of the standardized effects is again
quite substantial: a one-standard-deviation increase in Ebola concerns reduces the Democratic vote
share by just about one fifth of a standard deviation. Put differently, those increases in Ebola concerns
translate into a 3.1 percentage-point (3.3 p.p.) decrease in vote share for the Senate (gubernatorial)
election. Extrapolating the results for the gubernatorial election can convey this magnitude quite
starkly: this hypothetical loss in vote share would have been decisive in eight gubernatorial elections
in which Republican candidates won by less than six percentage points.15 .
    Finally, columns 5 and 6 of Table 6 showcase a substantial negative impact of Ebola concerns on
total voter turnout. In fact, the magnitude is such that a one-standard-deviation increase in Ebola

 Ebola Tweets accounts for the number of tweets about 'ebola' per 10,000 inhabitants in DMA during the same period. All regressions but those on
 columns (4) and (6) are weighted by DMA population. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the DMA-level are reported

 County-level controls are population density, median age, share of white population, share of population with college degree, income per capita, and
 unemployment. DMA-level controls are cable TV penetration 2010, Ebola Searches/Tweets before first case in the US, and google searches for the
 terms 'anxiety' and 'virus', both in 2013. Previous election controls include the Democratic vote share for House in the midterm election of 2010 and
 its change with respect to the 2006 midterm election.




searches would have led to a drop of about 1.4 percentage points. Interestingly, the 2014 midterm
elections registered the lowest turnout (36.7%) since 1942, and the 1.4 percentage points corresponds
to about one third of the drop relative to the preceding midterms in 2010 (40.8%) (McDonald 2010).
This suggests that the decline in the Democratic vote share may have been to an important extent
due to potential supporters being induced to abstain from voting.
     In sum, the Ebola threat had a substantial negative impact on the electoral fortunes of Democrats
in the 2014 midterms, across congressional and gubernatorial races.

5.3      Were Voters Blaming Incumbents?
One possible mechanism underlying our results could be an anti-incumbent effect, whereby the per-
ceived crisis may have affected the perception of effectiveness of incumbent officials, both at the
national and local level, either rationally or through misattribution. After all, it is possible that voters
could be making inferences about incumbent performance based on their perception of the govern-
ment's response to the Ebola crisis, not to mention that there is substantial evidence that voters may
punish or reward incumbents for outcomes over which they have little influence.
     We first consider the possibility of a general anti-incumbent channel, looking at voting results by
incumbency status. Table 7 shows that, for all types of election, we do not find that incumbents faced
a reduction in vote shares due to Ebola concerns (odd columns). It was only Democratic incumbents
who experienced a substantial a reduction in their vote share as a result of those concerns (even

columns).
   While this pattern rules out a general anti-incumbent effect, it is still consistent with the possibility
of voters punishing Democrats, at all levels, due to an attribution of responsibility to President Obama.
If that were the case, we would expect to see Obama's approval ratings negatively affected by the
timing of and distance to Ebola-related events. We explore that possibility by exploiting individual-
level (daily) Gallup data on presidential approval ratings to estimate the following model:

             Disapprovei,d,t(c) = P ost - Caset(c) × ln(Dist.Ebolac )d +  Xi + d + t +                           d,t ,            (4)

where Disapprovei,d,t(c) is an indicator taking value 1 if individual i living in DMA d disapproves
of Obama's job as president, and 0 otherwise. P ostCaset (c) is an indicator taking value 1 after the
diagnosis of Ebola case c. The variable ln(Dist.Ebolac )d is the distance (in logs) of DMA d from Ebola
case c. The vector Xi includes individual level controls (e.g., age, gender, race, etc), d is a collection
of DMA fixed effects, and t is a collection of day fixed effects.
   The results are in Table 8. In columns 1-3, we focus on a window of 15 days before and after the
diagnosis of the first Ebola case in the three different locations (Texas, Ohio, and New York). Results
suggest that the timing of the events and proximity to the cases do not affect Obama's disapproval

rates ­ in fact, we find a very precisely estimated zero effect.. We then exploit, in column 4, all the
daily data from September 1st to November 30th 2014, and estimate the three interaction terms.
Again, we find no evidence of an association. In column 5 we test whether the proximity to any of
the three locations predicted Obama's disapproval after the first case in the US, and find no evidence
of that either. Finally, the result is not an artifact of the Gallup data: column 6 shows no impact on
Obama's disapproval as measured by the CCES survey.
    In sum, we find no evidence of a general anti-incumbent effect of the Ebola crisis, nor of an impact
on President Obama's approval ratings. This suggests that the political impact of Ebola was not
about voters being disappointed with a policy response, or irrationally misattributing responsibility,
and punishing politicians as a result. To shed additional light on the nature of that impact, we now
turn to look at the strategic response by politicians.


6    The Strategic Response to Ebola
We now ask whether the widely perceived role of Ebola as an important campaign theme, in the weeks
leading up to the 2014 election, is borne out more systematically in the data, and, moreover, whether
it responded to strategic considerations.

6.1      Congressional Newsletters
We start by exploiting weekly variation obtained from the textual analysis of the content of e-
newsletters sent by members of Congress to their constituents. In particular, we are interested in
understanding systematic differences across parties and over time, in response to Ebola-related events.
   For that we estimate different versions of the following general model:

               N ewsletterc,t = P ostOnsett × M emberc +  Xc,t + t + c + t × c +                              c,t ,           (5)

where N ewsletterc,t is one of the several measures of newsletter activity by a member of congress
c, as of week t. In particular, we look at an indicator of whether at least one newsletter was sent,
the total number in a particular week (a flow variable), or the stock of newsletters sent since August
2014. Our main coefficient of interest captures the effect of the interaction between P ostOnsett (an
indicator taking value 1 in the period after the onset Ebola cases) and M emberc , which is a cross-
sectional characteristic of the candidate c or her electoral district, capturing the differential change in
behavior, upon the onset of Ebola cases, by members of Congress with that characteristic. The vector

Xc,t accounts for the length of the newsletters in terms of number of words, t is a collection of week
fixed effects, and c is a collection of member of Congress fixed effects. Finally, t × c accounts for
politician-specific linear trends. We cluster the standard errors at the level of members of Congress.
    Figure 5 displays the evolution of Ebola-related newsletters by Republican and Democrats. It is
immediately apparent that mentions to Ebola increased dramatically upon the occurrence of the first
U.S. case. There is also a clear difference across parties: Republicans respond much more strongly.
This confirmed more systematically by Panel A in Table 9. By all of our measures, Republicans were
more likely to send Ebola-related content in their newsletters. The magnitude is quite important:
Republicans were 6.4 percentage points more likely to mention Ebola in a e-newsletter after the
detection of the first case on U.S. soil (from column 1); this doubles the average probability of sending
a newsletter mentioning Ebola in a given week during the sample period August-November 2014
(3.1%). This was in spite of the fact that they did not become more likely to send newsletters in
general.




                                  Figure 5: Evolution of Newsletters by Party

    Was that response by Republican politicians strategic, or were they more likely to mention Ebola
in their newsletters simply because they were also more likely to care about the crisis? One piece of
evidence, is also evident in Figure 5, which shows a precipitous drop in Ebola mentions immediately
after the election.     16   What is more, we also find (Panel B of Table 9) that Republicans facing a
competitive midterm election reacted much more strongly to the occurrence of the first Ebola case in
   16
      This is confirmed in Table A.2 in the appendix. In the appendix, we also exploit the timing of different cases. Table
A.3 shows that the second case, associated with Ohio, caused a differentially larger reaction from Republican members,
and Table A.5 shows that the increase after that second case from members of Congress whose constituents were close
to the existing cases is again entirely explained by Republicans.

Notes: The unit of observation is member of congress - week. The sample focuses on 367 member of the congress (i.e., senators and house representatives) who sent sent at least one official
e-newsletters between August 2014 and the midterm election. The dependent variables are indicators taking value 1 if the member of the congress sent that week a newsletter mentioning the
subjects listed in each column. The main independent variable accounts for the interaction between a dummy indicating the post-onset of the first case in Dallas and an indicator taking value
1 if the member of the congress is republican, 0 otherwise. Specifications in all panels include week fixed effects, newsletter controls, and member of the congress-specific linear trends. The
number of observations is 5505 and the number of clusters is 367. Newsletter controls are the number of words and accumulated number of words. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error
estimates clustered at the member of congress-level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided
hypothesis tests.




the US.17 There is a strongly heterogeneous pattern: after the first case, Republicans facing a very
competitive race were a full 25 percentage points more likely to send a newsletter mentioning Ebola,
compared to those facing less competitive races (column 1). We find similar results when looking
at either the weekly number (column 2) or accumulated number of Ebola-related newsletters since
August 2014 (column 3). This set of results is very much suggestive of a strategic use of the Ebola
crisis by Republican politicians.
      Panel C further establishes that Republican members of Congress were inclined to mention Ebola
in conjunction with particular topics. Specifically, we look at newsletters mentioning terrorism, immi-
gration, and President Obama. As it turns out, while Republicans reduced, if anything, the frequency
with which they mentioned those issues after the first Ebola case in the US, they very much increased
that with which they mentioned them in conjunction with Ebola, as can also be seen in Figure 5.
After the first case, Republicans were 2.5 p.p and 3.3 p.p more likely to mention immigration (column
4) and Obama (column 5) in the same newsletters in which they mentioned Ebola. This represents
    17
         By September 19, 2014, 36 (resp. 12) House (resp. Senate) races are classified as competitive.


                                                                                                   21
more than twice the average probability of receiving a newsletter mentioning those immigration and
Ebola during the sample period August-November 2014.
   Could it be that all politicians were simply responding to the concerns of their constituents? Table
A.4 in the Appendix shows that, on average, members of Congress were not very responsive, in terms
of mentioning Ebola in their newsletters, to the distance to the nearest Ebola case ­ which, as we
have seen, predicts Ebola concerns. This suggests the latter weren't simply driven by the effort of
politicians to raise the salience of the threat. Again, however, it was only Republicans who responded
in such fashion (see Table A.5).
   Documenting these patterns begs the question of whether the effort by Republican politicians
translated into additional votes. To answer that, we slightly modify equation (1), by replacing our
indicator of Ebola concerns with an indicator for whether at least one Ebola-related newsletter had
been sent to a county. While we do not have a clear source of exogenous variation in the decision to
send the newsletter, we can exploit within-DMA variation in our treatment for the House election.
Put simply, we can add DMA fixed effects to equation (1), and still be able to estimate our main
coefficient of interest.
   In Table 10 we show how our coefficient of interest changes as we add different levels of cross-
sectional fixed effects. In column 1 we only account for the baseline set of county-level, DMA-level,
and previous elections controls. We then sequentially add region, state, and DMA fixed effects in
column 2,3, and 4, respectively. We find that, even after accounting for DMA-level unobservables,
counties that received Ebola-related newsletters from Republican members of Congress experienced
a large drop in Democratic vote shares. Again, while it is hard to draw causal claims from this
particularexercise, the results are suggestive that Republicans may have benefited from priming Ebola
concerns to their constituents. Taking point estimate from column 4 at face value, counties that
received at least one Ebola-related newsletter experienced a drop in Democratic vote share of 4.4
percentage points, compared to those what did not receive any.

6.2    Campaign Ads
We now turn to the data on campaign ads, as it seems natural to expect that any strategic response
by politicians would be reflected in their advertising. In this case, we can exploit weekly variation
in the number and content of ads that candidates in House, Senate, and gubernatorial races placed
on TV. When it comes to the content, one limitation is that we do not have information on whether
ads mentioned Ebola, since that was not tracked by the Wesleyan Media Project. The latter did
track mentions to specific issues, out of which we focus on a few that tend to be topics that are often
perceived to favor conservative politicians: terrorism, immigration, and religion.
   We estimate the following model, analogous to (6.1):

             Adsc(r),t = P ost - Onsett × M emberc +  Xc,t + t + r + t × r +         c(r),t ,       (6)

 where Adsc(r),t is one of the several content-based measures of different types of ads placed by
candidate c in race r. We define extensive and intensive (flow and stock) measures, along the lines

Notes: All specifications are weighted by DMA population. The variable Ebola Newsletters is a dummy equal to 1 if the
term 'ebola' is mentioned in a political newsletter sent a by Republican House Representative in Congressional District
during Aug.-Dec.2014. All regressions but the one in column (5) are weighted by DMA population. Heteroskedasticity

of the ones for the newsletter data. The vector Xc,t now includes the weekly flow and accumulated
stock of ads (since August 1st 2014), as well as their total time duration. Further, t is a collection of
week fixed effects and c(r) a collection of candidate (or race) fixed effects. Finally, t × c accounts
for race-specific linear trends. We cluster the standard errors at the level of races.
   We start by focusing on the within-race variation ­ namely, comparing candidates competing in
the same race and analyzing whether the Republican chooses to air different types of ads after the
occurrence of the first Ebola case. Table 11 displays the results for four different issues: terrorism,
immigration, President Obama, and religion. With the exception of terrorism, the aforementioned
issues are more prevalent in Republican ads (both in the intensive and extensive margin): they are 4.1,
14.4, and 2.4 percentage points more likely to mention immigration, Obama, and religion, respectively,
before the onset of Ebola. What is more, Republican candidates become even more likely to air ads
about immigration and Obama, after the occurrence of the first case of Ebola in U.S. soil, but now
also about terrorism ­ and not so for religion.

Notes: The unit of observation a candidate - week. The sample focuses on 597 candidates for congress (house or senate) and state governor who aired at least campaign ad between
August 2014 and the midterm election. The main independent variable accounts for the interaction between a dummy indicating the post-onset of the firt case in the US and an
indicator taking value 1 if the candidate is republican, 0 otherwise. Ad controls are the number of ads and their total time in week as well as the accumulated number of ads and their
total time since August 1st 2014. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the race-level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the

     This indicates quite clearly that, while Republicans generally focus on a distinct set of topics
compared to Democrats, that focus clearly changed in response to the onset of Ebola. They did not
simply increase the volume of ads on all topics they typically favor, but rather increased the emphasis
on a (presumably negative) framing of President Obama, as well as on issues that could potentially
be tied to fear of external threats (terrorism, immigration).
     We can actually look directly at whether fear was an important component of that strategy. The
"Political Advertising in 2014" dataset codes whether ads feature an appeal to fear, based on the use of
ominous music and on the text of the ad. Using that information, we compute the total number of ads
appealing to fear, as well as the total number of such ads that also mention terrorism, immigration,
or criticism of Obama.
     Figure 6 displays some interesting patterns in those data. First, Republicans and Democrats seem
to appeal to fear at similar rates throughout the period, which may be surprising in light of the
literature that shows that priming fear in an experimental environment leads to more conservative
political views (e.g. Jost et al 2003, Thorisdottir and Jost 2011). However, ads appealing to fear while
mentioning immigration are substantially more prevalent in Republican ads, and that combination
increases substantially after the occurrence of the first Ebola case in the US. Panel A of Table 12,
again focusing on within-race variation, shows that these patterns hold systematically, and not just
for immigration: Republicans also combine fear with terrorism and Obama, and more so after the first
Ebola case.18
     This is eminently consistent with a strategic fear-based response that tries to tie the perceived Ebola
threat to specific topics that favor Republicans. The strategic nature of this response is underscored
  18
     In Table A.6, in the appendix, we show our results still hold when we add candidate fixed effects. We also show in
Table A.7 that the first two Ebola-related events explain most of the effect documented in Panel A of Table 12.



                                                                                          24
                      Figure 6: Evolution of Fear Appealing Campaign Ads by Party


by Panel B of Table 12, where we analyze the potential heterogeneous effect of Ebola according the
degree of competitiveness of each race. Consistent with the result on congressional newsletters, we find
that Republicans facing a competitive race tend to mention more terrorism, immigration, and Obama
in fear-appealing ads, after the first Ebola case. Compared to those facing a less competitive race,
a very competitive race increased the stock of fear-appealing ads mentioning terrorism, immigration,
and criticism of Obama increases by 70, 173, and 634 weekly ads, respectively.
     Finally, in Panel C of Table 12 we ask whether campaign ads were responsive to the distance
between potential voters and the nearest Ebola case. As with newsletters, we find no effect on average
for all candidates (odd columns). In this case, however, we do not detect a link with distance even for
Republican candidates (even columns). This reinforces the conclusion that politicians were not simply
responding to voters, and that the latter were not simply being prompted by the messages coming
from politicians.19


7        Did Ebola Make Voters More Conservative?
We have shown that the Ebola-related episodes in the U.S. triggered a strategic response by Republican
politicians, and that they benefited the latter in the ballot box. In the absence of a separate source
of exogenous variation for the behavior of politicians, we cannot establish whether the electoral effect
    19
     In Tables A.8 to A.11 in the appendix, we further investigate the potential role of proximity to Ebola cases by
looking at a window of two weeks before and after the diagnosis of the first Ebola case in the three different locations
(Texas, Ohio, and New York), or by looking to the whole period and estimating the three relevant interaction terms.
Again we do not find strong evidence that distance strongly predicts changes in the content of ads after the occurrence
of each case.

Notes: The unit of observation a candidate - week. The sample focuses on 597 candidates for congress (house or senate) and state governor who aired at least campaign ad between August 2014 and the midterm
election. The coding of an ads appealing to fear is based on codding by Political Advertising in 2014 (Wesleyan Media Project) in two dimensions: 1) whether any ominous/tense music is played during the
ad, or 2) there is direct appeal to fear in ads regardless of the music. The independent variable Post-Onset is a dummy indicating the post-onset of the first case in the US whereas Republican is an indicator
taking value 1 if the candidate is republican, 0 otherwise. Based on the 2014 House Race and Senate Race Ratings for Sept. 19, 2014 (right before first-ebola case) by the Cook political report, the variable
Competitive Race takes value 1 if the race is classified as 'Toss Up' or 'Lean', 0 otherwise. Specifications in all panels include week fixed effects, ads controls, and race-specific linear trends. The number of
observations in Panel A and B is 8624 and the number of clusters is 228. Ad controls are the number of ads and their total time in week as well as the accumulated number of ads and their total time since
August 1st 2014. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the race-level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the

was caused by that behavior. However, we can look at whether voters changed their views in response
to the Ebola threat. This is particularly important as it allows us to ascertain the extent to which the
electoral impact was related to a broad threat-induced conservative shift in attitudes, as opposed to
something more specific.
      For that we resort to the CCES data, with which we replicate the exact same approach as in
(5.3). As dependent variables of interest, we look at five attitudinal measures of surveyed individuals,
which we can tie to conservative views: anti-immigration, pro-gun, religious, opposition to same sex
marriage, and self-reported conservatism. Table 13 presents the main results. Point estimates suggest
that the proximity to an Ebola case after the first Ebola does not explain disagreement with gun

control measures, beliefs regarding the importance of religion, opposition towards gay marriage, or
self-reported conservatism.
     There is one dimension that does seem to be impacted by Ebola: attitudes towards immigra-
tion. Specifically, individuals leaving closer to an Ebola case tend to have stronger anti-immigration
attitudes, after the occurrence of the first case.20
     These findings have two important implications. First, the impact of the concerns regarding Ebola
was not necessarily associated with more conservative attitudes in general, which was a possibility
suggested by the previous experimental literature. Second, the results suggest that not all associations
drawn by politicians were able to change voters' minds: as already documented in Section 5, our
treatment does not explain disapproval rates of Obama, even though Republicans tried to push this
connection. Instead, the strategic exploitation of the Ebola threat by politicians seems to have been
constrained by those associations that can be more readily drawn by voters in regard to that threat.

 Notes: Sample includes all CCES's respondents for years 2013 and 2014. The variable Anti-Immigration (pro-gun)[religious] corresponds to the first principal component
 of responses to 5 (5)[3] questions regarding immigration (disagreement with gun-control measures)[importance of religion]. The variable Anti-gay Marriage takes value
 of 1 if respondent is against gay marriage. The variable conservative takes value of 1 if respondent is conservative or very conservative, 0 otherwise. The variable
 disapprove Obama takes value 1 if the respondent strongly disapproves or disapproves Obama, 0 otherwise. (all related questions are described in the appendix)
 The main independent variable accounts for the interaction between the distance (in logs) to the nearest Ebola Case and a dummy indicating the onset of that case.

8        Concluding Remarks
Our investigation of the political consequences of the 2014 Ebola episode in the U.S. has uncovered
a number of important effects. First, Ebola concerns caused a decrease in the Democratic vote
share in that year's midterm elections, which was not related to a general or Obama-specific anti-
incumbent reaction. Second, Republican candidates exploited the episode in their campaign strategy,
by emphasizing the topic in conjunction with themes such as immigration, terrorism, and anti-Obama
rhetoric. Finally, the salience of the Ebola threat also affected views on a subset of those themes,
particularly related to increased anti-immigration sentiment.
     Generally speaking, our results establish that fear of threats can indeed be a potent electoral force,
in a high-stakes context in which we can isolate an exogenous shock to that fear that is relatively
    20
    Reassuringly, we find the same patterns when we estimate the three distances interaction after each case in Table
A.12 in the appendix.



                                                                                       27
disconnected from the extent of the actual threat. They also suggest, however, that this force cannot
be freely molded by politicians. Instead, the impact of the threat in changing voters' minds seems
predicated on there being easily drawn connections between the threat and specific issues. In the case
of Ebola, a gruesome disease originating abroad, the association with immigration seems to have stuck
with voters.
   The extent to which the lessons from Ebola apply to other salient threats is an open question, but
we can nevertheless identify some dimensions that are worth considering. For instance, shocks that
actually affect the risk environment ­ such as Ebola itself in the context of West Africa, or the recent
coronavirus (COVID-19) episode in many countries around the world ­ could well lead to a stronger
updating of views on incumbent performance. As another example, we must consider which kinds of
issues can be plausibly associated with the threat ­ shark attacks, to use a well-known example, are
unlikely to lead to changed views on immigration. Finally, the timing could well matter: the Ebola
crisis happened to reach the U.S. just a few weeks before an election, and had more time elapsed it
could well be that effects would be more muted.
   Last but not least, it would also be interesting to assess the role that the media may play in
amplifying the impact of a perceived threat. We have seen evidence that the media gave extensive
coverage to the handful of Ebola cases in the US, and that coverage dropped precipitously after the
midterm elections. The extent to which this mattered for the effects we find remains a question for
future research.

                     Figure A.1: Ebola-Related Twitter Activity (Dallas)




       Note: The figure plots the coefficients and the 95% confidence intervals for the interaction
       between distance (in logs) to Dallas and a dummy indicating the onset of the first ebola
       case in Dallas. The dependent variable is the number of ebola related tweets per 10,000
       inhabitants in DMA (using 2010 census population). The unit observation is a DMA-day.
       The coefficients are estimated from separate regressions in which we control for DMA
       fixed effect, day fixed effect, and DMA-specific linear trends while restricting the sample
       as a function of the proximity to Dallas. The sample includes daily data by DMA 15 days
       before and 15 days after the ebola diagnosis of the case. Confidence intervals are based
       on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered by DMA.The number of DMAs for
       each regression (clusters) are reported in brackets.

ebola case in Cleveland. The dependent variable is the number of ebola related tweets
per 10,000 inhabitants in DMA (using 2010 census population). The unit observation is

Notes: The unit of observation is member of congress - week. The sample focuses on 367 member of the
congress (i.e., senators and house representatives) who sent sent at least one official e-newsletters between
August 2014 and December 2014. The variable Ebola Newsletter Indicator takes value 1 if the member
of the congress sent that week a newsletter mentioning ebola, 0 otherwise.The variable Number of Ebola
Newsletter accounts for the number of newsletter mentioning ebola that were sent that week by the member
of the congress. The variables Any Newsletter Indicator and Number of Newsletters consider all newsletter
regardless of their contents. The main independent variable accounts for the interaction between a dummy
indicating the post-midterm election period and an indicator taking value 1 if the member of the congress
is republican, 0 otherwise. Newsletter controls are the number of words and accumulated number of words.

Notes: The unit of observation is member of congress - week. The sample focuses on 367 member of the congress (i.e., senators and house representatives) who sent sent at least one
official e-newsletters between August 2014 and the midterm election. In columns 1 to 6, the analysis focuses in 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the diagnosis of each ebola case.
The variable Ebola Newsletter Indicator takes value 1 if the member of the congress sent that week a newsletter mentioning ebola, 0 otherwise. The variable Ebola Newsletter Stock
accounts for the accumulated number of newsletter mentioning ebola that were sent since August 2014 by the member of the congress. The main independent variables accounts for
the interaction between a dummy indicating the post-onset of each ebola case and the distance from each member's constituents to the location of the case. Newsletter controls are
the number of words and accumulated number of words. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the member of congress-level are reported in parentheses;
*** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Notes: The unit of observation a candidate - week. The sample focuses on 624 candidates for congress (house or senate) and state governor who aired at least campaign ad between
August 2014 and the midterm election. The coding of an ads appealing to fear is based on codding by Political Advertising in 2014 (Wesleyan Media Project) in two dimensions: 1)
whether any ominous/tense music is played during the ad, or 2) there is direct appeal to fear in ads regardless of the music.The main independent variable accounts for the interaction
between a dummy indicating the post-onset of the first case in the US and an indicator taking value 1 if the candidate is republican, 0 otherwise. Ad controls are the number of ads
and their total time in week as well as the accumulated number of ads and their total time since August 1st 2014. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the
race-level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Notes: The unit of observation a candidate - week. The sample focuses on 624 candidates for congress (house or senate) and state governor who aired at least campaign ad between
August 2014 and the midterm election. The coding of an ads appealing to fear is based on codding by Political Advertising in 2014 (Wesleyan Media Project) in two dimensions: 1)
whether any ominous/tense music is played during the ad, or 2) there is direct appeal to fear in ads regardless of the music.The main independent variable accounts for the interaction
between a dummy indicating the post-onset of the first case in the US and an indicator taking value 1 if the candidate is republican, 0 otherwise. Ad controls are the number of ads
and their total time in week as well as the accumulated number of ads and their total time since August 1st 2014. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the
race-level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Notes: The unit of observation a candidate - week. The sample focuses on 306 republican candidates for congress (house or senate) and state governor who
aired at least campaign ad between August 2014 and the midterm election. The coding of an ads appealing to fear is based on codding by Political Advertising
in 2014 (Wesleyan Media Project) in two dimensions: 1) whether any ominous/tense music is played during the ad, or 2) there is direct appeal to fear in ads
regardless of the music.The main independent variable accounts for the interaction between a dummy indicating the post-onset of the first case in the US
and and the distance (in logs) to the closest ebola case. Ad controls are the number of ads and their total time in week as well as the accumulated number
of ads and their total time since August 1st 2014. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the race-level are reported in parentheses;
*** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Notes: Sample includes all CCES's respondents for years 2013 and 2014. The variable Anti-Immigration (pro-gun)[religious] corresponds to the first principal
component of responses to 5 (5)[3] questions regarding immigration (disagreement with gun-control measures)[importance of religion]. The variable Anti-gay
Marriage takes value of 1 if respondent is against gay marriage. The variable conservative takes value of 1 if respondent is conservative or very conservative,
0 otherwise. The variable disapprove Obama takes value 1 if the respondent strongly disapproves or disapproves Obama, 0 otherwise (all related questions
are described in the appendix). The main independent variables account for the interaction between a dummy for the post-onset of an ebola case and
the distance (in logs) to that case. Individual-levels control are age and a set of indicators variables for male, white, hispanic, college or higher education,
married, and annual income above US median (i.e., usd 59,000). Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the county-level are reported
in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.
