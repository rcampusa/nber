                                           ABSTRACT

Discussions of financial risk often fail to distinguish between risks that are consciously borne and

those that are not. To understand the breeding conditions for financial crises the prime focus of

concern should not be simply on large risk-taking per se, but on the unintended, or unanticipated

accumulation of large risks by individuals, institutions or governments, often through the lack of

knowledge or understanding of the risks by stakeholders and overseers of those entities. This paper

analyses specific situations in which significant unanticipated and unintended financial risks are

accumulated. It focuses, in particular, on the implicit guarantees that governments extend to banks

and other financial institutions, which may result in the accumulation, often unconscious from the

viewpoint of the government, of unanticipated risks in the balance sheet of the public sector. The

paper also discusses how risk exposures can be measured, hedged and transferred through the use

of derivatives, swap contracts, and other contractual agreements with specific reference to emerging

markets.

1.   Risk and transparency

     Well-functioning financial markets carry out many tasks: the transfer of value over time

(borrowing-lending), across borders and industries, the facilitation of payments, the

fragmentation of large-size investment projects. An important latent function of financial

markets is to provide timely information: on the expectations of economic agents and on the

value of the economy’s assets.

     But perhaps the foremost function financial markets perform is the transfer or allocation

of risk among different actors: young people, for instance, tend to be better equipped in taking

on risk than old people. Given a total amount of risk in the economy, financial markets and

financial institutions contribute to its distribution among different actors in a way that better

fits individual preferences or conditions.

     Financial markets, however, are often “incomplete”, in the sense that they provide only

limited possibilities to shift risk across individuals. The role of swaps and other privately

negotiated derivative instruments is to complete financial markets, thus increasing the ability

of individuals, financial institutions, corporations and governments to manage risk.


1.1 Risk and derivatives

     Consider, for example, an emerging market economy. The domestic financial market will

typically allow very limited diversification of risks. In such a situation, diversification through

international capital mobility is the obvious alternative. However, the transfer across borders of

the ownership of real and financial assets is a rather inflexible way to achieve diversification,

in the sense that it is costly to reverse. Often it also runs against political constraints.

     Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivative contracts provide an appealing alternative. Equity

swaps, for instance, allow a country to diversify risk without shifting the ownership of assets.

For example, a government could impose tight capital controls, limit foreign ownership of




                                                   1
domestic firms and still diversify the country’s exposure to domestic risk through equity swap

contracts with foreigners that do not require the transfer of ownership of the underlying asset.

        The general point is that risk diversification through derivative instruments is more

flexible than diversification through the transfer of assets. Interest rate swaps, for instance, one

of the most common of these instruments, allow banks to service both their borrowers, who

want fixed-interest rate, long-dated loans and their depositor lenders, who do not wish to be

exposed to interest rate risk, without the bank taking interest rate exposure itself. Credit-

default swaps allow a bank to swap credit risk vis-à-vis one borrower for credit risk vis-à-vis a

different set of borrowers: the risk-return performance of the bank may thus be improved

without negatively affecting its relationship with customers—as might happen if the bank were

to sell the loans. We discuss these instruments further in Section 6 of this paper.

        A volatile economic environment increases the incentive to use derivatives to achieve a

better allocation of risk in the economy. During the first half of 2002, as uncertainty in the

world economy was increasing, the size of the OTC derivatives market (foreign exchange,

interest rate, equity-linked and commodity contracts), increased by 15 percent, reaching

$127,564 billion. Outstanding credit derivatives, a type of instruments, which did not exist up

to the mid-nineties, increased 35 percent, reaching $1,600 billion. 1

        As derivatives markets expand, however, so do the concerns regarding the possibility that

the use of these instruments might increase the vulnerability of the financial system, rather than

contribute to a better allocation of risks. These concerns were well summarized in a recent IMF

paper: “OTC derivative contracts bind institutions together in an opaque network of credit

exposure, the size and characteristics of which can change rapidly and, moreover, are arguably

not fully understood with a high degree of accuracy even by market participants themselves.

Risk assessments and management of exposures are seriously complicated by a lack of solid

information and risk analyses about the riskiness of both their own positions and those of their

counter-parties. As a result this market is characterized by informational imperfections about

current and potential future credit exposures and market-wide financial conditions.”2 The

collapse of Enron and the view that the company’s use of derivatives was a factor in its

demise—a view by no means uncontroversial, as discussed in ISDA, 2002--only added to these

concerns.

      Discussions of the role of derivatives and their risks, as well as discussions of financial

risks in general, often fail to distinguish between different types of risk. To understand the

breeding conditions for financial crises the prime source of concern is not risk per se, but the

unintended, or unanticipated accumulation of risks by individuals, institutions or governments

including the concealing of risks from stakeholders and overseers of those entities.

      To make this point, the paper analyses specific situations in which significant

unanticipated and unintended financial risks are accumulated. Among the examples concerning

the public sector are the explicit and implicit guarantees that governments extend to banks and

other financial institutions. Such guarantees can be the source of unrecognised accumulation

by governments of unanticipated risks and resulting liabilities in the balance sheet of the public

sector.3

      We shall analyze how the value of such guarantees changes with the change in the value

of the economy’s assets, and what this implies for a government’s financial policy, and thus for

the sustainability of the public debt. This analysis will naturally lead to a set of reflections on

the correct evaluation of a country’s exposure to risk and on the design of prudential rules for

banks and for their shareholders. It will also lead to a discussion of the way financial

instruments, such as swaps, could be used to control the accumulation of risk.

1.2 Transparency and accounting principles

     There are situations where the unintended, or unanticipated accumulation of risks may be

a sheer consequence of inadequate accounting principles that conceal risk itself. An important

example of the limitations of standard accounting principles in identifying and revealing large

risk exposures is offered by the treatment of company pension funds—a topic we take up in the

next section of the paper.

     The demise of Enron has attracted much attention on the lack of transparency of leverage

and risk-taking by firms that move liabilities and risk exposures off their balance sheets by

using complex special-purpose partnerships and derivatives. The same financial engineering

tools that have served well in the efficient transfer of risks across otherwise incompatible

institutional systems, may also be used to disguise large risks and value losses from even the

most diligent of detectors.

     The danger of abuse, and thus a need that corporate managers, board members and other

external overseers understand these instruments, has been rightly emphasized following the

Enron events. Indeed, the boards of many firms are engaging outside risk specialists to search

for what they call “Enronitis” among their subsidiaries and capital structures. However, this

bright-light focus on modern financial technology can blind us to more fundamental issues

surrounding the limitations of traditional accounting. One need look no further than to the

familiar, plain-vanilla, “well-understood” defined-benefit corporate pension plan as an

example of these limitations. Such plans present a far larger in magnitude and more wide-

spread off-balance sheet leverage, than any of the Enron transactions, and without reliance on

complex derivative contracts at all.

2.   Risk and (lack of) transparency in U. S. balance sheets: the economic
     effects of the accounting treatment of defined-benefit pension plans


     A defined-benefit (DB) pension plan represents a secured claim by the plan’s beneficiaries

against the company—typically a guarantee of a pension of up to two-thirds of final salary.

The plan’s assets constitute collateral-like security for promised benefits. From an economic

standpoint, this is equivalent to the company borrowing money to invest in assets. For this

reason a company that does not wish to use the defined-benefit pension plan it sponsors to

increase its asset risk and its leverage should invest 100 percent of the plan’s assets in highly

rated, fixed-income, securities, the duration of which matches the duration of the plan’s

liabilities. This however is not what most companies do.4


2.1 GAAP rules and companies’ exposure to risk via the pension plans they sponsor

     Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP, Statement of

Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, SFAS 87) direct public companies that sponsor a

defined-benefit (DB) pension plan to report, in their balance sheet and income statement, only

the net difference between the company’s pension assets and liabilities, as a corporate asset or

liability. Thus what enters the company’s balance sheet is only the surplus (deficit), which is

the difference between the value of the plan’s assets and its liabilities. For example, a plan with

$65 billion in assets and $64 billion in pension liabilities would report a net amount of surplus

of $1 billion, the same as a plan with $2.5 billion in assets and $1.5 billion in liabilities. The

amount of risk a company accumulates in its balance sheet, via the exposure to its pension

plan, thus is not immediately visible.

     Table 1 shows the balance sheet of a hypothetical company that sponsors a DB pension

plan. The case shown in the table is that of a company whose plan is fully funded—that is, at

current market prices assets and liabilities are matched. This of course would not be the case if,

for instance, interest rates subsequently changed.

                                                               |       - Debt

                               Pension Fund Assets: | DB Plan Liabilities
                                          - Bonds 40 | 100
                                          - Stocks 60 |



      For example, if the pension plan’s assets are partly (for the typical U.S. plan around 60%)

invested in stocks, then a simultaneous fall in both interest rates and stock prices—as might

happen during a recession or in a financial crisis with a flight to quality—would increase the

value of the plan’s liabilities—which rise as interest rates fall—and at the same time reduce the

value of the assets held as collateral for those liabilities. The company’s economic balance

sheet is thus exposed to the volatility of the plan’s assets and liabilities.5

      The accounting treatment of a DB pension plan is thus little different from the treatment

of an off-balance-sheet long-dated swap derivative contract in which the company receives the

total return on an equity portfolio and pays a fixed rate of interest in return applied to a

notional amount equal to pension liabilities.

  We believe that the correct way to compute the value of a plan’s liabilities is to use the yield on a long-
term default-free bond as the discount rate since in this case liabilities are valued using a discount rate that
has the same risk and timing characteristics as the payments the plan will make. This belief, however, is
not undisputed. When stock markets fall, some actuaries hold that the fall in asset prices does not matter
for the solvency of a pension plan, because, as share prices decline, the dividend yield rises and the
expected return on the market increases. Accordingly, as the assets decline, so does the actuarially
measured values of the liabilities—assuming this is computed using the dividend yield, as discount rate.
                                                           6
        Therefore, a standard U.S. corporate pension plan may produce the same leverage and

potentially large risk, as would the use of an equivalent derivative contract, with neither

directly reported on the balance sheet.


2.2 Pension plans, income statements and bonuses

        GAAP rules allowing a company to account for the surplus income from its DB pension

plan as operating income, can obscure any assessment of the company’s performance.

Consider, for example, a good-performing year, that is a year in which the return on the

pension plan’s assets is particularly good and exceeds what would be required to match the

increase in the plan’s liabilities. GAAP rules allow this excess return to be credited as a new

intangible asset, called “prepaid benefit expense”. The opposite adjustment can be made in a

bad year.

        The beneficiaries of excess return are not the plan’s beneficiaries, but the company’s

shareholders who can draw on this intangible asset to top up the company’s net income. For

example, in 2001 Verizon Communications Inc. reported a net income of $389 million, after

taking losses for a variety of telecom investments. The “true” net income, however was a loss

of $1.8 billion: The net income was turned positive by drawing on the excess return on the

assets of the company’s pension plan.

        Milliman USA, a benefits consulting firm, reports that in 2001 the net income declared by

50 large U.S. corporations included $54.4 billion of excess returns from pension funds’ assets.

In fact, these assets lost $35.8 billion.6

        Discretion on the part of companies in their treatment of the returns on pension fund

assets, and thus lack of transparency, extends far beyond. Keeping to the Verizon example, if

    one looks more closely at the company pension plan, one finds that in 2001 the return on the

plan’s assets was negative, and resulted in a reduction in the value of total assets amounting to



6
    www.milliman.com
                                                 7
$3.1 billion. How then could the company claim an excess return and report it on its income

statement?

       GAAP rules are based on the assumption that over time positive and negative returns on a

pension plan’s assets will balance out. A company’s accounting is thus expected to understate

both its plan’s losses in bad years and its plan’s gains in good years. In economic terms

shareholders should benefit from the pension plan’s income with smaller contributions in good

years, and pay more into the plan in bad years. This is not what always happens in accounting

terms. Verizon’s 2001 income statement “assumes” that its pension plan had earned a return of

9.25 percent and it reported income as if that assumption were true. Other companies made

even more bold assumptions: IBM assumed a return of 10 percent, General Electric of 9.5

percent. In Verizon’s case, the income associated with a return of 9.25 percent would have

exceeded the amount required to balance the increase in the liabilities of the company’s

pension plan: thus the origin of the “excess” return.

       The incentives to legally manipulate the return on a company pension plan are enhanced

by the practice of including the income assumed to have been originated from the pension

plan’s assets when computing management’s performance bonuses.

       However, when a plan slips into underfunded status—as might happen when the fall in

asset prices and interest rates do not reverse and eventually must be recognized in the

company’s accounts—a corporation’s equity may take a hit that can disproportionately exceed

the year’s charge to the DB pension plan. This is because SFAS 87 requires a corporation

whose plan falls into unfunded status to take two actions:

   .     charge to the balance sheet a minimum liability equal to the amount underfunded. Thus,

         for a pension plan for which the minimum liability is required, all losses of the plan for

         the year–including the full effect of higher liability measured at the new lower interest

         rates and asset losses in the weak markets—are immediately reflected as reductions in

         shareholder equity;


                                                 8
   .     cancel any asset that had been created in the corporation’s balance sheet as a result of

         the accumulation of excess returns on the pension plan’s assets during the previous

         years. The charge for such cancellation is taken by shareholders’ equity.

       To illustrate, assume a plan was previously overfunded, generating a positive contribution

(negative annual cost of the plan) to the income statement in prior years. These positive

contributions appear as a prepaid pension cost, an asset item on the company’s balance sheet.

Now assume that the plan is no longer overfunded due to investment losses and/or an increase

in obligations. The consequence of the minimum liability calculation is that:

   .     the prepaid pension cost (an asset) must be eliminated, and

   .     an accrued pension cost (a liability) equal to the amount of underfunding must be

         carried on the balance sheet.

       The combined effect of these changes can be a significant adjustment to shareholder

equity as illustrated in Table 2. Note that in this example, the company’s equity is reduced not

merely by the $1,000,000,000 underfunding, but by the reversal of the entire previously

accumulated prepaid pension cost as well.

2.3 The transfer of risks onto the government

     GAAP accounting principles thus conceal on a year-on-year basis a company’s true

exposure to market volatility, which should include the substantial exposure acquired through

the assets and liabilities of its pension plan.

     Full disclosure, on corporate balance sheets, of the composition of a pension plan’s assets

(or, in the absence of it, continuous matching of the mark-to-market value of the plan’s assets

with that of its liabilities) would reveal the true degree of the company’s leverage and risk.

This is not something that is being considered in current proposals for an overhaul of GAAP

rules.7

     How widespread is the problem? For many of the largest 50 U.S. companies (see Table 3)

DB plans account for the bulk of the company’s pension plan assets. The remaining pension

assets are accounted for by defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k). These assets

collectively can be a multiple of the company’s market capitalization. In December 2001 the

pension assets of General Motors, the largest corporate pension plan in the United States with

over $73 billion in defined-benefit plan assets, were 2.7 times the company’s stock market

value. As inspection of Table 2 reveals, GM is certainly not alone in this position among U.S.

corporations. Corporate pension assets in total represent a significant fraction of the overall

market value of U.S. corporate equity, over one-fourth. Sixty percent, on average, of the assets

of defined-benefit plans are invested in common stocks: the fraction has increased from about

50 percent in the 1980’s.8

     As long as the company is solvent, the risks and rewards of allocating the plan’s assets to

equities are borne by shareholders, since the fund’s beneficiaries enjoy a defined benefit with

no upside. However, if the company were to go into bankruptcy, the risks are transferred in

part to the beneficiaries, and in part to the federal government through the Pension Benefit

  GM announced In January 2003 that its pension fund assets were unfunded by $19.3 bn, compared with
$9.1 bn a year earlier (Financial Times, January 10, 2003, page 21.)

Guarantee Corporation (PBGC), the government institution offering partial guarantee to the

beneficiaries of the companies’ DB plans. Therefore, when a company invests the assets of its

pension plan in common stock it is de-facto raising its leverage, and transferring, at least in

part, the risk onto the plan’s beneficiaries and onto the government.

        Negative shocks to the corporate sector can thus be transferred, through company pension

funds to the government. An example is shown in Table 4. We assume that the pension plan (a

DB plan with government guarantee) is invested 50% in equity. A negative shock to the

corporate sector reduces the value of its assets by 40 percent, causing a 30 percent fall in

equity. The fraction of the pension plan’s assets invested in equity also falls by 30 percent. In a

DB plan the liabilities are unaffected by the shock. Therefore the government’s financial

exposure to the plan increases by a corresponding amount.

        The effects of the transfer of risk onto the government are apparent in the balance sheet of

the PBGC for the year ended on September 30, 2002.9 During this period the operating loss of

the corporation amounted to $3.64 billion, an $11.37 billion net turnaround from a $7.73

billion surplus a year earlier, the largest in the federal pension insurer's 28-year history. Of

these losses, by far the largest fraction, $9.31 billion, is accounted for by the increase in

“Claims for actual and probable pension plan terminations”, that is for the pension obligations

transferred to the PBGC by company plans in default, plus the increase in the value of the

guarantees extended. This loss arises because, under GAAP, the PBGC recognizes as a loss

both actual and probable pension plan terminations. During fiscal year 2002, $5.91 billion of

the $9.31 billion in losses were from "probables." Since the close of the 2002 fiscal year, the

agency has assumed full responsibility for the pension plans of two companies-National Steel

and Bethlehem Steel-that together accounted for $5.16 billion of the losses estimated as

“probable” on September 30. Another key factor was the decline in interest rates, which

increased the program's liabilities by $1.65 billion.

3.    Balance sheets and financial guarantees10

      The pension-plan example shows how the government can become exposed to shocks that

originate in the private sector. Financial guarantees can transfer risk across different sectors in

the economy and also produce negative feedback loops that can trigger severe crises. In this

section we develop this theme further, showing how the implicit guarantees governments

extend to banks and other financial institutions result in the accumulation, often unconscious

from the viewpoint of the government, of unanticipated risks in the balance sheet of the public

sector.


3.1 Loans and guarantees

      Any time a bank makes a loan, an implicit guarantee of that loan is involved. To see this,

consider the following identity, which holds in both a functional and a valuation sense:




                        Risky Loan + Loan Guarantee ≡ Default-free Loan


this can also be re-written as:


                        Risky Loan ≡ Default-free Loan – Loan Guarantee



      Lending by a bank thus consists of two functionally distinct activities: pure default-free

lending and the bearing of default risk by the lender11. This equivalence of course applies more

generally to other forms of debt obligations, not only to bank loans. Whenever a lender makes

a loan to anyone other than a default-free government, he is implicitly also selling a guarantee.


10
  This section draws heavily on Merton and Bodie (1992)
11
  This identity strictly applies only if (a) the guarantee itself is default-free, and (b) it covers the entire
loan. That is, the guarantor will not default on this obligation, and his obligation is to fully make up for any
loss on promised payments. Some guarantees have deductibles, or require co-insurance with the debt
holder. Tax treatments and other regulatory factors could also affect the identity. While such factors are
important in analyzing specific situations, they are not essential in understanding the fundamental
functional activity of lending as discussed in the text.


                                                     14
     To see this point more clearly, it will perhaps be helpful to think of the lending activity as

taking place in two steps:

       i.   purchasing a guarantee, and
      ii.   taking up of a loan


     Suppose that the guarantor and the lender are two distinct entities. In the first step, the

borrower buys a guarantee from the guarantor for, say, $10. In the second step, the borrower

takes this guarantee to the lender and borrows $100 at a default-free interest rate of, say, 10%

per year. The borrower winds up receiving a net amount of ($100 - $10 =) $90 in return for a

promise to pay back $110 in a year.

     Often, of course, the lender and the guarantor are the same entity – for example, a

commercial bank – and the borrower simply receives the net $90 from the bank in return for a

promise to repay $110 in a year. The interest rate on the loan is then stated as 22.22%, i.e.,

($110 - $90)/$90. This promised rate reflects both the risk-free interest rate and the charge for

the guarantee. To see that the two are separable activities, note that the holder of the risky debt

could buy a third-party guarantee for $10, as shown in Table 5. The holder would then be

making a total investment of $90 + $10 = $100 and would receive a sure payment of $110.




                                                   Table 5

                             Assets                                Liabilities

                                                      15
     The purchase of any real-world loan is thus functionally equivalent to the purchase of a

pure default-free loan and the simultaneous issue of a guarantee on that loan. In effect, the

creditor simultaneously pays for the default-free loan and receives a “rebate” for the guarantee

of that loan. The magnitude of the value of the guarantee relative to the value of the default-

free loan component varies considerably. A high-grade bond (rated AAA) is an almost default-

free loan with a very small guarantee component. A below-investment-grade or “junk” bond,

on the other hand, typically has a large guarantee component.



3.2 Transferring risk onto the government

     The liabilities that banks issue to fund their lending are often guaranteed by the

government--typically through deposit-insurance schemes. Here we analyse the effects of these

guarantees for the public sector. In particular, and more importantly, we wish to understand

how does the risk exposure of the government change as the value of the banks’ assets

changes?

     Table 6 shows the balance sheets for a corporation, for a bank that holds its debt, and for

the government. The bank itself is financed in part with debt, in part with equity: the value of

the debt, if its promised payments were risk-free, is $90. In panel A) there is no guarantee,

therefore the debt is risky: its market value is $85, lower than its default-free value of 90. This

is because, as in the example discussed above, it reflects the prospect of a lower-than-promised

payment in the event of default. In panel A) the government is not involved in guaranteeing the

bank: its balance sheet is balanced with assets and liabilities both equal to A.

     Next we examine, in panel B), what happens following a shock which reduces the capital

of the corporation, and thus also the market value of the bank’s asset. The loss is absorbed in

part by bondholders and in part by the bank’s shareholders—say a third by the former, and

two-thirds by shareholders. The market value of the debt falls to $82 = $85 - $3; the bank’s

equity to $8 = $15 - $7. The government’s balance sheet is again unaffected.

                                                16
     Now let us introduce a government guarantee that makes the bank’s debt risk-free. This is

shown in panel C). Before the shock, when the capital of the corporation is worth $200, and the

bank’s assets are worth $100, the value of the guarantee is $5, exactly the amount of the

default discount on the non-guaranteed debt. Since the debt is fully guaranteed by the

government, the value of shareholders’ equity does not change. In the balance sheet of the

bank the guarantee is an “off-balance-sheet” item (this is why we write it “below the line”), but

its value is fully reflected in the equity of the shareholders. Finally, the guarantee shows up in

the government’s balance sheet as an additional liability: here too we write it below the line, to

reflect that such guarantees are seldom accounted for in the government’s books.12

     The guarantee protects the debt from the effects of the shock to the corporation’s balance

sheet. This is shown in panel D). Equity falls to $8, as in the absence of the guarantee, while

the market value of the debt does not move from its risk-free value, $90. This of course is

possible because the value of the government’s guarantee has risen from $5 to $8, an increase

that matches the loss that the debt would have incurred absent the guarantee. The government’s

balance sheet now reflects the greater value of its guarantee to the banks.

     The government’s exposure to the guarantee changes, as the value of the underlying

variables change. This is because the government guarantee protects the debt from the effects

of any shock to the corporation’s balance sheet. In the last panel of Table 6, panel E), we

examine by how much would the value of the guarantee rise, following a further shock to the

capital of the corporation, one that reduces it to $120, a further loss of $40.

     The decline in the value of corporate assets increases the prospect of a default and a

lower-than-promised payment to the bank: this reduces the value of the corporation’s debt to,

say, $75. The value of the corporation’s equity thus falls to $45. Now consider the balance

sheet of the bank. Absent the guarantee, the market value of the bank’s debt would have fallen,

  In the United States, the Office of Management and Budget is supposed to estimate the value of all
guarantees issued by the government.
                                                   17
say, to $73 and the bank’s equity to $2. The government’s guarantee protects the value of its

liabilities: it thus amounts to $17.

     In our examples, the relative proportions in which a fall in the value of the bank’s assets is

borne by debt and equity--or by equity and the government guarantee-- were simply given

exogenously. Understanding the underlying structure and variables that determine the increase

in the value of the guarantee, as the capital of the corporation falls, will assist our

understanding of how governments, by guaranteeing the bank’s debt, can accumulate

unanticipated risks--and why even recognizing the liability incurred at a given point in time on

a marked-to-market basis is not enough to fully capture the government’s changing risk

exposure.

3.3 Using option theory to measure the exposure to risk

     Guarantees, like options, are contingent liabilities for their issuers, with required future

payoffs contingent on the values of other assets. Indeed, the equivalence between a risk-free

loan and the combination of a risky loan plus a guarantee suggests the analogy between a loan

guarantee and a put option on that loan. The guarantee component of a risky loan is analogous

to a put option that is a binding commitment to buy the loan for Vo, the promised value of the

loan, in case the borrower, when the loan contract expires, is unable to repay—fully or

partially.13

In the previous example the position of the holders of the corporation’s debt is analogous to a

default-free debt combined with a short position in a put option on corporate assets. The

economic balance sheet of the bank includes assets consisting of loans to the corporation,

which can be decomposed into default-free debt as an asset and the put option as a liability.

The bank also holds, among its assets, a government financial guarantee. The government, as

the issuer of that guarantee, has it as a liability on its economic balance sheet.

     The three economic balance sheets can be used to demonstrate the interdependence

among sectors. One is “long” on a certain implicit option; another is “short” on the same

implicit option. These implicit options thus create important risk inter-linkages among different

sectors.

     The analogy between guarantees and options suggests a simple way to measure the

exposure to risk arising from a guarantee. For instance, if a government guarantees the

liabilities of the banking system, how does its exposure change, as the value of corporate assets

changes? Option theory suggests a number of ways to measure exposure to risk. The most

common one, “delta”, is the change in the value of an option as the value of the underlying

asset changes. “Delta” is thus an appropriate measure of an institution’s exposure to risk. In

our example “delta” could be used to measure to what extent the government’s exposure to its




                                                 20
guarantee changes, as the value of corporate assets, and thus of the assets of the banking

system, change.14

      To construct a measure of exposure to risk using option price theory, we start, in Figure 1,

showing two relations. The piecewise linear line is the payoff, at the maturity date, for the

holder of a guarantee (the option), as a function of the mark-to-market price of the underlying

asset--the bank’s loan or the capital of the corporation in the particular case analyzed in the

previous section. The payoff is positive for V < Vo, zero for V ≥ Vo. The other relation plotted

in Figure 1 displays the value of the guarantee (the option), as a function of the mark-to-

market price of the underlying asset. This is inversely and non-linearly related to the price of

the underlying stock.15

      Figure 2 shows the government’s exposure to risk for any given value of the bank’s

assets. The curve plotted in this figure is (the absolute value of) the tangent slope of the curve

shown in Figure 2--that is of the value of the guarantee, for a date prior to the maturity of the

asset. This curve (the “delta”) measures by how much the value of the guarantee changes as the

value of the banks’ assets change. It shows that the government’s exposure, acquired through

the guarantee, for certain ranges of values increases more than proportionately as the market

value of the bank’s assets falls.

      The reference to the activities of investors is suggestive of how the government’s

exposure changes as asset prices fluctuate. The additional liability transferred on the

government’s balance sheet by a 10 percent shock to the capital of firms is larger the lower is


13
   If the loan can default before maturity, the guarantee corresponds to an American option, where the
exercise date is not predetermined. See Merton (1974, 1977).
14
   “Delta” is sometimes also called the “hedge ratio”. This is with reference to the activities of investors
who “hedge” their position in put options by buying shares in the underlying stock. Because the price of
the option rises as the value of the underlying asset falls, an investor who owns one put option, and wishes
to hedge, must buy a number of shares that is larger the lower is the price of the stock. The “hedge ratio”
increases as the value of the underlying asset falls. See e.g. Hull (2000), pp. 310-319.
15
   The figure is created using the option formulas developed in Black-Scholes (1973) and in Merton (1973)
with the following parameter values:
            - risk free rate = .04               - volatility = .50
            - time to maturity = 1 year          - strike price = 105
                                                    21
that capital to start with. Recognizing this point about the non-linearity in the transmission of

risk exposures is essential to prevent the accumulation of unanticipated risks on the

government’s balance sheet.

3.4 The non-linear transmission of risk from corporate balance sheets to the government

     The framework described helps explain how volatility can be transferred in a non-linear

way from the corporate and banking sectors onto the government. In the example risk is

transferred through the guarantee. Following a negative shock to the corporate sector (for

instance following a devaluation in the presence of unhedged foreign corporate debt), the value

of corporate assets decline, and the value of the government guarantee to the banks increases in

a non-linear way. This is also shown in Figures 3 and 4.

3.5 Financial guarantees and negative feedback loops

     Financial guarantees can produce negative feedback loops that can trigger severe crises.

For instance, rating agencies may react to the information that the value of a government’s

guarantees has increased by downgrading its sovereign bonds. The downgrade will raise the

cost of servicing the public debt and lower the present discounted vale of future budget

surpluses. This will lower the value of the government’s assets precisely when the value of its

liabilities has increased.




4. Sovereign spreads, macroeconomic volatility and debt maturity16

     Countries that issue large amounts of sovereign debt, especially, but not only, in emerging

economies, often can only do so by issuing financial instruments with a very short duration. In

Brazil, for instance, the duration of two thirds of the entire public debt is currently shorter than

12 months. Thus, when the spreads such sovereigns must pay exceed a certain threshold level,

the debt becomes unsustainable. We can think of this threshold level as the one beyond which

the country can no longer continue to service its debt without default, or restructuring, or

“unrealistically large” adjustments in fiscal variables or in the balance of payments.

     Applying options’ theory to the analysis of spreads offers a new way to evaluate the risk

of default. As illustrated in Box 4.1, spreads depend on the average maturity of the debt, on the

level of the risk-free interest rate, on the country’s leverage and on the volatility of its assets.

These include, if the debt is denominated in foreign currency, the reserves of the central bank

plus the (foreign currency value) of the government’s fiscal assets, that is the present value of

residual fiscal surpluses and other assets.

     Consider, as an example, the effect of a shock that both lowers the value of a country’s

assets and raises their volatility. This could happen, for instance, following a shock that lowers




                                                25
the relative price of a commodity in which a country specialises, and increases its volatility.17

As shown in Figure 5, the combination of a lower value of domestic assets and a higher

volatility can produce a very large increase in spreads, due to the non-linearity in the relation

between spreads and asset values.

      The relations shown in Figure 5 differ from the arithmetic commonly used to evaluate

debt sustainability in two respects:

     1. the standard sustainability calculation considers the value of a country’s assets—and

        how this changes, for instance following a devaluation--but fails to realize that changes

        in volatility also shifts default probabilities, and both affect bond spreads for a given

        value of a country’s assets;

     2. the standard computations also fail to realize that the relation between spreads and

        underlying supporting asset values is non-linear and convex.18 In contrast, the options-

        based model provides a structural specification of the non-linear relation between the

        value of the guarantee and the asset values and their return volatilities.

   The conceptual framework of the section was first presented in Dale Gray (2001,2002) and in Gray,
Merton and Bodie (2002).

in the relative price of copper worsened the country’s terms of trade.

     The relation between volatility and sovereign spreads is perhaps suggested in the April

2002 World Economic Outlook (IMF 2002, p. 66). The WEO reports various measures of

macroeconomic volatility: the standard deviation of GDP, of government revenues and

spending, of the terms of trade and the real exchange rate for different groups of countries.

Along with these data it shows the frequency of debt-related events, defined as the number of

defaults or rescheduling per country group in each period. The data shown in the WEO are

reproduced in Table 7. During times of relatively high macroeconomic volatility the frequency

of debt events increases. Advanced countries show, on average, less volatility and no defaults.

When volatility in advanced countries increased, as in the 1970s’ and ‘80s, compared with the

1990’s, it had little effect on the number of defaults because advanced countries start from such




                                                                 27
a high level of assets relative to their debt—which is consistent with the non-linear relation

between sovereign assets and spreads shown in Figure 5.

     For the purpose of our discussion here, consider a simple model (we outline such a model

in Box 4.2) in which future flows of payments to a country’s assets are proportional to GDP. If

we posit further that flows to the assets are proportional to GDP, and expected future GDP is

proportional to current GDP, then expected future cash flows would be proportional to current

GDP. The volatility of a country’s assets will thus be proportional to the volatility of GDP, and

spreads will on average be higher in countries in which GDP volatility is higher. The data

shown by the WEO IMF hint at this relation, but fail to recognize the effect of the non-linearity

in the relation between spreads and volatility.

the average duration of the debt, for a given level of asset volatility. In Figure 6, as the average

duration of the debt falls from 1 year to 6 and to 3 months, spreads are higher for any given

Box 4.1:               Using option theory to compute sovereign spreads

        Consider a firm with risky assets V, which are financed by equity, S, and zero-coupon

debt with face value F, maturing at T. Debt is risky: the risk is related to the probability that at


                                                    30
time T the value of the firm will be smaller than F and the expected recovery amount in the

event of default. Thus, at time 0, the value of the firm’s debt, B0 < Fe − rT , i.e. the promised

yield to maturity on the debt is higher than the risk-free rate r. This defines the yield spread

that compensates bondholders for the default risk they bear.

      To determine the value of this spread we shall consider, as above, the identity, in value,

between the risk-free loan and the combination of a risky loan plus a guarantee. By purchasing

a put option on V, with strike price F, the lenders could completely eliminate the default risk

and convert the risky corporate loan into a risk-free loan with face value F. If the risk-free rate

is r, then:




                                              B0 + P0 = Fe− rT



The Black-Scholes model (assuming its assumptions are satisfied) gives us the value of this

(put) option:19




                                    P0 = − N ( − d 1 )V0 + Fe − rt N ( − d 2 )


where N(.) denotes the cumulative standard normal distribution, and


                                        V                    1

where σ is the standard deviation of the return on the firm’s assets. As Crouhy et al. (2001,p.

364) show, the formula has intuitive interpretation in the special case when there are no risk

premiums on any asset--a so-called “risk-neutral” equilibrium world.20

Re-writing the value of P0, as:


                                         N (−d1 )                
                                   P0 = −           V0 + Fe − rT  N (− d 2 )
                                         N (− d 2 )              



we observe that the premium on the put option can be decomposed into two terms:

     .     the discounted expected recovery value of the loan, conditional on VT ≤ F . This is the

           absolute value of the first term in parenthesis;

     .     the current value of a risk-free bond paying F at time T. This is the second term in

           parenthesis.

         Hence the sum of the two terms inside the brackets yields the (risk-neutral) expected

shortfall, in present value terms, conditional on the firm being bankrupt at time T. The final

factor is the (risk-neutral) probability of default, N(-d2). The product of the default probability

times the expected shortfall determines the premium for insurance against default.

         The same expressions can be used to compute the default spread, that is, the difference

between the yield to maturity on the risky loan, and the risk-free rate. This is:

                                                              V0
                                    − 1 / T ln( N (d 2 ) +          ) N ( − d1 )
                                                             Fe −rT

20
   A key characteristic of the option-pricing methodology for pricing risky debt that makes it attractive to
practitioners is that it does not require estimates of the expected returns on any assets. Indeed, as a
computational device, one can value options or risky debt “as if” there were no risk premiums. See Cox
and Ross (1976). Hence, the jargon term “risk-neutral” valuation is used to describe this pricing approach.
Since the actual expected return of the firm’s underlying assets is never used in the pricing formula, the
actual probability of default and the actual expected recovery rate are not deducible from bond prices or
the formula. Only “risk-neutral” probabilities can be so deduced. If the assets of the firm have a positive
risk-premium and thus an expected return greater than the risk-free rate, then the “risk-neutral” probability
of default will give a biased-high estimate of the actual probability of default.

     The spread is a function of the firm’s leverage ratio                        , of the volatility of the
                                                                           V0

underlying assets, and of the maturity of the debt T. Note that, as volatility and leverage rise,

the spread increases in a non-linear way—exactly as in the case of the guarantees discussed in

the previous section.




Box 4.2:      A fall in output can lead to a reduction in the value of a country’s sovereign

assets.

     The ability to tax is typically a government’s most valuable asset.21 Thus the sovereign

assets of a country include, along with physical assets, the present discounted value of future

budget surpluses (i.e. the governments’ taxing capability minus those government expenditures

that will not be cut to accommodate foreign debt distress). We can therefore express the net

sovereign assets of a country as:


                                                          ∞

                                                          0


where A0 represents the value, at time 0, of the physical assets controlled by the government

and B0 the stock of public debt.    bs (t ) = τ t − g t   is the primary budget surplus, that is tax revenue

minus essential government expenditure, net of interest payments, at time t, measured in constant

dollars as of time 0, E0 is the expectation operator, conditional on information at time 0 and k is

the real risk-adjusted discount rate, assumed to remain constant over time.              bs(t )   is assumed

proportional to the level of the country’s output at time t:   bs (t ) = a. y (t ) . If we further assume that

shocks to GDP are persistent, that is   dy = α ydt + σ ydz , the value of a country’s sovereign

example in the Middle East.

net      assets   will    be     linearly   related    to   its   current    level    of   output,

 A0 + ay ( 0 ) / ( k − α ) − B0 .

       The above equation assumes that the real cost of debt remains constant over time.

Sovereign spreads, however, as discussed above, increase (non-linearly) when the value of

sovereign assets falls. Thus the increase in sovereign spreads induced by a fall in output will be

amplified, because lower output, for a given spread, reduces net sovereign assets, and lower net

assets raise spreads and thus the cost of debt, which in turn reduces net sovereign assets. This

is another instance of the negative feedback loops discussed in section 3.5.




5.     Observations for the correct evaluation of a country’s exposure to risk and for the
       design of prudential rules for financial institutions and their shareholders

       As discussed at length in Gray, Merton, and Bodie (2002), explicit recognition of the

chain of financial guarantees offers a rich framework for analyzing the risk exposure of a

country. The main benefit comes from the ability to correctly assess dynamically the transfer

of risk across sectors. Here are a few examples:

.     distress in the corporate sector can be transmitted to the financial sector, e.g. following a

      change in commodity prices;

.     distress in the financial sector can be transmitted to the government, e.g. through the

      government guarantee of bank deposits;

.     sovereign distress or default can be transmitted to the private sector, e.g. through the

      increase in spreads. The same happens following a devaluation, which can raise firms’

      leverage and unbalance the balance sheets of financial institutions to the extent that their

      liabilities are denominated in a foreign currency.




                                                  34
     These issues of risk transmission across sectors were a focus of attention following the

financial crises of the late 1990’s, whose characteristics did not fit the pattern of the traditional

balance-of-payments crises of the previous decade. In this section we try our hand at relating

our work to the recent literature on financial crises. The analysis of financial guarantees offers

a rich tool for evaluating the extent of a country’s exposure to risk and how this changes over

time. The importance of this issue is recognized in the traditional literature, but the analogy

with the analysis of financial guarantees has not been made. This analogy provides a

straightforward tool for analyzing how risk exposure builds up through the economy and

eventually cumulates in the government’s exposure.

     We shall then draw, from the analysis of financial guarantees, some implications for risk

monitoring. We shall do this having in mind offering some guidelines for the design of

prudential rules for financial institutions and their shareholders.

     In the next section we analyze how risk exposures can be controlled, hedged and

transferred through the use of derivatives, swap contracts, and other contractual agreements.




5.1 Balance sheets and financial crises

     Traditionally, international financial crises were characterized as predominantly current-

account crises. A country would run a large budget deficit, finance it by printing money, with

the inflation tax. The currency would, more often than not, be fixed to the dollar—often

because the resulting appreciation of the real exchange rate raises real wages. Eventually the

trade deficit produced by the overvalued real exchange rate could no longer be financed:

reserves dried up, and so did the supply of international loans. What followed were devaluation

and a sharp cut in real wages, which in turn helped a recovery of economic activity.

     More recent crises, starting with Mexico in 1994-95, and then Asia and Russia in 1997-98

are fundamentally different in that balance-sheet issues are central to the descriptions and

almost surely to the propagation of the crisis, as vividly described in Dornbusch (1998):

                                                 35
     ”In Mexico’s massive earthquake, some years back, many of the splendid new buildings
collapsed burying and killing a large number of people in the debris. Without the earthquake
they surely would not have crashed, in fact they had graced the skyline for years, monuments
to their proud owners and builders. But examination revealed that the concrete had far too
much sand and too little of the real stuff. Not surprisingly, under stress they went. That surely
was not an accident—the building codes were there, and the inspectors stood by collecting the
payoffs for overlooking unsound construction. Just the same has been happening in cross
border finance. Emerging market balance sheets stand up in fair weather but under stress they
collapse. Vulnerability is the key word; risk is another way of looking at it.”

     The observation that the origin of many international financial crises lies in the

accumulation of risk in balance sheets is central to the recent macroeconomic literature on such

crises (for recent statements see Calvo, 2002 and Jeanne and Zettelmeyer, 2002).

Understanding the effects of risk accumulation in balance sheets is important because it

explains why, in crises of this type, monetary and fiscal policies tend to become ineffective.

Banks with weak balance sheets do not react to an increase in central bank money by raising

the supply of loans; and if government with a weak balance sheet attempts a fiscal expansion,

spreads on government debt issues will go up, which often translate into higher spreads on

private-sector borrowing as well.

     These observations also underscore Dornbusch’s recommendation that: “the right answer

to crisis avoidance is controlling risk. The appropriate conceptual framework is value at risk

(VAR)—a model-driven estimate of the maximum risk for a particular balance sheet situation

over a specified horizon. There are surely genuine modelling issues with the specifics of VAR

as has been widely discussed with respect to bank risk models used for meeting BIS

requirements (cf. Crouhy et al, 2001). But just as surely there is no issue whatsoever in

recognizing that this general approach is the right one. If authorities everywhere enforced a

culture of risk-oriented evaluation of balance sheets, extreme situations such as those of Asia

in 1997 would disappear or, at the least, become a rare species.




                                               36
      This literature on international financial crises22 recognizes that the implicit guarantees

governments extend to banks and, through them, to firms create the potential for greatly

weakening government balance sheets. The attention, however, has mostly focused on the

reasons why such guarantees exist, rather on the correct measurement of their cost and

changing risk exposures. One view (e.g. Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo, 2001), emphasizes

government bailouts, which encourage banks to willingly expose themselves to exchange rate

risk: it is the government guarantee that makes it optimal for banks to have an unhedged

currency mismatch between their assets and their liabilities, and thus transfer the exchange rate

risk onto the government. Of course, the strength of that incentive is affected by whether

current shareholders will lose their ownership in the event of failure or retain it. Subtler is the

view exposed by Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2000) who ask why private borrowers

underinsure against country shocks and exchange rate depreciation by contracting foreign-

currency denominated debt. The answer they provide is that under-insurance is a feature of

underdeveloped financial markets: if financial markets are well developed, firms have no

incentive to take up excessive foreign-currency denominated debt.23

      The contribution of our paper is in spirit responsive to the Dornbusch recommendation, in

that it provides a framework for correctly evaluating the extent of a country’s exposure to risk

and the changes in that exposure over time.



5.2 Government exposure to the financial system: computing a country’s value-at-risk

      A country’s exposure to risk, at any given point in time, results from the risk exposure of

each sector in the economy and from the transmission of risk across sectors through financial

guarantees. Understanding how a sector’s exposure changes when events hit a different sector,

and realizing that exposure to risk changes non-linearly, is the main benefit of the financial

                                                    37
guarantees approach. The approach suggests a new way of thinking at macro risk: describe the

economy as a set of interconnected portfolios of assets, liabilities and contingent claims and

ask how the values of these portfolios react to external shocks (shocks to fundamentals).

     To correctly appreciate the extent of a government’s exposure to its financial system,

three steps are involved:

     a) the traded and non-traded assets of financial institutions, banks in particular, should be

         systematically marked to market: this is the first step to correctly evaluate the

         dimension of any existing guarantee;

     b) the guarantees extended to financial institutions, whether explicit or implicit, should

         be openly recognized in the government’s balance sheet. Rather than precise rules for

         governments to consider adopting, we frame a general orientation towards helping

         markets appreciate the extent of the guarantees.

     c) a government’s exposure to its domestic financial institutions—incurred through the

         outstanding guarantees to these institutions—explicit or implicit—increases more than

         proportionately with changes in the weakness of the balance sheet of these

         institutions. The additional liability transferred on the government’s balance sheet by

         a 10 percent shock to the capital of firms is larger the lower is that capital to start

         with. If the balance sheets of corporations and financial institutions are weak when the

         economy is weak—as it is generally the case—then it is precisely when tax revenue is

         low, and the cost of debt service high because sovereign risk has increased, that the

         value of the guarantees will be particularly high. This observation offers a powerful

         argument for diversification of the government exposure to local shocks, for instance

         by swapping tax revenue—an issue we take up in next section of the paper.

As noted in Merton (2002, p.66-67):
“A prospective application of modern financial technology by government is the measurement
and management of country risk….

                                                38
      A non-traditional approach to address the performance issue and its implication for
evaluating policy is to apply the technology of a well-studied problem in risk and performance
measurement for investment management and financial firms. This is the problem of
configuring all the decomposition and reintegration of risk-factor exposures that must be
determined within a financial institution before the aggregate risk measures such as value-at-
risk (VAR) can be applied. I believe that this technology, if properly adapted, can be used to
measure country risk exposures
     . this is structurally the same problem faced in the risk measurement of non-traded assets
and liabilities in financial institutions. In short, it is like the challenges of extending the VAR
and stress-testing concepts to include the domain of non-traded assets and liabilities. But as
with the application to financial institutions, I see this as a tough engineering problem, not one
of new science … we know how to approach it in principle and what we need to model, but
actually doing it is the challenge.
     As with conventional private-sector applications, the country risk exposures give us
important information about the dynamics of future changes that cannot be inferred from the
standard “country” accounting statements, either the country balance sheet or the country
income or flow-of-funds statement.
    As we discover with more conventional applications of risk management systems, once we
can measure the risk exposures we have, it is difficult to resist exploring whether we could
improve economic efficiency and risk sharing by changing those exposures.
    With the developed countries, Japan and EMU Europe in particular, and the emerging
ones both working on major changes in their financial systems, this may be an especially
opportune time to explore country risk management.”


     Gray (2001 and 2002) has implemented this framework to build multi-sector economic-

value balance sheets of countries. Such balance sheets explicitly compute to what extent the

values of financial guarantees change as assets and liabilities change and thereby provide ways

to capture changing risk exposures as well as changing values (See also Gray, Merton and

Bodie, 2002). This approach goes well beyond the simple recognition, pointed out in Blejer

and Shumacher (2000), that the correct measure of a central bank’s exposure to risk should

take into account the option value of any foreign-exchange derivative contracts the bank might

have entered into.

     For instance, using data for Thailand at the end of 1996, Gray (2001) has estimated the

value of the Thai government’s exposure through its implicit financial guarantees. At 33 Baht

per 1 U.S. dollar (the December 1996 exchange rate was 25.6 Baht per dollar) the government

exposure was short a put option whose value was less than 10 percent of GDP, provided equity

prices remained unchanged and liquidity, measured by the willingness of lenders to roll-over or

                                                39
refinance Thai USD loans, also remained unchanged. If equity prices declined 50 percent and

liquidity were reduced, devaluation beyond 33 Baht per dollar would have raised the value of

the implicit put option to 30-50 percent of GDP—a clear implication of the power of the non-

linearity in option values. By December 1997 in the crisis, the exchange rate reached 47 Baht

per dollar and equities had lost 60 percent of their pre-crisis value.



5.3 The valuation of banks’ assets


     Bank loans should be valued on a systematic and ongoing basis taking into account the

borrowers’ ability to repay. There are several appropriate ways to do this, depending on

circumstances. If the borrower issues debt, and the bonds are liquid, then use those marked-to-

market prices to value the loans. If its credit rating is known and frequently updated, so-called

matrix pricing based on rating spreads can be applied. Financial market prices such as the

underlying firms’ equity prices can also be used to provide up-to-date estimates of the value

and risk sensitivities of the loans using models like the one developed in Merton (1974): For

empirical tests of the model, see Kealhofer (2003) and for its real-world applications, see

www.moodyskmv.com and http://www.creditgrades.com. The fact that these alternative

methods often produce different valuations should not be a reason for inaction.

     Standard accounting rules for marking down book values are subject to considerable

management discretion. It is interesting to note that the valuation method based on historical

cost commonly used is the least effective precisely at times when investors and overseers need

the assurance of realistic and current valuations. When uncertainty grows, investors want a

system that reflects asset values in the changed market environment, not book-value valuation,

which rarely produces a change in price.

     Even if the loans are appropriately marked to market, there is an issue on how to measure

the future risk exposure. The amount of money that one can reasonably expect to lose as a


                                                 40
                                                                                        24
result of a default over a given period is a bank’s “expected risk exposure”.                The expected

loss will depend on (i) the amount exposed to credit risk; (ii) the probability of counter-party

defaulting, (iii) the recovery rate. The problem of measuring potential credit losses lies in

finding the best way of estimating these variables. With respect to (ii) and (iii) institutions

should develop techniques to compute the default rate path and the recovery rate path, and

distributions around these paths estimated by examining those distributions at specific points in

time in the future. As for the recovery rate one could use the recovery rate distribution as

derived from surveys of recovery rates of senior corporate bonds that have defaulted. This

analysis produces estimates of future recovery rate distributions that vary as a function of time.

Just like default rate distributions they do not typically follow a normal probability density

function. Finally, the distribution estimates of (i) – (iii) are to be combined to produce an

overall assessment of the expected risk exposure.25

       As for derivative instruments, starting with 2001-Q1 the FASB (Financial Accounting

Standards Board) requires most U.S. companies to adopt rule FAS 133 “Accounting for

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”. This means that derivatives or hedged

positions, even those embedded in contracts, should be reported on the balance sheet using

their fair value (marked-to-market). Prior to this ruling derivative financial instruments were

not recorded on the balance sheet.26


24
   See e.g. Crouhy et al. (2001). p. 551
25
   A step in this direction is the CreditRisk + model developed by Credit Suisse Financial Products and
described in Credit Suisse (1997). Valuation of risky debt does not necessarily require estimates of those
factors or a discount rate, as in Merton (1974).

5.4 Can equity and and/or subordinated debt substitute for risk monitoring?


     The previous analysis suggests that careful monitoring of all the items on and off the

balance sheet is essential for proper risk management. How strong are the off-balance sheet

guarantees in the face of an unexpected fall in the correctly computed value of the bank’s

assets? Can equity be a substitute for risk monitoring? Shareholders may be reluctant to

commit large quantities of equity capital because of the agency costs related to this strategy

and because of its unfavourable taxation. Subordinated debt, provided it is really junior to the

depositors’ claims, could be preferable to large equity commitments. However, its

subordinated nature can be more apparent than real. In the United States, its economic

subordination need not be followed strictly by courts within the context of Chapter 11

proceedings. Therefore, neither equity capital nor subordinated debt is a substitute for careful

risk monitoring of assets’ values. Just as important is the marking to market of the liabilities

and more specifically the monitoring of the market prices of the bank’s equity and

subordinated debt, reflecting in effect the value of the collateral guarantee by the

shareholders.27



5.5 Hedging macro risks


     The approach to risk management discussed above has implications for the banking

industry in emerging markets in which there is a high degree of macro risk and correlation

amongst all assets’ values. In this context, a common sense rule of asset diversification would

suggest that an emerging-market bank that invests part of its assets in domestic government

bonds increases its exposure to local macro shocks: the value of government bonds will be low

precisely when the value of the loan book is low. Therefore, in such economies, banks should

hedge the exposure of their loan book more than they would normally do in the context of




                                              42
advanced economies, for example investing in non-domestic assets—be they bonds or

otherwise.

        This issue came up during the recent crisis in Turkey. Turkish banks, as most emerging

market banks, own large fractions of the domestic public debt: the general macroeconomic

crisis which depressed the value of the loan books also brought the Turkish government close

to defaulting on its bonds. Also the value of other assets in the banks’ balance sheets and their

own equity value collapsed, resulting in a credit crunch and a further fall in the loan book

values. On the basis of our previous analysis one would conclude that lack of proper

monitoring and of proper risk diversification amplified the crisis. Our guarantee-based

approach to risk management would have suggested the need for additional equity capital for

the banks to continue their operations. Certainly the private sector had no incentives to provide

such equity, which eventually came in the form of a blanket government guarantee on all bank

deposits. The actual value of this off-balance sheet equity was itself dependent on the IMF’s

financing and on the government’s successful fiscal retrenchment effort. Some G7 countries

had advocated default on all public debt, and therefore also on the government guarantee, as a

way to relieve Turkey’s budget from the burden of interest payments. It is now clear that such

a course of action, destroying both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet banks’ equity,

would have caused a bank run and a worsening of the crisis.




5.6 Foreign ownership of an emerging country’s banks

        We have just seen how in small emerging market economies especially the value of the

government guarantee to the banking industry is highly negatively correlated with the value of

the banks’ loan assets. When the bank’s assets decrease because of a macroeconomic shock,

there is an increase in the government’s liability from the guarantee because the expected risk


27
     On this point see Bodie and Merton (1993) and Merton and Bodie (1992).
                                                   43
exposure is now higher, unless the bank raises adequate additional capital. This requires

prompt action by the government or by the shareholder.28 Unfortunately, when a serious crisis

erupts, a statement by the government that it will stand by its guarantee has less credibility,

while shareholders lack the incentive to provide additional capital. Incidentally, the same

shareholders of the bank may have less new investment capacity, having invested in other

sectors of the same economy.

      Spain’s direct investment in Argentina provides an example. The “cultural proximity”

between the two countries resulted in direct investments being cumulated. Some large Spanish

banks directly owned Argentinean banks, while at the same time also owning (often indirectly

through their shareholding in Spanish companies) Argentinean firms operating in the industrial

and service sectors. When the country’s economy collapsed the value of those firms also

collapsed. Spanish banks had anticipated this event by creating, on their balance sheet, loss

reserves to be used to write off their investments both in the banks and in the industrial and

service companies they owned—which in the event they did. Following these large write-offs

they were either unwilling or unable to infuse additional equity capital in the Argentinean

banks they owned, thus accelerating their demise and shifting upon the government the

responsibility for guaranteeing the bank’s liabilities.29

      It has rightly been suggested that especially governments in emerging markets perform

risk audits of their assets and liabilities using VAR-like methods in their assessments. We

recommend that they should also periodically reassess the value of the guarantee they are

implicitly and explicitly giving to the banking system and measure the expected risk exposure.

There would arise a strong case for prudential regulation requiring the banks operating in these

countries to sell or to diversify their loans portfolios into other countries’ assets through

securitizations, credit default swaps and credit derivatives. Furthermore, as Spain’s example

28
 Such action, because of the non-linear relation between the price of the option and the value of the loan,
must be of a bigger size than what is suggested by the static comparison of the two values in the new state.


                                                    44
shows, the foreign shareholders of the banks should comply with similar rules especially if

they are banks themselves.



5.7 Guarantees and governments’ financial policies

          A weakening of the domestic economy affects a government’s balance sheet in two ways.

On the side of liabilities, the value of the implicit guarantee that the government provides to

local banks increases—because, when the economy weakens, the value of the banks’ loans is

likely to fall. The weakening of the economy is also associated with a fall in tax revenues: this

in turn lowers the value of the government’s assets, as discussed in Box 4.2. 30 The two effects

interact, because the percentage increase in the liability transferred onto the government’s

balance sheet caused by, say, a 10 percent decline in the capital of firms, and thus in the value

of bank loans, is larger the smaller is that capital to start with.

This analysis suggests four remarks:

     i.     Given the amount of short-term liabilities of the banking system in an emerging market

            country, given an estimate of the probability of default and of the recovery rate

            distributions (as discussed in Section 5.2 above), it should be possible to compute that

            level of the government’s assets that is necessary to provide a guarantee to those short

            term liabilities and how this should be adjusted following changes in the value of the

            loan book.

            As shown in Box 4.2, the PV of future available budget surpluses (i.e. the governments’

            taxing capability minus those government expenditures that will not be cut to

            accommodate foreign debt distress) is an important, often the most important, asset

29
   Most foreign banks, not only Spanish banks, simply wrote their investments off and failed to invest
additional capital when the crisis erupted.
30
   The fall in the government’s assets can be even bigger if, as discussed in Box 4.1, the initial fall in the
value of assets raises spreads and thus the cost of debt service.



                                                      45
       available to a government to support its debt. Therefore, the path of future fiscal

       variables should be adjusted whenever the value of the guarantees changes. This

       observation provides a rational for IMF plans which commit countries to a future path

       of primary surpluses.

 ii.   The greater is the short-term capital inflow and the consequent domestic credit

       expansion, the greater is the subsequent risk exposure and, therefore, the greater should

       be the collateral asset value of the government. Sizeable short-term capital inflows

       should thus be accompanied by the establishment of formal reserves in the accounting

       to reflect the higher liabilities. However, as already mentioned, in many countries the

       government’s most important asset is represented by the path of projected budget

       surpluses: therefore, short-term capital inflows should be accompanied by an increase

       in the path of projected budget surpluses, which would thus act as reserves.

iii.   As we have seen in the case of Argentina, these governments should avoid currency

       mismatch between the base of their guarantee (the tax revenue) and the risk exposure.

       Therefore monetary arrangements like fixed exchange rates, and especially currency

       boards, when they are accompanied by a currency mismatch in the balance sheet of

       financial institutions are particularly vulnerable.

iv.    Private-sector equity can hardly be expected to substitute for the guarantee provided by

       the domestic government. Private-sector equity is at most a cushion and can hardly be

       expected to perform the role of a guarantee. In the case of financial intermediaries,

       equity is a tiny fraction of total liabilities and its value is correlated with the value of

       the loan book.




                                                46
     This observation offers a powerful argument for diversification of the government

exposure to local shocks, for instance by swapping tax revenue—an issue we take up in section

6 of the paper.




5.8 Observations on Basel II

     It has been argued (see e.g. Persaud, 2000, Borio et al., 2001 and Reisen, 2001) that Basel

II will raise the volatility of private-sector capital flows to developing countries. Basel II

retains from Basel I the fixed link between banks’ lending and equity, in the form of the fixed

minimum capital requirement of 8 percent. Furthermore, risk weights are assessed on the basis

of indicators that are pro-cyclical: under the “standardized approach” the external ratings,

under the “internal ratings-based approach” the probability of default. It can be argued that

both indicators behave pro-cyclically so that the borrowers’ risk category worsens and

correspondingly their credit spreads widen in bad times, therefore increasing both the

probability of further down-grades and of default.

     Such negative feedbacks, however, are not the result of regulation per se. If the reason

why a country is downgraded (or its default probability, as assessed by the lenders under the

“internal ratings-based approach”, is changed) is a real value problem, then the larger spreads

simply reflect the increase in the amount of risk transferred onto the lenders, or onto the

government that is providing the lenders with a guarantee. If instead the problem was just one

of liquidity, then neither ratings need change, nor spreads increase.




5.9 Capital controls

     Institutional environments in emerging market countries may make continuous risk

management by governments, banks and banks’ shareholders, a rather complex task. More

specifically, assessment of risk exposure and prompt response to its changes may be hampered

                                                47
by lack of transparency and poor functioning of financial markets, so that governments can

neither charge adequate risk-based premiums for their implicit or explicit guarantee, nor

monitor properly risk exposure. In such a situation it may be tempting to conclude that the only

alternative is restrictions on both the ownership of assets and the issue of liabilities—for

instance to avoid the accumulation in banks’ balance sheets of currency mismatches that

cannot be diversified away.

     Indeed, there are those who argue that some of the capital controls and of the distortions

present in many emerging markets during the 1980’s, can be rationalized as responding to that

motivation. The large variety of capital controls in the various countries makes it hard to draw

any generalization. Indeed, restrictions on capital outflows were hampering in varying degrees

just the kind of asset diversification that we have seen to be beneficial especially when there is

concentrated country risk. However, by the same token, these restrictions were also applied to

banks’ domestic liabilities, so that bank runs to shift assets outside the country were difficult,

and governments could always use inflation to make good on their guarantee. In general, tight

controls on capital outflows discouraged future capital inflows, serious currency mis-matches

were rare, and most importantly governments were guaranteeing deposits that were

denominated in the same currency as the domestic tax revenue base. That was not the case in

Argentina, where ten years after financial deregulation the government was called to guarantee

U.S.-dollar-equivalent bank deposits while the peso-denominated tax revenue base was

shrinking and the exchange rate was depreciating.

     Emerging countries’ financial markets were certainly far from being efficient during the

1980’s. Removing controls and asset restrictions were viewed by many as a fundamental step

to promote growth and efficiency. But this well-intended action may have had the

unanticipated and unintended consequence of reducing the intensity of monitoring of




                                               48
government-insured institutions without providing a fully offsetting protection for the

guarantor.31



6. Managing risk to reduce financial fragility

      Many emerging countries have large concentrated exposures to specific industries—often

the result of the domestic economy being relatively specialized. Table 8 provides one example.

The data document Taiwan’s’ exposure to electronics, which is large both relative to the

country’s exports and to its value added.

      Industrial policy to encourage the domestic development of other industries has

traditionally been the way many countries have tried to diversify their risk exposure to specific

sectors. The common policy instrument was public investment, often through state-owned

enterprises. The sub-optimality of such policies is obvious, as investment is often directed

towards sectors in which the country has no special comparative advantage. Furthermore, once

  It is the nature of policy changes in general that they will have unanticipated consequences. See R.K.
Merton (1936, 1989).]. It does not follow, however, that reinstitution of capital or asset controls is the
answer.
                                                     49
the investments are made and considerable numbers of citizens are working in those newly

created domestic industries, it becomes very difficult to reverse policy.

      Diversification through capital mobility is one obvious alternative. Financial markets

allow a country to diversify its exposure to specific sectors, while exploiting its comparative

advantage. Taiwan, for instance, could trade domestic stock ownership of its domestic

electronics firms for a world-diversified portfolio of equities. Singapore, through the

Government Investment Corporation and related funds, appears to have taken significant steps

to diversify through foreign securities holdings. In general, however, this solution runs against

at least three obstacles: it is inflexible (once done, deep foreign ownership of domestic shares

is not easily reversed or changed); it creates incentive problems, as fear of expropriation of

foreigner-held shares in domestic firms is always a possibility; it often runs against local

political constraints such as the belief that the country’s “best” assets were sold to foreigners at

too low a price.

      Swap contracts and other derivative instruments provide an appealing alternative. Swaps

allow a country to diversify risk without shifting the ownership of assets. For example, a

country could impose tight capital controls, limit foreign ownership of domestic firms and still

reduce its exposure to risk: swap contracts do not require the transfer of ownership of the

underlying asset. Risk diversification through derivative instruments is obviously more flexible

than diversification through the transfer of assets.32



32
   Caballero and Panageas (2003) suggest that Chile could eliminate most, if not all, of its deep recessions
by embedding into its external bonds a long put option, yielding US$ 6-8 billions when the price of copper
falls by more than two standard deviations for a semester or more. They estimate that such insurance, if
fairly priced, might cost US$ 500 millions (lump sum). Caballero (2003) argues, however, that currently
“there is no natural market for holding such an instrument, and the corresponding derivatives markets
would not suffice to cover the position of the writer of the option. “Even in the best emerging economies,
he argues, aggregate risk management is being done with stone-age instruments and methods. “ He thus
concludes suggesting that the IMF has a key role to play here in resolving this impasse and becoming a
catalyst for such a development. He proposes that “the IMF creates a new Contingent-Markets Department
which should have three primary tasks: (i) To help identify each country’s contractible contingent basis
and develop the corresponding contingent bonds; (ii) To help create and regulate contingent market CDO-
like funds; (ii) To help design a macroeconomic policy framework consistent with the insurance
mechanism developed for the country, and monitor its fulfillment.

     The analysis of financial guarantees offers a rich framework for comparing alternative

ways to control risk. In the remaining paragraphs of this section, we discuss how derivatives

(swaps) can be used—and the extent to which they are used in practice—to limit the

accumulation of risk and thus reduce a country’s financial fragility.




Box 6.1:     Diversifying Taiwan’s exposure to electronics

     Consider Taiwan. Call RT the (stochastic) return on Taiwan’s GDP and RWE the

(stochastic) world return on electronics. Since Taiwan is heavily exposed to electronics


                                      RT = a + b R W E + ε T


where εT is a country-specific component and b is larger the higher the exposure. Let RWSM be

the return on a well-diversified portfolio of world equities. Consider a swap agreement where

Taiwan pays λ RWE and receives λ RWSM thus ending up with



                              RT = a + (b - λ) RWE + λ RWSM + εT


by choosing a value of λ sufficiently close to b the country could reduce its exposure to

electronics. For λ = b Taiwan would be left with the return on the well-diversified world

equity portfolio plus an exposure to its idiosyncratic risk εT.

     The swap as described is a “right-way” swap: in bad years, when electronics firms do

worse than the world index of other industries, Taiwan is on the receiving end of the swap. It

pays when world electronics outperform other industries. The country thus pays only in states

of the world where the world industry sectors represented in local firms outperform the world

index of other industries, i.e. when the country is relatively economically stronger.



                                                 51
     Swaps can also be used to reduce the overall risk a country faces: Taiwan could hedge its

exposure to risk by swapping (a fraction of) its exposure to RWE for the world risk-free rate.

     Swapping the return on world electronics for the return on a well-diversified world equity

portfolio, or for the risk-free rate, or for a mix of both, Taiwan would remain exposed to the

idiosyncratic component of the returns of local firms, εT. This may be the efficient thing to do

from the point of view of local incentives, since εT is the only component of the return of local

firms on which the country has some control.

     In principle, Taiwan could also diversify away the exposure to idiosyncratic risk, by

swapping the total return on its domestic portfolio of electronic companies (in effect both RWE

and εT) for the return on the world diversified market portfolio. This limiting case would allow

Taiwan to eliminate completely its exposure to local electronics firms, thus recreating the same

conditions that would prevail if all domestic electronic firms were owned largely by foreign

residents and Taiwan invested broadly around the globe. In this extreme case, however, as

under too-large foreign ownership of domestic firms, the drawbacks are related to the incentive

to expropriate, or the usual agency costs of a non-owner manager.




6.2 Equity swaps as an instrument to diversify risk Internationally 33

     In this section we illustrate how an equity swap could enable a small country to diversify

risk internationally without violating possible restrictions on investing capital abroad. Suppose

that small-country pension funds who already own the domestic equity were to enter into

swaps with a global pension intermediary (GPI). In the swap, the total return per dollar on the

small country’s stock market is exchanged annually for the total return per dollar on a market-

value weighted-average of the world stock markets. This exchange of returns could be in a

common currency, dollars, as described or adjusted to different currencies along similar lines



                                                52
to currency swaps. The magnitudes of the dollar exchanges are determined by the “notional” or

principal amount of the swap to which per dollar return differences apply.

        Without pursuing the details of implementation, we see that the swap effectively transfers

the risk of the small-country stock market to foreign investors and provides the domestic

investors with the risk-return pattern of a well-diversified world portfolio. Since there are no

initial payments between parties, there are no initial capital flows in or out of the country.

Subsequent payments, which may be either inflows or outflows, involve only the difference

between the returns on the two stock market indices, and no “principal” amount flow.

        For example, on a notional or principal amount of $1 billion, if, ex post, the world stock

market earns 10 percent and the small-country market earns 12 percent, there is only a flow of

(.12 - .10) x $1 billion or $20 million out of the country. Furthermore, the small-country

investors make net payments out precisely when they can “best” afford it: namely, when their

local market has outperformed the world markets. In those years in which the domestic market

under-performs the world stock markets, the swap generates net cash flows into the country to

its domestic investors. Hence, in our hypothetical example, if the small-country market earns 8

percent and the world stock market earns 11 percent, then domestic investors receive (.11 - .08)

x $1 billion = $30 million, a net cash inflow for the small country. Moreover, with this swap

arrangement, trading and ownership of actual shares remain with domestic investors.

        Foreign investors also benefit from the swap by avoiding the costs of trading in individual

securities in the local markets and by not having the problems of corporate control issues that

arise when foreigners acquire large ownership positions in domestic companies. Unlike

standard cash investments in equities or debt, the default or expropriation exposure of foreign

investors is limited to the difference in returns instead of the total gross return plus principal (in

our example, $20 million versus $1.12 billion). Default on the part of a counter-party in a swap



33
     This section draws on Bodie and Merton (2002) and Merton (1990, 1999, 2002).
                                                   53
contract results in the flow of payments being interrupted: the other party loses the

diversification the swap provided, which can be rebooked with a different counter-party.

        The potential exposure of foreign investors is probably less for the swap than for direct

transactions in individual stocks. Not only because swaps only imply an exposure to flows of

returns, rather than to the total value of the underlying asset. It is also more difficult to

manipulate a broad market index than the price of a single stock. Even if settlement intervals

for swaps are standardized at six months or one year, the calendar settlement dates will differ

for each swap, depending upon the date of its initiation. Hence, with some swaps being settled

every day, manipulators would have to keep the prices of shares permanently low to succeed.

        Furthermore, with the settlement terms of swaps based on the per-period rate of return, an

artificially low price (and low rate of return) for settlement this year will induce an artificially

high rate of return for settlement next year. Thus, gains from manipulation in the first period

are given back in the second, unless the price can be kept low over the entire life of the swap.

Since typical swap contract maturities range from two to ten years (with semi-annual or annual

settlements), this would be difficult to achieve.

        The hypothetical equity swap just described enables pension funds to achieve broader

international diversification. A different type of swap could enable them to hedge equity risk

altogether. This would be particularly important for people in countries where there is no local

entity, including the government, capable of issuing fixed-income securities that are free of all

risk.

        This second type of swap would call for the pension fund to swap the total return on its

equity portfolio for a risk-free interest rate denominated in a “strong” currency or in units of

constant purchasing power. This hypothetical swap would work the same way as the one in the

previous example, except that the net cash flows produced by the swap would result in the

pension fund receiving a risk-free rate of return. The counter-party must have a very good


                                                 54
credit rating, or the swap must be guaranteed by a third party with a strong credit rating, or by

a two-way mark-to-market collateral. As in the previous example, the pension fund would have

to make payments to the swap counter-party only in years when its equity portfolio

outperforms the risk-free rate.

     Swaps are over-the counter (OTC) instruments, traded outside organized exchanges.

Trading swaps implies no capital requirements although mark-to-market collateralizing of

swaps is wide-spread; there are no specific rules governing conduct, including risk

management, imposing centralized trading, defining clearing and settlement rules, and loss-

sharing rules in case of defaults. OTC derivative markets lack a formal structure, have no

physical central trading place, and no clearing or settlement system. There is also no central

mechanism to limit individual or aggregate risk taking and risk management is completely

decentralized.

     Swaps, however, are very different from traditional negotiated bilateral contracts. The size

of the OTC derivatives market (about $100 trillion of notional contracts outstanding, see Table

9) has meant that these contracts have become standardized, in particular with regard to the

legal aspects of the contract and the procedure for enforcing them: ISDA provides standardized

courts- and market-tested contracts. This makes a swap contract very different in cost and

timeliness of execution from a one-off bilateral contract.

     The idea of using swaps to diversify risk has been around for a long time. What is

different today, and allows swaps to be used in significant size and at low cost in practice, is

the convenience of an existing legal infrastructure.

     Large macroeconomic risks can accumulate in the balance sheet of the government.

Swaps can be used by governments to stabilize tax revenue and avoid the sudden accumulation

of debt. Consider again a country like Taiwan exposed to a specific industry such as

electronics. The accumulation of foreign debt denominated in foreign currency often occurs in

states of the world where RWE is low and tax revenue is correspondingly low. An instrument

that allowed the government to reduce its exposure to a specific industry would stabilize tax

revenue and reduce the sudden accumulation of foreign debt. As developed at length in Box

6.2, there are other examples of instruments besides swaps performing similar functions

including structured notes and other collateralized instruments, which essentially allow a

government to borrow against a future flow of income, e.g., the revenue from oil exports.




Box 6.3      Other derivatives used to diversify a country’s risk

     Emerging market borrowers have increasingly used innovative financial instruments to

maintain access to international capital markets and attract capital flows, particularly at times

when financial market turbulence reduces investors’ appetite for emerging market debt. It is
                                                56
interesting to note (see Schinasi et al., 2000) that the issuance of this type of securities was

particularly large following the South-East Asian and Russian crises and died out as markets

conditions returned to normal. One example is structured notes, a fixed income security linked

to a derivative—usually a swap, but also options, futures/forwards, or even credit-linked

derivatives. Structures notes, as already mentioned, allow a borrower to hedge almost any risk:

they could be designed to link the payment to capacity of the borrower. The very flexibility of

this instrument is often the reason for its lack of liquidity in secondary markets. Being tailor-

made for a specific country it is not surprising that a structured note is not a very liquid

instrument.

        Collateralized bonds are not properly derivative instruments: they are really the

securitization of future high-quality receivables, for instance oil revenue. In this sense they

constitute senior debt, where the seniority is often guaranteed by incorporation of the issuing

entity in a third country—as was the case with Pemex Finance, incorporated in the Cayman

Islands, the entity used by the Mexican government to issue securitized notes. The entity is

directly assigned the revenue from the receivables, which it uses to service the debt. As with

the senior debt issued by some developing countries in the late nineteenth century, the problem

with collateralized debt is that these instruments often earmark revenues, which constitute a

major source of tax income. This automatically raises the cost of debt service on other forms of

debt.

        Consider, returning to the example used at the beginning of this section, a Taiwanese bank

that lends to local electronics firms. Taiwan’s comparative advantage lies in its firms’ ability to

produce world-class electronics at low cost; the bank’s comparative advantage lies in its local

knowledge, that is the ability to monitor the projects of local firms and their management. The

domestic financial market, however, is too small to allow the bank to raise enough funds for its

lending activities—the manifestation, at the individual bank level, of a macroeconomic

phenomenon: the country needs portfolio capital investment to grow.


                                                 57
     By borrowing in the international capital market the bank exposes itself to an array of

risks. Not only the traditional maturity mis-match, and possibly also a currency risk, but

exposure to an industry sector, world electronics, over which it has limited, if any, control.

What the bank monitors is the relative performance of domestic firms, but a slump in the world

electronics market weakens the bank, quite independently of its ability in lending and

monitoring. The bank would need an instrument that allows it to diversify credit risk, e.g. to

swap default risk vis-à-vis its domestic borrowers for credit risk vis-à-vis a set of international

borrowers. This is precisely what a credit derivative contract can produce.

     A bank holding a concentrated loan portfolio has at least two ways to improve its risk-

return performance. First, it can actively manage the portfolio by trading loans: selling a loan,

however, might negatively affect the bank’s relationship with its customer when this discovers

that his loan has been transferred to a different institution. Second it can use credit derivatives.

A credit derivative allows the bank to swap credit risk vis-à-vis one borrower for credit risk

vis-à-vis a different set of borrowers. The two transactions are typically disjoint. First the bank

enters a default swap arrangement, essentially an insurance contract through which the bank

buys, for a fee, insurance for the event of a default. Next the bank sells insurance to other

banks buying exposure to the default risk of a different loan.

     The transfer of credit risk can enhance the efficiency of credit markets by separating

credit origination from credit-risk bearing. It can also help reduce the concentration of risk in

banks’ balance sheets: not only allowing banks to diversify their credit exposure across

markets and sectors, as discussed above, but also by making it easier to shift such risks onto

the balance sheets of non-bank institutions.

     By there very nature, however, these derivatives spread credit risk to a broader set of

market participants. This weakens the effectiveness of traditional credit-risk surveillance

mechanisms—which are typically limited to banks—and increases the channels through which

credit events can spread across institutions and markets.


                                                58
        There is also a concern related to the effectiveness of these instruments at transferring

default risk in the case of credit events. Sometimes it has been unclear whether the

restructuring of a company would qualify as a “credit event” and thus trigger the insurance

clause.34 Other cases were related to the purchase by banks of protection against the default of

a client, triggered by his failure to make good on forward contracts for the delivery of a

particular commodity—a form of credit default swap. The institutions selling such protection

to the banks, often insurance companies, have argued that the banks never intended to take

physical delivery of the commodity on the day the forward contract expired: the forward

contract had been used by the bank simply to extend credit to its client—and the credit risk had

been effectively transferred to the insurance companies: but this was not what the way the

insurance companies interpreted the contract.

7.   Conclusions

     Discussions of the role of derivatives and their risks, as well as discussions of financial

risks in general, often fail to distinguish between risks taken consciously and ones that are not.

To understand the breeding conditions for financial crises the prime source of concern is not

risk per se, but the unintended, or unanticipated accumulation of risks by individuals,

institutions or governments including the concealing of risks from stakeholders and overseers

of those entities.

     This paper has analysed specific situations in which significant unanticipated and

unintended financial risks can accumulate. We have focused, in particular, on the implicit

guarantees that governments extend to banks and other financial institutions, and which may

result in the accumulation, often unrecognized from the viewpoint of the government, of

unanticipated risks in the balance sheet of the public sector.

     Using the structural analogy between guarantees and options we have shown that a

government’s exposure to risk arising from a guarantee is non-linear. For instance, in the case

of a government which guarantees the liabilities of the banking system, the additional liability

transferred onto the government’s balance sheet by a 10 percent shock to the capital of firms is

larger the lower is that capital to start with. Recognizing this non-linearity in the transmission

of risk exposures is essential to reduce the accumulation of unanticipated risks on the

government’s balance sheet.

     Analyses of recent international financial crises recognize that the implicit guarantees

governments extend to banks and corporations create the potential to greatly weaken their

balance sheets. The attention, however, has mostly focused on the reasons why such guarantees

exist, rather than on measurement of the exposures they create. This paper offers just such a

framework for measuring the extent of a government’s exposure to risk and how that exposure

changes over time.




                                                60
     We have discussed valuation of the assets of the banking system; drawing on the work of

Gray (2001 and 2002) we have analysed the issues to be addressed in order to compute a

country’s value-at-risk; finally, we have used those insights to explain why the expected path

of future fiscal variables (taxes and spending) should be adjusted whenever the value of the

guarantees changes, such as, for instance, when the domestic economy weakens, or following

an inflow of short-term capital.

     Finally we have discussed ideas on how risk exposures can be controlled, hedged and

transferred through the use of derivatives, swap contracts, and other contractual agreements. In

emerging-market economies the domestic financial market typically allows limited

diversification of risks. Internal diversification through industrial policy can be inefficient and

costly to reverse. In such a situation, diversification through international capital mobility is

the obvious alternative. However, the transfer across borders of the ownership of real and

financial assets is only one way to achieve diversification, and it too can be costly to

implement and even more costly to reverse. Often implementing these approaches to

diversification conflicts with political objectives and constraints. Over-the-Counter (OTC)

derivative contracts provide an appealing, non-invasive alternative way to transfer risk. Equity

swaps, executed on a large scale, allow a country to diversify risk without shifting the

ownership of assets or otherwise disturbing the domestic financial practices.
