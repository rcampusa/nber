                                              ABSTRACT

Why do wars occur? We exploit a natural experiment to test the longstanding hypothesis that leaders
declare war because they fail to internalize the associated costs. We test this moral hazard theory of
conflict by compiling data on 9,210 children of 3,693 U.S. legislators who served in Congress during
the four conscription-era wars of the 20th century: World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and
the Vietnam War. We test for agency problems by comparing the voting behavior of legislators with
draft-age sons versus draft-age daughters. We estimate that (i) having a draft-age son reduces legislator
support for pro-conscription bills by 10-17%; (ii) support for conscription increases by a quarter as
a legislator's son crosses the upper age threshold; and (iii) legislators with draft-age sons are more
likely to win reelection when the draft is less popular. These results are consistent with a political agency
model in which voters update their beliefs about politicians' motives when they make unpopular legislative
decisions. Our findings provide new evidence that agency problems contribute to political violence,
and that elected officials can be influenced by changing private incentives.

1    Introduction

Violent conflict undermines state capacity, economic growth, public health and human cap-

ital formation (Besley and Persson, 2010; Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Collier et al.,

2003; Ghobarah et al., 2003). The severity of these costs raises a fundamental question:

why do destructive wars occur at all? Credible theories must allow for the failure of bar-

gained settlements to ensure peace (Fearon, 1995). One such explanation reflects a classic

political agency problem: if the leaders who order war stand to gain from the benefits

without internalizing the costs, then war will be oversupplied (Jackson and Morelli, 2007).

    We test this theory using data on roll call votes in the United States Congress during

the four conscription-era wars of the 20th Century: World War I, World War II, the

Korean War, and the Vietnam War. By observing an exogenous change in the exposure

of some legislators to the costs of conflict but not of others, we can detect moral hazard

in the decision to wage war. If leaders fully internalize the social cost of conflict in their

polity, then both groups should vote identically after the change; if not, then those with

higher private costs will reflect this in their voting.

    We exploit a natural experiment that is permitted by the nature of conscription-era

warfare in the United States. Legislators who had sons within the age boundaries of

the draft were more likely to be exposed to the direct costs of conflict than legislators

who had only daughters of the same age. Our main identifying assumption is that these

two groups would otherwise vote identically—in other words, the gender of a given draft-

age child is as good as random. Our identification strategy is also bolstered by the fact

that the proposed draft age boundaries often shift from vote to vote. This allows us to

include legislator fixed effects in our main specification, meaning that all time-invariant

characteristics of legislators are flexibly controlled for.

    We find that legislators with sons of draft age are between 10% and 17% less likely to

vote in favor of conscription than comparable legislators with only daughters of draft age.

To place this magnitude into perspective, it is equivalent to around 50-65% of the “party

line” effect of having a sitting president from the opposing party. We also find suggestive

evidence that, during the Cold War era when conscription was relatively unpopular, (i)


                                               1
legislators are less likely to vote in favor of conscription during election years; and (ii)

legislators with draft age sons are more likely to win reelection to the following Congress.

These findings are consistent with a model of political agency in which voters reward

politicians who vote against conscription and punish politicians who do not internalize its

social costs.

       Our results imply that legislators can be influenced by private motives that are external

to political or ideological concerns. One challenge to this interpretation is the possibility

that legislators with draft-eligible sons develop empathy for others in the same predica-

ment, and that the change in behavior that we observe is due to concerns for the electorate

rather than selfish motives. To explore this, we examine the behavior of politicians with

sons around the upper age eligibility cutoff. We interpret this cutoff as a discontinuous

determinant of draft exposure, as politicians are “treated” when their son is beneath the

cutoff, and not treated when they are above it.1 Using a regression discontinuity design

with legislator fixed effects, we find that a given politician raises her support for conscrip-

tion by 26% when her son crosses the upper age cutoff. We argue that this is unlikely

to be caused by a sudden change in empathy. Instead, we interpret it as evidence that

policy choices are manipulable by private motives orthogonal to both career concerns and

individual ideology.

       To arrive at these results, we undertake two main data collection exercises. In the first,

we gather information on the number and gender of children of 3,693 U.S. senators and

representatives from a combination of census records and and a variety of biographical

sources. In the second, we identify 248 roll-call votes relating to conscription from 1917

to 1974, and code the direction of pro- or anti-conscription policy preferences based on

contemporaneous newspaper reports, where applicable. This process produces a main esti-

mation sample of more than 26,000 observations at the level of a legislator-vote, combining

information on 140 unambiguous roll-call votes, 2,287 legislators, and 5,421 children.

       In order to validate our vote-coding procedure, we eschew the task of assigning pro- or

anti-conscription codes to roll call votes ourselves and develop instead a method that relies
   1
    This is not true of the lower cutoff, as a politician with a son who is, say, two years younger than the
lower boundary is plausibly exposed to the treatment.



                                                     2
on the behavior of well-known foreign policy “hawks” (pro-war legislators) and “doves”

(anti-war legislators) during each era. If a legislator votes in line with the hawks and

against the doves on a given measure, it is determined as a hawkish vote. Applying this

approach, we find that legislators with draft-eligible sons are again around 10% less likely

to vote with hawks on draft-related measures, but are not less likely to vote with hawks

on measures unrelated to the draft.

   To rationalize these main findings, we turn to a model of political agency that combines

elements of moral hazard and adverse selection (Besley, 2006). ‘Good’ politicians pursue

measures that are in the voters’ interest, and voters respond by reelecting them. ‘Bad’

politicians decide either to mimic good types in order to win reelection, or to vote against

citizens’ interests and lose reelection. This decision is determined in part by the value

of private rents that accrue to the politician if she votes against the electorate’s wishes.

Typically, researchers do not observe exogenous variation in private rents that politicians

can capture through legislative voting. This presents a barrier to empirically testing this

type of model. However, in our setting we do observe an exogenous ‘wedge’ between the

private benefits of conscription for legislators with draft-eligible sons versus those with

daughters of comparable age. This gives us testable implications of the theory that we

bring to the data. We find suggestive evidence that those with draft-eligible sons are

more likely to win reelection when the draft is unpopular. We also provide evidence that

pressure to toe the national party line is likely to be one motive that impels politicians to

vote in favor of conscription despite its lack of broad support among voters.

   The paper contributes principally to two distinct bodies of research. The first is an

emergent empirical literature that connects credible identification strategies to theoretical

work on the origins of violent conflict. These foundations are based on contest models in

which two sides fight to control total resources. Each side allocates their own resources

between production and appropriation, and the probability of victory is determined by the

relative effectiveness of fighting technology (Haavelmo, 1954; Hirshleifer, 1988; Garfinkel,

1990; Skaperdas, 1992). One limitation of contest models is that they fail to account for

bargained settlements. Wars are risky and destructive, and so it is necessary to understand



                                             3
why they are avoided in some cases but not in others.2

    Two sets of explanations in particular endure for why lengthy wars can occur between

rational actors. The first broadly relates to incomplete contracting whereby the inability

of each group to credibly commit to a negotiated settlement inhibits peace (Garfinkel

and Skaperdas, 2000; Powell, 2006, 2012). For example, Chassang and Padro i Miquel

(2009) develop a model in which transient economic shocks reduce the opportunity cost

of fighting without altering the present discounted value of victory. In a perfect informa-

tion environment with an offensive advantage and no third party contract enforcement,

groups may not be able to commit credibly to peace, and war can ensue in equilibrium.

Empirical papers that exploit plausibly exogenous variation to identify the link from eco-

nomic conditions to conflict include Miguel et al. (2004), Dube and Vargas (2013), Bazzi

and Blattman (2014), Berman and Couttenier (2015), Berman et al. (2017), Harari and

Ferrara (2018) and McGuirk and Burke (2020). The second explanation has received less

attention in the empirical literature: that wars can occur because the leaders who order

violence do not fully internalize the costs (Jackson and Morelli, 2007). This moral hazard

theory of conflict relaxes the assumption that groups are unitary actors.3 To the best of

our knowledge, we are the first to corroborate it empirically using plausibly exogenous

variation.4

    The second literature broadly relates to the political economy of legislative decision-

making. The prevailing view is that a legislator’s vote is motivated by reelection concerns,

promotion to higher office, and the politician’s own ideological beliefs (de Figueiredo and

Richter, 2014; Ansolabehere et al., 2003; Levitt, 1996; Washington, 2008). However, this

model of policy formation leaves no room for the possibility that legislators are addition-

ally influenced by other private payoffs. While this may be difficult to reconcile with the

growing share of campaign contributions emanating from the extreme top of the wealth
   2
     For example, Acemoglu and Robinson (2005) describe how elites expand the franchise to the poor in
order to preclude violent revolt.
   3
     ‘Moral hazard’ in the political economy literature broadly describes legislators (agents) pursuing private
ends in office at the expense of voters (as principals) who do not observe their motives.
   4
     Other papers that relax the assumption of unitary actors by modeling the behavior of political leaders
in conflict include De Mesquita and Siverson (1995), Tarar (2006), and Smith (1996). Information asym-
metries are also posited as a rational explanation for conflict, although this is limited in particular as a
driver of lengthy wars given that the true strength of each armed actor ought to reveal itself quickly in
battle (Fearon, 1995; Blattman and Miguel, 2010).


                                                      4
distribution in the United States (Bonica et al., 2013), there exists nonetheless an argu-

ment that politicians are largely immune from such influences (Ansolabehere et al., 2003;

Levitt, 1994; Tullock, 1972). An alternative explanation for this absence of evidence is

the empirical challenge inherent in its detection. An ideal identification strategy would

require estimating the effect on legislative voting of a change in private motives that is

independent of both political and ideological concerns. By exploiting plausibly exogenous

variation in the gender of draft-age children, our study overcomes this problem and finds

evidence that legislators respond to private incentives.

    We proceed with a brief discussion on the political economy of legislative voting in

Section 2. In Section 3 we introduce our data. In Sections 4 and 5 we present our

estimation strategy and main results. In Section 6 we examine the empathy versus self-

interest interpretation of the main results, and in Section 7 we endogenize the behavior of

voters in response to legislators’ decisions in a political agency model and empirically test

its implications. In Section 8 we conclude.



2    Political Economy of Legislative Voting in a Democracy

There is a broad consensus in the empirical literature that a politician’s legislative vote is

determined by reelection concerns, promotion to higher office, and their own ideological

beliefs (de Figueiredo and Richter, 2014; Ansolabehere et al., 2003; Levitt, 1996). This

implies that the politician takes into account four sets of preferences in determining her

optimal legislative vote (Higgs, 1989; Levitt, 1996). Reelection concerns are represented

both by the preferences of voters in her electorate, and by the preferences of her supporters

within that group; promotional concerns are represented by the national party line; and

ideological beliefs are exogenously determined fixed preferences.

    Assuming that preferences are single peaked, the politician’s objective is to select a

vote that minimizes the weighted average of the squared distances from the four ‘ideal




                                              5
points’ that correspond to each preference as follows:


                 max Uit = − [α1 (Vit − Mit )2 + α2 (Vit − Cit )2 + α3 (Vit − Pit )2
               Vit ={0,1}
                                                                                                            (1)
                                                   2
                                 + α4 (Vit − Fi ) ],


where Vit ∈ {0, 1} is the legislator i’s vote at time t; Mit ∈ [0, 1] is the ideal point in a given

issue space of the voters in the legislator’s electorate; Cit ∈ [0, 1] is the equivalent ideal

point among the legislator’s supporters; Pit ∈ [0, 1] is the ideal point of the legislator’s

national party; and Fi ∈ [0, 1] is the legislator’s ideological bliss point, which is assumed

to be fixed over time. The α parameters represent weights, and all weights sum to 1.

       There exists at least some empirical evidence in support of each element in (1). The

first, general voter preferences, is derived from the canonical model of Downsian compe-

tition in which politicians converge on the preferences of the median voter. Empirical

support for this model can be shown by detecting an impact of exogenous changes to the

composition of an electorate on subsequent policy outcomes.5 However, there also exists

evidence that is not compatible with the purest interpretation of the model. For example,

US senators from the same constituency vote differently, and an exogenous change in local

representation (but not in the electorate) led to important policy changes in India.6

       The second element, supporter group preferences, is derived from the “duel con-

stituency” hypothesis (Fiorina, 1974), which states that legislators apply additional weight

to the preferences of their own supporters within their electorate. This might be due to

the existence of primary elections, or because supporters are inclined to volunteer or con-

tribute in other ways to a candidate’s campaign.7
   5
     For example, Cascio and Washington (2014) show that a plausibly exogenous expansion of black voting
rights across southern U.S. states led to greater increases in voter turnout and state transfers in counties
with higher black population. Similarly, Miller (2008) shows that the introduction of suffrage rights for
American women immediately shifted legislative behavior toward women’s policy preferences.
   6
     Poole and Rosenthal (1984) show that Democratic and Republican U.S. senators representing the same
state, and therefore the same electorate, exhibit significantly different legislative voting patterns. In India,
Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) exploit a randomized policy experiment in which certain village council
head positions were reserved for women. Despite the electorate remaining unchanged, the reservation policy
significantly altered the provision of public goods in a manner consistent with gender-specific preferences.
Both of these results violate the median voter theorem, implying that while it has some predictive power,
there must exist additional determinants of policy.
   7
     Levitt (1996) finds that U.S. senators assign three times more weight to the preferences of their own
supporters relative to other voters in their electorate. Brunner et al. (2013) and Mian et al. (2010) also
find evidence that is consistent with this effect.


                                                       6
       The third element, national party preferences, reflects the fact that politicians have an

incentive to vote in line with the national party, who in return can provide promotions to

various committee positions.8

       The final element, a legislator’s fixed ideology, is estimated by Levitt (1996) to carry

a weight of around 0.60, more than α1 , α2 , and α3 combined. Causal evidence for the

existence of this idiosyncratic ideological influence is provided by Washington (2008),

who finds that U.S. legislators with more daughters have a higher propensity to vote in

favor of liberal measures, particularly ones connected to expanding reproductive rights.

Her findings are consistent with sociological theories that parenting daughters increases

feminist sympathies.9


Incorporating private influences

A notable feature of this model is the absence of a private motive that is distinct from a

legislator’s fixed ideology and political career concerns. To wit, the model either assumes

that there are no other private costs and benefits associated with legislative voting, or

that, if there are, legislators are immune to their influence. This appears to be at odds

with the apparently large sums of private money that are spent on lobbying and campaign

contributions. However, Ansolabehere et al. (2003), echoing Tullock (1972), argue that if

campaign contributions were indeed worthwhile investments, they ought to be of substan-

tially higher value in each election cycle given the trillions of dollars of government outlays

potentially at stake. They note that campaign spending limits are not binding; that the

majority value of contributions come from individual donors rather than special interest

Political Action Committees (PACs); and that these individuals give the marginal dollar.

They also run fixed effects regressions that uncover no relationship between pro-corporate

legislative voting and corporate donations. They conclude that campaign contributions
   8
     Evidence from, inter-alia, Bonica (2013), Snyder and Groseclose (2000), and McCarty et al. (2001)
supports this view in the context of U.S. congressional voting.
   9
     One line of argument is that voters’ preferences are represented in government not through α1 or α2 ,
but rather through this channel. This is the “citizen candidate” notion of representation, which states that
candidates are unable to make binding commitments to voters, and so voters support candidates whose
(known) fixed ideology is most closely aligned to their own (Besley and Coate, 1997; Osborne and Slivinski,
1996). In contrast to median voter theorem, voters elect rather than affect policies.




                                                     7
are largely made for their consumption value, rather than returns on investment.10

    In this paper, we address an alternative potential explanation for the absence of evi-

dence on the role of private influences in legislative voting: the significant empirical chal-

lenge inherent in detecting such an effect (as noted by de Figueiredo and Richter, 2014). A

causal identification strategy would involve estimating the effect of an exogenous change

in the private net benefits of voting on the legislative choices of a politician, conditioning

on politician fixed effects to hold ideology constant. While there exists persuasive evidence

that, for example, campaign contributions can “buy” time with a legislator (Kalla and

Broockman, 2016), that the market value of firms can be affected by exogenous changes

in the political power of connected politicians (Jayachandran, 2006; Fisman, 2001), and

that exogenous differences in ideology between politicians can affect voting (Washington,

2008), to our knowledge there is no evidence that individual legislators respond to changes

to their private net benefits of voting on a given issue. Yet, such a view would be consis-

tent with more recent evidence that the richest individuals in the U.S. are contributing a

higher share of contributions to politicians than before (Bonica et al., 2013), and that the

pattern of contributions by firm CEOs and economic PACs suggest that they are investing

rather than consuming (Gordon et al., 2007).

    To incorporate this viewpoint, we propose a modification of equation (1) above in

which self-interested legislators are additionally concerned with their own private returns

to voting, as follows:


                 max Uit = − [α1 (Vit − Mit )2 + α2 (Vit − Cit )2 + α3 (Vit − Pit )2
               Vit ={0,1}
                                                                                                          (2)
                                                  2                  2
                                + α4 (Vit − Fi ) + θ(Vit − Rit ) ],


    where Rit ∈ [0, 1] is the ideal point that optimizes legislator i0 s time-varying private
  10
     While the model above is consistent with this view, it can also accommodate a form of effective
campaign spending whereby contributions can help to elect a certain politician with sympathetic ideological
preferences, as distinct from affecting a politician’s policy preferences in a quid pro quo arrangement.
However, even this possibility has been challenged empirically, most notably by Levitt (1994). Similarly,
the fact that three times more is spent on lobbying in the U.S. than campaign contributions does not imply
that legislators are susceptible to private concerns beyond those laid out above. Lobbying is the transfer
of information in private meetings from organized groups to politicians or their staffs (de Figueiredo and
Richter, 2014). If these activities were shown to have an impact on policy, the possibility would still remain
that their impact operates through any of the elements in the model rather than through a private quid
pro quo channel.

net benefit, θ is the weight that the politician assigns to this motive, and             j=1 αj + θ   = 1.

The solution to the legislator’s problem becomes:

       We define political motives as those derived from the preferences of voters and political

parties, and private motives as those derived from ideological preferences and other time-

varying costs and benefits.


Implications for Conflict

Much of the theoretical literature on violent conflict treats actors as unitary decision-

makers.11 Implicit in this approach is the assumption that the costs and benefits of

conflict are shared among members of each group. The politician’s solution in (3) relaxes

this assumption. If, on a given vote, a shock to Rit is sufficiently large, then it is possible

a leader may vote to enter conflicts in which the expected social costs exceed the benefits,

or to avoid conflicts in which the expected social benefits exceed the costs. The critical

condition in either case is that the private payoff through θ offsets the influences that

operate through the other channels, or Vit∗ (. | θ > 0) = (1 − Vit∗ (. | θ = 0)).12 This is

raised by Fearon (1995) as one explanation for violent conflict between rational groups

that cannot be solved necessarily through a negotiated settlement. Jackson and Morelli

(2007) develop the concept formally, showing that “political bias”—or the extent to which

the pivotal policy maker benefits from conflict relative to the rest of the population—can

cause war even in the presence of enforceable transfers between potential belligerents.

       Other papers that relax the assumption of unitary actors do so by modeling the politics

of conflict from the perspective of leaders (De Mesquita and Siverson, 1995; Smith, 1996;

Goemans, 2000; Tarar, 2006), or by addressing a different type of agency issue, whereby

literature.
   12
      The same could be said about changes to Cit , Pit and Fi , assuming that Mit approximates the social
optimum. An interesting difference is that those motives are plausibly known to the electorate, whereas
Rit is plausibly not. We examine this condition in more detail when we endogenize voter behavior in
Section 7.




                                                     9
politicians must provide sufficient incentives to solve the collective action problem of rais-

ing an army (Grossman, 1999; Beber and Blattman, 2013; Gates, 2002). In our setting,

this is achieved by the threat of penalties for draft evasion.

   The specific role of moral hazard in conflict has been applied to the case of rebel

activity in the presence of external humanitarian interventions—for example, Kuperman

(2008) and Crawford (2005) argue that the insurance provided by external groups protects

rebel groups from the risks of rebellion, which ultimately leads to more violence—and to

the case of states acting more aggressively when they have powerful allies (Christensen

and Snyder, 1990; Benson et al., 2014; Narang and Mehta, 2019). In the present paper,

we make the related argument that politicians who are protected from the risks of conflict

are more likely to support it.


Testing Implications

The central challenge for the researcher in determining whether or not private payoffs

influence policy decisions (i.e., θ > 0) is to identify exogenous variation in Rit . Otherwise,

any estimate of θ could be biased due to positive covariance between Rit and any of the

other elements in the model. For example, a senator who receives contributions from

a weapons producer and favors voting for war in Congress may appear to be malleable

through this channel. However, the possibility exists that (i) a large share of her electorate

is employed by the firm, in which case Mit or Cit is measured incorrectly as Rit ; or (ii)

that she is ideologically predisposed to war and the firm optimally contributed to her

campaign, in which case Fi is measured incorrectly as Rit .

   We overcome this problem by exploiting variation in the age and gender of politicians’

children to determine whether or not having a draft-eligible son affects legislative voting

on conscription, holding Fi constant. Legislators with draft-eligible sons stand to lose

more from the passage of conscription than do legislators with daughters of comparable

age, all else equal. This implies that, on a vote to determine whether or not to impel

citizens to go to war, legislators exhibited measurable, exogenous variation in Rit .

3        Data and Background

Structure         Data in our main analysis is at the level of a legislator-vote. Each observation

contains information on how the legislator voted and on a range of legislator characteristics,

including the number and gender of their children at the time of voting. In our full

dataset, which includes votes analyzed for robustness and auxiliary exercises, there are

3,693 legislators, 9,210 children, and around 700,000 legislator-votes spread between the

House of Representatives and the Senate from the 64th Congress in 1916 to the 93rd

Congress in 1974.13 In our core analysis of conscription voting there are 2,287 legislators,

5,420 children, and 26,373 legislator-votes. We describe below our principal data sources

and the construction of our main variables.


Vote data Our dependent variable of interest is whether or not a given legislator voted

in favor of conscription. Our main sample of interest is the universe of draft-related roll

call votes cast in the United States Congress during the 20th Century. We create this

sample by first gathering voting records from the Voteview project.14 We then retain the

union of votes that are assigned the “Selective Service” issue code by Voteview (the main

conscription legislation in the United States is named the Selective Service Act) and votes

that we determine to be relevant. This is aided by short descriptions of each roll-call vote

provided by the Gov Track project.15 This gives a total of 248 votes; 195 determined by

Voteview and a further 53 determined by the authors. An example of a measure that is

assigned the issue code is: “S.1 Act to provide for the common defense and security of the

US and to permit the more effective utilization of man-power resources of the the US by

authorizing universal military training and service,” which was passed in the House and

Senate in 1951. An example of a vote that was not assigned an issue code by Voteview

but was assigned a code by the authors is: “To amend S.1871, by raising the minimum

age limit to be selected into the military from 21 to 28 years. (P. 1463, Col. 2),” which

was rejected in the Senate in 1917. It was not assigned the “Selective Service Act” issue

code most likely because the act itself had not yet passed.

   Next, in order to examine legislators’ motives for voting, it is necessary for us to assign

a ‘direction’ to each roll call vote. For example, in the first example above, it is clear that

an “aye” vote implied support for the draft, whereas in the second example it seems

less likely to be the case. Raising the lower cutoff could plausibly reflect an anti-draft

preference. At the same time, however, it is possible that the passage of that amendment

could have raised the likelihood that the main draft bill to which it was attached ultimately

passed too. In such a case, there is a danger of misclassifying a pro-draft measure as an

anti-draft one.

   For each of the 248 votes, therefore, we turned to archival records to determine the

implications of an aye versus a nae. This mostly took the form of newspaper articles from

the week in which a bill was debated in the New York Times and the Chicago (Daily)

Tribune. In some cases, this research reversed our priors on the direction of a certain vote.

For example, an amendment to authorize “the president to conscript 500,000 men if the

number is not secured by voluntary enlistment within 90 days” (Senate Vote 51 in the 65th

Congress, 1917), might initially appear to be a pro-draft amendment. However, articles

in both papers make it clear that this was viewed as a success by the isolationists at the

time, as the original Army bill provided for selective draft without a call to volunteers.

   Several votes were too ambiguous to be coded in either direction. For example, it is

not clear a priori whether or not a vote to allow exemptions for certain groups is welcomed

by a congressperson with a draft-eligible son; on the one hand, the son may be eligible,

but on the other, exemptions for other eligible men may increase the probability of being

drafted into combat conditional on being eligible.

   The results of this data collection exercise can be seen in Table 1, where we document

draft-related votes only in Congresses in which we found relevant votes that we could

determine as pro- or anti-draft. In total, we code the direction of 140 votes—106 in the

Senate and 34 in the House (Column 1). In the second column we present our main

dependent variable: Pro Draft is equal to 1 if a legislator voted in favor of conscription

(aye if it was a pro-draft vote, or emphnae if it was an anti-draft vote), and 0 otherwise.

This exhibits a large amount of variation; the sample average is 0.58. In the third column

we present the average absolute margin between aye and other votes (nae or abstentions).

                                              12
For example, there is one vote in the 89th Senate; Pro Draft is 0.93, which means the

margin is 0.93 − (1 − 0.93) = 0.86, the gap between the winning vote and the losing vote.

Column (4) contains the number of draft-related votes in total—i.e., successfully coded

or otherwise. The overall number is 232, as the remaining 16 were in other Congresses in

which we did not successfully code any votes. We cannot present the same information

for the outcome variable, but we do present the average margin to facilitate a comparison

between Columns (2) and (3). The respective mean margins are 0.18 and 0.17, suggesting

that there is no obvious difference between votes that we could and could not code.


Legislator data The main independent variables are constructed from data on legis-

lators’ family compositions. We first take basic data on legislators themselves from the

Biographical Directory of the United States Congress 1774 - 2005 (Dodge et al., 2005). We

then use this information to locate richer household data from alternative sources. Most of

this data is acquired from decennial U.S. Census records dating from 1840 to 1940, which

we access through Ancestry, a company that provides digitized and searchable Census

records up to 1940.16 These records contain information on the name, gender and age of

each household member. We cross-check household data across multiple Census records

and ensure that the full set of children are accounted for. For those congresspeople too

young to have household information contained in the 1940 Census, we rely instead on

a broad range of sources that include obituaries in national newspapers; biographies on

official federal and local government websites; local media profiles; university archives;

and other online repositories.17

      In Table 2, we present this information only for the 2,287 legislators who voted on

our main sample of conscription measures in Column (1) of Table 1. Of these, 85% had

children at the time of voting, and the average number of children per legislator was

2.37; 68% had at least one son and 65% had at least one daughter. In the second to

last column, we present the percentage of legislator-votes in which a legislator’s son was

within the draft-eligibility window pertaining to the given roll call vote. For example, on

a vote that proposes to enact the draft for all men between 20-25, a legislator with a 26

year old son is coded as a 0. However, if the following roll call vote proposed to raise

the upper cutoff so that the window runs from 20-30, the same legislator is coded as a

1. This is our main ‘treatment’ variable in the analysis. The House and Senate sample

means are 0.23 and 0.21; meaning that over one fifth of legislator-votes on draft bills are

cast by legislators with sons in the draft window. Reassuringly, the equivalent figures for

daughters are the same.

   Data on the age cutoffs are presented in Figure 1 and Table 3. There is more variation

in the upper age cutoff than in the lower one. There is also considerably more variation

in the proposed cutoffs during the two World Wars than in the two Cold War conflicts.



Taken together, the data show that draft-related measures in Congress were relatively

contentious, and that around one-fifth of legislators had sons of draft-eligible age during

the relevant votes. Less clear are (i) the perceived costs and benefits of conscription that

were postulated during debates on the floor (or in committee) at the time; and (ii) the

potential additional costs to a treated legislator of a draft measure passing.

   On the first issue, we can learn much from archived newspaper reports about the

nature of the debate surrounding conscription. For example, on the first day of the

World War I draft bill debate on April 23, 1917, Representative Julius Kahn, who led

the Administration’s fight for conscription, invited Captain Percy Benson of the Somerset

Yeomanry, a regiment of the British Army, to speak to the House Committee on Military

Affairs about “England’s mistakes.” Benson listed five main reasons why the US should

pursue conscription. First, he believed that the obligation to defend a democracy ought

to be equal; second, he argued that the draft secured “infinitely greater efficiency”, insofar

as the government, through the selective process, could ensure that a sufficient number of

men could remain in essential industries such as coal mining, shipbuilding, and farming

during the war; third was the “economy” of conscription, which allowed the government

to call up single men rather than married ones with dependents and potentially expensive

allowances and pensions; the fourth point was “continuity of effort”, or the direct efficiency

of securing a sufficient number of soldiers with maximum certainty in order to win the war;

and the fifth point was to ensure that “slackers” pull their weight and, just as importantly,

                                             14
that those who “were called slackers who were not slackers at all” would be protected from

such terms of opprobrium.18

       In one form or another, many of these points were repeated over the course of draft-era

warfare in the US Congress, although, as we discuss in detail in Section 7, the necessity of

the draft as a means of securing a sufficient number of soldiers waned as conflict technology

became more capital intensive over time (Fordham, 2016). Other arguments against the

draft were varied. Unions were consistently opposed to conscription as they viewed it as

a form of class exploitation, most likely because the alternative—raising military pay—

would increase unions members’ bargaining power and wages.19 Relatedly, others viewed

the draft as an opportunity for special interests to profit,20 while isolationists and pacifists

opposed conscription as part of their general opposition to interventionist foreign policy.21

       One consistent argument against the draft relates to agency frictions of the type that

we seek to test in our main analysis. Perhaps the most notable example of this concerns an

amendment proposed by Congressman Hubert Stephens of Mississippi to make members

of Congress themselves subject to the draft during World War I. Speaking in favor of the

amendment, Congressman Frank Clark of Florida argued that “[i]t would be a shame,

a cowardly thing [...] for Congress to declare war and then send young boys to do the

fighting, while our precious hides are exempt.” Mr. Stephens insisted that there were a “a

number of vigorous men on this floor who are fit for service at the front.” The amendment

also ran an opinion piece quoting Abraham Lincoln’s defense of the draft during the Civil War, in which he

      During the World War I draft debate, The New York Times reported that “Mrs. W.I. Thomas of

alliance between Lombard and Wall Streets. Grant Hamilton of the American Federation said labor stood
solidly against conscription.” (“Senate Takes Up Draft for Debate,” The New York Times, April 22 1917.)
This line of argument continued into the World War II era (“Draft Bill Action is Demanded Now,” The
New York Times, August 22, 1940):
         “Senators Holt, Wheeler and Walsh again bitterly attacked the principle of peace-time con-
         scription. Senator Holt asserted that “international bankers” and “wealthy attorneys” were
         promoting the selective service measure. He said he saw something sinister in what he said
         was the fact that most of them were “Harvard men.”

   Speaking during the debate to enact conscription prior to U.S. involvement in World War II, Senator

Times, April 28 1940.)

was defeated, 130 to 86.22

         On the second issue, we compile in Table 4 data on U.S. draft registrants, draft de-

ployments, total service-members, and total fatalities for each war in our dataset. In total,

just over 109 million men were registered for the draft over the four conflicts. Of those,

16.3 million (or 15%) were inducted. This is just under one half of the 35.3 million total

service members. Total U.S. fatalities are estimated at 426,132, implying a 1.2% prob-

ability of death conditional on serving. Assuming that draftees were killed at the same

rate as regular service members, a draft registrant had a 0.2% probability of being killed

in battle.23 Note also that this does not take into account other long-run mental, physical

and labor-market costs of conflict such as those identified in Angrist (1990) and many

others. One fifth of legislators, therefore, had a non-trivial role in determining the risks

faced by their own sons in battle.



4         Estimation

Our main specification is as follows:


 Visvcj = αi + vvcj + kiv + β1 soniv + β2 draf t childiv + β3 draf t soniv + ζXiv + isvcj , (4)


where Visvcj is an indictor equal to one if the legislator i from state s votes to enact

or expand conscription in vote v during Congress c in congressional chamber j; αi are

legislator fixed effects; vvcj are vote fixed effects; kiv are fixed effects for number of children

at the time of vote v; soniv is an indictor equal to one if a legislator has a son at the

time of vote v; draf t childiv is an indicator variable equal to one if a legislator has any

child of draft-eligible age as determined by the cutoffs in vote v; draf t soniv indicates

that a legislator has a son of draft-eligible age in vote v; Xiv is a vector of time varying

controls, comprising the legislator’s age, age squared, and terms in office. In regressions

without legislator and vote fixed effects, we include controls for party, state and chamber

fixed effects. Standard errors are two-way clustered by legislator and vote. We estimate
    22
    “Amendments Flood House,” The New York Times, April 29 1917.
    23
    This is around 17 times greater than the probability of dying in a traffic accident in the United States
in 2019 (see: www.nsc.org/road-safety/safety-topics/fatality-estimates, accessed 3/12/2020.)


                                                    16
the specification with a linear probability model (LPM) and show that the results are

qualitatively unchanged when estimated in a conditional (fixed effects) logit model (CL).

    Our main identifying assumption is that draf t soniv is independent of the error term.

This is violated if having a draft age son is related to any of the other determinants of

optimal voting in equation (3)—voter preferences, party preferences, and ideology. The

inclusion of legislator fixed effects, vote fixed effects (the most granular time fixed effects

possible), draf t childiv , and fixed effects for total number of children are particularly

reassuring in that regard. Conditional on these covariates, we argue that variation in

draf t soniv is as good as random.

    Finally, it is necessary to determine the appropriate number of lead years for the lower

cutoff in the treatment variable. If, say, the lower cutoff is at 20, then it is likely that

a member of congress with a 19 year old son is effectively treated. Failing to account

for this will bias the estimated treatment effect βˆ3 toward zero, as treated legislators

will contaminate the comparison group. While the decision is somewhat arbitrary, what

should be clear is that βˆ3 initially rises as we reduce the lower cutoff and add more treated

legislators to the treatment group, before smoothly decreasing again as more untreated

legislators with younger children are added.



5    Main Results

Table 5 presents the main results with the lower bound set at 4 years below the proposed

cutoff. This means that a legislator with a 16 year old son is treated if the proposed

lower cutoff is 20 years of age. In Column (1), we show that having a draft-eligible

son reduces the probability of voting for conscription by 6.7 percentage points, from a

mean of 0.605. Adding state fixed effects reduces the magnitude of the coefficient and

removes its statistical significance (although the coefficient on draf t childiv is marginally

significant). In Column (3) we add legislator fixed effects, finding a treatment effect of

−0.102 (p< 0.01), or 17% of the mean. Finally, we add vote fixed effects and estimate the

full model from equation (4) in Column (4), finding again a large and significant negative

treatment effect in the region of 10% of the mean.


                                              17
       In Figure 1, we plot the sensitivity of each empirical model in Table 5 to different lower

cutoff ages. In all four models, point estimates smoothly rise from the one-year lead to

the four-year lead, before falling off slightly at five years. This pattern aligns well with

theory: with few leads there are treated legislators in the control group, which biases β3

downward. The treatment effect is maximized with a four-year lead, as the inclusion of

legislators with a five year lead reduces the point estimate. Up until the Vietnam War,

the mean duration of the draft per war was 3.3 years. Returning to the example above, it

is reasonable that legislators with a 16 year old son are more concerned about conscription

on average than those with a 15 year old son.

       In Table 6, we examine whether or not the treatment variable is larger in a sample of

close votes. Legislators’ decisions are more likely to be pivotal in closer votes. We would

therefore expect those with draft-eligible sons to be more likely to oppose the draft in

narrow votes relative to landslide votes. Defining close votes as those in which the margin

was less than 60-40, we find that the draft-age son × close vote interaction effect in the

first three columns ranges from −20 to −15 percentage points (p< 0.01), easily enough to

convert the average legislator from pro- to anti-draft. Adding vote fixed effects reduces

the interaction effect to −1.8 percentage points (p> 0.10).


Hawks and Doves            In Section 3 we described the process by which we coded 140 votes

as either pro- or anti- draft. This is a subset of the 248 draft-related votes in total. The

remaining 109 were too ambiguous for us to code with confidence.24

       Two drawbacks of this approach are (i) the loss of coverage owing to the ambiguity of

certain votes; and (ii) the level of discretion that we were required to exercise in determin-

ing the direction of each vote. In order to test the robustness of the main results to sample

selection and the authors’ discretion, we develop an alternative method of measuring pro-

or anti-draft preferences among legislators. Drawing on a variety of sources, including

historical accounts and archival newspaper articles, we identify at least two well-known
  24
    These include bills that add exemptions which could potentially help or hinder a legislator depending on
the exemption; and bills that were too ambiguous to interpret for other reasons, e.g., a House amendment
in 1951 that proposed to prevent draftees from being sent to Europe, which some viewed as limiting the
scale of the draft while others viewed it as increasing the likelihood that draftees would be sent to Korea,
which was potentially more dangerous.



                                                    18
foreign policy “hawks” and two well-known foreign policy “doves” during each Congress

in both the House and the Senate.25 We use this information to create a new variable,

Hawk Vote, which is equal to 1 if the modal vote among the hawks in a given legislator’s

congress-chamber is in favor of a measure and the modal vote among doves is against it.

Similarly, it is equal to 0 if the model dove vote is in favor of a measure and the model

hawk vote is against it. The variable is only defined in cases where there is a unique mode

among hawks and a unique mode among doves that is not the same. The correlation

coefficient between Hawk Vote and our main Pro Draft outcome variable is 0.92.

       In Table 7, we repeat the same four specifications as in Table 5 using Hawk Vote as the

dependent variable. The sample is drawn from all 248 draft-related votes in our dataset,

rather than the 140 that we were able to code. On the other hand, votes for which the

variable is not defined are omitted. In assigning legislators to treatment or control groups,

we use the draft age thresholds assigned to individual votes where possible. Otherwise,

we use the thresholds that were most recently passed in a given chamber. The results are

almost identical; interpreting Column (4), we see that legislators with sons of draft-eligible

age are around 5.5 percentage points (or 9% of the mean) less like to vote for conscription

than those with daughters of comparable age.

       In Table 8, we restrict the hawks and doves sample to draft-related votes that are not

included in our main estimation in Table 5, and again find similar results.

       In Table 9, we repeat the exercise on the universe of votes in draft-era Congresses

that are unrelated to the draft. This gives a sample of almost 176,000 legislator-votes. In

Column (2) where we control for state fixed effects there is a marginally significant positive

effect. In our preferred specifications with legislator fixed effects and added vote fixed

effects (Columns 3 and 4 respectively), the treatment effect is not significantly different

to zero.

       This exercise suggests that our main results are not an artifact of the authors’ vote-

coding procedure, and that legislators with sons of draft age do not vote differently to

those with daughters of draft age on issues unrelated to the draft.
  25
   The exception is the 82nd House during the Korean War, in which we were only able to find one dove
(Robert Crosser, D-Ohio).



                                                 19
Additional robustness           In Appendix Table A1, we repeat the exercise with added

controls for second order polynomials in the age of every child of each legislator. If a

legislator does not have a kth order child, we enter a zero for the corresponding age.

These zeros are then flexibly captured by kiv in the regression. These age controls ensure

that the treatment effect is not picking up nonlinear effects of a child’s age on legislators’

voting preferences. The main results are robust to their inclusion.

      In Appendix Table A2, we show that the main results are qualitatively robust to

estimating an equivalent Conditional Logit model.

      In Appendix Table A3, we run the same four empirical models as in Table 5 with

an alternative set of draft-related votes. While our main votes concern the enactment,

extension, or reduction of universal military service (e.g., passage of the Selective Service

Act, its extension over time, increasing or decreasing the number of draftees, etc.), the

votes that we study in Table A3 instead include what we call “window votes,” which are

votes to change the existing upper or lower cutoffs only. We treat these separately because

they require an alternative coding procedure. To understand why, say that legislators vote

on a measure to change the draft window from 20-30 to 20-35, i.e. raising the upper cutoff

from 30 to 35. A legislator with a 32 year old son is clearly negatively impacted, and

would be assigned to the treatment group. We denote these legislators as “marginal.”

However, it is not obvious to see how a legislator with a 22 year old son is affected by

this. On the one hand, their son faces a longer duration of eligibility. On the other, the

probability that their son is drafted could be reduced. This was an issue much debated in

Congress at the time. Reporting on one such debate in 1940, the New York Times writes:

        “The difference in age brackets between the two bills could have a profound

        effect on the selection results, it was asserted during the debate in the two

        houses. To raise the 800,000 men it is planned to train during the first year

        of the program would involve the selection of only one in every twenty-three

        registrants in the age group of 21 to 45 and one out of every thirteen under

        the Senate bill’s age range of 21 to 31.”26

To sidestep this problem, we drop these infra-marginal legislators from the sample, leaving

only the marginal group as treated and the extra-marginal legislators as the control along

the age dimension. This leaves a sample of around 7,000 legislator-votes. The results

can be seen in Figure A1, where we allow the lead years to vary. The treatment effect

is maximized with either a one-year or a two-year lead rather than a four year lead as in

the main model, perhaps reflecting the fact that window votes tended to occur closer to

the ends of wars than the main votes. We present these models with a two year lead in

Table A3. Another point to note is that the treatment effect is significant with vote fixed

effects but not with legislator fixed effects, which is consistent with the sharply reduced

sample size.

    Finally, in Table A4, we present results in which the treatment variable is not coded

with respect to the proposed cutoffs as determined by vote in question, but rather to the

existing cutoffs determined by the most recently approved measure in a given chamber.

This introduces measurement error in the treatment variable. The results, although still

significant in our preferred specification, highlight the importance of examining the im-

plications of each specific roll call vote rather than basing the treatment status on the

prevailing cutoffs.



6    Empathy vs. Self-Interest: Regression Discontinuity

While the main results are consistent with the hypothesis that leaders have selfish motives

beyond politics or ideology (i.e., that θ > 0, from Section 2), it is nevertheless possible

that the estimated βˆ3 is consistent with the classic model of legislative voting presented in

equation (1). For example, it could be the case that legislators receive information from

their draft-eligible sons that makes the social cost of conscription more salient to them for

a certain period of time. In that case, we might be observing a change in the legislator’s

perception of voter preferences, or even a change in the legislator’s own ideology, rather

than a change in her private returns to voting.

    One way to test this empathy vs self-interest interpretation is to examine the behavior

of legislators who have sons around the upper age cutoff. Under the self-interest interpre-


                                             21
tation, those who have sons immediately below the cutoff will behave as if they are treated,

whereas those who have sons immediately above the upper cutoff will not. Under the em-

pathy interpretation, one would assume that the legislator’s concern for draft-eligible sons

and their families would remain intact—or at least decline more gradually—as their own

son crosses the upper threshold.

   This test lends itself to a regression discontinuity design around the upper boundary

of the draft age eligibility cutoff. We create a running variable defined as the legislator’s

son’s age minus the upper cutoff. It is negative when a legislator’s son is below the upper

cutoff age on a given vote, and positive when he is above it. If a legislator has more than

one son, we select the age of the son closest to the cutoff. We discard all observations

for legislators who have sons beneath the lower age cutoff to aid our interpretation. If a

legislator has one or more sons within the draft age window and another above it, we use

the age of the draft-eligible (i.e., within-window) son closest to the cutoff, as it is more

relevant to the legislator’s behavior.

   Formally, we estimate the following model, for RViv ∈ (−h, h):


            Viv = α + φ1{RViv > 0} + δ1 RViv + δ2 RViv × 1{RViv > 0} + εiv ,              (5)


where RViv is the running variable (son’s age minus upper cutoff); 1{RViv > 0} is an

indicator equal to 1 if RViv is positive (i.e., if the son’s age is above the upper cutoff);

and h is a bandwidth determined by the procedure developed in Calonico et al. (2014).

The parameter φ measures the effect of having a son exit the draft eligibility window on a

legislator’s vote for conscription. A significant and positive φ indicates some support for

the self-interest motive; a null effect indicates support for the empathy motive alone.


Results    Estimates of φ are presented in Table 10. In the first column, we see that a

legislator with a son slightly above the upper cutoff is 15 percentage points (or about 25%

of the mean) more likely to vote for the draft than one with a son slightly below the upper

cutoff. In the second column, we add controls for legislator fixed effects. The results imply

that a given legislator is 15.7 percentage points more likely to support the draft after his



                                             22
or her son crosses the upper cutoff relative to before. In columns (3) and (4) we repeat

the exercise focusing only on close votes, or those in which the margin of victory was a

maximum of 20% of the votes cast. This reduces the sample size by around 70%, and

gives equivalent estimates of φ at 36 and 38 percentage points respectively—over half of

the overall mean.

       In Table 11, we test for similar discontinuities with two placebo outcomes: whether

the legislator is in the Senate or the House, and whether the legislator is a Democrat or

not. Whether in the close vote sample or in the full sample, there is no discontinuous

association with the running variable at the upper cutoff.

       In Table 12, we repeat the exercise from Table 10 only with the daughter’s age replacing

the son’s age in the running variable.27 In the full sample of votes there is a negative jump

at the cutoff, and in the sample of close votes there is no significant effect. One possible

explanation for this negative effect is that there is no underlying relationship between

the running variable and the outcome, and so the discontinuity that we observe is one of

many along the distribution. We can interrogate this by examining RD estimates at a

variety of placebo cutoff points to either side of the true cutoff. In Table A5 we present

10 placebo tests for the son’s age effect. These begin at -15 and increase in intervals of

three years. The true estimate is the only one that is positive and significant. There is

one negative and significant estimate at the cutoff + 12 years. In Table A6, we replace

the son’s age with the daughter’s age. Six of these RD estimates are significant, and of

those two are positive and four are negative. These coefficients suggest the there is no

clear relationship between a legislator’s daughter’s age and the probability that they vote

in favor of conscription.


Figures       Figure A2 in the Appendix presents the visual analogue of these RD results. As

the data-driven bandwidths are rarely above 5 years, we additionally present in Figure 3

a local linear regression discontinuity (RD) plot that mimics the first result in Table 10

without any bandwidth restrictions. On the right hand side is the equivalent plot where

the running variable is the legislator’s daughter’s age minus the upper cutoff rather than
  27
   The running variable is generated according to the same procedure outlined above, only substituting
daughters for sons in each step.


                                                 23
the son’s age. The discontinuity is clear with respect to the son’s age, but not with respect

to the daughter’s. Figure 4 repeats the exercise using a second order polynomial on each

side of the cutoffs. Again, there is a positive discontinuity on the left hand side, but not

on the right. In Figure 5, we show RD plots with both placebo outcomes—Senator and

Democrat—and the son’s age running variable. Neither exhibit a significant jump. Finally,

in Figure 6, we plot the density of the son’s age running variable, finding no significant

evidence of bunching on either side of the cutoff.

         Taken together, evidence from legislators’ voting behavior around the upper cutoff

strongly suggests that self-interest is at least part of the motive behind the main results

rather than a sense of empathy for the electorate or an enlightened form of ideology.

On average, a legislator is around 15 percentage points more likely to vote in favor of

conscription when her son crosses the upper age eligibility threshold.



7         Political Agency and Voter Behavior

We postulate in Section 2 that a sufficiently large shock to Rit could cause political leaders

to vote to enter conflicts in which the expected social costs exceed the benefits, or to avoid

conflicts in which the expected social benefits exceed the costs, provided that θ > 0. So

far, we have shown that an exogenous increase in the private costs of conscription for

some legislators reduces the likelihood that they vote in favor of enacting it. What is

still unclear is whether, on average, these treated legislators with draft-eligible sons better

represent their constituents’ preferences over conscription than similar control legislators

with daughters of comparable age. If the treated group better reflects voters’ concerns,

then it is the control group politicians that deviate from the social optimum by failing to

internalize the costs of their decision. If the control group better reflects voters’ concerns,

then it is the treatment group politicians that deviate from the social optimum by failing

to internalize the benefits of their decision.28

         In this section, we endogenize the behavior of the electorate in order to better un-
    28
    We interpret the term ‘social optimum’ loosely as a reflection of the median voter’s preference; this is
violated if the average preference is different to the median preference, or if voters do not have sufficient
information to determine the socially optimal position.



                                                     24
derstand the dynamics of politicians’ decisions. It is useful to anchor our analysis of

voter behavior within the framework of established political agency models in which the

electorate is the principal and elected officials are agents who enact legislation on their

behalf.29 Informational problems can arise if politicians can hide effort or motives. We

consider two general types of models that align with our main results: (i) ‘pure’ moral

hazard in which all politicians maximize private rents; and (ii) moral hazard with ad-

verse selection, in which bad politicians maximize private rents and good politicians enact

voters’ preferred policies. We propose an empirical test of theoretical implications to

determine which model more closely fits the data.


7.1      Pure moral hazard

The ‘first generation’ political agency models focus on moral hazard as the defining agency

problem (Barro, 1973; Ferejohn, 1986). In these, self-serving politicians seek to maximize

rents. Voters know that all politicians are self-serving, but they do not perfectly observe

the rents that accrue to politicians in office nor the actions that they take. In equilibrium,

elections partially constrain rent-seeking in the period before an election as politicians

value future rent-seeking opportunities.30

       The implications of this approach in our setting are straightforward. First, it is con-

sistent with our main result that politicians vote in their self-interest. Second, as voters

are aware that all politicians are self-serving, they are therefore indifferent between in-

cumbents and challengers. This implies that a politician’s equilibrium legislative record

will not affect her reelection probability.


7.2      Moral hazard with politician types

The modern workhorse political agency model presented in Besley (2006) combines el-

ements of moral hazard from first generation political agency models with elements of

models that allow for different politician types. In these, elections serve the twin purposes

of restraining politician behavior, as above, and selecting ‘good’ politicians who care more
  29
    See Besley (2006) for an in-depth account of these models.
  30
    Elections only partially constrain politicians as voters must permit a level of rent-seeking that prevents
politicians from plundering all public resources immediately.


                                                     25
about voter welfare. In chasing private rents, ‘bad’ politicians can also mimic good ones in

order to disguise their type to the electorate.31 Below, we briefly describe a basic version

of the model in order to consider its implications in our setting.


Environment

Consider two time periods t ∈ {1, 2} in which N politicians of type i ∈ {g, b} either vote

against or in favor of conscription. This decision is represented by Vjt ∈ {0, 1}, where

j ∈ {1, 2, . . . N } denotes an individual politician. We define type g as ‘good’ politicians

for whom the weight placed on private (non-ideological) returns to legislative voting is

zero, and type b as ‘bad’ politicians for whom this weight is strictly positive. Voters do

not observe these types.

  The state of the world St ∈ {0, 1} determines which policy is preferred by voters. If
PN Ajt
 j=1 N > 0.5, where                   
                                      
                                      1 if Vjt = St
                                      
                               Ajt =
                                      
                                      0 otherwise,
                                      

then voters receive a payoff ∆; otherwise their payoff is zero. All politicians get a payoff

E from being in office—this could reflect ‘ego rents’ (Rogoff, 1990) or other material gains
                                                                     Ajt
from office. Good politicians receive a payoff of E + (∆ | N
                                                              P
                                                                 j=1 N > 0.5), and always

choose Vjt = St . Bad politicians receive a private benefit of rt ∈ (0, R̄) from choosing

a policy Vjt = (1 − St ), where rt is drawn independently from a distribution with a

conditional density function G(r). The mean value of rt is µ, and we have shown in our

main results above that R̄ > β(µ + E), where β is a discount factor. In other words, rt

can be sufficiently large that bad politicians choose policies that do not align with voter

preferences.

      The timing of the game is as follows. Nature determines the type of politician and the

state of the world at the beginning. Once in office, politicians observe the draw r1 and

select Vjt (St , i). Voters observe only Vjt and their own payoff, and then decide whether

or not to reelect the incumbent. Following the election, politicians receive a new draw r2 ,
 31
      This is not possible in pure adverse selection models.



                                                      26
and Period 2 decisions are made. The game ends once Period 2 payoffs are realized.


Equilibrium

We solve for a perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which politicians behave optimally in each

period given the reelection rule that voters put in place. Voters update their beliefs using

Bayes rule.

   In Period 2, every type of politician chooses her short term optimal decision without

considering the electoral implications, i.e., Vj2 (S2 , g) = S2 and Vj2 (S2 , b) = (1 − S2 ). In

Period 1, good politicians choose Vj1 (S1 , g) = S1 . The more interesting problem concerns

the bad politician, who must weight the value of her private benefit against the present

value of mimicking a good politician in order to receive rents in the second period. Let

λ represent the probability that a bad politician mimics a good one in Period 1. Voters’

belief that a politician is good conditional on observing Vj1 (S1 , i) = S1 is:

                                              π
                                   Π=                 ≥ π.
                                         π + (1 − π)λ

This implies that a politician can always improve their reputation Π by voting as would a

good type. If voters are retrospective—that is, if they observe and learn from legislative

voting—then politicians who choose Vjt = S1 are reelected, and those who choose Vjt =

(1 − S1 ) are not reelected as they are bad types for certain and will yield voters a zero

payoff in Period 2.

   The optimal Period 1 decision for a bad politician is determined by the relative value of

the private rent r1 against the value of disguising her type and winning reelection, which

is β(µ + E). Thus, the probability that a bad politician takes the action preferred by

voters is

                                      λ = G(β(µ + E)).

Proposition 1.

(i) Good politicians always choose Vjt (S, g) = St .

(ii) Bad politicians always choose Vj2 (S2 , b) = (1 − S2 ) in Period 2.



                                              27
(iii) Bad politicians will choose Vj1 (S1 , b) = S1 in Period 1 if they earn sufficiently small

private rents r1 < r∗ ≡ β(µ + E) from voting against the electorate’s preferred policy.

(iv) All politicians who choose Vj1 (S1 , i) = S1 in Period 1 are reelected.

       Bad politicians will therefore select Vjt = (1 − St ) in Period 1 if they earn sufficiently

large private rents r1 > r∗ ; otherwise they will mimic good politicians in order to survive

to the second period. Elections can therefore discipline politicians to an extent, but they

are still an imperfect mechanism as bad politicians can take actions to disguise their type.


Conscription and heterogeneous rent shocks                         Allow the private rent shock to be

characterized as follows: one subgroup of politicians receive r1h and another receives r1l ,

where r1h > r1l . This implies that there is an exogenous difference in r1 between politicians

that cuts across both good and bad types. Good types select Vj1 (S1 , g) = S1 irrespective of

r1 , and are reelected. If r1h > r1l > β(µ+E), then all bad types choose Vj1 (S1 , b) = (1−S1 )

and are not reelected. Similarly, if β(µ + E) > r1h > r1l , then all bad types choose

Vj1 (S1 , b) = S1 and are reelected. However, if r1h > β(µ + E) > r1l , then bad types with

r1h select Vj1 (S1 , b | r1h ) = (1 − S1 ) and are not reelected, while bad types with r1l select

Vj1 (S1 , b | r1l ) = S1 and are reelected. With heterogeneous rent shocks, therefore, there

exists an equilibrium in which some bad types pursue private rents and are voted out of

office, while other bad types mimic good types and survive to Period 2 because their rent

shock r1l is worth less than than the present value of the second period returns.

       Applying this logic to the case of conscription votes, we can interpret having a draft-

eligible son as a source of heterogeneity in the private rent shock. For example, consider

the case in which conscription is broadly unpopular with voters, i.e., S1 = 0. Bad types

without draft-eligible sons observe r1h > β(µ + E), meaning that their private benefit of

voting in favor of conscription exceeds the present value of survival to Period 2.32 However,

bad types with draft-eligible sons observe r1l < β(µ + E), and instead mimic good types by

choosing Vj1 (0, b | r1l ) = 0 and winning reelection. The draft eligibility ‘shock’ introduces

an exogenous wedge between r1l and r1h . Provided that r1h > β(µ+E) > r1l , bad politicians
  32
    Private benefits in this case could stem from an ideological disposition, from national party pressure, or
from lobby group or special interest pressure. In effect, any motive that is distinct from voters’ preferences.



                                                      28
with draft-age sons will oppose the draft, improve their reputation with voters, and survive

to Period 2. Conversely, if conscription is popular with voters, i.e., S1 = 1, then the draft

eligibility shock implies that politicians with draft age sons face r1h and vote against

constituents’ wishes, thereby revealing their true type and losing reelection.

Corollary 1. If S1 = 0 and r1h > β(µ + E) > r1l , then politicians with draft-age sons will

vote against conscription and win reelection. If S1 = 1 and r1h > β(µ + E) > r1l , then

politicians with draft-age sons will vote against conscription and lose reelection.


7.3   Testing implications

To determine which of these interpretations aligns better with the data, we examine the

electoral outcomes of legislators following Congresses in which they voted on draft-related

measures. In our main test, this amounts to replacing the outcome variable in equation (4)

with an indicator equal to 1 if the legislator wins their next election. Our main identifi-

cation assumption is that the observed relationship between having a draft age son and

electoral outcomes operates through the channel of conscription votes. In the nomencla-

ture of instrumental variables, we have observed in the main empirical section that the

first stage is significant. What we cannot declare with as much confidence is that the

exclusion restriction is valid. Politicians with draft-eligible sons may be more (or less)

electable after congresses that contained draft votes for reasons other than their voting

behavior if, for example, draft-eligible sons had a distinct influence in campaigning. We

proceed with this caveat in mind.


Draft popularity     Before conducting this analysis, we must first establish how aggregate

public support for the draft trends over the duration of our sample. Nationally represen-

tative data on public support for the draft is available from surveys administered by the

Roper Center’s Public Opinion Archive in 1945, 1952, 1969, 1980, 1981, 1985, and 2003.

These are analyzed by Fordham (2016), who documents a steady, steep decline in support

for the draft from around 70% in 1945 to around 20% at the outset of the Iraq War in




                                             29
2003.33 The author’s principal explanation for the decline in support relates to military

technology: public support for the draft is a function of its necessity to win the war. As

military conflict became more capital intensive over time, the importance of conscription

as means of ensuring victory waned. This suggests that public support for conscription is

also likely to be declining from World War I to World War II, although we can not verify

this in the absence of polling data. A second factor relates to the salience of military ca-

sualties. Karol and Miguel (2007) provide evidence that home-state casualties in the Iraq

war reduced the vote share for George W. Bush between the 2000 and 2004 presidential

elections. It is thus plausible that the more fatalities reported during draft-era wars, the

more unpopular is the draft itself. Turning to data presented in Table 4, we can calculate

U.S. fatalities per draftee for each conflict: 0.018 in World War 1, 0.029 in World War

II, and 0.024 in the Cold War theaters. Given the proliferation of mass media over this

period, it is reasonable to assign a higher weight to latter figures, as information on those

fatalities is more likely to proliferate among voters.

       Taken together, these facts indicate that voter support for the draft exhibits a down-

ward secular trend from World War I to the Cold War conflicts. We can shed light on this

interpretation by examining how senators vote in election years over time. Senators serve

six-year terms with staggered elections every two years. This feature allows us to control

for vote fixed effects by exploiting the fact that only one third of senators can face an

election year at any moment in time. In Table 13, we present evidence that senators who

are up for election are (weakly) more likely to vote in favor of the draft during World War

I, and less likely to vote for the draft during World War II and the Cold War conflicts.

The evidence is similar whether we use our main outcome of pro-draft votes or the hawks

and doves outcome. The results are significant only in the regression using hawks and

doves votes and including legislator fixed effects (Column 4).


Election Outcomes To test the implications of the model, we examine whether or not

legislators with draft-eligible sons are more likely to be reelected over time in our sample.
  33
    Clifford and Spencer (1986) note that support for conscription was substantially lower at the beginning
of World War II than in 1945. In March 1940, 20 months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, 98.4% of
Americans opposed going to war against Germany, reflecting a “general desire not to repeat the mistakes
of 1917/18” (pp. 8). This suggests that the trend is not strictly declining at all points in time.


                                                    30
To do this, we simply run the following specification for each of the main periods (World

War I, World War II and the Cold War) as follows:


  Eiscj = αi + vvcj + kivcj + γ1 sonivcj + γ2 draf tivcj + γ3 draf t sonivcj + ψXivcj + isvcj ,

                                                                                              (6)


where Eiscj measures election outcomes for legislator i in state s following congressional

session c in chamber j, and c ∈ {64, 65, 66} denotes World War I; c ∈ {76, 77, 78, 79}

denotes World War II; and c ∈ {82, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93} denotes the Cold War. The

variable draf t sonivcj indicates that the legislator has a draft-eligible son in vote v, which

is contained in congressional session c in chamber j. The vector Xivcj represents controls

for party, house or senate, terms in office, age, and age squared. The election outcome

Eiscj is either a binary variable indicating that legislator i was reelected or a variable

representing their margin of victory in the following election (which ranges from -1 to 1).

Our main specification does not include legislator fixed effects, as the outcome variables

now vary at the level of a legislator-term rather than a legislator-vote.

   We test the following implications from the political-agency models described above:


  1. Pure moral hazard. In the pure moral hazard model with only bad types, voters

      do not learn from legislative behavior. The draf t son variables will have no effect

      on a legislator’s subsequent election performance, i.e., γ3 = 0, ∀ c.

  2. Moral hazard with politician types. In the moral hazard model with politician

      types, voters do learn from legislative behavior. The draf t son variable will have a

      positive impact on election performance if St = 0 is state of the world and a negative

      impact if St = 1 is the state of the world. If St is declining over time, the empirical

      implication becomes (γ̂3 | 1{W orld W ar I}) < (γ̂3 | 1{W orld W ar II}) < (γ̂3 |

      1{Cold W ar})


   In the second implication, we treat the draf t soniv variable as an exogenous wedge

between r1l and r1h . All bad politicians observe a private rent shock that we do not observe,

but those with draft-eligible sons receive a different net rent shock once they take into


                                               31
account their additional private costs of conscription. This difference between r1l and r1h

is observed as draf t soniv .


7.4      Results

We present the results of this exercise in Figure 7 and in Appendix Tables A7 to A9. The

outcome variable is equal to 1 if the legislator won reelection to the following congressional

session and equal to 0 if the legislator lost reelection to the following congressional session.

It is not defined for legislators who do not contest the following election. Having a draft-

age son is negatively associated with reelection during World War I and World War II. All

six point estimates (that is, for models that cumulatively include fixed effects for number

of children, state, and roll call vote) are negative. In the first model using the WWI

sample, the point estimate is −0.1676 (p < 0.05). In the other five models, the point

estimate is around −6 to −7 percentage points, and is marginally significant (p < 0.10)

in two cases, and not significant in three. The mean probability of reelection conditional

on contesting the election is 0.79 in WWI and 0.84 in WWII.

       By contrast, all three point estimates on the Cold War sample are in the region of

+1.5 percentage points, although none are statistically distinguishable from zero. The

mean probability of reelection conditional on contesting is 0.89.34 We show in Appendix

Tables A13 to A15 that these differences are not driven by differences in the “first stage”

relationship between having a draft-age son and pro-draft voting, which is negative and

significant during both World War I and the Cold War.


7.5      Discussion

These findings suggest that conscription became more unpopular with voters over time;

and that legislators with draft-age sons became increasingly more likely to win reelection.

Taken together, they provide suggestive evidence in support of the model’s implications

that bad politicians pool their legislative votes with good types when the payoff from
  34
     In Appendix Figure A3 and Tables A10 to A12 we present analogous results where the outcome variable
is the next election margin of victory, ranging from −1 to 1. The results follow a similar pattern, with all
point estimates in the Cold War sample greater than the point estimates in the WWI sample. Model 1 in
the WWII sample is something of an anomaly, where the point estimate is +0.05 (p > 0.10).

unpopular votes is (exogenously) lower.

       An interesting question to consider is why some politicians still vote in favor of con-

scription when it is broadly unpopular. Our model and results imply that the control

group of otherwise identical legislators who voted in favor of conscription are deriving

utility from their vote through channels other than voter preferences. Linking back to

Section 2, these could be party career concerns (Pit ), ideology (Fi ), or other unobserved

private benefits (Rit ). In Table 14, we provide some evidence in support of party career

concerns as a partial explanation. We add to our baseline specification an indicator that

is equal to 1 if the president is from the same party as a given legislator. With legislator

fixed effects, this is identified off the switch from Lyndon B. Johnson to Richard Nixon in

1968. With or without fixed effects, this variable has a strong positive association with

pro-draft voting.

       This finding is supported by narrative accounts of Nixon’s approach to conscription

before and after his election as president. Fordham (2016, p. 29) notes that while there

were Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the debate over ending the draft, Nixon

“campaigned on a promise to put a stop to it, but repeatedly asked for its extension as

president.”35 Nixon’s turn was particularly evident at the time of the Hatfield-Goldwater

amendment to raise the pay of the military in 1970. The measure was an explicit attempt

to end the draft by attracting a sufficient number of volunteers to render it obsolete within

a year. The New York Times wrote at the time:

         President Nixon campaigned in favor of a volunteer army in 1968 and has

         supported the concept time and again since he became President. But he

         opposed the Hatfield-Goldwater amendment on the grounds that it would be

         too expensive and that the draft was essential as long as the United States

         maintained a sizable force in Southeast Asia.36

That legislative voting reflects this pattern is reassuring. More evidence on this motive

can be gleaned from newspaper reports at the other end of our sample period. Under
  35
     Similarly, Fordham notes that “Ronald Reagan criticized Jimmy Carter’s decision to restore draft
registration during his 1980 presidential campaign, but then decided to continue registration after he
became president.”

the heading “Ban Two Draft Opponents — Democrats in Cleveland Declare Gordon and

Crosser ‘Done’,” The New York Times reported the following in April 1917:

           Indignant at the spectacle of two Congressman from Cleveland openly op-

           posing President Wilson’s war policies, the leaders of the local Democratic

           organization today declared William Gordon and Robert Crosser “done.” The

           two Congressmen were practically read out of the Democratic Party by the

           declaration that the political organization of which Secretary of War Baker is

           head will never again support either man for nomination or election.37

These accounts, coupled with our findings above, suggest that pro-draft voting in the U.S.

Congress appears to stem at least in part from national party edicts. This does not rule out

important roles for other motives noted above: other common arguments that repeatedly

appear in archival reports relate to the technological efficiency of conscription relative to

volunteer armies, and also to a distributional motive whereby high-income special interests

favor conscription ahead of a war tax. This latter motive aligns well with the consistent

opposition to conscription demonstrated by organized labor groups throughout the 20th

century.

         In summary, we find evidence supporting a model of political agency that combines

aspects of moral hazard and adverse selection. When conscription is relatively popular,

voters punish legislators with draft-eligible sons; when it is relatively unpopular, voters

are more likely to reward them.



8         Conclusion

In this paper, we test the hypothesis that political agency problems contribute to violent

conflict: political leaders who do not internalize the costs of war are more likely to vote

in favor of it. We demonstrate this by compiling data on the voting behavior and family

compositions of over 3,300 legislators who served in the U.S. Congress during the four

conscription era wars of the 20th century. We find that, (i) relative to those with daughters
    37

of comparable age, legislators with sons who are eligible to be drafted are around 10-17%

less likely to vote for conscription; (ii) legislators increase their support for the draft by

a quarter when their sons cross the upper age threshold; and (iii) legislators with draft-

eligible sons are more likely to win reelection when the draft is less popular.

   We interpret these results within the framework of a political agency model that com-

bines aspects of moral hazard and adverse selection. Good politicians reflect voters’ con-

cerns and are reelected; bad politicians can choose between pooling with good ones in

order to win reelection, or voting against the electorate’s preference in order to pursue

private rents. In our set up, having a draft-eligible son introduces exogenous variation in

the private benefits of conscription for bad politicians. Consistent with this model, we

show that politicians with draft-eligible sons are more likely to be reelected when the draft

is broadly unpopular. This indicates that some bad politicians pool their votes with good

ones in order to win reelection.

   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify the impact of changing

private incentives on legislative voting with individual fixed effects. This implies that

politicians are malleable, which itself has potentially interesting implications beyond the

issue of conscription. Exploring private incentives of legislators in other policy domains

remains a fruitful avenue for future research. Our results also suggest that representative

democracy may better enhance social welfare when voters are aware of legislators’ pri-

vate incentives, and when they vote often enough to impose accountability on important

legislative decisions.
