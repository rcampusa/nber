       A network/search     view of international    trade in differentiated products is proposed.   It is

shown that this view can explain the importance of ethnic and extended family ties in trade, the

success of diversified   trading intermediaries     such as Japan’s sogo shosha, and the ubiquity of

government   export promotion policies such as subsidized trade missions.

I.   Introduction

          It is well known that very few manufactured                 (as opposed to primary)         commodities

are traded on organized exchanges.               It is also well understood      that the heterogeneity         of

manufactures      along the dimensions          of both characteristics      and quality interferes       with the

ability of their prices to signal relative scarcity.              I claim that this uninformativeness           of

prices prevents     “globally scanning”         traders from substituting        for organized exchanges in

mat thing international         buyers and sellers of differentiated         products.     Instead     connections

between sellers and buyers are made through                   a search process that because of its costliness

does not proceed until the best match is achieved.                  This search is strongly       conditioned        by

proximity     and preexisting      “ties” and restits        in trading   networks     rather than “markets”.         1

          This view helps us to understand            a puzzling relationship         between the volume of

trade and distance between trading partners                  that appears once one extends the sample of

countries    in a gravity model beyond the OECD to a larger set of 63 countries                        examined       by

Frankel and co-authors          in a series of papers on trading          blocs (e.g., Frankel,      Stein, and Wei

1993).    Looking across commodities,            one does not observe a more negative impact of

distance between trading          partners    on the volume of trade as transportation               costs increase

as a percentage     of value,     The explanation        of this puzzle offered by the network/search

view of trade is that, due to their heterogeneity,               low transport       cost commodities     are traded

through     networks   while high transport         cost commodities       either have organized exchanges

or reference prices that facilitate          international     commodity     arbitrage. z This explanation            is


lPart of the cost of establishing a connection between a seller and a buyer may be mutual
adaptation:    the seller refines his product to better suit the preferences of the buyer and the
buyer (especially if a firm rather than an ultimate consumer) adapts his specifications to
the capabilities of the seller (see Egan and Mody 1992). Gereffi (1994) has especially
emphasized the role of large first-world buyers in identifying and “shaping” third-world
sellers. Within a given industry (e.g., footwear) one can imagine a continuum from sellers
producing a completely specified product and then finding buyers to sellers finding buyers
and then producing a product tailored to their specifications.      The end result in terms of
the impact of distance and “ties” on trade is the same.
zIn passing we may note that the network view helps us to understand the high proportion
of international  trade that is int rafirm: the connections between sellers and buyers are
“built -in”. Brtinard (1993) finds for her sample of 64 industries that for the United States

macro level by examining             world trade flows, the purpose of the present paper is to explore

the consequences         of this view at a micro level by examining              trade behavior,          institutions,

and policies in a partial          equilibrium    context.    The next section contrasts            the

network/search         view with the standard          monopolistic       competition    approach         to trade in

differentiated       products.      Section III sets up a simple partial equilibrium                search model based

on models used in labor economics.                Sections IV-VI respectively           show how this search

model can help us to understand              the role of “social capital” in international                trade, the

viability     of general trading      companies     such as Japan’s        sogo shosha, and the rationale             for

ubiquitous      export promotion        policies such as subsidized          trade missions.        The concluding

section suggests areas for further empirical              and theoretical       research.



II.   The network/search            view vmns     the international        market model of trade in

differentiated products

            In the international      trade literature    there are two different models of product

differentiation.       In the “ided product”        model, products         vary because they combine certain

underl~ng       characteristics      in different bundles and each user (consumer               or producer)         has

some different best combination             in mind.     In the “love-of-variety”           model, different product

varieties     enter symmetrically       into a CES utility or production            function    so that the

consumer or producer             uses many different varieties        simultaneously        rather than choosing the

one that is closest to her ideal.          The ideal product       model is the only one that I will use here

(for an example of its direct application              to international      trade data see Feenstra           1988).

        The standard         approach     to modeling international          trade in differentiated          products      is

to assume monopolistic            competition    equilibrium.     An implicit      assumption        of the


the share of both imports           and exports accounted        for by intrafirm       transfers     is roughly equal
to one-quarter.
                                                                                                                           3


monopolistic      competition      model as it has been applied to international               trade is that any

supplier, foreign or domestic,         is automatically       matched     to the buyer(s)      to whose ideal(s) its

product is closest (see, e.g., Helpman           1981), s In terms of Figure la, all sellers and buyers

are connected      to an abstract     “international       market”,    a black box that serves to costlessly

mat ch buyers to sellers.         Perhaps   a fictitious    market is a serviceable      assumption       for trade

within a country,      where one can imagine that buyers are informed                  at nominal       cost of all

available varieties      and their characteristics         and sellers are well aware of how to reach the

buyers that form their particular           market niches,       It is, I argue, not serviceable        for

international     trade, where buying agents for consumer goods distributors                     and firms seeking

inputs to production         processes incur considerable        costs in discovering       the foreign varieties

available     and their characteristics,     as well as the capabilities        oft he suppliers     of these

varieties,    and sellers incur considerable       costs in finding buying agents or intermediate                goods

demanders       that are good matches for the variety they have to offer. As Swedish Trade

Council export consultant          Kent Goldmam            (quoted in Nothdurft      1992, p. 32) stated of his

clients that are marginal         or failed exporters,      “Sometimes      their product      isn’t right for the

market,      or the country    they chose was not a good fit, or their approach                or agents are not

right .“ International        trade in differentiated      products,    I argue, is more appropriately

described by Figure lb, where buyers and sellers become individually                        connected     as the end

product      of a search process and may be ignorant            of many buyers or sellers to which they

are not connected.

          While the situation       depicted in Figure lb might typically            be described as an

“unorganized      market”,     I prefer to use the term “network”.            I eschew the term “market”              to

highlight     the fact that trading     behavior in Figure lb is qualitatively           different than trading

behavior in Figure la and not just an approximation                    to it. In particular,     the “anonymity”


sThis automatic matching is of course             a consequence of the        assumption of perfect
information.     One can interpret what         I present here and in         Rauch (1996) as evidence that
the assumption of perfect information            is more damaging to          our ability to understand trade
in differentiated products than to our          ability to understand         trade in homogeneous products.
                                                                                                                          4


characteristic     of market transactions        permits   commodity      arbitrage     between distant         and

unrelated     parties while net works are distinguished        by the import ante of personal cent acts

that are facilitated      by proximity      and common language.          I choose the term “network”                to

indicate     an affinity with the branch of sociology called “network                 analysis”;    a concrete

example of this affinity will be given in section IV below.                I argue below that the change to

a network/search        perspective      allows one to understand      phenomena        that cannot be

understood       within the fictitious     international   market framework:           the importance        of “ties”

(e.g., ethnic, extended      family) in trade, the success of diversified             trading    intermediaries

such as Japan’s       sogo shosha, and the ubiquity        of government      export promotion            policies

such as subsidized       trade missions.      Clearly other potential      explanations         exist for all of these

phenomena,       some of which undoubtedly           account for part of what we observe, yet I hope to

demonstrate       that the network/search         view can nevertheless     provide new insight into all of

them.



III.    A partial equilibritun model of search and international              trade in differentiated

products

           The purpose of this section is to create a partial equilibrium               model of international

trade in differentiated      products     that will serve to build intuition      concerning         the qualitative

effects of social capital,    sogo shosha, and spillovers discussed in sections IV, V, and VI,

respectively.      The model is analogous to models in labor economics where workers search

for the jobs that best match their abilities. q It admits of a graphical                  solution    that is

similar to a “reservation      match”,

           Let us assume that a firm develops its variety of a differentiated                   product   to suit a

niche in its home market.         (The fact that this assumption          seems natural         already indicates




lSimilarly, Okun (1981, Chapter 4) argued that what he called “customer markets” (as
opposed to “auction markets”) had many similarities to labor markets.   His concern was
with “price stickiness” and macroeconomic fluctuations rather than international  trade.
                                                                                                                     5


an incomplete        information     structure   where information     about buyers is mediated        by

distance.)     The firm then tries to find foreign buyers for this variety,            as opposed to

developing      a new vanet y for whatever         foreign buyers it finds.      The real world actually

displays a mixture          of both of these kinds of behavior.      Nothdurft     (1992, p. 63) notes that,

“A recent European           Commission     study, for example, found that even among successful

frequent     exporters,     only half of the firms surveyed tailored products         to market

specifications.     ”

           Within    an industry,     each firm produces its variety under conditions           of locally

constant     unit cost.     As is well known, globally constant        unit cost would lead to customized

production,       eliminating    the gains from trade that result from consumers           or producers      being

able to purchase products           closer to their ideals (i. e., the gains from trade not based on

aut arky cost differentials).         Thus unit cost must be decreasing       at sufficiently     small levels of

output,      The purpose of the locally constant          unit cost assumption      is to prevent firms’

average costs from changing when they expand into foreign markets,                     so that their profits

horn domestic        sales are also unchanged.

          The firm searches for the foreign buyer whose preferences                among various product

characteristics      and quality best match the variety it has to offer, Its problem is

complicated       by the fact that it can search across many countries             (even many ports of

entry),    each of which in general will differ regarding          search costs per unit time and

regarding     how “close” and cost competitive            the closest domestic substitutes      are. I will

simplify this problem by collapsing all the dimensions               along which products       can vary into

one, and all the countries          (ports of entry) into one. I thus assume there is a one-to-one

correspondence          between potential    product   vaneties   and points on the real line, that there is

a known distribution          of buyers F(x) along the real line, and that search takes place in

discrete time at a constant          cost c per period.     Foreign competitors     are assumed to all

charge the same price so that the firms that are most competitive                   with the searching firm

are always the two that produce the varieties               that are closest to its variety on the real line.
                                                                                                                     6


           Figure 2 shows the portion of the red line where the searching                 firm’s variety,

denoted by X*, and those of its closest foreign competitors,                denoted by xl and X2, are

located.     The vertical   dimension     of the figure shows the potential        gains from trade or

surplus generated     by a match between the searching firm and a buyer as a function                       of the

latter’s ideal product.      The graph implicitly      assumes that buyers do not differ along any

dimension     other than ideal product;       e.g., they are all the same size. If all three supplier

firms are charging the same price then obviously any potential                  buyer that is aware of all

three will make its purchase from the firm that is producing                  the variety     closest to its ideal

product.     For the time being let us assume not only that both foreign competitors                     are

charging the same price, but that the searching firm’s unit cost is the same as that price.

In this case potential      gains from trade clearly fall to zero at x* - (x* - xl)/2              and at

x* + (X2 - x*)/2.      The surplus also clearly declines when the buyer is getting closer to the

nearest competitor       and farther from the searching firm.             Bet ween x* and (xl + x2)/2 the

buyer gets farther from both the searching firm and its nearest competitor                      as its ideal type

moves to the right; I assume that surplus declines monotonically                  in this region so that

there is a unique mtimum          at x*.

           The remaining    assumptions     follow the standard         search model of labor economics

(see, e.g., Sargent 1987, Chapter         2). In particular,        buyers are passive’ (only sellers search)

and there is no learning in the sense that previous searches offer no guidance as to “where”

to search next.     In any period the firm can accept its current match forever or reject it and

search again for a new buyer with which it can match next period, so that acceptance                            of

the match yields m(x)/(1 - d), where b is the firm’s discount factor.                 I assume that the

firm’s per period profit from the match,          fix), is an increasing       function     of the realizable

surplus (see Figure 3). Let V(xt) be the expected value of X~_Ofit~x)

            The solution for V(xt ) is given by the heavy line plotted         in Figure 3. It is implicit

in Figure 3 that c is not so large relative to J/v(x) dF(x) that no search (no trade) is

optimal.      We see that the firm accepts any match in the interval                (x,i).     It should be noted

in passing that the situation         depicted in Figure 3, where search is profitable              (in

expect at ion), allows us to understand         the commonplace        expression     of interest     in “finding

new markets”       in the int ernat iond business press, an int crest that cannot be understood

within either the perfectly      competitive     or monopolistically      competitive         models of

international     trade.

           Let us now briefly consider the case where the given firm’s unit cost differs from the

price charged by its nearest foreign competitors.           I consider the case where its unit cost is

lower, since this is presumably         more typical of an exporting       firm; the case where its unit

cost is higher can be treated      symmetrically.      Clearly there now exist potential              gains from

trade even when the firm is matched            with buyers that are “closer” to the competition,                 and

indeed the entire plot of the surplus in Figure 2 must be shifted upwards,                       raising the plot of

~xt)/(l      - b) in Figure 3 as well. But we might expect J~v(x)dF(x)                  - c to increase more

because c remains constant,        paradoxically    narrowing   the range of acceptable             matches     even

though the range of matches         that yield positive surplus has widened.                 The intuition    is that

the profit from a given match has increased relative to the cost of search, thereby making

firms more willing to reject bad matches.



IV.       Search and social capital

           The work of Putnam      (1993) has led to a surge of interest        in the concept of “social

capital”     (now two decades old), which he describes (1994) as “features of social

organizations,     such as networks,     norms, and trust, that facilitate          coordination      and

cooperation      for mutual   benefit. ” Here I will use the concept to refer to what sociologists

call “ties” that are used to exchange information.           The effects of such ties have been
                                                                                                                                  8


extensively      studied in connection         with job search, for which Montgomery                (1991, p. 1408)

summarizes       the evidence from the literature            with the stat ement that “approximately                   50

percent of all workers cmrently           employed found their jobs through                friends and relatives. ”

            While there is a fairly rich anecdotal           and descriptive     literature     on the role of

extended      family and ethnic ties in international             trade, to my knowledge Gould (1994) has

done the only econometric           study quantifying          some of these effects.      He finds that

immigration       to the United States increases U. S. bilateral               trade with the immigrants’

countries     of origin, that this “immigrant-link              effect” is stronger for U. S. exports than for

U. S. imports,      and that the effect on exports exhausts               itself for a much smaller number               of

immigrants       than does the effect on imports,              Taken together     these results indicate         that the

most important        effect of immigration        on trade is through         the establishment         of business

contacts,     with a secondary       effect through increased        U. S. preferences        for goods produced            in

the country      of origin,     Gould also notes (p. 310) that when he disaggregates                     total trade into

trade in consumer and producer goods, “The immigrant                         information      variable     does not

appear to be important           in the producer imports          equation. ” His explanation             of this finding

is completely      consistent    with my argument           in this paper:     “Because producer           goods tend to

be the least differentiated         products    (for instance,     scrap metal) across countries,             trade flows

in these products      may not benefit much from country-specific                   information.     ”

            The anecdotal     and descriptive     literature     on international     trade has mainly

emphasized       how business contacts         established      through     ethnic or extended      family ties can

resolve the problem of trust in international                transactions     (e.g., Curtin     1984).     Yet clearly

such ties can also be important           as a source of information           about potential      buyers (or

sellers).     Kotkin (1992) states that “Chinese entrepreneurs                  remain, in essence, arbitrageurs,

their widespread       dispersion    a critical means of identifying           prime business opportunities”                (p,

169) and “most of Hong Kong’s Indian businesses--from                         the tiny two-man           operation    to the

giant conglomerate--fit          the classical mold, with extended             families providing         the linkages

between various national          markets”      (p. 219).      A good example of how the Hong Kong Indian
                                                                                                                       9


net work works to identify buyers is the following story (p. 201):

           Like millions of other Indian emigrants, [Gulu] Lalvani never went home.
           Shortly after arriving in Leeds, he met a pair of Jewish brothers named
           Rosenbaum who were selling costume jewelry and seemed to be making good
           money at it. Intrigued, Gulu and his brother Pratap took out a loan and
           bought some ersatz pearl necklaces through family contacts in Hong Kong,
           which they sold to the Rosenbaums at a handsome profit. Soon the Lalvanis
           were selling to the Jewish wholesalers down in London, taking in orders of up
           to 60,000 pounds at a single swoop.
In short, cross-border     ties are important      not only as a foundation        for trust but also as a

source of free information:      in terms of Figure 3, one will accept a buyer about which one is

informed for free rather than search if the buyer lies in the interval               (x,X). On the other

hand, if all firms are matched         automatically      to their ideal buyers as in the monopolistic

competition     model, than free information           supplied through    ties is unimportant.

           The network/search    view of international         trade in differentiated      products      also has

implications    for the import ante of ties within a country.           The role of such ties in promoting

information     sharing is increasingly     appreciated,      Discussing   the Sines Valley region of

Brazil, the origin of over 80 percent of the country’s footwear exports,                   Schmitz (1995, p.

21) reports that “non-economic           ties bet ween actors do seem to play a major role.                Some are

to do with ethnicity     (being of German descent);           others with geography        (being local); or

kinship. ” The “diffusion of information          and ideas” between these tied entrepreneurs

“occurs not only in business transactions,             but also at social gatherings       of friends, family,

sports club, neighborhood       or church” (p. 12). Investigators          of industrial     districts    such as

Schmitz have mainly been interested           in sharing of technological       information,         while the

importance     of ties for marketing     has been relatively      overlooked.    In particular,       the benefits

of exchange of information      concerning foreign buyers emerge clearly from the model of the

previous section.     Consider two firms with equal unit costs whose entrepreneurs                       are “tied”.

One firm is identified    by x* in Figure 3 and the other firm lies anywhere outside the

interval    [xl ,X2], For example, firm 1 may specialize in women’s shoes while firm 2

specializes in men’s shoes.      Under these circumstances          the acceptance       intervals     of the two
                                                                                                                      10


firms will not overlap.       If firm l'sentrepreneur       then contacts    aforeign     buyer who turns out

to be more interested       in men’s than women’s shoes, he will be willing to pass this

information      on to firm 2‘s entrepreneur,       and vice-versa. H In effect, then, in every period

each firm gets two independent             draws from the distribution      F(x) rather than one, until one

firm accepts a match.        It follows that their “tie” raises V(xt) for both firms.           Moreover,

adding ties can only raise V(xt) still further.          Indeed, it is possible that a

country -industr y’s stock of social capital as I have defined it here could make the

difference between its participation           and non-participation     in international     trade:     it could

be that no firm will find a search for foreign buyers worthwhile               on its own, but many firms

will find this search worthwhile           if they search mutually.

           Matters   become more complex when the firm to which firm x* is tied lies within the

interval     [X1,X2]. This cotid be a common occurence when a country is densely supplied in

a particular    part of characteristics       space, i.e., when products    with a particular     constellation

of characteristics     are a regional/national      specidt y (e.g., “stout”    beers from Ireland).         In

this case the acceptance       intervals    of the tied firms may overlap, creating         a subinterval     of

matches for which they will not share information.              Such a tie will typically       not raise V(xt)

as much as the type described in the preceding paragraph,                the exception      being when the

more “distant”       tied firm is located in a very favorable part of the distribution            and is likely

to find an acceptable      match very quickly.        This advantage     of distant     ties over “close” ties

is another     example of what Granovetter          (1973) called “the strength       of weak ties” in

connection     with job search:     ties with those who are more “distant”            from you (e. g., friends

made during your previous employment               rather than your current employment)            and with

whom your relationship        may be less intense (” weaker”) because of less frequent                 cent act can

prove more valuable because there is less overlap between the information                    they possess and



HThis could occur among the wholesalers that represent the firms rather than among the
firms themselves.   I observed this behavior in the garment district of New York City,
where wholesalers routinely referred to their competitors customers whom they thought
would be int crested in their competitors’ lines.
                                                                                                                         11



the information         you possess.



V.    Search and Sogo Shosha

            A natural     reaction    to the analysis of the previous section is that even in the absence

of social capital,       traders     (export firms) should emerge to organize “untied”               producers    in

order to take advantage              of the economies of scope that exist in the search process.

However, this line of thinking             neglects to take account of the fact that implicit            in the

notion of “tie” is familiarity           with the characteristics      and capabilities       of the agent to which

one is tied. T Thus in the employment               search context      one can recommend           one’s friend for a

job because one knows him well enough to know whether he will be a good match for the

position.

           A trading firm that wishes to capitalize              on economies of scope in the search for

foreign buyers must therefore make an initial investment                        in thorough   knowledge of its

clients.     This puts it at a cost disadvantage              relative to the client’s own search, a

disadvantage       that can ordy be overcome (if at all) by having a large enough number of

clients to generate econoties             of scope sufficient to offset this cost disadvantage.

Understanding        this benefit from size is, I believe, a first step towards understanding                    the

success of Japan’s general trading             companies,      known as sogo shosha. 8 Yoshino and Lifson

(1986, p. 7) describe sogo shosha as “large-scale                 diversified     intermediaries”    with “some

characteristics     of both vertically       integrated   firm and market”.           Of their operation    in the

late nineteenth         and early twentieth      centuries,     Yoshino and Lifson (p. 23) state:


7A wholesaler in the New York City garment district, explaining to me why he had found
referrals such a useful means of expanding his customer base, said that people who
recommend you “know what you’re about. ”
sMany other explanations for the success of the sogo shosha have been offered in the
literature.  For example, Sheard (1992) argues that the sogo shosha compensate for
Japanese capital market imperfections by implicitly insuring against default on trade
credit, a risk they can diversify through their “generality”. Here I am attempting to
identify a basis for success that can extend to any economy whether or not it shares
Japan’s characteristics,  and thus help us understand the experience of other countries that
are attempting to imitate the sogo shosha.
                                                                                                                         12


           Particularly import ant ... was the role the sogo shosha played in providing
           export opportunities for the myriad small Japanese firms in cottage industries,
           which, like their counterparts in developing countries today, faced many
           problems in trying to break into the world market. The sogo shosha fed them
           market information, helped them design products, extended credit, and, most
           import ant, developed foreign outlets for their products.

In 1975 the South Korean government                  stimulated    the creation of general trading       companies

in imitation     of the sogo shosha.         One can get some idea of the size and importance                of the

Japanese      and Korean general trading           companies from figures compiled by Lee (1987).                   In

1985, Japan’s top nine general trading               companies     handled 45 percent of Japan’s total

exports,     while Korea’s top seven general trading              companies handled     47.9 percent of all

Korean exports.         Parenthetically,       it is worth noting that Sung (1991) essentially           argues

that the dense network         of traders in Hong Kong functions           like a general trading       company

for mainland      China.    The share of Hong Kong imports from China for re-export                      in total

Chinese exports had climbed to 41.3 percent by 1989 (Table 7.6, pp. 144-5).                          Sung also

breaks down the Hong Kong re-export                  share of Chinese exports by one-digit           SITC

commodity       groupings    (Table 7.8, pp. 148- 149), and his figures show a clear tendency                   for

Hong Kong’s share to increase with the degree of product                   differentiation.       In 1987 (the last

year for which this breakdown              is available),   when the Hong-Kong        re-export     share of total

Chinese exports was only 21,9 percent, this share was 28.5 percent for manufactures                           (SITC

6-9) and 49.5 percent for machinery               (SITC 7) compared      to 10.7 percent for food and crude

materials     (SITC O-4) and 18.2 percent for the intermediately               differentiated      category of

Chemicals      (SITC 5).

           The argument      presented      in this section so far can explain only the size of the

general trading      companies,      not their diversification.      Indeed, since these economies of scope

are also available      to traders    that specialize in only one industry, g how can the general

trading     companies    compete?      At best they can ordy equal the specialized              traders in


gThe role of specialized Taiwanese shoe trading companies in matching Taiwanese
manufacturers   to foreign buyers “in accordance with the specialties of individual factories”
is well documented by Hsing (forthcoming, p. 57).
                                                                                                                                13


industry-specific      knowledge of how best to handle customs and documentation,                          liability

and other trade laws, shipping,           etc., while the specialized traders          will clearly have lower

overhead.      The answer, I believe, is that through               diversification   across industries       the

general trading      companies     can realize additional          economies of scope not available           to

specialized traders,       The following quotation          from Jameson        (1994) concerning       the

second-largest      sogo shosha is revealing in this connection:                “Mitsui, for example, formerly

divided its operations      into product-line         divisions.     ‘But when the number of divisions

reached 80, it became apparent            we were losing sight of the overall picture,’            company

President     Naohiko Kumagti        told the newspaper            Asahi.   The divisions were reorganized               into

20 headquarters       ‘to broaden horizontal       cent acts,’ he said. ” Horizontal         contacts      across

industries    may be especially useful when handling                buying as well as selling clients.          For

example,     suppose a general trading        company has as clients a firm in an intermediate                      goods

industry     that sells to producers      in a certain capital goods industry           and a firm in a final

goods industry      that purchases       the output    of this capital goods industry.         The company               can

conduct one search for foreign buyers/sellers              on behalf of both clients, until a match within

the company’s       accept ante interval     for one of the clients is found.          Overlapping        accept ante

intervals    are not a concern in this case since the clients are not in (potential)                 competition

with each other; a capital goods firm that is a good match for both clients can buy from

one and sell to the other.

           The preceding    paragraph      begs the question, if general trading           companies      make such

good economic sense, why are they not more prevalent?                       One possible explanation          is that

large, diversified trading       firms typically      cannot succeed because of the same problem                    that,

according to Granovet t er (1995, Chapter              10 and Afterword),         makes large government

employment       services ineffective:      the quality of information          possessed about the client is

inadequate     compared    to the information         possessed by the client herself or by her friends,

In the 1980s the government          of Turkey passed legislation            encouraging    the formation           of

with Turkish        manufacturers     that “frequently     heard were complaints          that FTC

representatives       abroad did not have enough knowledge of their products                  to be effective

salesmen. ” Possibly general trading companies                can ordy flourish within the East Asian

style of doing business that emphasizes              close long-term    relationships.      Jameson   (1994)

states,   “Perhaps     most fundamental        to shosha is the intimacy        and the history of business

relationships      built up over generations. ” Specialized trading firms, in contrast,               can survive

merely through        providing     a straightforward     “middleman”      service using industry-specific

knowledge of the type described above, and do not depend on economies of scope in search

to be cost-effective.

          In this connection      it is worth noting that the Korean general trading              companies

were formed by pre-existing            business groups called chaebol (Lee, pp. 3-4), largely

eliminating       the need for costly investment        in “ties”.   The sogo shosha are also affiliated

with business groups:        Imai (1989, p. 135) notes that Japanese             business groups have “a

general trading       company     at the core of the group engaged in information             exchange between

both buyers and sellers. ” However, if one investigates                further it becomes clear that Mit sti

Bussan and Mitsubishi           Shoj, the oldest and largest sogo shosha, initiated            the

diversification     of their zaibatsu (as the pre-World          War II Japanese         business groups were

called) into production         of differentiated    manufactured      goods.   Sakamoto      (1990, p. 54)

stat es that,     “The conglomerate e form of zaibatiu can be said to have been born with Mit sui

Bussan’s commercial        operations     as its midwife, ” and goes on to describe (pp. 62-63) how,

for example,      Mitsui came to dominate           Japan’s exports of cotton yarn and cloth by forging

ties with independent       spinning and weaving companies. 10 Nevertheless,                 both Mitsui and

Mitsubishi      benefited from implicit      government      subsidies during the years when they were



10T~s occurred before World war I. During the interwar years, Mitsti Bussan “had small
and medium-sized industries organize themselves and produce bicycles, woolen goods, knit
goods, and shell buttons” (Sakamoto 1990, p. 75).
                                                                                                                        15


 making their initial investments           in ties:    Yoshino and Lifson report that “The first major

 boost to [Mitsui] Bussan came in the form of the exclusive right to export the output                       of the

 richest government-owned           coal mine” (p. 11) and “The business began in shipping,                 but like

 Mitsui, Mitsubishi,      even more actively,          moved into mining in 1873 under the patronage               of

the government”        (p. 15). It may be significant         that a third sogo shosha (Suzuki) that by

the end of World War I achieved a size comparable                  to that of Mitsui and Mitsubishi

subsequently       collapsed;    according to Yoshino and Lifson (p. 19) “Suzuki did not have

access to the highly profitable         fining    ventures that Mitsui and Mitsubishi          enjoyed through

political patronage. ”

            My analysis comparing       the efficiency of search by general trading          companies      to that

of firms’ own search suggests the following tentative               conclusion.   Economies      of scope

realized by general trading         companies     dominate     the cost of “maintaining”      ties that firms

conducting      their own search do not have to bear (because they are automatically                   aware of

changes in their own product lines), but not the cost of building                 ties from the ground up.

The East Asian success with general trading                companies then reflects their governments’

willingness     to provide start-up     subsidies rather than unique cultural         attributes.    11

            General trading     companies    may be hampered       by an additional     diffictity   in realizing

economies of scope in search.          Suppose that, for any potential        company      client, there

typically     exists another firm in the same country-industry            with an overlapping        accept ante

interval.     Suppose further      that the mat ch that the general t rad.ing company identifies             for

its client act ually occurs within the intersection           of the two accept ante intervals.       It might

be possible for the other firm to free-ride             on this search and compete for the buyer’s

business, thereby      devaluing    the outcome of the search. 12 The strategy          of free-riding      might


llThe World Bank (1994, p. 112) states that, “Taiwanese LTCS [Large Trading Companies],
however, never really took off in part because government incentives to LTCS were very
modest”.
lzIn the previous section it was implicitly assumed that if this situation arose, either (1) the
firm whose search was successful is able to prevent free-riding through secrecy, a long-term
exclusive cent ract, or other means, or (2) codes of behavior embedded in the notion of a
                                                                                                                  16


dominate       the strategy     of being a general trading     company client.    Indeed, it might

dominate       the strategy     of engaging in any form of search for foreign buyers.           This issue is

taken up in full in the following section.



VI.    Search and SpiJlovers, and Policy Responses

          How much potential          exists for firms to free-ride    on the searches of other firms for

foreign buyers?           We do not know how typical it is for country-industries            to be sufficiently

densely supplied in a particular          part of characteristics     space to create overlapping

accept ante intervals.          We do know that international         trade leaves a paper trail of customs

documents        and involves movement        of goods and people in and out of international           (and

thus highly visible) seaports and airports.            (Though we have pushed aside the issue of

mutual       adaptation     between seller and buyer for this paper, it is worth noting in passing

that much of this will involve translation           of documents      and conformance       with regulations

and standards       that are easily transferred      to a competing      supplier from the same country. )

When legal means are inadequate,             free-riding   may be accomplished       by illegal means.

McDermott         (1994, p. 32) states, citing a study conducted          for the American     Society of

Industrial     Security,     that “the most common target for corporate          spies is customer     lists”.

We are also informed by Egan and Mody (1992, pp. 326-7) that, at least when more

developed country buyers are detiing with less developed country                  sellers, buyers prefer

renewable short -t erm (annual)          cent racts, rat her than long-term      contracts    that would

prevent free-riding,          In any case, my tim in this section is to show that it is much easier to

understand       the ubiquity     of certain government      policies if we think of them as responses to

the potential      for firms to free-ride    on the successful searches of other firms for foreign

buyers.

          Let us consider the case where firms in a given country-industry               find it worthwhile




“tie” prevent free-riding.
                                                                                                                  17


to engage in search for foreign buyers in the absence of potential               free-riding    but do not find

search worthwhile        in the presence of potential      free-riding.   13 One possible policy response

to this problem is to subsidize search,          Indeed, most governments         do this by, among other

things, sponsoring       trade missions.     Of twelve countries      studied by Seringhaus       and Rosson

(1990, chapter      2), only West Germany        and Austria     did not provide formal government

support for trade missions, leaving their organization              and financing to chambers        of

commerce and industry         associations    instead.    In recent years the Japanese         government   had

also withdrawn       from export promotion,       leaving this to the Federation       of Japanese

Industries,     which includes the sogo shosha.          (The other nine countries     were Australia,

Belgium,       Canada,   France, Italy, the Netherlands,       Sweden, the United Kingdom,           and the

United States.)

        Hibbert      (1985, p. 141) lists a number of areas in which trade missions can play a

positive role.     At the top of Ms list are “facilitating       market research”     and “participants

collectively     devoting more effort to market investigation”.           11 Consider also this detailed

description     of the programs    sponsored by the state-owned           French Insurance      Company     for

Foreign Trade (COFACE),           given by Nothdurft        (1992, pp. 46-47):

        To encourage SMES [small-to-medium-size       enterprises] to develop overseas
        markets, COFACE will reimburse 50 percent (more in difficult markets) of the
        costs of two individual missions by up to three company executives for as long
        as two weeks. More significant y, for an annual premium equal to 1.5 percent
        of an SME’S market exploration budget, C OF ACE will guarantee from 50 to
        60 percent of the cost of market exploration activities, up to approximate ely
        $160,000, if subsequent export income from the target market fails to cover
        R&D costs. Repayment is graduated over six years to keep pace with
        anticipated business growth. A similar program for large firms guarantees up
        to 75 percent with repayment over ten years. According to one COFACE

 IsEven if these firms find search worthwhile in the presence of free-riding, they may delay
search if there is a first-mover disadvantage.  The first mover has the obvious disadvantage
of incurring search costs, but also has the advantage of searching wit bin its own accept ante
intervti rather than (effectively) searching within the acceptance interval of another firm.
For a discussion of “excess inertia” when there is first -mover disadvantage see Farrell and
Sdoner (1986).
llAt the bottom of Hibbert’s list is “providing beneficial intra-group   exchanges and contacts
for experienced exporters”.    This suggests that another purpose of trade missions is to
substitute for social capital, or even to build social capital.
                                                                                                                     18


        official, some 6,000 firms have participated in this guarantee                  program,   and
        two-thirds have been either wholly or partly successful.

Thus it seems clear that government               support   of trade missions is a response to what is

considered inadequate        search by domestic firms, but whether it is perceived as inadequate

because of potential      free-riding     or only in light of some mercantilist         goal is not clear.

        Another     means of subsidizing          search is the creation of government        entities   intended

to function much like the general trading companies                discussed in the previous section.

Consider the following example from the Emilia-Romagna                   region of Northern        Italy,

described by Nothdurft           (1992, p. 36):

        The Service Center for the Export Development of Emilia-Romagna          Firms, or
        SVEX, was created in 1989 jointly by ERVET, the regional chamber of
        commerce, and the production associations for small, medium, large, and
        artisan firms ....Operating on the assumption that Italian firms need no help in
        penetrating European markets, SVEX researches unt appeal but potentially
        important difficult markets such as the former Soviet Union, India, and Japan.
        It conducts a detailed market analysis; finds an appropriate political, cultural,
        or trade event to promote the region’s firms; organizes a group of firms
        interested in and capable of trading with the target country; invites officials
        from that country to visit the firms in Emilia-Romagna;     and eventually
        establishes a permanent presence in that market, typically an overseas
        national under contract to SVEX. In addition to representing individual firms
        and groups of firms, SVEX is, in effect, a service center for service centers in
        the region’s other sectors.

        Even if trade missions and other market exploration               programs       are successful in

countering    the disincentives      to search created by potential      free-riding,     because they do not

prevent free-riding     they may not be cost-effective          from the point of view of the sponsoring

government.     Free-riding       weakens the bargaining        power of the domestic firms vis-a-vis          the

foreign buyer and may therefore reduce the total domestic                share of the surplus below what

one firm would have obtained            in the absence of free-riding.    In this connection        it is worth

noting a comment       by Hibbert       (1990, p. 226) that missions that represent          only one industry

rather than a range of industries          “are not always popular among businessmen               who find

themselves    competing     against each other overseas (calling on the same buyers, promoting

similar products,     etc. )“.
                                                                                                                     19


           One way to prevent free-riding         is for governments   to allow firms that identify            and

supply foreign buyers to apply for a monopoly export license to fill orders for its type of

product (s) coming from that buyer.              Such a policy, however, would shut out desirable

competition       in the case of bad performance       by the holders of the licenses.         For this reason

such a licensing system may act as a competitive              disadvantage     for the country’s     sellers

vis - a-vis sellers in other country-industries.         Nevert heless, countries      t hat license exports

with other policy objectives        in mind may attempt        to discourage     free-riding    more informa~y

through     their administrative     oversight    of the licensing process.     Clearly more research is

required here, both to identify the optimal policy response to the problem of potential

free-riding     on the search of others and to discover the extent to which current                 government

policies may be understood         as responses to this problem.



W.     Conclusions

           In this paper I have explored some of the implications             of a network/search      view of

trade in differentiated       products   for microeconornic    aspects of trading     behavior.      I have

shown that this view can explain the importance               of ethnic and extended       family ties in

trade, the success of diversified trading intermediaries           such as Japan’s      sogo shosha, and the

ubiquity      of government    export promotion      policies such as subsidized      trade missions.       A

whole set of government         trade policies aimed at subsidizing      search, a set heretofore        ignored

by trade theorists,     has been opened up for formal welfare analysis.             At the same time, it

must be recognized that alternative          explanations     etist for all of these phenomena,        some of

which undoubtedly        account for at least part of what we observe, and that more research is

needed to evaluate      the relative importance       of the explanations      I have given here.      It is

doubtful      that studies using data on bilateral      trade flows such as Gould (1994) can be

anything      more than suggestive.      What will be needed is comparative           case studies done with

the ideas presented      here in mind.

           Much more could be learned about trade and search by dropping                  the limitations       of
                                                                                                         20


the partial    equilibrium    approach I have pursued in this paper.     For example,   Gereffi (1994)

has argued that when sellers are less developed country manufacturers           the most important

search activity    is conducted    by (more developed country)     buyers, yet I have assumed

throughout     that foreign buyers are passive in the sense that they do not engage in search

activity    of their own.    This prevented    me horn analyzing phenomena     such as trade fairs,

which appear to attract       foreign buyers in part by reducing their search costs. is To properly

incorporate    actively searching foreign buyers as well as domestic      sellers, however, one

shotid     move from a search model to a mat thing model, thereby greatly increasing         the

complexity     of the analysis.   Ultimately    the goal should be a general equilibrium   model in

which search and networks         on the one hand and competitively     determined   market prices on

the other are both sources of information        for traders.




lsThe advantages of seller clustering to buyers searchin for a differentiated product has
already been recognized by conventional search theory r where “ties” between searchers
play no role); see, e.g., Stuart (1979).
