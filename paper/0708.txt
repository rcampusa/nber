 INFLATION, FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES, AND THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT
                                 AB S TRACT



     The most important conclusion of this paper is that the growth rate
of the money supply influences the U.S. inflation rate more strongly and
promptly than in most previous studies, because the flexible exchange rate
system has introduced an additional channel of monetary impact, over and
above the traditional channel operating through labor-market tightness.
Lagged changes in the effective exchange rate of the dollar, through their
influence on the prices of exports and import substitutes, help to explain
why U.S. inflation was so low in 1976 and why it accelerated so rapidly in
1978. Granger causality tests indicate that lagged exchange rate changes
influence inflation, but lagged inflation does not cause exchange rate
changes. A policy of monetary restriction in the 1980s is shown to cut
the inflation rate by five percentage points at about half the cost in lost
output as compared with the consensus view from previous studies.
     The paper defines the "no shock natural rate of unemployment't as the
unemployment rate consistent with a constant rate of inflation in a hypo-
thetical state having no supply shocks and a constant exchange rate. A new
estimate of this natural rate concept displays an increase from 5.1 percent
in 1954 to 5.9 percent in 1980 that is entirely due to the much—discussed
demographic shift in labor—force shares and relative unemployment rates.
Other higher estimates of the natural unemployment rate, close to 7 percent
in 1980, result from the use of a naive Phillips curve that relates inflation
only to labor—market tightness and inertia variables.
     The paper contains extensive sensitivity tests that examine the beha-
vior of the basic inflation equation over alternative sample periods; that
enter the growth rate of money directly and track the behavior of a money—
augmented equation in dynamic simulation experiments; and that test and
reject the view that wage—setting behavior is dominated by "wage—wage
inertia", that is, the dependence of wage changes mainly on their own
past values.

central issue, for both theory and policy" —— James Tobin'




                        I.   INTRODUCTION


     The prerequisites for an informed discussion of anti—inflationary

demand—management policy are a quantitative assessment of the response

of inflation to alternative degrees of demand restraint, and an estimate

of the real output loss associated with each hypothetical policy.

Central to the planning of an anti—inflationary strategy is the concept

of the "constant inflation" or "natural" rate of unemployment, below

which inflation accelerates and above which inflation decelerates.

Policymakers planning to stop inflation by restrictive demand—management

policy must know how high the unemployment rate must be maintained to

induce slower inflation, and how rapidly inflation will adjust per unit

of time for a given excess of unemployment above the natural rate.

     The traditional quantitative tool to address these issues has been

the econometric Phillips curve equation, which explains the current in-

flation rate as depending on the unemployment rate and lagged inflation,

i.e., on labor market "tightness'1 and on "inertia" that delays the adjust-

ment of inflation to changes in labor market conditions. Econometric

Phillips curves have been under attack for most of the past decade,

partly because the relation between inflation and unemployment has been

positive rather than negative over much of that time. While the

consensus view of a decade ago estimated the natural unemployment rate to

be about 5 percent, the actual recorded unemployment rate between early

1971 and late l980——6.4 percent——was accompanied not by a deceleration of

inflation but a doubling of inflation (in the GNP deflator) from about

5 percent to almost 10 percent. The juxtaposition of the unemployment and
                                                                      2

inflation figures seems to imply, as Robert Hall and others have argued,

that the natural unemployment rate in the U.S. in the late 1970s had

reached close to 7 percent.2 This conflict between high unemployment

and accelerating inflation led commentators like Robert Lucas and Thomas

Sargent to announce the demise of the Phillips curve and, with it, the

collapse of Keynesian economics.3

     This paper finds that the Phillips curve has been prematurely buried.

The Phillips—curve specification——that inflation depends on inertia and

on real aggregate demand in the form of a labor—market tightness variable——

is less wrong than incomplete. Just as today's undergraduate students

learn that accelerations of inflation depend on a Marshallian scissors of

demand and supply shifts, so the econometric explanation of inflation re-

quires the inclusion not just of inertia and aggregate demand variables,

but also of variables to represent the impact of external supply shocks

and government intervention in the price—setting process.    This paper,

which is the fourth of a series on the U.S. inflation process, provides

new estimates of the natural unemployment rate and the responsiveness of

inflation to demand—management policy that are neither as pessimistic as

those based on traditional Phillips curves nor as optimistic as those

incorporating the Lucas—Sargent assumption of instantaneous price respon-

siveness to anticipated nominal demand disturbances.

     There are four distinguishing features of this study:

          1. Inflation depends on inertia, and on both demand and supply

shifts. A careful treatment of supply factors, especially the relative

prices of food and energy and the impact of the 1971—74 Nixon price con-

trols program, helps to explain why inflation and unemployment were
                                                                      3

positively related in the early 1970s, and leads to improved estimates of

the impact of demand variables on inflation.

         2. Demand effects include the influence of exchange rates.

Traditional Phillips curve equations allow the impact of aggregate demand

to enter only through a single real variable, the unemployment rate (usually

its inverse, and often weighted to correct for demographic shifts). The

specification adopted here allows demand policy to enter through two addi—

tional channels, the rate of change of real or nominal demand, and the

change in the effective exchange rate of the dollar (which in turn de-

pends on monetary and fiscal policy). The exchange rate variable makes a

critical contribution to our explanation of inflation behavior in the

l970s, particularly the low inflation rate in 1976 and its acceleration in

1978. Further, the exchange rate variable, when combined with an equation

that links exchange rate behavior to monetary policy, substantially in-

creases the responsiveness of inflation to monetary restriction and leads

to a lower estimate of the associated loss of real GNP.

         3. Inflation is explained without explicit reference to wage

behavior. Some past studies of inflation, including those of George

Perry, have estimated only wage equations, without presenting separate

estimates of the responsiveness of the price—wage markup to aggregate demand

conditions.5 Since the wage equation captures only part of the impact of

demand on inflation, it implies an overly pessimistic verdict on the out-

come of restrictive demand—management policy. By concentrating on the

relation of inflation to past inflation and both demand and supply factors,

this paper circumvents the need to estimate separate wage equations. Sen-

sitivity tests indicate that the omission of a wage equation actually improves

our ability to explain historical inflation data.
                                                                        4


        4.   The   direct   impact of money on prices is tested explicitly.

Some critics of the Phillips curve approach state, usually without explicit

empirical proof, that past changes in the money supply are the dominant

influence on inflation. If the reaction of inflation is sufficiently

prompt, a monetary disturbance can change the inflation rate without any

response in the real variables (like unemployment or real output) that

typically play the key explanatory role in Phillips curve equations,

causing such equations to be fundamentally misspecified. In a contest

with traditional specifications, we find that short lags on past monetary

changes are a good substitute for changes in unemployment, and long lags are

a good substitute for the level of unemployment. A dynamic simulation of

an equation including long lags on money can explain inflation data for the

1970s as well as, although no better than, a similar equation excluding

money. The major drawback of the equation with money is the long—run

instability of its estimated form and its implausible long—run behavior

in simulations of alternative policy regimes.

     Two types of quantitative analysis of the impact of aggregate demand

on inflation are presented. First, the robustness of the basic inflation

equation is tested by comparing it with alternative specifications. What

difference is made by specifying the growth of aggregate demand to operate

through nominal monetary changes rather than a real variable like unemploy-

ment? Is there any evidence of shifts in the importance of the demand

variables between the first and last halves of the 1954—80 interval? Is

a separate wage equation necessary to track the inflation process, or can

the process be adequately summarized in a single equation that ignores

wages? The second task of the paper is more directly related to the present

concerns of the policymakers. What would have been the consequences for
                                                                   5


inflation of alternative demand management policies during the 1975—80

period? What is the implied natural rate of unemployment during the 1970s

and at present? And what would be the outcome for inflation and real GNP

of alternative monetary growth rates over the next decade?

    The paper begins in Part II with a brief examination of the basic

data for 1954—80 on inflation, the growth of nominal GNP and money, the

ratio between actual and natural" real GNP, and two measures of unemploy-

ment. Part III discusses methodology and shows the formal relationship

of our single basic inflation equation to conventional wage and price mark-

up equations. Part IV tests for shifts in coefficients between the two

halves of the sample period. Part V compares the basic equations with

variants that directly introduce lagged changes in the money supply and

provides new evidence on patterns of Granger causality among prices, unemploy-

ment, and money. The basic specification is compared in Part VI with

equations that explain wage change and the relation of prices to wages

separately with the same set of right—hand variables. Historical simulations

are the subject of Part VII, while Part VIII develops simulations of hypo-

thetical future demand growth policies based on both the basic equation

and alternative specifications.

 II. BASIC DATA ON INFLATION, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND UNEMPLOYMENT


     Although regression equations are the basic tool of analysis in this

paper, nevertheless some basic features of the postwar inflation process

can be identified in a simple summary of the raw data, as in Table 1.

Sections 1 and 2 of the table list means and standard deviations of key

variables for five evenly—divided subperiods within the span of our overall

sample period that extends from l954:Q2 to l98O:Q4. The first three

columns show quarterly rates of change at annual rates, and the last three

columns show levels of the ratio of actual to natural real GNP, and two

measures of the unemployment rate (the official rate and PerryT s demo-

graphically weighted rate). The level of natural real GNP used to compute

the output ratio in column (4) is the "QPOT1T' series estimated by Jeffrey

Perloff and Michael Wachter, extrapolated after 1978 at a growth rate

corresponding to the official Council of Economic Advisers potential GNP

series (2.8 percent in 1979 and 1980), and adjusted for the 1980

revisions in the National Income and Product accounts.

     The first outstanding fact in section 1 of the table is the simul-

taneous increase in both inflation and unemployment during 1970—80 as

compared to 1954—65, with inflation rising from an average of 1.7 percent

in the first two subperiods to 6.9 percent in the last two subperiods,

hile official unemployment rose from 5.4 to 6.4 percent, and the weighted

unemployment rate rose from 4.4 to 4.7 percent. The output ratio duplicates

the story told by the weighted unemployment rate, as would be expected,

since a demographic correction was used by Perloff and Wachter in creating

their natural output series. The following "Okun's Law" regression shows

the close connection between the weighted unemployment rate (UW), and the
                                                                                 7

           and the coefficient of first—order serial correlation =       0.79.

Thus the output ratio is 100 percent when the weighted unemployment rate

is 3.96 percent, and this corresponds to an official unemployment rate in

1980 of 5.8 percent. The Perloff—Wachter output ratio, and the associated

values of the weighted and official unemployment rates, are used only as

a point of departure for our investigation, which will attempt to deter-

mine whether the Perloff—Wachter output ratio overstates natural real GNP

and understates the corresponding natural rate of unemployment. Stated

another way, we must determine whether the acceleration of inflation in

the 1970s can be explained when on average the Perloff—Wachter output

ratio was negative throughout the decade.

     Between the first and last sub—periods the acceleration of inflation

of 5.3 percentage points was accompanied by similar accelerations in

nominal CNP and monetary growth of, respectively, 5.0 and 5.1 percentage

points. (It is interesting that velocity growth was so stable across the

five sub—periods, ranging only from 2.9 to 3.4 percent.) But within each

sub—period the relationship between inflation, nominal GNP, and money was

not nearly so close. The second section of the table shows the standard

deviations within each of the five intervals of each variable. The variance

of inflation and the output ratio was greatest in the early l970s, whereas
                                                                       9


the variance of adjusted nominal GNP growth was greatest in the 1950s, and

the variance of monetary growth was greatest in the late 1970s. In fact,

the variance of monetary growth was relatively low in the early 1970s,

just when the variance of inflation, the output ratio, and unemployment

was highest. These summary statistics reflect our finding that postwar

inflation cannot be adequately characterized simply as a lagged adjustment

to one or more of the other variables included in Table 1, but rather its

explanation requires an explicit quantitative treatment of supply shocks

and of government intervention in the inflation process.

    A different subdivision of the data is presented in the bottom section

of Table 1. The dates shown are those of the trough and peak inflation

rates (measured as four—quarter chages) corresponding to each of the five

NBER business cycles. The upward ratcheting of the peaks and troughs after

1961 is clearly evident, although the 1980 inflation peak fell short

that reached in 1974 (another clue that supply shocks played a special

role in the highly variable inflation of the early l970s). The correlation

of inflation and either demand or monetary growth is extremely weak across

inflation peaks and troughs, and is negative between 1970 and 1976. The

negative Phillips curve relation between inflation and unemployment is

evident before but not after 1970.

                         III. METHODOLOGY

Two Equations or One?


     Just as the Phillips—curve econometricians and the Lucas—Sargent

classicists hold different views about the impact of aggregate demand on

inflation, so they also set up their empirical studies differently. The

traditional procedure has been to specify a wage equation and then to

assume that the price level is marked up over "standard" unit labor cost,

that is, the wage rate divided by a productivity trend. Some traditional

studies, which do not provide estimates of the markup equation, imply that

their estimated coefficient on the level of unemployment in the wage

equation is the only channel through which aggregate demand can alter the

inflation rate.6

     In contrast proponents of the Lucas—Sargent approach focus directly

on an equation in which the inflation rate rather than wage change is the

dependent variable.7 The effect of demand is entered through changes in

nominal money or nominal GNP, and there is no attention to variables

representing labor market tightness. This single—equation approach has

several advantages over the traditional two—equation mainline framework

that emphasizes wages.

     First, wage and price markup equations cannot be distinguished as

truly structural equations applying to behavior in particular markets. The

behavior of wages, for instance, can be explained just as well by real

GNP as by labor market variables like unemployment, suggesting that the

wage equation does not provide us with any special insight about the work-

ing of labor markets. Indeed, if the "Okun's Law" relationship linking the
                                                                      11


output ratio and the unemployment rate works well, as in equation (1)

above, then output variables can mimic the behavior of labor—market

variables over the business cycle.8 Second, traditional wage and price

equations may be particularly prone to simultaneous equations bias. If

current prices explain wages and current wages explain prices, then the

coefficient on a variable that influences both simultaneously——whether a

demand proxy like real GNP or a supply variable like price—control effects——

may be biased downward if it is measured with error and part of its true

effect is "soaked up" by the right—hand wage or price variable.

     A third problem is that the use of separate wage and price markup

equations leads to an artificial separation of the variables that 'belong"

in each equation. Thus the inflationary impact of the payroll tax or

Kennedy—Johnson wage guidelines depends not just on their coefficient in

the wage equation, but on the response of prices to that particular source

of wage variation. Finally, the two—equation approach is inconvenient

and clumsy. The full impact of a variable on the inflation rate cannot be

learned from the simple inspection of a table, but requires multiplying and

adding coefficients.

     On all of these counts a single inflation equation, which relates the

rate of price change to its own lagged values, seems superior. The equation

is openly a convenient characterization of the data rather than an attempt

to describe structural behavior. Because the underlying structure may

shift, the coefficients in the estimated equation may shift, so that any

such single—equation approach should pay special attention to tests of

the stability of coefficients across sub—intervals within the sample period.
                                                                  12

Details of the Specification

    Our single inflation equation is derived from separate wage and price

markup equations. Because economic theory gives us no guidance as to the

exact form of the impact of aggregate demand on inflation, we shall

postulate that the level and rate of change of a real utilization variable

-—either the output ratio or weighted unemployment——enters both the wage

and price markup equations. The level of the real demand variable is

denoted below by X, and its rate of change as x. An important restric-

tion on the wage equation is that we rule out a "wage—wage spiral," that

is, the dependence of the rate of wage change on the inherited "norm" of

lagged wage change due to the attention paid by workers to wage differen-

tials.9 Instead, the influence of inertia on wage change (w) is assumed

to enter through a single term, defined as lagged price change         plus

the Tequilibrium" growth rate of the real wage (Ar). While the wage—wage

view is plausible, any role of lagged wages must be purged from the wage

equation if we are to be able to develop a single inflation equation that

is free from the need to explain wage behavior. Section VI below demon-

strates that lagged price changes perform much better than lagged wages

in a wage equation.

     In addition to the real demand and inertia variables, wage change is

allowed to depend on a vector of supply variables (Zwt) that shift the rate

of wage change for any given values of lagged prices and the demand variables.

Among the supply shifts that might enter the wage equation are the impact

of wage controls and of changes in the payroll tax and minimum wage. When

an error term (ce) is included the wage equation becomes:
                                                                           13

         (2) w =      a0
                           + a1(p1 +   )) + a2X + a3x +            +


  In   the steady state the actual growth in the real wage (w —     p)   will

  be at the equilibrium rate (A) only if c 1, the level of the real

  demand variable is constant at X =
                                         —(a01a2), and the supply and error

  terms have realizations equal to zero. Thus the term "equilibrium" to

  describe A is used in the highly restricted sense of a "no shock"

  equilibrium. In exactly the same sense, the "natural rate" of output or

  unemployment (X) is compatible with steady wage growth only if the same

  set of restrictive conditions is satisfied. In the long run the           term

 plays no role in the inflation process if the productivity variable in

  the price equation below (Gb)   equals X.       But some have argued that a de-

 cline in productivity growth can cause an acceleration of inflation if firms

 and workers try to maintain the old path of real wages, rather than instantly

 allowing the growth rate of real wages to decelerate in proportion to the

 productivity slowdown (A. >   ci).    Our distinction between the real wage and

 productivity is introduced to test empirically whether productivity behavior

 has been a separate determinant of the observed rate of inflation (an inde-

 pendent channel is introduced in Appendix A, which contains equations that

 translate monetary growth into unemployment. Slower growth in productivity——

 and thus in potential output——reduces the unemployment rate relative to the

 natural unemployment rate for any given growth rate of money and thus in our

 basic equation in Table 2 causes the inflation rate to accelerate).

       The price markup equation relates current price change          to the

current change in "standard" unit labor cost (w —            the same demand
                                                      c.),
variables as appear in (2), a vector of supply shift variables (z) that

influence the level of prices relative to wages, and an error term
                                                                                     14

The fact that the current wage enters the price equation, hut only              lagged
price change enters the wage equation, is an expositional convenience that

does not restrict the empirical work presented below.'0 Among the supply

shift variables (z       )    that   could enter into the price equation are govern—

                                      lwt          Pt


The long—run equilibrium properties of (4) can be seen more easily if we

combine the separate z variables, error terms, and coefficients from the

wage and price equations:



                    10 +                 +              + (1i1)a +          + yx +

            where     =

                                  4ZP + i4z; and
                             =                                  =       +



     What are the conditions necessary for (5) to generate a constant

equilibrium rate of inflation? First, the coefficient on lagged price

change       must be unity. Second, the equilibrium real wage term in the

wage equation and standard productivity growth in the price equation must
                                                                                 15


be equal (X—o         0).    Third, the coefficient on standard unit labor cost

in the price equation must be unity            = l).11    Fourth. the rate of

change in the real demand variable, as well as every supply shift variable,

must also be equal to zero (x = z        =   0).   Finally, the level of the real

demand variable must be at its "natural rate," X =
                                                               —o'2)•     Correspondingly

(5) lays out those events that can cause the inflation rate to accelerate,

including an excess of A over a, a level of real demand above the natural

rate (X >
            X),    a positive rate of growth of the real demand variable, and


any adverse supply shock.

     Clearly Xt represents the "natural rate of output" only if all of

the other conditions stated in the previous paragraph are valid. If there

is, for instance, an adverse supply shift (z >           0),   inflation can acceler-

                  =         An excess of A over a, or a positive realization
ate even if
                      X.
of any z variable, pushes the "constant inflation" level of real demand


below the value of Xt. Thus the framework of equation (5) has the potential

of explaining why inflation accelerated during the l970s, despite the fact

that the Perloff—Wachter output—ratio measure summarized in Table 1 was

negative on average during the decade.


Endogeneity Problems


     Leaving   aside the possible endogeneity of elements in the z supply

vector, a topic discussed in Part Vii below, a weakness ot euation (5) is

the appearance of two endogenous variables, the level and rate of change of

real demand (X and x, respectively). A bias in the coefficient on both

demand variables, and particularly on the rate of change effect (xe),
                                                                  16

may be introduced from two sources. First, if x is represented by the

change in real GNP, measurement error may introduce a spurious negative

correlation between the dependent variable     and x, the output change

variable, thus biasing downward the parameter Y3 since in the United States


national accounts nominal GNP and prices are measured independently, with

real GNP as a residual 12 Thus any error that exaggerates the rate

of price increase in a given quarter would depress the official growth

rate of real GNP by an equal amount, since data for nominal GNP are col-

lected independently. This type of measurement error can be avoided by

using a real demand variable collected from an independent data source,

e.g., Perry's weighted unemployment rate, to measure both X and x.

     Second, for any given growth rate of nominal GNP, a supply shock

(z > 0) raises the inflation rate and reduces real GNP growth. In
principle the impact of any supply shock that shifts the inflation rate

for given values of the output variables is supposed to be captured by

the vector of    variables included in the equation. But errors in the

measurement of the    variables may introduce a spurious negative correla-

tion between the inflation rate and the change in either output or unemploy-

ment. For instance, with fixed nominal GNP growth, imagine that an oil

price increase raises the inflation rate and reduces output growth by one

percentage point in the initial quarter, and that the "oil shock" variable

times its coefficient erroneously indicates only a 0.5 percent upward

shift in the inflation schedule. The explanation of the other 0.5 percentage

point acceleration of inflation would be captured by a coefficient of —0.5
                                                                    17

on the output change variable if there were no other observations; more

generally when the "truet' coefficient on output growth (13) is positive,


then the estimated coefficient would be biased toward zero. Given the

close negative association between real output and unemployment in (1),

the same bias would apply (with the opposite sign) to unemployment varia-

bles. To test the possibility that this "supply shock bias" might affect

the estimated equation, an alternative version is estimated below in

which the real rate of change variable is replaced by the lagged growth

rate of the nominal money supply.

     The GNP deflator seems the natural choice as dependent variable in a

study of the basic U.S. inflation process. Given any specified path of

nominal GNP and "natural" (or potential) real GNP, determination of the path

of the GNP deflator automatically yields as residual the output ratio


and, through equation (1), the unemployment rate. A pitfall introduced

by the GNP deflator stems from the use of shifting current—period ex-

penditure weights in its construction, leading to a confounding of price

changes with changes in the mix of output.. In a quarter in which there is

a sharp change in a particular category of nominal spending, as in the

case of an auto strike or oil embargo, the value of the deflator may

rise or fall due to shifting weights, even if there were no effect of

nominal GNP on any individual price change. Fortunately this problem

can be avoided through the use of the published "fixed—weight" GNP de-

flator that insulates true price changes from expenditure shifts, just

as studies of wage inflation during the past decade have adopted the

practice of employing a dependent variable that is corrected for changes

in the inter—industry employment mix.13
                                                                   18

              IV. THE BASIC INFLATION EQUATION AND

     ITS SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN SPECIFICATION AND DATING


The Point of Departure: A Naive Philiips Curve


     Our starting place is the simple Phillips curve that incorporates only

the effects of real demand and inertia. Although most Phillips curve re—

search has stressed the relationship between wage change and the level of

the unemployment rate, a quasi—Phillips—curve equation can be estimated

within our framework by regressing the rate of inflation on its own lagged

values and the current level of the Perry weighted unemployment rate (U).

This is equivalent to the estimation of (5) with the omission of the demand

growth, productivity, and supply shift terms. As in all of the equations

presented in this paper, the level of the unemployment rate, appears in

its linear rather than its inverse form (used in most previous studies).

Since the inverse form improves the fit by only a trivial amount, less

than one percent, I prefer the linear form which makes the coefficients

on the constant and unemployment terms easier to interpret.15 Also in

common with the other equations in this paper, the role of the lagged

dependent variable may be either to represent the adaptive formation of

the expected rate of inflation, or simply the role of inertia in the

inflation process through the influence of three—year wage contracts and

other similar institutional phenomena. Since these two interpretations

cannot be distinguished empirically, there is no point in trying to

decide which is valid.tf

     To standardize the equations in the paper and economize on the number

of permutations of equations that must be estimated, the lagged dependent
                                                                          19


variable is entered into every equation as a fourth—degree polynomial ex-

tended over 24 lagged values with a zero end—point constraint. In Table 2,

column (1) illustrates an equation in which the quarterly rate of change

of the fixed—weight GNP deflator (expressed as an annual rate) is regressed

on this polynomial distributed lag, on the level of the weighted unemployment

rate, and on a constant term.

     The estimated coefficients in column (1) seem satisfactory at first

glance. The Phillips curve slope——the coefficient on U——is strongly

significant and indicates that a permanent one—percentage—point reduction

of the unemployment rate is accompanied by 0.6 percentage points extra

inflation for any given contribution of the lagged inflation variable.

But there is a problem in the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation,

which lies significantly above unity. Maintenance of the weighted unem-

ployment rate at 1Q/12    3.45 would be associated with an acceleration

of inflation. Thus the natural unemployment rate cannot be calculated

directly in column (1).

    A central focus of this study is the extent to which the natural

unemployment rate has increased during the 1970s. A measure of the upward

shift implied by column (1) can be provided if we constrain the sum of

coefficients on lagged inflation to be unity, and include two dummy varia-

bles for the first and last half of the l970s to measure the shift in the

constant term as compared to the sample period as a whole. The constraint

is imposed in column () by subtracting from the dependent variables the

                            Notes to Table 2

a. In columns (4) through (6), the constraint is imposed by subtracting

      from the quarterly change in the GNP fixed weight deflator the 24

      lagged inflation variables times their respective coefficients from

      columns (1) through (3), divided by the sum of coefficients. This

      difference is the dependent variable in a regression in which all of

      the other indicated variables appear on the right—hand side.

b. In columns (1) to (3) the indicated figures are sums of coefficients

      (and their t ratios) when the lagged dependent variable is entered

      as a fourth—degree polynomial distributed lag on 24 lagged values,

      with a zero end—point constraint. In lines 3 and 4 the lagged in-

      flation variable is entered twice in the same form, with the first

      distributed lag fitted to values for 1948:Q2 through l966:Q4, and

      the second fitted to values for l967:Ql through 1980:Q4.

c.   For each variable marked with footnote "c," both the current and four

      lagged values are entered into the equation, with the listed co-

      efficient indicating the sum of all five coefficients and associated

      t ratio on the sum.

d. Same as note c, except that the current and three lagged values are

     entered.

e.   The Nixon controls "on" dummy variable is entered as a variable equal

     to 0.8 for the five quarters l97l:Q3—l972:Q3. The "off" variable is

     equal to 0.4 in l974:Q2 and l975:Ql, and equal to 1.6 in l974:Q3 and

     l974:Q4. The respective dummy variables sum to 4.0 rather than 1.0

     because the dependent variable in each equation is a quarterly change

     expressed as an annual rate, i.e., multiplied by 4.0.
                                                                       22

24 lagged inflation variables times their respective coefficients in

column (1), all divided by the sum of coefficients (1.22). The results in

column (4) imply that the natural weighted unemployment rate rose about one

percentage point after 1970:
                                    Implied Natural Rate of Unemployment

                                    Weighted               Official

               1956                   4.18                   5.00

               1972                   5.23                   6.81

               1978                   5.12                   6.80

The conversion from the weighted to the official rate is accomplished

simply by adding in the actual difference between the two rates in the

listed year. The resulting estimate of an official natural unemployment

rate in the l970s of 6.8 percent corresponds to the back—of—the--envelope

estimate of Hall.'6


introducing the Supply Shift Variables

     Our basic equation (5) contains several variables in addition to

those shown in the first column of Table 2, including a vector of supply

shifts, a productivity term, and an additional demand variable, the rate

of change of r'eal demand. These additional variables are introduced in

two stages in Table 2. First, in the second column two key supply shift

variables are included——the Nixon controls and changes in the relative

prices of food and energy. Then in column (3) the complete set of addi—

tional variables is included. Because the exact specification of the

supply shift variables was examined in detail in a previous paper, here

every equation enters each component of the z vector with the same

definition and lg distribution.17
                                                                           23

     2. Food-energy Effect. The most readily available measure of the

impact of changes in the   relative   price of food and energy is the difference

between the respective rates of change of the National Accounts deflators for

personal consumption expenditures and for personal consumption net of expendi-

tures on food and energy. This measure has the advantages that (a) it incor-

porates food and energy products with weights reflecting their importance in

final spending (as opposed, for instance, to the Producer Price Index for

energy that applies multiple weights to crude oil), and (b) it assumes a value

of zero when the relative prices of food and energy are constant, thus allow-

ing the "no shock" natural rate of unemployment to be calculated directly in

Table 2.18


     2. Nixon Controls. The impact of the price controls during the Nixon

administration is assessed with a pair of dummy variables, specified to show

the cumulative displacement of the price level by the controls and the extent of

its subsequent post—controls rebound. The "on" variable is defined as 0.8 for

the five quarters 1971:Q3 through l972:Q3, and zero otherwise. The "of f"

variable is defined as 0.4 for the two quarters 1974:Q2 and 1975:Ql,

1.6 for l974:Q3 and l974:Q4, and zero otherwise. These dummy variables

sum to 4.0, not 1.0, because the dependent variable is multiplied by 4.0

to convert it to an annual rate. Previous econometric evaluations of

control effects have been based both on dummy variables and on post—

sample dynamic simulations of equations. Blinder and Newton contributed

a third method, based on a time series of the fraction of prices actually

controlled. In a detailed comparison Frye and Gordon concluded that when

the dummy variable and Blinder techniques are used in conjunction with the

same specification of other variables, they give identical fits and
                                                                      24
measures of the displacement of the price 1ev by controls, 19     The post—

sample simulation technique is judged inferior, because it is unable to

incorporate information on variables that were unimportant before 1971 but

were important thereafter (especially flexible exchange rates). The co-

efficients displayed in lines 12 and 13 of Table 2 show a substantially

greater ttoff" effect than flon" effect, a result attributed below to the

impact of the foreign exchange rate.

     The estimates in column (2), and the corresponding constrained

equation in column (5), add to the "naive Phillips curve" only the impact

of Nixon controls and the current change in the relative prices of food

and energy. In my research I have found that a number of other variables

are useful in explaining postwar inflation. The following list describes

the additional variables in the order in which they are entered in column

(3), and the corresponding constrained equation in column (6).

     3.   Split Lagged Dependent Variable. The fit of the equation improves

markedly when the single distributed lag on past inflation in columns (1)

and (2) is replaced by two separate distributed lags in column (3) applied

respectively to lagged price data before and after l967:Ql——chosen because

it is the midpoint of the sample period. The improvement in fit occurs

because the shape of the lag distribution shortens substantially in

the last half of the sample period, from 11.2 to 6.8 quarters. The F

value for the significance of the additional lag distribution is 2.06,

close to the 5 percent critical value of 2.49. Two factors may have

speeded up the responsiveness of the inflation process. First, higher in-

flation rates have brought increased awareness of inflation behavior, and,

second, the share of wage contracts containing escalator clauses increased

substantially in the 1970s as compared to the l960s.20
                                                                            25

        4. Change in Unemployment. A significant contribution is made by

 the change in unemployment, entered as a simple first difference of the

 Perry weighted unemployment rate. An equation that omits the unemployment

 change variable exhibits a jump in the coefficient on the level of the

unemployment rate from —0.59 to —0.72. The F value for the additional rate

of change variable is 3.76, as compared to a 5 percent critical value of

3.98.

        5. Productivity Deviation. If the equilibrium real wage growth

variable in the wage equation (Xe) and the standard productivity variable


in the price markup equation (o.) were identical, then the behavior of

actual productivity changes would have no influence on the actual inflation

rate in equation (5). However in general there is no reason for these two

variables to be identical, and thus there is room for tests of the direct

influence of actual productivity changes on inflation. Let us imagine

that the productivity variable in the wage equation (X) is a constant


representing a straight time trend, t, whereas the '1standard" productivity

variable in the price equation (o.k) is a weighted average of the actual

growth rate of productivity               and another constant trend (t):


     (6)      A =

     (7)            =   (p) + (l-p)t,21
so that the productivity variable that appears in equation () becomes:


     (8)        —        =t   —   t   —        —
                                                                           26

        The (t —
             w
                   tp   )   term becomes absorbed in the constant of the inflation

equation and, if it is not zero, becomes part of the estimated natural

unemployment rate. In Table 2 we measure the productivity deviation"

    —   t)    by specifying t as a variable time trend.22 The productivity

deviation variable, the difference between the quarterly growth rate of

nonfarm output per hour and this variable trend, enters significantly on

line 7 of the equation in column (3). Experimentation with lags indicates

that its entire impact occurs in the current quarter. The F value on its

inclusion is 4.22, compared to the 5 percent critical value of 3.98.

     6.      Foreign exchange raie. Changes in the effective exchange rate of

the dollar have not been included as an explanatory variable in previous

studies of inflation, mainly because it has been difficult to find a

statistically significant impact. The previous insignificance of the

exchange rate appears to have been caused by the impact of the Nixon con-

trols in delaying the adjustment of U.S. domestic prices to the dollar

depreciation that occurred in two stages between 1971 and 1973. Our varia-

ble is the quarterly change in the effective exchange rate of the dollar,

starting in 1975:Q2, the quarter when the post—controls rebound is assumed

to terminate. This variable, entered as a current and three lagged values,

makes a significant contribution to the equation (with a F value of 2.55

compared to a 5 percent critical value of 2.49) and helps to explain why

inflation was so low in 1976 and accelerated so rapidly in 1978. The

policy implications of this variable are important, since movements in the

exchange rate introduce a direct impact of monetary policy (and the monetary—

fiscal mix) on the inflation rate. The artificial device of setting the
                                                                      27

 exchange rate change equal to zero before 1975 accounts, I believe, for

 the fact that the Nixon controls "off" coefficient is larger than the

 "on" coefficient. The cumulative depreciation of the dollar between 1970

 and 1975:Ql was 17 percent, contributing 1.94 percent to the inflation

 rate when multiplied by the 1975—80 coefficient of —.11. Of this 1.94

 points of extra inflation, 1.2 points are captured by the excess positive

 coefficient on the controls 'off" variable, and the remainder is pre-

 sumably soaked up by other variables.

     A question may be raised about the possible endogeneity of the

 foreign exchange rate variable. Fortunately, there is strong evidence

against contemporaneous feedback from inflation to the exchange rate.

First, the exchange rate variable enters in the form of the current and

three lagged values, but all of its explanatory power comes from the lags;

the coefficient on the current variable is insignificant. Second, a

regression of the foreign exchange rate on currentand four lagged changes

in money, nominal GNP, and the GNP deflator yields coefficients on current

and lagged inflation that are jointly and individually insignificant.

Thus all of the short—run interaction between the exchange rate and in-

flation is due to the effect of the former on the latter, and any impact

in the reverse direction is both imperfect and long delayed.Z3


     7. Effective Minimum Wage and Social Security Tax. In previous

studies I have found these two variables to be significant "self—inflicted

wounds," that is, changes in government policy variables that had a direct

negative impact on the inflation rate. The effective minimum wage rate is

defined as changes in the ratio of the statutory minimum wage to average
                                                                     28


 hourly earnings in the nonf arm economy, and the effective payroll tax rate

 as the ratio of total contributions for social security (employee and

 employer shares) divided by wages and salaries. Neither variable is

 statistically significant in column (3), but both are included to maintain

 comparability with previous studies. In addition, their effect in separate

 wage and price markup equations is of interest and is estimated in Table 5

 below.


 Sensitivity of Natural Unemployment Rate to Form of Equation

      The specification of the equations in columns (1) through (3) is

 repeated on the right—hand side of Table 2, with a unity constraint imposed

 on the sum of the coefficients on lagged inflation in each equation in

 columns (4) through (6). The latter equations also insert two additional

constant terms for the first and last half of the 1970s, in order to test

 for shifts in the natural rate of unemployment. The inclusion of the food—

 energy and price—control effects in column (5) eliminates roughly one—third

 of the increase in the weighted unemployment rate between 1956 and 1978,

while the complete specification in column (6) eliminates most of the re-

maining increase:

     The insignificance of the dummy shift variable for 1976—80 in column

(6) indicates that there was no upward shift in the natural weig7ited un-

employment rate between the 1950s and late 1970s (the same result occurs

when five dummies are included for each five—year sub—period). The mar-

ginal significance of the 1970—75 dummy shift variable in column (6) may

reflect the treatment of the foreign exchange rate variable, which is set

equal to zero before 1975 because the Nixon controls contaminate the

timing of its impact on inflation. We calculated above that 1.9 points

of extra inflation during 1970—75 would be accounted for by the deprecia-

tion of the dollar, if the 1975—80 coefficient on that variable were applied

to the cumulative 1970—75 depreciation. Deducting 0.6 percentage points

for the excess of the Nixon "off" dummy coefficient over the Nixon "on"

coefficient, there remain 1.3 points to be accounted for, or 0.24 points

of inflation per year. Subtraction of 0.24 from the estimated 1970—75

dummy shift variable of 0.41 would reduce the estimated shift to 0.17.

     Overall, the figures for the official unemployment rate indicate an

upward shift in the natural rate of 1.8 percentage points in column (4),

1.6 points in column (5), and only 0.9 points in column (6). Since all of

this shift in column (6) is accounted for by the upward drift of the differ-

ence between the official and weighted unemployment rates, due to the in-

creasing demographic importance of teenagers and women and a worsening of

their relative unemployment rates, column (6) carries the implication

that there has been no upward shift in the natural rate for other than

demographic reasons. Less inclusive Phillips curves, like those displayed

in columns (4) and (5), incorrectly interpret as a shift in the natural
                                                                   30


rate the impact of the productivity slowdown and exchange rate deprecia-

tion, particularly in the 1977—80 period. If U.S. productivity behavior

and exchange—rate performance continue to be unfavorable during the

1980s, then column (5) is relevant in estimating the natural rate, but a

tineutralu behavior of productivity and the exchange rate (that is,

trend productivity growth and a constant exchange rate) would imply that

the natural unemployment rate in 1980 was S.9 percent. An annual time

series of the natural rate is presented in Appendix Table B—i.


Sensitivity to Changes in Sampie Period

     Did the process of price adjustment in the U.S. become less

sensitive to demand in the 1970s? George Perry's recent analysis of

wage change found a significant shift in the coefficient on unemploy-

ment in 1970, with the implication that the Phillips curve had become

virtually flat during the past decade.21 Our basic equation already

allows the lag distribution on past inflation to shift between the first

and last halves of the sample period. The first three columns of Table

3 examine shifts in the coefficients on the level and change in the

umeployment rate, holding constant the influence of lagged inflation

and constraining the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation to be unity.

Thus column (1) in Table 3 repeats the constrained basic equation from

column (6) of Table 2, differing only in the omission of the insignificant

constant shift terms. Because the dependent variable in Table 3 is

price change minus the constrained effect of lagged inflation, the dis-

played equations explain the change in the rate of inflation (i.e., the

second derivative of the price level).25

    is explained in notes a and b to Table 2.

    by the same technique used in Table 2, columns (4) and (5), i.e.,

   without a split in the lag distribution on past inflation.

    The coefficient estimates in columns (1) and (2) are virtually

identical, indicating no shift in the coefficient on the level of un-

employment in explaining accelerations and decelerations of inflation.

The F ratio for the significance of the additional unemployment variable

is 1.40, compared to the 5 percent critical value of 3.98. In column

(3) the "level effect" of unemployment is unchanged, but a split in the

coefficient on the unemployment "change effect" results in a low and

insignificant coefficient after 1966. However, this shift is insig-

nificant, with a comparison of columns (2) and (3) yielding an F ratio

of only 1.25, compared to the 5 percent critical value of 3.98. Corn—

paring columns (1) and (3), the F ratio is 1.33, versus a 5 percent

critical value of 3.11. The downward shift in the unemployment change

variable may be partially explained by a bias predicted in our discussion

of endogeneity problems in part III above. Errors in the measurement

of supply shocks tend to create a positive correlation between inflation

and the change in unemployment (as unmeasured supply shifts raise in-

flation, reduce output, and raise the unemployment rate), thus causing a

bias toward zero in the coefficient on the change in unemployment.

     A greater degree of doubt about the robustness of the unemployment

change effect is suggested by columns (4) and (5), which display con-

strained regression equations fitted to the portion of the sample period

ending in 1969, and to the portion beginning in 1964. Each of these

equations includes only a single distribution on lagged inflation. The

 results for the earlier sub—period indicate that all of the impact of

 demand operated through the level of the unemployment rate, and none

 through the rate of change, but that the "level effect" was more than
                                                                 34

double the coefficient in the basic full—period equation in column (1).

The results for the later sub—period also indicate a stronger level ef-

fect than in the full—period equation, and a weaker change effect. It

is interesting that the sum of the coefficients on the level and change

effects varies much less across sample priods than the individual co-

efficients——the respective sums of the level and change coefficients in

columns (1), (4), and (5) are —1.24, —1.20, and —1.05.

     There are other interesting aspects of the short—sample results in

columns (4) and (5). First, the productivity deviation and minimum wage

coefficients are much larger in the early period, and are insignificant

in the later period. Second, the impact of food and energy prices was

actually stronger in the early period (column 4) than in the full period

(column 1). These aspects of the equations are confirmed in several

other experiments which (a) estimate unconstrained versions of columns

(4) and (5), and (b) split the sample period roughly in half between an

early 1954—66 sub—period and a late 1967—80 sub—period. A formal Chow

test on the equations run in experiment (b) fails by a wide margin to

reject the null hypothesis that the first half of the observations obeys

the same relation as the sub—period relation for the last half of the

sample period. The conclusion is the same, but by a narrower margin, when

the Chow test is conducted in reverse in a comparison of the last half

of the observations with the sub—period relation for the first half of

the sample period.26 Thus, despite shifts in individual coefficients

over time, conventional statistical tests confirm that the basic equation

describes a stable relation between inflation and its determinants.

           V.     COMPARING DIRECT AND INDIRECT CHANNELS OF

                           MONETARY INFLUENCE



Introducing     Monetarb Variables into the Basic Inflation Equation


     Our interest in the direct effect on inflation of changes in the

nominal money supply is motivated by three considerations. First,

our discussion of endogeneity problems in Part II suggested that if

nominal demand were exogenous, errors in the measurement of supply

shifts would bias toward zero the coefficient on the change in real de-

mand in our basic equation (5). Second, by forcing the impact of demand

to operate entirely through real variables, our basic equation may

understate the short—run responsiveness of inflation to changes in

monetary policy. Finally, and perhaps most important, a substantial

segment of the economics profession considers inflation to be a monetary

phenomenon not only in the long run, but also in the short run. Re-

garding changes in the money supply as basically exogenous, this group

views real variables like real GNP and unemployment as contemporaneously

determined, and therefore is likely to suspect that our basic equation

is plagued by simultaneity problems.

     The relationship between the money supply and the unemployment

variable appearing in our basic equation can be described concisely in

three equations. First, the rate of growth of nominal GNP          by

definition equals the sum of the growth rates of money (mr) and velocity




     (9)
                y m+v.
                                                                    36

To simplify the subsequent exposition, we shall treat the change in

velocity as a serially independent random variable with mean zero and

constant variance, but shall consider the impact of other assumptions in

the discussion of the empirical results presented below. A second

identity links the growth rate of real output () to the growth of

nominal GNP and prices, and, by substitution of (9), to the growth rate

of the money supply:


     (10)                                m + v —
                            Pt                     Pt.

The third equation is an "Okun's Law" relation between the weighted un-

employment rate (U) and the ratio of actual to natural real GNP

Here we rewrite equation (1) above, neglecting the lagged terms,


     (11)           =   +            + e,

where e is an error term. Taking first differences, (11) can be con-

verted into a relationship between the change in the unemployment rate

and the deviation of actual from natural real GNP growth:27

                w                    *
     (12)     AU =               —       +

     In our basic inflation equation (5) above, the real demand variable

was given the general designation "X," which could stand for the real CNP

ratio (Q), the weighted unemployment rate (UW), or some other proxy. The

empirical version of our equation as estimated in Tables 2 and 3 uses the

weighted unemployment rate to represent "X" and can be written in its

general form by substituting "Uk" for "X" in equation (5):
                                                                              37

        (13)         Pt =      +                         + y3U +        +
                                   y1(p lt°t +

To replace the unemployment change variable by the change in the nominal

money supply, we substitute equation (10) into (12), and (12) into (13).

After rearranging, the new inflation equation becomes:


                     Pt =                                + y2U + y3(m_q) + y4z +

to note that the condition for monetary neutrality in (14) is no longer

a unitary coefficient on lagged inflation, but rather that the coefficients

on lagged inflation and on monetary growth sum to unity.28

        The consequences of inserting a monetary growth rate variable into

our basic inflation equation are illustrated in Table 4. To simplify the

presentation, the table displays only the coefficients on the level and

change of unemployment, and on the rate of change of the money supply.

Throughout the M1B definition of the money supply is used. The results

hinge on the length of the lag allowed on the monetary variable. When

only the current and four lagged values are allowed to be entered, as in

section "A" of the table, the impact of the monetary variable is minor.

But when the lag distribution is extended to include 24 past monetary

values, there is a substantial improvement in the fit of the equation. No

results are shown for intermediate lag lengths, as a result of experiments

that indicate a deterioration in fit when the lag distribution is trun-

cated in the range between 8 and 20 lagged values.

        Line A2 adds the current and four lagged values of M1B change to the

basic unconstrained inflation equation displayed in line Al. There is an

                          Notes to Table 4

a.   The "basic equation" is unconstrained and is identical to that

     estimated in Table 2, column (3), with the single exception that the

     change in the social security tax rate is entered only as a current

     value, not as a current and four lagged values. This deletion of the

     insignificant lagged social security tax variables is required by

     space limitations in our regression package and is carried out uni-

     formly in Table 4.

b.   In section A of the table, the monetary growth variable is entered

     in the form of the current and four lagged values, with no constraints

     on the lag distribution.

c.   In section B of the table, the monetary growth variable is entered

     in the form of the current and 24 lagged values, with the lag

     distribution estimated to lie along a fourth—degree polynomial

     with a zero end—point constraint.
                                                                  40


insignificant sum of coefficients on money, and the F ratio on the joint

significance of the monetary variables in line A2 is only 0.70, compared

to the 5 percent critical value of 2.33. When the unemployment change

variable is omitted in line A3, the sum of coefficients on the money

change variable becomes significant, but the F ratio (comparing lines

A3 and A4) is still only 1.00, indicating that a higher coefficient on

unemployment in line A4 substitutes for part of the contribution of the

monetary variable in line A3. Thus a monetary change variable in the

form of the current and four lagged values does not add any significant

explanatory power and appears mainly to be a substitute for the unemploy-

ment change variable.

     The results are more favorable to a monetary explanation of inflation,

however, when the lag distribution is stretched out to 24 quarters. All

of the lag distributions displayed in section B of Table 4 share two

common features. First, they are highly bimodal, with a peak in the cur-

rent quarter, then a trough, and a second peak in quarters 14—18. Second,

their mean lag lengths are quite long (counting the current quarter as

"zero," and the first quarter as "one," the mean lags in the four lines

of section B are, respectively, 9.6, 10.2, 8.4, and 10.4 quarters). The

addition of the long—lag monetary variable not only improves the fit of

the equation, but also substantially reduces the size and significance of

the coefficient on the level of unemployment. Comparing lines Al and Bl,

the F ratio on the joint significance of the monetary variables is 3.31,

compared to a 5 percent critical value of 2.50. Omission of both unemploy-

ment variables in line B3 results in a significant loss of explanatory

power; the F ratio that compares lines Al and A3 is 4.36, compared to the
                                                                       41

critical value of 3.13. Thus it appears that the long—lag money growth

variable and at least one unemployment variable (level or rate of change)

does better in explaining inflation that either variable alone.

     Finally, line B4 shows the marked deterioration in fit when the

lagged inflation variables are removed, resulting in a F ratio of 2.28

compared to a critical value of 2.03. Thus an adequate description of the

inertia in the inflation process appears to require inclusion of both

lagged money and lagged inflation variables, rather than either lagged

variable alone. An extra experiment, not shown in Table 4, was to fit

separate lag distributions on money for the first and last halves of the

sample period. The F ratio on the inclusion of the extra lag distribution

on money is 0.33, compared to a critical value of 2.50.

     How do the implications of the best—fitting equation in line Bi of

Table 4 differ from those of the basic unconstrained equation (column (3)

of Table 2 and line Al of Table 4)? The main difference is that the

equation including money exhibits long—run instability, with a sum of

coefficients on the money and lagged inflation variables summing to 1.80

in the first half of the sample period and to 1.35 in the last half. In

contrast the sums of coefficients on lagged inflation in the basic un-

constrained equation are 1.01 and 1.03, respectively. The estimated

effects of the supply shift variables are similar, with almost identical

coefficients on the productivity deviation and the food—energy effect

in the monetary version, and a smaller coefficient on the minimum wage and

social security taxes. It is somewhat surprising that the inclusion of

the monetary variable does not reduce the impact of the foreign exchange

rate; instead that coefficient increases from —0.11 to —0.15.
                                                                        42

     The interpretation of the monetary equation in line Bi is influenced by

our unrealistic assumption in equation (9) above that changes in velocity

could be treated as a serially uncorrelated variable with mean zero and

constant variance. In fact the change in velocity over the sample period

has been about three percent per annum (Table 1 above), and this trend is

absorbed in the constant term of the equation. The relation between

nominal GNP and money may also explain why the coefficients in line Bi ex-

hibit long—run instability. This comes primarily from the high elasticity

of nominal GNP changes to changes in the money supply, rather than from

instability in the basic inflation process. In the vector autoregressive

equation explaining nominal GNP changes presented in Table 5 below, the

sum of coefficients on lagged money in the nominal GNP equation is 1.68

(this finding is parallel to the income elasticity of the demand for Ml

of 0.6—0.7 found in studies by Goldfeld and others).29 A version of line

Bl in Table 4 with nominal GNP changes replacing the money supply ex-

hibits less long—run instability; the sum of coefficients in the last

half of the sample period on nominal GNP plus the lagged inflation varia-

bles is 1.10, in contrast to 1.35 when the money supply is included as on

line B1.30

     Despite the modest improvement in fit in the equations that include

money or nominal GNP, there is no change in the conclusion that inertia

plays a major role in the inflation process, due to the long mean lags in

the influence of both money and past inflation. A complete analysis of the

policy implications of the alternative equations, including their predic-

tions regarding the output loss that would accompany a policy of steadily

decelerating monetary growth, is contained in part VIII below.

 Granger Causality Results


     Recently considerable attention has been given to the concept of

"Granger causality" as a useful way of describing relations among time

series. A series X is said to cause another series Y if the inclusion of

lagged values of X significantly improves the fit of regression equations

explaining Y that also include lagged values of Y and other available

past information. In a recent survey of this literature John Geweke has

found that tests in autoregressive models are as good as or superior to

other methods for testing causal orderings in time series.3'

     It is interesting to compare the results of Geweke's tests to ours,

and to replicate his findings for our data and sample period. Geweke's

major conclusion supports our results that inertia plays a major role in

the postwar U.S. inflation process. He finds that feedback from Ml to

nominal GNP "seems to arise mostly from the relationship between money

and real GNP. The hypothesis that Ml and the GNP deflator are uncorrelated

at all leads and lags cannot be rejected at the 10 percent level when

seasonally adjusted data are used."32 This, however, is a result

characterizing business cycle frequencies. In the long run, feedback from

Ml to real GNP nearly vanishes, and almost all of the long run variance

in prices is attributed to innovations in Ml. Finally, there is some

evidence of feedback from nominal and real GNP to Ml at "those frequencies

where transactions demand would lead us to expect it."

     Table 5 reports on tests similar to those of Geweke for the same

1954—30 sample period as our basic inflation equation, in contrast to

his study of the earlier 1949—69 interval. The endogenous variables in-

cluded are the same inflation, unemployment level, and money change

variables used in Table 4. Nominal GNP change is not included in the

inflation or unemployment equations to minimize multicollinearity. All

data are seasonally adjusted, and all equations include a constant and

trend term, six unconstrained distributed lags on the other endogenous

variables, and (unlike Geweke's test) the set of exogenous supply variables

that appear in our basic inflation equation.33 The numbers reported in

the table are F ratios on the inclusion of the six lagged values of the

variables listed across the tops of the columns.

     The results appear basically consistent with those of Geweke,

despite the inclusion of 11 years of data after the end of his sample period.

Lagged inflation is the main variable driving inflation, reflecting

inertia. Short—run feedback from M1B change to inflation is marginally

significant, whereas short—run feedback from unemployment to inflation is

surprisingly insignificant. The short—run feedback from money change to

unemployment is stronger than that from money to prices, as in Geweke's

study, while we also confirm that feedback between money and nominal GNP

runs almost entirely between the former and the latter. Because all equa-

tions exclude current endogenous variables, these results do not rule out

contemporaneous feedback between money and nominal GNP.


     Taken together, the results in Tables 4 and 5 tell a consistent

story in which monetary innovations cause changes in nominal GNP, real

GNP, and unemployment in the short run, and in the inflation rate in the

long run. The price level is neither perfectly flexible nor perfectly
                                                                    46


inflexible in response to monetary innovations. There is a substantial

short—run response, channeled entirely through unemployment variables in

conventional Phillips curves and in our basic inflation equation, and

through a combination of unemployment and money variables in Tables 4 and

5. As this initial effect feeds back through the lagged inflation varia—

bles, the responsiveness of inflation to monetary innovations becomes

larger and that of real GNP and unemployment becomes smaller. It is the

task of our simulation experiments in part VIII to quantify the short—run

and long—run responsiveness of inflation to monetary innovations, and to

test whether the simulation results are sensitive to the direct inclusion

of monetary variables in the inflation equation.

             VI. THE ROLE OF WAGE EQUATIONS AND

                        "WAGE-WAGE FEEDBACK"


     Our explanation of the U.S. postwar inflation process in this paper

differs from most previous studies not only in its stress on supply—shift

variables, but also in its omission of an equation explaining the be—

baylor of wages. Any inertia in the wage—setting process is captured by

the patterns of coefficients on the lagged inflation variables in the

inflation equation itself. Several considerations call for an examination

of wage determination and parallel equations that explain price change

relative to wage change. First, a dynamic simulation of our basic

single—equation explanation as compared to a two—equation wage—price

model can help to determine which approach provides the best fit to

inflation data within the sample period. Second, simulations for future

periods under different monetary regimes can compare the dynamic responsive-

ness of one—equation and two—equation systems. Third, estimation of wage

equations is required to test a maintained hypothesis in our original

specification in equation (2) that wage change depends on past price

change, not past wage change. Fourth, the hypothesis of wage—wage inertia,

which has played a major role in recent empirical research and in theore-

tical analyses of the inflation process by Hall and Okun, needs to be

tested directly.

     Table 6 is an extension of Table 2. Column (1) in Table 6 is our

basic unconstrained inflation equation, exactly the same equation as in

column (3) of Table 2. All the unemployment and supply—shift variables

are entered identically in every equation in Table 6, and the only difference

b.   The lagged wage variable in column (2) is the quarterly change in the

     in column (3) is the inflation rate plus the same productivity trend.

is in the choice of current wage or price change as the dependent variable,

and in the choice of lagged wages or prices (or both) as an explanatory

variable.

     Columns (2) and (3) report price mark—up and wage equations that

correspond to the original specification in equations (2) and (3). Be-

cause it is difficult to determine a priori which of the supply—shift

variables influences the price mark—up and which influences wages, all

of those variables are entered in each column. The implications of the two—

equation system can be compared to the single equation in column (1) by

summing coefficients across columns (2) and (3). Such a summation yields

roughly consistent results for the inertia variables, the productivity

deviation, food and energy prices, and the social security tax. But in

the two—equation system the combined impact of the unemployment variables

and the Nixon controls appears to be greater, while the influence of the

minimum wage rate vanishes. A surprise in the two—equation system is the

fact that both the level and rate—of—change effects for unemployment are

significant in both the price mark—up and wage equations. This differs

from past studies, including my own, which have typically included only

a level term in the wage equation and only a rate—of—change term in

the price mark—up equation.35 Another unexpected result is that current

and lagged increases in food and energy prices significantly boost the

rate of wage change, even when lagged changes in the GNP deflator are in-

cluded in the wage equation. This tends to argue against the simple wage—

wage view stressed by Hall and Okun.

     Two direct tests of wage—wage inertia are provided in columns (4)

and (5) of Table 6. Column (4) replaces the lagged inflation variables of
                                                                        51

column (3) with lagged wage change variables, resulting in a 23 percent

increase in the unexplained variance. The statistical weakness of the

wage—wage explanation is surprising, since feedback is allowed from food

and energy prices to wages. Another test in column (5) enters both lagged

inflation and wage change in the wage equation. The result is a sum of

coefficients on lagged inflation that is close to unity, and on lagged

wage change that is of the incorrect sign and is insignificantly different

from zero.36 When column (5) is reestimated with the difference between

lagged wage and price change entered instead of lagged wage change itself,

the resulting sum of coefficients is —0.55, rather than the coefficient

of 1.0 that would be required to validate pure wage—wage inertia.37 Over-

all, lagged inflation contributes significant explanatory power in wage

equations and seems superior to the alternative hypothesis of wage—wage

inertia. Simultaneity problems do not influence these results, since

current inflation is not included as a right—hand variable in any of the

wage equations in Table 6. I have previously attributed the influence of

lagged prices in wage equations to the importance of shifts in labor

demand along a relatively inelastic supply curve for labor.38

    Additional hypotheses can be tested with the structure of wage and

price equations displayed in Table 6, but most of these are outside of the

scope of this paper. One issue which has received much recent attention

is the inflationary impact of the treatment of homeownership in the Con-

sumer Price Index.39 When the difference between the change in the CPI

and in the fixed—weight GNP deflator is entered into the basic wage

equation in Table 6, column (3), in the form of eight lagged values, the

resulting sum of coefficients is 0.35 with a t   ratio   of 2.1. When the
                                                                  52

same variable is entered into the basic inflation equation in column (1),

the sum of coefficients is 0.35 with a t ratio of 1.7. The F ratio on

the inclusion of this extra lag distribution in the inflation equation

is 1.44, as compared to the 5 percent critical value of 2.50. Thus it

appears that differences in measurement procedures between the CPI and

GNP deflator affect the overall inflation process, and that this effect

is channeled through the use of the CPI as an escalator in wage contracts.

This additional variable is not included in the basic inflation equation

used in the simulations described in the next two sections, because it

is clearly endogenous (depending on interest rates) and for an adequate

treatment would require that we go beyond the scope of this paper by

building a model of interest—rate behavior. Fortunately this omission

is not a serious one, since the significance level of the CPI variable

is marginal, and because its inclusion causes only minor changes in

other coefficients.

    VII. COIJNTERFACTIJAL SIMULATIONS WITHIN THE SAMPLE PERIOD


     Our inflation equation can be used to measure the quantitative

impact of specific supply shifts and of alternative demand policies.

Every simulation illustrated in this section is "dynamic," that is,

applies the fitted coefficients on the lagged dependent variable to

those generated within the simulation rather than to the actual historical

values. We first present simulations in which the actual values of the

unemployment and productivity variables are entered. Next, equations are

added that explain unemployment, productivity, and the foreign exchange

rate, in order to allow us to examine the responsiveness of inflation

to alternative counterf actual demand policies.


Tracking Ability in Dynamic Simulations

     The inflation equation included in all simulations in Parts VII and

VIII is the constrained version listed in Table 2, column (6). This

equation was estimated in a form that constrains the sum of coefficients

on the lagged dependent variable to be unity, so that the equation can

track a steady state relation between money growth and inflation in our

simulations of hypothetical future demand management policies. The equa—

tion, as in Table 2, also includes small coefficients on dummy variables

for the first and last halves of the l970s (these were the dummy varia-

bles used to compute the shifts in the natural rate of unemployment,

as listed at the bottom of page 28).

     The first pair of columns in Table 7 compares four—quarter averages

of the actual inflation rate with those fitted in a dynamic single equa-

tion simulation of the 1971—80 period, that is, a simulation in which

fitted values of the lagged dependent variable are fed back into the

equation but all other variables are taken as exogenous. The cumulative

error is —1.06 percent, meaning that the actual price level is about one

percent less than the simulated price level after ten years, so that the

mean error in tracking the inflation rate is only —O.l() percent per year.

The standard error of the simulation (not shown in the table) is 0.751,

close to the 0.785 standard error listed in Table 2 for the estimated

equation over the entire 1954—80 period. For purposes of comparison, an

identical simulation was computed for a two—equation model containing the

wage and price mark—up equations listed in Table 6, column (2) and (3).

The resulting standard error for the inflation rate over the same period

was 0.833, indicating an increase in the unexplained variance of about

20 percent. This confirms that wage equations, while interesting in

their own right, are not necessary for a historical understanding of the

U.S. inflation process. By way of contrast, a dynamic simulation of

the best—fitting equation that directly enters lagged changes in the

money supply (Table 4, line Bl) has a standard error of 0.751, exactly

the same as the basic equation.

     A more challenging task is to track historical inflation rates in

a three—equation model in which the unemployment rate and productivity

deviation are made endogenous. The inflation equation is the same as

before, but equations are added that explain changes in the unemployment

rate and the productivity deviation as a function of current and lagged

changes in the output ratio (i.e., ratio of real to natural real GNP).

The unemployment equation is a first—difference version of our "Okun's

Law" equation (1) above, and the productivity equation reflects the lagged
                                                                      56

adjustment of hours to changes in output. Detailed listings of coefficients

and further comments on these "auxiliary" equations are contained in

Appendix A. The purpose of the three—equation model is to allow changes

in both the inflation and unemployment rates to be calculated for changes

in the exogenous supply shift variables and for specified time paths of

nominal GNP. When nominal CNP is specified, an identity can be used to

calculate the change in the output ratio corresponding to any inflation

rate, and then the auxiliary equations can be used to compute the unem-

ployment rate and productivity deviation. An iterative procedure is used

to make the initial given inflation rate converge to that predicted by

the inflation equation.

     The third column of Table 7 shows the fitted values of the inflation

rate in a dynamic simulation of the three—equation model. The cumulative

and mean errors are actually smaller than those in the simulations of the

one—equation model. Columns (4) and (5) show how closely the unemploy—

ment rate can be tracked in this simple model that takes nominal GNP and

the supply shift variables as exogenous, and uses coefficients estimated

from the full 1954—80 period, but which uses no information on the actual

values of inflation, unemployment, or the productivity deviation after

1970 in the calculations of the fitted values.

     The bottom section (B) of the table repeats the simulations for the

last three years of the sample period. The results are very close to those

from the decade—long sample period. The most interesting, and potentially

serious, error in all the inflation simulations is the tendency to pre-

dict too high an inflation rate in 1979 and too low a rate in 1980.
                                                                      57


Decomposing the Impact of Supply Shifts

     The estimated impact of the various supply shift variables in the

inflation equation can be calculated by successively setting each to zero

in dynamic simulations like those of Table 7.   Should the unemployment

rate or nominal GNP be chosen as the exogenous variable in these counter—

factual simulations? Either choice is unsatisfactory. This can be seen

in Table 8, where column (1) repeats the fitted values from the single—

equation simulation that treats unemployment as exogenous (Table 7, col-

umn (2)), and where column (2) computes an artificial inflation series

by setting equal to zero the coefficients on changes in the relative

prices of food and energy, the foreign exchange rate, productivity

deviation, effective minimum wage rate and social security tax, and on

the Nixon control dummy variables. The result in column(2) is an es-

timated increase in the inflation rate from 5.3 in 1971 to 6.1 percent

in 1973, followed by a decline to 3.7 percent in 1980. This time path

reflects, of course, the historical fact that the unemployment rate

dipped below our estimate of the natural unemployment rate in 1972—73,

and again in 1979, but was above the natural rate during the rest of the

decade. This is an unrealistic simulation of a world without supply

shocks, because much of the high unemployment experienced during 1974—77

and in 1980 was a direct result of the supply shocks themselves, so it is

doubtful that the low simulated 1980 inflation rate would have been

achieved.

     On the other hand, simulations with the growth of nominal GNP or

the money supply treated as exogenous and with supply shifts suppressed

lead to a predicted 1980 inflation rate of 8.1 percent and an unemploy—

ment rate of 4.5 percent. This is equally unrealistic, because much of

the acceleration in nominal GNP and money growth after 1975 occurred as

policymakers partially accommodated the supply shifts in order to prevent

a larger increase in unemployment than actually occurred. The growth in

nominal GNP, money, and prices would all have been lower in the late 1970s

in the absence of supply shifts. The fact that 1980 inflation without

supply shifts and with nominal GNP exogenous is predicted to 8.1 percent,

only slightly less than the predicted 8.8 percent with supply variables

included, illustrates the neutrality property displayed by our estimated

inflation equation——over a period as long as a decade, inflation depends

almost entirely on the growth of nominal demand, and supply shifts serve

mainly to influence the unemployment rate.


    The right—hand section of Table 8 illustrates the estimated effects

of the separate right—hand variables when unemployment is exogenous.

The figures show the extra inflation in each year contributed when the

estimated coefficients of the listed variable are included in the equa-

tion as compared to the inflation that occurs when the coefficients are

set at zero. It is not surprising to find that the most important of

the supply—shift variables in contributing to inflation was the change

in the relative price of food and energy, followed by the change in the

foreign exchange rate.'0 The lack of importance of the productivity

deviation is explained not just by the small size of its coefficient,

but also by the fact that the step—like slowing of the productivity

trend is estimated from the entire sample period, so that the mean of the
                                                                      60

productivity deviation is zero (see footnote 22 above)     The impact of

the minimum wage rate and social security tax is minor, enough to con-

tribute about half a point of inflation in 1980 and a two—percent higher

price level in that year. Finally, the cumulative effect of the Nixon

controls   is negative despite the fact that the "on" and "off" co-
efficients are equal; this result is an artifact of the dynamic simulation,
which   allows any variable having an early impact a longer change to be

built into the lagged dependent variable than another variable having a

later impact.'


To Accorivnodate or Not to Accommodate?


        After the first OPEC oil shock in 1973—74 economists debated the

merits of accommodating the shock by allowing a one—time jump in the money

supply to "pay for" the jump in oil prices. Other economists argued that

in this circumstance, as in all other circumstances, the best policy was

a constant growth rate rule for the money supply. In this section we

present the verdict of our inflation equation regarding the costs and

benefits of alternative monetary policies after the first OPEC shock.

        In the previous section we described the auxiliary equations that

generated paths for the unemployment rate and productivity deviation with

nominal GNP treated as exogenous. In this section we need to go further

and allow for the impact of monetary policy on inflation through the

channel of changes in the foreign exchange rate. Although a complete

treatment of exchange rate determination requires a consideration of

differentials between domestic and foreign interest rates, an exchange—

rate equation is presented in Appendix A that provides a surprisingly
                                                                     61

good fit to data for 1972—80 including as exogenous variables only the

growth rates of money, nominal GNP, and the relative price of food and

energy. When this equation is joined by a simple vector autoregressive

equation that explains nominal GNP changes by its own lagged values and

by current and lagged changes in the money supply, it is possible to

generate alternative scenarios corresponding to different monetary growth

rates. The basic inflation equation plus the four auxiliary equations

allow five variables to be treated as endogenous—--inflation, unemployment,

the productivity deviation, and the growth rates of nominal GNP and the

effective exchange rate.

     Table 9 shows the impact of two counterfactual monetary growth paths.

The first is a "constant growth—rate rule" (CGRR) path that sets M1B

growth each year exactly 2.0 points above the growth rate of natural real

GNP. Because the latter declines between 1975 and 1980, the CGRR path

for M1B growth in Table 9 also displays a deceleration. The second

"accommodative jump" path is designed to generate the same cumulative

growth in M1B that actually occurred between 1975:Ql and l980:Q4 but in a

different time configuration, with an initial jump followed by a CGRR

policy that sets the rate one percentage point faster than the "pure"

CGRR policy. This hypothetical policy is displayed only to show the

mechanical properties of the model, since it is unlikely that the Federal

Reserve could actually achieve such precise control of the money supply.

     The results show the expected reduction of inflation and increase in

unemployment under the pure CCRR path. But the tradeoff is more favorable

than in the typical simulation of large—scale econometric models. By the

end of 1980 the inflation rate is three percentage points lower with CGRR,

               solution that enters the actual growth rate of money.

while the unemployment rate is about one percentage point higher. The

cumulative loss in output over the six—year simulation is only 5.7 per-

cent of real GNP. The alternative accommodative jump" path, as would be

expected, initially generates more inflation and a reduction in the unem-

ployment rate, but then generates the reverse as money growth rates fall

below those that actually occurred. The cumulative loss in output relative

to the actual path taken by the money supply is negligible, only 0.4 per-

cent of real GNP. In both cases, however, the cumulative output loss

figure is an understatement by ignoring the further losses that would

occur if the simulation were allowed to run after 1980.

          VIII. SIMULATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE POLICIES


Limitations of Simulations Across Policy Reimes

        Simulations of our basic inflation equation are of interest only

if the parameters will remain invariant to alternative hypothetical

policy regimes.2 Is there reason to believe that key parameters would

shift between a world of 7 percent monetary growth and a world of 2 per-

cent monetary growth? Such a policy change, although it seems drastic

from the perspective of 1981, would simply throw into reverse the policy

shift that allowed the growth rate of M1B to accelerate from 2 percent in

1954—64 to 7 percent in 1976—80 (see Table 1 above).3 Our confidence in

the relevance of policy simulations is bolstered by the finding in Part

IV that a Chow test fails to reject the null hypothesis that the first

half of our sample period obeys the same inflation equation as the last

half.

        Two sets of parameters are allowed to shift in our basic inflation

equation. First, the lag distribution on past inflation is fitted

separately to the first and last halves of the sample period, with the

conclusion that the mean lag shortened from about 11 to about 7 quarters.

Would a reversal to an earlier monetary policy regime cause the lag to

lengthen? This would occur if agents became less concerned about in-

flation and were willing to accept a greater fraction of nominal contracts

in preference to escalated contracts. I doubt that such a shift is likely

in the near future, because agents will want to experience a substantial

period of stable prices before abandoning indexed contracts. Another con-

sequence of rapid monetary growth has been the advent of the flexible ex-

change rate system, which in our inflation equation makes the inflation
                                                                    65

rate more responsive to variations in money growth. While a stable in-

flation rate in the U.S. is unlikely to cause a return from flexible ex-

change rates to Bretton Woods, nevertheless the likely impact of U.S.

monetary policy on other nations needs to be considered explicitly in any

simulation of future events.

     As is illustrated below, the inclusion of the foreign exchange rate

variable allows our model to generate a sharp slowdown in the inflation

rate in a relatively short time with a relatively low cost in terms of

lost output. This occurs because a slowdown in the rate of monetary

growth relative to nominal GNP growth, as occurs during a transition

period before nominal GNP growth responds, is estimated to cause an ap-

preciation of the exchange rate (the events of 1980:Q4 and l981:Ql demon-

strate the responsiveness of the exchange rate to changes in interest

rates and in the growth of velocity). In addition, the subsequent slow-

down in nominal GNP growth is estimated to cause an additional apprecia-

tion. If it were interpreted literally, our foreign—exchange—rate equation

would predict a continuous and permanent appreciation following a return

to low rates of growth in money and nominal GNP, with continuous down-

ward pressure on the inflation rate. This would be unrealistic, however,

because the exchange—rate equation contains no variables for other nations,

and they would surely respond to a new monetary regime in the U.S. All

our simulations assume a response by other nations after two years, and

this is implemented by making the exchange rate respond not to nominal GNP

growth itself, but rather to the difference between current nominal GNP

growth and a four—quarter moving average of nominal CNP growth two years

earlier. Following the arrival of money at its new lower steady state,
                                                                     66

this treatment causes the exchange—rate appreciation to disappear after

roughly two years.

     Our inflation equation implies that the impact of high interest

rates caused bymonetary restriction is to dampen inflation through the

exchange—rate effect. This impact might be mitigated by two other ef-

fects of high interest rates that are ignored, those operating through

capital costs and through the CPI measurement error. In previous research

I was unable to find an effect of interest rates on inflation through the

capital—cost channe1. As for the CPI channel, its omission is a defect

of the simulations, but there may be two offsetting implications. Ini-

tially a restrictive monetary policy raises both nominal and real interest

rates, boosting the CPI and adding to inflation. But then as other

variables, particularly the unemployment rate and the exchange rate,

cause inflation to decelerate, the nominal interest rate will fall relative

to the real rate, and this will reduce the growth of the CPI relative to

the GNP deflator and help to decelerate the GNP deflator further.

     Our simulations are all based on specified growth paths for the

growth of the money supply (M1B). Some "cold turkey" simulations are

based on an instantaneous 5 percent drop in the rate of monetary growth.

Like the "accommodative jump" simulation described in the previous sec-

tion, the "cold turkey" experiments assume an unrealistic degree of con-

trol by the Federal Reserve over the money supply. They are presented not

because they are plausible, but to allow the characteristics of the model

simulations to be clearly perceived in the figures. A final qualification

is that the relation between nominal GNP growth and M1B growth is deter-

mined by an equation estimated to the entire 1954—80 sample period. If
                                                                       67

financial innovations or the flexible exchange rate system have altered

the relationship between nominal GNP and money in the last few years,

our simulations may contain an error. We may, for instance, have under-

stated the growth in the velocity of M1B if financial innovations have

accelerated the movement into other assets. In addition, we have ig-

nored the impact of an exchange—rate appreciation in reducing the foreign

trade surplus, thus creating a channel of negative feedback from exchange

rates to velocity.




The Control Solution and the Arithmetic of Disinflation


     The U.S. economy was not in long—run equilibrium in early 1981,

thus posing a problem in the choice of a benchmark for our policy simula-

tions. In the eight quarters ending in 1980:Q4 the growth of M1B

averaged 7.1 percent at an annual rate. Our nominal—GNP equation pre-

dicts that maintenance of that money growth rate permanently would be

associated with a 10.3 percent growth rate of nominal GNP, reflecting

the historical behavior of velocity. Since the excess of nominal GNP

growth over natural real GNP growth, roughly 7.5 percent in this case,

must be equal to the inflation rate in the long run, the U.S. inflation

rate of 9.3 percent in 1980 was almost two percentage points above the

long—run equilibrium rate.5 Turning the arithmetic around, if we ig-

nore the possibility of faster growth in velocity or slower growth in

natural real GNP than we have assumed, a steady state with 9.3 percent

inflation would require M1B growth of 9 percent.

     The situation of the U.S. economy in early 1981 is explained by the

supply shocks and exchange rate changes of 1977—80 that pushed the
                                                                       68

inflation rate above the long—run equilibrium level, together with over-

shooting in response to the acceleration of nominal demand growth in the

late 1970s. Because our dynamic simulations set all of the supply shift

variables equal to zero after l981:Ql, they exhibit the property that

continuation of 7 percent growth in M1B will cause the inflation rate to

fall to 7.3 percent while the unemployment rate is declining to its

natural rate of 6.0 percent. The elimination of adverse supply shifts

itself creates a beneficial supply shift, allowing policymakers to achieve

a simultaneous reduction in inflation and unemployment, just as occurred

in the. U.S. between 1975 and 1976. The relatively optimistic set of

simulations presented here reflects the assumed absence of further in-

creases in the relative price of food and energy, or in the effective

social security tax and effective minimum wage.46

     To avoid confusing the deceleration of the inflation rate that

would occur with continued 7 percent M1B growth and the further deceler-

ation that would accompany a slower monetary growth, our control solution

displayed as the dotted line in Figure la sets the monetary growth rate

at 9 percent in order to generate a long—run inflation rate equal to the

1980 rate of 9.3 percent.47 As is the case in all of the dynamic simula-

tions in this part of the paper, the simulation extends from l981:Q1

to 199l:Q4, and uses the four auxiliary equations of Appendix A to

translate specified patterns of monetary growth into the unemployment,

productivity deviation, and exchange rate variables that appear on the

right—hand side of our basic inflation equation from Table 2, column (6).

The zig—zag pattern displayed in Figure la by the control solution in

1981 and 1982 reflects the response of the foreign exchange rate to the

deceleration of the monetary growth to 9 percent from an extremely rapid

12 percent annual rate in the last half of 1980. This exchange—rate

effect soon dies out, and the control solution thereafter smoothly ap-

proaches the long—run values of 9.3 percent inflation and 6.0 percent

unemployment indicated by the open circle in Figure la.




The   "Cold Turkey" and   "Voicker" Approaches to Disinflation


      A dramatic contrast is provided by the "cold turkey" solution which

suddenly and permanently reduces M1B growth to 4.0 percent in 1981:Q1,

implying a long—run equilibrium inflation rate of 4.4 percent, shown by

the open circle labelled "LR" in Figure la. The economy's adjustment

to this monetary shock is surprisingly rapid, with inflation falling to

4.4 percent by 1984, and then overshooting for the rest of the decade

as a result of the high unemployment rates reached during the process of

adjustment. The cold turkey simulation presents a more optimistic view

regarding the possibility of achieving a permanent reduction in the in-

flation rate than is implied by the consensus of existing large—scale

econometric models. Arthur Okun popularized the view that the cost of

a permanent one—percentage—point reduction in the inflation rate is 10

percent of a year's GNP, or a 50 percent output loss to cut inflation by

five percentage points.8 In contrast, the cumulative loss of output in

the cold turkey simulation as opposed to the control solution is 29 per-

cent, as shown on line id of Table 10. As shown on the same line, con-

tributing to the relative degree of optimism in this simulation is the

behavior of the foreign exchange rate, which in 1991 is 35 percent higher

with the cold turkey policy than with the control solution policy.

     The effect of an alternative and more realistic monetary policy is

illustrated in Figure lb. Corresponding to the stated intention of the

Federal Reserve Board to achieve a deceleration in NiB growth of one—half

percentage point per year, the "Voicker path" slows money growth at that

pace from 6.9 percent in 1980:Q4 to 4.0 percent (reached in l985:Q4).

Corresponding to the gradualist nature of this policy, the inflation

rate decelerates more slowly and the peak unemployment rate is 7.8 per-

cent as compared to 8.5 percent under cold turkey. The period of high

unemployment lasts longer, however, accounting for the fact that the

cumulative output loss under the two disinflationary policies is almost

identical, as is the cumulative appreciation of the dollar.


Sensitivity of Simulation Results to Specification Changes

     Our analysis of historical dynamic simulations in Part VII reported

that data for 1971—80 could be tracked equally well by our basic equa-

tion and by an alternative equation that added a long distributed lag of

past changes in the money supply (equivalent to Table 4, line Bi). We

also tested the tracking ability of a wage equation combined with a price

mark—up equation (Table 6, columns (2) and (3)) and found a substantial

deterioration in tracking ability. The behavior of the economy in re-

sponse to a Voicker path of monetary deceleration is simulated with the

money and wage—price equations and is compared with the basic equation in

Figure lb. Each of these simulations shares in common the same auxiliary

equations, and thus identical time paths of money, nominal GNP, and
                                                                       73

exchange rates. The less responsive the inflation rate, of course, the

greater will be the transitional unemployment rate experienced during

the period of adjustment.9

     The equation that includes lagged money behaves almost identically

to the basic equation through 1985, as shown by the dotted line in Figure

lb. But then the economy seems to "get stuck" at a relatively high rate

of unemployment, leading this simulation to generate a higher cumulative

output loss than the basic equation (Table 10, line 2e). This occurs

because the lagged money terms reduce the coefficient on the level of

unemployment rate almost to zero, thereby eliminating the mechanism by

which the basic equation gravitates to the natural unemployment rate.

The pattern of coefficients on lagged inflation and lagged monetary

changes does not generate the substantial overshooting required to

reduce the unemployment rate to the natural unemployment rate, so in

1991 the unemployment rate is still 7.3 percent. The control solution

displays a tendency to drift in the opposite direction, and yields a

5.1. percent unemployment rate in 1991.

     The wage and price mark—up equations produce an adjustment path

that exhibits more sluggish behavior than the basic equation, and thus

implies higher unemployment rates and a higher cumulative output loss

during the period of adjustment. The cumulative output loss is 46 per-

cent along the Volcker path (Table 10, line 3e), similar to Okun's

estimate of a 50 percent loss, and this is an understatement because the

economy still has not arrived at the natural unemployment rate in 1991.

The sluggish behavior of the wage and price mark—up system reflects
                                                                      74

the longer implicit adjustment lags introduced by the Lnteraction of two

lag distributions, one in each equation. Thus the impact of the higher

unemployment and foreign exchange rates in the wage equation cannot af-

fect inflation until it feeds into the price mark—up equation through a

lag distribution that has a mean lag of 6 quarters.

     Further evidence on the characteristics of the different equations

is provided in Figure 2, where the left frame illustrates the difference

between the cold turkey and control solutions. As shown by the circle

marked "LR," in the long run the difference should be —5 percent for the

inflation rate and zero for the unemployment rate. By 1991 both the

basic equation and the wage/price—mark—up equations have completed

most of their adjustment, with the latter displaying a more sluggish

response and a greater degree of overshooting. The equation that in-

cludes lagged money displays the same tendency to "get stuck" and in 1991

generates an unemployment rate with the cold—turkey policy two percentage

points higher than with the control solution policy. The right—hand

frame of Figure 2 shows that the response of the basic equation becomes

much more sluggish if the foreign—exchange effect is artificially sup-

pressed while the other coefficients remain the same. The cumulative out-

put loss along the cold turkey path rises from 29 percent to 48 percent.

     The degree of response of the inflation rate can be stated alterna-

tively as the percentage of the deceleration in nominal CNP along the

cold—turkey path, as opposed to the control path, taking the form of a

deceleration of inflation. The more rapid response of the basic equation,

and that including lagged money, is clear here in comparison with the

wage/price—mark—up equations:

                    IX. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

     This paper has explored a number of central issues in the relations

among inflation, unemployment, and the foreign exchange rate of the dollar,

and the growth rates of wages and the money supply. The conclusions

should be of equal interest to econometricians attempting to understand

the behavior of the postwar U.S. economy, and to policymakers attempting

to devise a strategy for achieving lower rates of inflation and unemploy-

ment. The main conclusions can be grouped under seven headings.

     1. Alternative Concepts of the Natural Rate of Unemployment. The

natural rate of unemployment, that is, the unemployment rate consistent

with a constant rate of inflation, can be defined either for an existing

set of conditions or for a hypothetical state in which there are no

supply shocks. Our estimate of the "no—shock natural unemployment rate"

is 5.9 percent for 1980. The increase in this rate from 5.1 percent in

1954 is attributed entirely to the shifting demographic composition of

the labor force and of relative unemployment rates. A striking finding

is that the natural rate never fell below 5 percent throughout the 1954—80

period, implying that the 4 percent unemployment goal of the Kennedy and

Johnson Administrations was incompatible with a constant inflation rate.

     2. Variance of Inflation in the 1970s. The behavior of inflation

during the decade between 1971 and 1980 cannot be explained by the simple

ttinertiatt and "labor market tightness" variables included in traditional

Phillips curve equations. Critical additional contributions are made by

changes in the relative prices of food and energy, by changes in the

effective exchange rate of the dollar, and by government intervention in

the form of the Nixon price controls and their termination. Much of the
                                                                       78

 acceleration of inflation in the 1970s is attributed to changes in the

 relative prices of food and oil and in the exchange rate rather than to

 a shortfall of the actual unemployment rate below the natural rate.

Our preferred inflation equation exhibits neutrality with respect to

changes in the nominal money supply——after a decade such nominal dis-

turbances only alter the inflation rate and have no impact on the unem-

ployment rate.


     3, Effect of the Foreign Exchange Rate in the Fast and Future.

The demise of the Bretton Woods system and the advent of floating exchange

rates have increased the responsiveness of the U.S. inflation rate to

monetary policy Changes in the effective exchange rate of the dollar,

through their influence on the prices of exports and import substitutes,

help to explain why inflation was so low in 1976 and why it accelerated

so rapidly between late 1977 and early 1979. Granger causality tests

indicate that lagged exchange rate changes influence inflation but

lagged inflation does not cause exchange rate changes. Most important,

our basic equation that includes the foreign exchange rate predicts that

a policy of ending inflation through restrictive monetary policy would

have a much smaller cost in the form of lost output than an alternative

equation that sets the exchange rate coefficient to zero.

     In the late 1970s it was a commonplace that exchange rate movements

helped to account for the low inflation rates experienced by Switzerland,

West Germany, and Japan. It has been less widely recognized that a

monetary deceleration in the U.S. in the l980s can cause the dollar to

appreciate and reverse the inflation differentials among nations from

those of the 1970s. The counterpart to slower inflation in the U.S., at
                                                                      79

least initially, will be faster inflation and lower real GNP in foreign

countries experiencing depreciations. Policies of exchange rate

stabilization by these countries will require that they duplicate the

monetary restriction initiated by the U.S., thus allowing the U.S. to

achieve a worldwide slowdown in the growth rates of money and prices.


     4. Sensitivity to Specification Changes. The major shifts in the

U.S. inflation process in the last decade have been a faster response

time, measured as a reduction in the mean lag in an inflation equation

on past values of the inflation rate, and the shift to floating exchange

rates. Splits in the sample period indicate that our basic equation is

stable across the first and last halves of the 1954—80 period, but there

is a tendency for the coefficients on the change in unemployment and in

the effective minimum wage to be lower after 1966.

     5.   Direct Impact of Money in the Inflation Process. In our infla—

tion equation, short lags on past changes in the money supply are a sub-

stitute for current changes in the unemployment rate, and long lags are a

substitute for the current level of the unemployment rate. Although

capable of fitting the historical data as well as our basic equation,

versions that include lagged changes in the money supply display implausible

behavior in long—run simulations.


     6. Evidence Against Wage-Wage Inertia. Several dynamic models of

the inflation process——including that of the late Arthur Okun——are based

on the assumption of feedback from lagged wages to current wages, rather

than from lagged prices to current wages as in our model. Several al-

ternative specifications reject the hypothesis of wage—wage inertia. When
                                                                       80


lagged price and wage variables are allowed to compete on equal terms,

the contest is decisively won by lagged price changes.

     7. The Cost of Disinflation. Our basic equation implies that in—

flation can be reduced by five percentage points at the cost of 29 percent

of GNP, or about $760 billion in 1980 prices. This contrasts to the

traditional consensus estimate of a 50 percent output loss (about $1,310

billion). The major factor explaining our more optimistic verdict is the

channel of influence from restrictive monetary. policy to inflation through

the appreciation of the exchange rate. Nevertheless, we support the con-

clusion of the traditional Phillips—curve literature that stopping in-

flation is not costless; our inflation equation predicts that a continua-

tion of current Federal Reserve policy will achieve a four—percent infla-

tion rate by 1987 at the cost of an unemployment rate that remains

modestly above the levels of early 1981 at least until 1988. The costs

of disinflation warrant a continued search for beneficial supply shocks,

e.g., reductions in taxes and regulations that directly raise business

costs and reduce productivity.


Directions for Future Research


     The analysis of the past and likely future behavior of inflation is

inevitably a complex undertaking. Every possible explanatory variable——

both those included in this paper and those excluded from consideration——

can be specified in a several alternative ways and allowed to enter with

alternative lag lengths. While this paper and others in this series have

exhaustively examined a number of variables, questions still remain.
                                                                       81

How sensitive is the impact on inflation of the productivity slowdown to

different specifications of the productivity trend? What accounts for the

weak estimated impact of the social security tax on inflation, i.e.,

which economic sectors bear the burden of the tax and why? Can evidence

be found for a robust effect on inflation of the user cost of capital,

or capital taxes, or personal taxes? Much experimentation not reported

in this paper has convinced me that direct "supply—side" effects of tax

rate changes on the inflation rate are so weak as to be invisible. But

there are numerous unanswered questions that remain, which require both

an improved specification of tax changes and other supply—side effects,

and which can be answered with added assurance only after the passage of

time allows the accumulation of further evidence on the effects of foreign

exchange rates and other central determinants of the U.S. inflation

process.

     6The three papers by Perry cited in the previous footnote contain

the term "inflation" or "wage—price spiral" in their title yet contain only

wage equations. They were influential in leading to the low estimates of

inflation responsiveness popularized by Arthur Okun in "Efficient Dis-

inflationary Policies," American Economic Review, vol. 68 (May 1978), pp.

348—52.


     7Actually the most cited "new classical" empirical work by Barro,

for example, Robert J. Barro and Mark Rush, "Unanticipated Money and

Economic Activity," in Stanley Fischer, ed., Rational Expectations and

Economic Policy (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 23—48, fits an

equation in which the dependent variable is the price level rather than its

rate of change. The failure to difference the price level leads to serial

correlation in the residuals and severely biased coefficients, a classic

example of spurious regression examined in the work of C. W. J. Granger and

P. Newbold, "Spurious Regressions in Econometrics," Journal of Econometrics,

vol. 2 (1974), pp. 111—20, and Charles I. Plosser and G. William Schwert,

Effects of Differencing," Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 4 (1978), pp

     8The level and change of the output ratio were first introduced into

a wage equation in Robert J. Gordon, "Can the Inflation of the 1970s be

Explained?" BPEA, 1:1977, pp. 253—77. See Table 3 on pp. 266—7 and the

     9The 'age—wage" mechanism is stressed by Robert E. Hall, "The Process

of Inflation in the Labor Market," BPEA, 2:1974, pp. 343—93, Arthur Okun,

Prices and Quantities: A Macroeconomic Analysis (Brookings

Institution, 1981), and Perry, "Inflation in Theory and Practice," pp. 207—41,

and in fact dates back to Keynes' view that workers care about relative wage

rates.


    '01f lagged wage change also enters the price equation, then lagged values

of the right—hand variables in the wage equation enter the reduced form equa-

tion (4). In fact the empirical work below allows flexible lags on all variables.


    '1This does not deny a role for the prices of other inputs, for example,

capital or raw materials, since these variables can be entered as relative prices.

See the more complete specification of the price mark—up equation in Robert J.

Gordon, "The Impact of Aggregate Demand on Prices," BPEA, 3:1975, p. 620.


     '2Nominal GNP is estimated from sources like retail sales, investment

surveys, and government expenditure data. The price data used for the de-

flation of individual components of GNP come primarily from the two major

Bureau of Labor Statistics price indexes, the Consumer and Producer Price

Indexes.

     13The fixed—weight wage index was first constructed and used for

quarterly research in Robert J. Gordon, "Inflation in Recession and Re-

covery," BPEA, 1:1971, pp. 105—66.


     14The distinction between backward and forward looking expectations

is discussed by Perry, "Slowing the Wage—Price Spiral," pp. 268—70.


     15The 5 percent F value for the significance of the inverse as com-

pared to the linear form in Table 2, column (1), is only 1.19, compared

to a critical value of 3.98.

     18This is not the conceptually correct variable to include in our

equations that explain the GNP deflator, since no allowance is made for the

price of food and energy exports and imports. The conceptually correct

measure was used in Gordon, "The Impact of Aggregate Demand," pp. 613—620.

There was insufficient time in the preparation of the present paper to

allow the 1975 variable to be reconstructed and updated from the revised

National Accounts, but reestimation of the basic inflation equation for the

1954—75 period using te 1975 variable indicates virtually no change in

results.

quarters.

     22The time trends run between actual levels of nonfarm output per

hour achieved in the first quarter of the sample period (1954:Q2) and three

succeeding quarters when the Perloff—Wachter output ratio was approximately

100 percent: 1964:Q3, 1972:Ql, and 1978:Q4. The extrapolation after 1978:Q4

was computed to correspond to the slowdown in the growth of potential GNP

assumed in the Economic Report of the President, 1980. The computed trend

lines are: 1954:Q2—1964:Q3, 2.56 percent; l964:Q3—1972:Q2, 2.11 percent;

l972:Q2—1978:Q4, 1.22 percent, and after 1978:Q4, 0.5 percent.

exchange rate movements is examined in Jacob Frenkel, "The Collapse of

       25The constraint on the lagged dependent variable is imposed to

simplify the interpretation of the shift in coefficients on the unemploy-

ment variables. Comparisons in unconstrained equations mix together the

impact of shifts in the coefficients on unemployment and on the lagged

inflation variables.

critical value, indicating failure to reject the null hypothesis that

must be equal to the excess of monetary growth over natural output growth,

in £ it, when current values of nominal GNP or money are omitted, and

only the 24 lagged values are included.

     33These are the dummy variables for the Nixon controls; the current

productivity deviation; the current and four lagged values for the changes

tax, and the effective minimum wage; and the current and three lagged

values for the foreign exchange rate.


   34The hypothesis that the U.S. inflation process is characterized by

"nominal wage inertia," while that in other countries is characterized by

"real wage inertia," is central to the papers of Jeffrey D. Sachs, "Wages,

          Although I have never previously included the level of

unemployment or output in a price—change equation, one previous paper of

mine found that the rate of change of real output was more significant

than the Putput ratio in a wage equation that included both. See Gordon,

"Can the Inflation of the l970s be Explained?" Table 3, columns (5) and

(6), p. 266.


     36The lag distributions on past inflation or wage change are estimated

separately in columns (1) through (4) for the first and last halves of the

sample period. A single distribution, without a sample split, is estimated

for both past inflation and wage change in column (5), due to space

limitations in our regression package.

          Recall that exchange rate variable is set to zero before 1975:Q2.

How is the impact of the 1971—73 depreciation to be included? Following

the argument on the top half of page 29 above, we attribute to changes in

the foreign exchange rate (1) the excess of the Nixon "off" coefficient

over the Nixon "on" coefficient, and (2) half of the coefficient on the dummy

variable for 1970—75.


     41The effect of the controls is based on "on" and "off" coefficients

that are set equal to each other, because the estimated excess of the "off"

over the "on" coefficient is attributed to the effects of the exchange rate

rather than the controls (see the previous footnote).

and money to the current money supply was constant across the sub—periods

        45Nominal GNP growth (y) is equal by definition to the sum of the

growth rates of real GNP and the GNP deflator (q + p). This implies

     *             *
y — q      q — q       + p. Since actual and natural real GNP growth must be
                                                    *
equal in the long run, in that situation y — q must be equal to p.

        46A small dash of realism is introduced by allowing the food—energy,

minimum wage, and social security tax variables to assume their actual

values for 1981:Ql.


     471n this part of the paper all figures refer to four—quarter

changes ending in the fourth quarter of the given year. If the 1980

inflation rate of 9.3 percent seems low, this results from our practice

of expressing quarterly growth rates as annual rates by multiplying the

quarterly rate by 4.0 (thus ignoring compounding) and then computing

four—quarter growth rates by adding successive quarterly rates. Com-

pounding (as in Table 8.1 of the National Income and Product Accounts)

yields an inflation rate of 9.6 percent for the four quarters ending in

l980:Q4, in contrast to our 9.3 percent.

     49To allow the money and wage—price equations to generate a long—run

steady state, the relevant sum of coefficients on lagged nominal variables

has been constrained to sum to unity, as in the basic equation.

                              APPENDIX A

              "Auxiliary" Equations Used in Simulations


     The primary purpose of the inflation equations estimated in this

paper is to determine the time path of the economy's adjustment to

demand disturbances and supply shocks. Following a change in the growth

rate of the money supply, which we assume to be under perfect control by

the Federal Reserve, changes occur in four explanatory variables in our

basic inflation equation——the level and change o.f the unemployment rate,

the deviation of productivity growth from its trend, and the change in

the foreign exchange rate. This appendix presents the equations used to

compute the responses of these variables to changes in monetary growth.

     The primary objective in specifying each equation is to exclude

endogenous variables that would require equations of their own, e.g., the

interest rate. An additional objective is to make each equation "neutral"

in the long run with respect to the growth rate of money; after an initial

transition period the model forces productivity to grow at its trend rate,

and the unemployment rate to be constant. Long—run constancy is also im-

posed on the foreign exchange rate. Unless otherwise stated, each equation

is estimated over the same sample period as the basic inflation equation,

1954:Q2 to 1980:Q4.


From Money to Nominal GNP

     The only endogenous variable that enters the model without appearing

in the inflation equation is the difference between nominal GNP growth and

natural real GNP growth        This   is explained entirely by its own lagged


values, and current and lagged changes in the money supply relative to
                                                                                            93

natural real GNP growth (me). This specification frees us from the need

to guess the growth rate of natural real CNP in the future; historical

values are from Perloff and Wachter updated by the author, as described

on p. 6 of the paper.

From Nominal GNP to Unemployment and Productivity


     An identity allows the deviation of real GNP from natural real GNP

growth () to be calculated from an initial guess for the inflation rate




      (A.2)           =        — Pt + DIF.


Iterative solution allows Pt to converge to the inflation rate


calculated in the basic inflation equation. DIFt, included in the histori-

cal but not in the future simulations, is the difference between the

growth rates of the implicit and fixed—weight GNP deflators.

     The weighted unemployment rate (U) is related to real GNP growth

and the lagged deviation of productivity growth from trend (e1) by the

following "Okun's Law" relationship:
                                                                                       94

In the long run, when inflation is equal to                  actual and natural real


GNP growth are equal, productivity grows at its trend rate (see equation

A.4), and the weighted unemployment rate is constant.

     The productivity deviation variable is explained by current and

lagged changes in output, unemployment, and the relative price of food

The device of explaining unemployment by lagged productivity, and productivity

by lagged unemployment, helps the model stay on track during historical

simulations when productivity behavior experiences shocks that cannot be

explained simply by the lagged adjustment of employment to changes in out-

put. The constant term (0.468) used to adjust output growth is the

sum of coefficients on output in the unemployment equation, so that in the

The Foreign Exchange Rate

     The   experience of 1980 and 1981         has dramatized the sensitivity of the
                                                                               95

 exchange rate of the dollar to changes in the interest rate differential

 between dollar—denominated and foreign assets. However, entering domestic

 and foreign interest rates into a foreign exchange rate equation here

would require numerous additional equations to explain interest rate move-

ments. To avoid this additional complexity, we take advantage of the

 short—run relation between changes in velocity and interest rate movements,

and explain changes in the effective foreign exchange rate of the dollar

 (r, as represented by the series "amx" from the International Financial

Statistics) as depending on changes in velocity and nominal GNP:

Here "D73" is a dummy variable for 1973—Qi — 1973:Q2.                 The constant term

"3.2" is the long—run trend of velocity growth implicit in equation (A.l).

Equation (A.5) states that when velocity is growing at its trend rate, the

dollar appreciates with            y < 5.02   and depreciates with    y > 5.02.     To

avoid the implication of a permanent appreciation in future simulations

following a restrictive monetary policy that brings y below 5 percent, it

is assumed that foreign nominal GNP growth responds with a two—year lag.

This assumption is implemented in future simulations by subtracting from

(A.5) the following:

As a result, the exchange rate is constant in the long run in all future

simulations.
