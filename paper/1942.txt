                  The Self-Employment Experience of Immigrants




                                    ABSTRACT



     Self-employment is an important aspect of the immigrant experience in

the labor market. Self-employment rates for immigrants exceed 15 percent

for some national groups. This paper addresses three related questions on

the self—employment experience of immigrants. First, how do self-employment

rates of immigrants compare to those of native-born men? Second, is there

an 'assimilationtt effect on the self-employment propensity of immigrants?

Finally, are the more recent waves of immigrants facing different self—

employment opportunities than the earlier waves? Using the 1970 and 1980

U.S. Censuses, the analysis shows that indeed self-employment rates of

immigrants exceed those of native-born men; that there is a strong, positive

impact of assimilation on self-employment rates; and that more recent waves

of immigrants are opting with increasing frequency for the self-employment

option.

                               George J. Borjas*




I.   Introduction

     The question of how immigrants do in the labor market has been studied

intensively in the last decade. Generally, this literature has demonstrated

that earlier waves of immigrants have higher earnings than more recent waves

and that, in addition, the earnings of immigrants who have been in the U.S.

for 10-15 years (or longer) exceed the earnings of the native-born.' Recent

work by Borjas (1985) questions the validity of the inference often made from

these cross-section studies that immigrants "assimilate" rapidly in the U.S.

labor market. In fact, by following immigrant cohorts over a decade Borjas

shows that the cross-section studies confound secular changes in cohort quality

with the assimilation process and that most of the earnings growth captured by

cross-section regressions is due to a sizable decline in the quality of

immigrants admitted to the United States in the postwar period.

     Despite the important insights provided by these studies of how immi-

grants do in the labor market, a potentially significant aspect of this issue

has been ignored. In particular, it is not uncommon in the sociological

literature to assert that a major channel for immigrant assimilation has been

the ample availability of self-employment opportunities for immigrants (see,

for example, Bonacich and Nodell, 1980; and Cummings, 1980). These studies

argue that many immigrants begin their climb up the ladder of economic success

by becoming self-employed and catering to customers from the "old country,"

i.e., consumers who have similar national backgrounds and who demand products
                                     2




where immigrants have a comparative advantage in the production process (due

perhaps to language barriers or to the familiarity with ethnic preferences).

Since all studies in the earnings determination literature discussed earlier

ignore the self-employment option and/or explicitly focus on the earnings of

salaried workers it is possible that these studies have provided an incomplete

picture of how immigrants assimilate in the labor market.

     It must be noted, however, that the disinterest in the question of self-

employment among labor market participants is not restricted solely to the

immigration literature. In fact, the related questions of who are the self—

employed and how they do in the labor market have received only the most

tangential attention in labor economics.2 This disinterest could be justified

if self-employment was a numerically unimportant component of the labor

market. The summary statistics in Table 1, however, should quickly dispel

this myth. This table presents the self-employment propensities and incomes

observed in the 1980 Census for men aged 18-64 in each of 12 major racial!

ethnic/nativity groups. Among white male labor force participants, the prob-

ability of self-employment is 11.7 percent for the native-born and rises to

16.5 percent for the foreign-born. These probabilities remain above the 10

percent level for both Asian and Cuban immigrants and fall to about 8 percent

for ttother" Hispanics. The self-employment probabilities are lowest, both

among the native- and foreign-born, in the black and Mexican samples, where

they lie in the 4-5 percent range. Table 1 also shows differentials by na-

tivity status and ethnic groups in the annual incomes received by self—

employed and salaried workers. These statistics also indicate that self-

employed workers have higher annual incomes than salaried workers (although

part of these differences may be due to returns on the physical capital owned

by self-employed workers).
                                     3




     The fact that immigrants have higher self-employment propensities raises

the interesting question of exactly what it is that these individuals do in

the labor market. Table 2 sheds some light on this issue by presenting the

industrial distributions of the native- and foreign-born by self-employment

status. These statistics show that self-employed immigrant workers are

significantly more likely to be in a "retail-trade" job than native-born

self-employed workers: Over 27 percent of self-employed immigrants are in

this industry compared to 17 percent of the native-born self-employed popula-

ton. Since the retail trade industry contains such types of firms as "variety

stores", "grocery stores", and "eating and drinking places", Table 2 does

provide some support for the hypothesis that many immigrants assimilate in the

U.S. labor market by opening up small shops and catering to specialized consumer

groups.

     The statistics in Tables 1 and 2, therefore, show that self-employment is a

significant activity among immigrant (and native-born) men in the labor market

and that it deserves careful study. This paper provides an initial attempt at

documenting the differences in self-employment propensities between the

native-born and the foreign-born and at analyzing the impact of assimilation

and changes in cohort quality on the self-employment experience of the immigrant

population. Section II of the paper presents the framework that will guide

the empirical analysis. Section III analyzes the self-employment propensities

of immigrants and native-born workers using the 1970 and 1980 U.S. Censuses,

while Section IV shows that the "enclave" effect is a major factor in the

creation of a gap in self-employment propensities between the foreign-born and

the native-born. Section V summarizes the results of the study.



II. Framework

     In deciding whether or not to become self-employed immigrant i compares
                                                   4




the market wage he would earn as a salaried worker, w, with the expected net

income from self-employment, y. .                Define   the index function:


     I.
      1
            y. - w. =
             1    1
                        X.
                         1
                           + v.
                              1
                                                                                    (1)



where X. is the vector of observable socioeconomic characteristics which
       1
affects y. and/or w.        .   If        I. is positive the immigrant becomes self-employed

and is a salaried worker otherwise. The probability of self-employment is

then given by:


     P. =
      1
            Pr[I.>O]
                 1
                        =   Pr[v.>-X.n],
                                1   1
                                                                                     (2)




and the parameter vector             't     can be estimated (up to a factor of proportionality)

once the stochastic nature of the disturbance v. is specified.

     Little is known about the specification of the variables in the vector

X. in equation (2).         It is reasonable to expect, however, that the standard

socioeconomic characteristics of education, age, marital status, etc., which

play a major role in the determination of salaries will also play a role in

the determination of self-employment incomes, and hence on the self-employment

propensity. Individuals who are self-employed differ from salaried workers

in two important respects: (1) they have a financial investment in the firm;

and (2) will bear more risk than a salaried worker. It clearly takes time and

some level of skill to raise the necessary resources for an individual to open

up his business. Thus it would not be surprising if the self-employment

propensity was positively correlated with age. In addition, to the extent

that education increases the types of skills necessary for an individual to

assess the extent of the market and the kinds of goods customers demand it

seems likely that education and self-employment rates would also be positively

related. Note, however, that both of these predictions implicitly assume
                                     5




that marginal increases in both education and age affect self-employment

incomes by more than they affect the individual's salaried alternatives.

     One type of risk that self-employed workers bear is the possibility

that their employees will shirk on the job. Harried self-employed persons

have a simple way of diminishing this type of risk: hire their spouses.

This allocation of labor within the family is optimal since both self-

employed workers will have identical incentives--the maximization of family

income or self-employment profits--and the shirking problem is thus solved.

Hence we would expect that self-employment propensities are greater for

married persons than for single persons.

     As these examples illustrate interesting economic hypotheses about the

relationship between self-employment incomes (and probabilities) and standard

socioeconomic characteristics can be easily derived from basic economic

principles. Although the derivation of a complete theory of self-employment

is beyond the scope of this paper, these examples should illustrate that

important insights can be obtained from further research along these lines.

     Our main interest, of course, is on the determination of self-employment

rates for immigrants, and how this process differs from the determination of

self—employment rates for native-born men. One key variable which clearly

plays a role in determining self-employment rates for immigrants is the number

of years that have elapsed since immigration, t. Since self-employment

requires a relatively large financial investment, it is unlikely that recently

arrived immigrants have the financial capability to start up a firm soon after

immigration. Hence self-employment rates and t. will be positively correlated.

In other words, as immigrants "assimilate" they are also more likely to become

self—employed. It is well known, however, that a single cross-section regression

of equation (2) will not provide estimates of this assimilation effect unless
                                             6




it is also assumed that the ?lquality?t of immigrant cohorts has remained

stationary over the sample period. The evidence in Borjas (1985), however,

has shown that the stationarity assumption is, in fact, invalid in terms of

the market wage rate. In particular, the quality of immigrants admitted to

the U.S. has declined in the sense that more recent immigrants have lower

wage rates than earlier immigrants had at comparable stages of the assimila-

tion experience. Thus cross-section estimates of the effect of t. on the

self-employment probability confound the true assimilation impact with quality

differentials among immigrant cohorts.3

     To derive a general framework that allows the identification of these

separate effects, consider the group of immigrants aged 18-54 in 1970. Using

the 1970 Census, it is convenient to partition this group into four cohorts:

arrivals in 1965—1969, arrivals in 1960-1964, arrivals in 1950—1959, and

immigrants who arrived prior to 1950. Consider next the group of immigrants

aged 28-64 in the 1980 Census. The 1980 Census data allows the partitioning

of this group of immigrants into six cohorts: arrivals in 1975-1979, arrivals

in 1970-1974, arrivals in 1965-1969, arrivals in 1960—1964, arrivals in 1950-1959,

and immigrants who arrived prior to 1950. Note that the last four cohorts

defined in the 1980 group exactly match the definitions of the cohorts from

the 1970 Census.4 Given these data, and assuming that the disturbance v.

follows a logistic distribution, two cross—section regressions can be estimated

by maximum likelihood:



               =          +           +            +            +            +

where Pt is the probability of self-employment in Census year t ,     X   is

a vector of socioeconomic characteristics, and the dummy variables indexing

years-since-immigration/cohort are defined by: D751 if immigrated in 1975-

1979; D70=1 if immigrated in 1970-1974; D65=l if immigrated in 1965-1969;

D60=1 if immigrated in 1960-1964; D501 if immigrated in 1950-1959; and D401

if immigrated prior to 1950. By definition, the vector X in (3) and (4)

does not contain a constant term.

     Consider cohort k , where Dkl (k40,50,60,65). Let X give the mean

values of the socioeconomic characteristics for the immigrant group as of

1980. Define:


     7O,k =   l+exp[-(7O+k)]}'
                                                                          (6)
     8o,k 1+exp[-(gO+k)]1'

     80,k+10 =   1+exp[-(ygO+k÷lO)]}       ,                              (7)


Equations (5) and (6) give the predicted probability of self-employment

(evaluated at X) for the representative member of cohort k in 1970 and 1980,

respectively. Equation (7) gives the predicted self-employment probability

in 1980 for the cohort who arrived 10 years after cohort k .     Note that

the comparison of cohort k in 1970 and cohort k+10 in 1980 holds constant

the number of years since immigration across Censuses.

     Using the definitions in (5)-(7), the 1980 regression can be used to

estimate the cross-section change in the probability of self-employment over

a 10 year period (net of aging). The cross-section change in the probability

is, of course, given by 80,k 8o,k+1o .         Note, however, that this term
can be rewritten as:


     80,k - 80,k+10 =                    + 70,k80,k+10 .                  (8)
                        8o,k7o,k
                                     8




Equation (8) decomposes the cross-section change in the self-employment

probability into two parts. The first term in (8) gives the change in

the probability experienced by cohort k over the 1970-1980 decade, and

will be called the "within-cohort" change in the self-employment probability.

It is worth stressing that this within-cohort change measures the true impact

of the assimilation process on self-employment propensities. The second

term in (8) estimates the difference in P. which occurred over the decade
                                         1

for immigrants with a given number of years since immigration. Thus it

compares different cohorts at the same point of their U.S. life cycle and

will be called the "across-cohort" change in self-employment propensities.

If, for example, the quality decline experienced by immigrant cohorts has

affected mainly the level of market earnings, the "across-cohort" effect

would be negative since more recent cohorts would find self-employment more

profitable than earlier cohorts found it at comparable stages of the as-

similation experience. The existence of quality differences among immigrant

cohorts, therefore, implies that the cross-section regression provides a

biased measure of the impact of assimilation on self-employment propensities.

     It should be noted, however, that the within-cohort change defined in

equation (8) can also be a biased measure of the impact of assimilation if

aggregate labor market conditions changed sufficiently between 1970 and 1980.

For instance, if economic changes over the decade led to a relative decline

in the earnings of salaried workers, the probability of self-employment will

have experienced a secular increase during the period. This aggregate shift

in the probability will bias upwards the within-cohort change and, due to

the decomposition in (8), will impart a downward bias on the across-cohort

change. One possible solution to this problem is simply to analyze the

behavior of the self-employment probability of immigrants net of the changes
                                                   9



which occurred in the native-born population. Suppose the logit equations

determining self-employment propensities for the native-born are given by:


         p
                  )   = Xô   +     + u70   ,                            (9)
             70




     2n(10) Xô8 +                  + u80   ,                            (10)


where the subscript nU indicates native-born status. Define the self-

employment probability of a native-born worker statistically similar to

the average immigrant by:


     70,n =       {1+exp[_(Ô70+)1}'            .                        (11)

    80,n =        [1+exp[_(Ô80+)]I'            .
                                                                        (12)

The decomposition of the cross-section change in the probability of self—

employment net of the secular changes occurring in the native-born population

can be written as:


                                                   -
    80,k80,k+10 =                                          8O,n7O,n1
                                                                        (13)
                         +                             -
                                 7o,k8o,k÷1o                 70,n80,n
The first bracketed term in (13) gives the difference between the within—

cohort change in the self-employment probability of immigrants and the

change in that probability which occurred among native-born workers. Thus

it gives the change in self-employment propensities experienced by a specific

immigrant cohort net of the change experienced by similar native-born workers.

Likewise, the second bracketed term in (13) gives the across-cohort effect
                                        10




net of the economy-wide changes experienced by native-born workers during

the 1970-1980 period.



III. Assimilation and Self-Employment

     The data used in the analysis are drawn from the 1970 1/100 Public Use

Sample from the U.S. Census (5 percent SMSA and County Group file), and the

1980 A Sample from the U.S. Census (a 5 percent random sample of the popula-

tion). Due to the very large sample sizes in these data sets. random samples

were drawn for some of the larger groups (e.g., white natives in both 1970 and

1980, black natives in 1980, etc.).5

     The analysis is restricted to male persons aged 18-54 in 1970 and 28-64

in 1980. The five sample selection rules used in both Censuses are:   (1)

the individual is not in the Armed Forces; (2) the individual does not

reside in group quarters; (3) the individual is not enrolled in school;

(4) the individual worked at some point during 1969 or 1979; and (5) the

individual resides in an SHSA. This last restriction prevents the analysis

from being biased by the prevalence of self-employment in the farm sector and

by the relative absence of immigrants in rural areas. Since previous re-

search has shown that major differences in economic status exist within the

male immigrant (and native-born) labor force, the study will be conducted

separately for each of six major immigrant groups: Mexican, Cuban, other

Hispanic, Asian, white, and black, where the "white" and "black" immigrant

samples contain the observations which are neither Hispanic nor Asian.6

Finally, the definition of self-employment is drawn from the class of worker

variables in the 1970 and 1980 Censuses. An individual is classified as

self—employed if he is a self-employed worker (business not incorporated)

or if he is an employee of his own corporation. Unpaid family workers are

excluded from the analysis in this paper.

     Before proceeding to the decomposition suggested by equations (8) and

(13) it is useful to describe the 1980 Census data in terms of a simple cross-

section regression. In particular, pool the native-born and foreign-born

samples in the 1980 Census and estimate the logit regression:


          P
     n (i0         = Z.y
                      1
                           +   c.1                                   (14)
              80


where the vector Z. includes both socioeconomic variables and the years-

since-migration vector, and the native-born sample pooled with the immigrant

samples is the immigrant's racial/ethnic counterpart in the native-born

population. The maximum likelihood estimates of equation (14) are presented

in Table 3.

    These regressions show that education has a positive (and significant)

impact on self-employment rates in all the samples. This result, of course,

is consistent with the hypothesis presented earlier that higher education

levels increase the individual's ability to provide a service that other

persons may desire, or perhaps that higher education levels increases the

organizational or managerial skills of workers. Similarly, Table 3 shows

that self-employment propensities increase with potential labor force exper-

ience. The experience coefficient is positive and significant for all racial!

ethnic groups except black men. It is of interest to note that black men are

also the only group for whom there is zero correlation between marital status

and self-employment propensities. In general, married men have higher self-

employment rates, due perhaps to the fact that family-owned businesses have an

advantage over other firms in solving the shirking problem. As Table 3 shows,

however, this effect does not exist in the black male sample. This finding

probably reflects the inherent instability in the black family. Finally, the
                                     12




regressions in Table 3 include a variable measuring the health status of the

individual (namely, if health ttlimitsf! work). Surprisingly, it is seen that

for most of the groups this variable has a positive impact on self-employment

propensities. It thus seems that the self-employment option expands the oppor-

tunities of persons with disabilities and gives them the flexibility of miti-

gating the negative labor market impacts of bad health.

     The regressions in Table 3 include a vector of years-since-migration

dummies which are of more direct concern to the present study. The omitted

variable in the vector indexes if the individual is native-born. Two important

findings are evident in the table. First, self-employment probabilities are

almost always larger for immigrants than for the native-born. The exceptions

to this result are usually found in the samples of immigrants who have resided

in the U.S. fewer than 5 years. For immigrants who have resided in this

country longer than 10 years, however, Table 3 shows that, without exception,

the probability of self-employment is at least as large for immigrants as it

is for the native-born. A second important finding evident in Table 3 is that

the probability of self-employment is not monotonically increasing with years-

since-migration. For example, in the white sample the logit coefficients of

the years-since-migration dummies exhibits little variance (and, in fact, are

insignificantly different from each other) during the 1950-1975 period.

Roughly speaking, therefore, Table 3 suggests that, in the absence of quality

differences among immigrant cohorts, most of the gap in self-employment propen-

sities between the foreign-born and the native-born is created within 5-10

years after immigration. This result differs markedly from the conclusions

reached in the cross-section regression on immigrant earnings where it is

found that immigrant earnings are a monotonically increasing function of

years-since-migration.
                                          13




       However, as equations (8) and (13) make clear the cross-section regres-

sions in Table 3 say nothing about the assimilation process since they con-

found the true growth attributable to assimilation with quality differences

among immigrant cohorts. These decompositions are presented in Table 4 for 18

immigrant cohorts. Two important points should be made about the derivation

of the statistics in Table 4. First, the vector of socioeconomic character-

istics, X , held constant in the logit self-employment regressions includes

the variables: years of completed schooling; years of labor market experience

(defined by Age-Schooling-6); years of labor market experience squared; whether

or not health limits work; and whether or not married spouse present. Secondly,

to minimize the large number of parameters to be estimated by maximum likeli-

hood, and due to the large number of observations, the coefficients of the

socioeconomic variables 70' y80, 7O 680) are constrained so that 7O

=   y and 670   680 = 6   .   Thus the socioeconomic variables are allowed to have

a differential impact between the native- and foreign-born samples, but this

impact remained constant over the decade.7

       The results in Table 4 are best understood by illustrating their deriva-

tion through an example. Consider the group of white men who arrived in

1965—1969. According to the 1980 cross-section regression, the probability of

self-employment for these men is - .0028 percentage points lower than that of

similarly skilled immigrants who arrived 10 years later.8 Thus the cross-

section regression reveals little change in self-employment propensities over

time. Using equation (8), however, this quantity can be decomposed into

within- and across-cohort changes in self-employment probabilities. This

decomposition reveals that as of 1980 this group of immigrants actually had a

self—employment probability that was 9.8 percentage points higher than in

1970. Thus the cohort experienced a significant increase in self-employment
                                     14




propensities. Yet, at the same time, this cohort as of 1970 had a self—

employment probability that was 10.1 percentage points lower than the 1980

self-employment probability of men who arrived in 1975-1979. Thus the secular

changes in the quality mix of these immigrant cohorts have led to an increase

in self-employment propensities. In fact, the across-cohort change wipes out

the within-cohort change so that in the cross-section it appears as if years-

since-migration had no impact on the self-employment probability.

     Of course, it may well be that these changes between 1970 and 1980 simply

reflect economy-wide fluctuations in self-employment incomes. The decomposi-

tion in equation (13) controls for this problem by netting out the change in

the self-employment probability achieved by the native-born group. It should

be noted, however, that the choice of the native-born reference group is

somewhat arbitrary since the immigrant population can be compared to a number

of different racial/ethnic native-born men. In this paper, each immigrant

group (except for the Cubans) is compared to its respective ethnic/racial

native-born counterpart. In the Cuban case, due to the small sample size (and

the even smaller number of self-employed Cuban unatives?t) the Cuban immigrants

are compared to white native-born men.

     The last two columns of Table 4 conduct the decomposition of the cross-

section growth after netting out the change in the self-employment probabil-

ities of the native-born. In the case of the 1965-1969 white immigrant cohort,

the within-cohort change remains positive and significant and is approximately

8.1 percentage points. In other words, the self-employment probability of

white immigrants who arrived in 1965-1969 increased 8.1 percentage points

above the increased experienced by white native-born men over the 1970-1980

period. Similarly, the across-cohort change remains negative and significant

even after netting out the white native-born change so that, indeed, more
                                     15




recent cohorts of immigrants are more likely to opt for self-employment

than earlier immigrants.

     The remaining rows of Table 4 replicate the analysis for all other co-

horts in the six immigrant groups. Perhaps the major finding obtained from

these results is that there are sizable differences in the within- and across-

cohort changes experience by immigrants both within and across national groups.

In general, however, the within-cohort change in the probability of self-

employment is positive, while the across-cohort change is negative. For

instance, in the decomposition that nets out the change in P for the native-

born, 17 out of 18 within-cohort effects are positive (and 11 of these effects

have a t-ratio exceeding unity), while 14 of the across-cohort effects are

negative (with 9 of these effects having t-ratios above 1.0 in absolute value).

These results, therefore, are consistent with the hypothesis that as immigrants

assimilate in the United States the relative gains from self-employment increase.

In addition, the results in Table 3 also show the existence of a secular shift

in the relative gains of self-employment for immigrants. In other words, more

recent immigrant cohorts perceive self-employment as a relatively better employ-

ment alternative than earlier immigrant cohorts.

     Thus two important substantive questions are raised by the results in Table

4. First, why does the assimilation process of immigrants involve a switch

from salaried jobs to self-employment? Second, why do more recent immigrants

find self-employment a much more profitable alternative than the earlier

waves of immigrants? With respect to the first question, it is clear that

self-employment requires a somewhat large financial investment in the firm.

It is unlikely that the most recent immigrants have accumulated the financial

resources needed to open up a business. Thus it is not too surprising to

find that, during their assimilation, immigrants switch from salaried jobs to
                                    16




self-employment opportunities.

    The second question posed above is somewhat harder to address. A possible

factor for the cohort effects is related to the analysis of Borjas (1985). One

interpretation of his findings is that salaried opportunities for recent waves

of immigrants are substantially worse than the opportunities faced by the

earlier waves of foreign-born persons. This implies that the more recent waves

of immigrants will find it relatively more profitable to enter self-employment

than the earlier waves did (at the same point of their U.S. life cycle). This,

however, raises the important question of why salaried opportunities declined

more than self-employment opportunities. A second factor which may be respon-

sible for the cohort effects in Table 4 is the change in immigrotion policy

implicit in the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act. This law has empha-

sized family reunification as the primary variable determining visa allocation

among potential entrants.9 Since self-employment opportunities increase

greatly when family members can join the firm, the family reunification goal

of the current law may well be playing a major role in the self-employment

cohort effects. Although the results in Table 4 cannot conclusively prove

the validity of these hypotheses, it is clear that additional research on

the self-employment of immigrants should be conducted to address these im-

portant questions.



IV. Enclaves and the Self-Employment of Immigrants

     An important result in Section III was the finding that the probability

of self-employment of immigrants exceeds the probability of self-employment

of native-born men for practically all ethnic/racial groups. Although this

result can be explained in terms of the hypothesis that immigrants face

higher self-employment incomes (relative to the native-born), this explanation
                                     17




does not really provide an understanding of y the nativity differences

arise. The sociological literature, however, has presented extensive anecdotal

evidence of how immigrants create enclaves by concentrating in specific

geographic areas, and of how these enclaves create and expand opportunities

for immigrants to become self-employed. These opportunities arise because

immigrants from a particular national group are assumed to have a comparative

advantage in serving the needs of consumers from that national group. The

comparative advantage, of course, is created by informational asymmetries

between the immigrants and the rest of the population, and these informational

asymmetries may include such factors as better knowledge of consumer preferences

and knowledge of the language spoken by the immigrant population.

     This hypothesis can be easily tested by analyzing the self-employment

propensities of the three Hispanic groups (i.e., Mexicans, Cubans, and

other Hispanics) studied in the previous section. Since these three groups

are much more homogeneous in culture and language than the three other

groups analyzed earlier (namely, whites, blacks and Asians), it is likely

that enclaves of Hispanics may have opened up self-employment opportunities

for Hispanic immigrants. Formally, the enclave hypothesis can be tested

by estimating the regression:



             = Zy +
                      h   +                                           (15)


where Z. is a vector of socioeconomic characteristics, and    is the fraction

of the SMSA's population that is Hispanic.1° The enclave hypothesis implies

that X is positive. In addition, if equation (15) is estimated separately

in the foreign-born and native-born samples, and if immigrants benefit more

from the self-employment opportunities opened up by the enclave, one would
                                     18




expect that the impact of    on the probability of self-employment is larger

in the immigrant than in the native-born sample.

     Table 5 presents the estimated impact dp/dq =   p(l-p)   for each of the

six Hispanic groups under study, where the derivative is evaluated at the mean

self-employment probability of each group. For purposes of comparison the

table also presents the impact of    on the self-employment probability of

non-Hispanic whites. Two important results are apparent. First, the coef-

ficient X is indeed positive and significant in the Hispanic samples. That

is, Hispanics are more likely to be self-employed in areas which have larger

Hispanic populations. Moreover, note that the impact of       in the non-Hispanic

white samples is insignificantly different from zero; hence the results for

Hispanics cannot be dismissed as reflecting some unknown area-specific effect.

Second, the impact of    on the self-employment probability is larger for

immigrants than for the native-born, and this difference is significant in two

of the three Hispanic samples."

     It is possible to use the regression coefficients reported in Table 5 to

calculate the increase in the self-employment rates of immigrants (relative to

natives) due to the enclave effect. The results from this calculation are re-

ported in Table 6. Consider the sample of Mexican men. The average Mexican

immigrant lives in a metropolitan area that is 23.7 percent Hispanic, while the

average Mexican/American lives in an SMSA that is 25.6 percent Hispanic. The

regressions in Table 5 report the marginal increase in the self-employment prob-

ability due to changes in these proportions. The relevant calculation then

shows that the enclave effect increases the self-employment rate of Mexican

immigrants by 1.2 percentage points over that of Mexican native-born men.

Similar calculayions reported in Table 6 for the Cuban and other Hispanic
                                     19




samples show that enclave effects increase foreign-born self-employment rates

by 1-2 percentage points over the native-born base. Hence enclave effects are

not only statistically significant, but they are also numerically important.

     These results, however, cannot really answer the fundamental question

of     enclave effects exist. The fact that the self-employment rates of non-

Hispanic whites (reported in the last row of Table 5) are not related to percent

Hispanic in the SHSA suggests that language (and/or culture) plays an important

role in the creation of the enclave effect. A number of additional experiments

were conducted to provide a better test of this hypothesis. These experiments

included relating the self-employment rates of Asians to the percent Asian in

the SMSA, and conducting a separate analysis of the self-employment rates of

immigrants from English-speaking countries. On the whole, however, these

preliminary calculations were negative and did not provie any additional

insights into the factors that are driving the results in Table 5. The likely

reason for this failure is the fact that the Asian sample is extremely hetero-

geneous--both in language and cluture--so that any future analysis of these

individuals will have to segment by country-of-origin. Similarly, the sample

of men from English-speaking countries includes men from the U.K. and Ireland,

as well as men from Jamaica and the Philipines. The cultural (and racial)

differences among these various samples makes it unlikely that a self-employed

immigrant from an English-speaking country can be equally efficient in catering

to all the groups that make up his "enclave". Future studies of this problem,

therefore, will have to increasingly look at the roles played by culture,

race, and language in differentiating among immigrant and native-born groups.



V.   Summary

     Self-employment represents an important component of the immigrant exper-

ience in the U.S. labor market. Its omission in earlier studies cannot be
                                     20




justified by the presumption that self-employed workers represent a numerically

unimportant part of the immigrant labor force. In fact, among large immigrant

groups self-employment rates exceed 15 percent of the labor force. This paper

begins the study of the immigrant self-employment experience by analyzing the

self-employment rates of 18 immigrant cohorts using the 1970 and 1980 U.s.

Census. The major findings are:

     1.   Assimilation has a sizable impact on self-employment probabilities:

The longer the immigrant resides in the United States, the higher the pro-

bability of self-employment.

     2.   There has been a rapid increase in the self—employment rates exper-

ienced by recent immigrant cohorts as compared to earlier cohorts. These

across-cohort changes may have been caused by the relative decline of oppor-

tunities faced by immigrants in the salaried sector over the last decades.

     3.   Immigrants are more likely to be self-employed than similarly

skilled native-born workers. A major reason for this differential is that

geographic enclaves of immigrants increase self-employment opportunities

particularly for immigrants who share the same national background (or

language) as the residents of the enclave.

     The prevalence of self-employment among immigrants (and native-born

workers) in the labor market suggests that much additional work is needed

in this area. The analysis in this paper makes clear that continued research

of the self-employment option and of self-employment incomes is likely to

greatly enhance our understanding of the immigrant assimilation process.

          Recent studies by Lazear and Moore (1984) and Wolpin (1977) have

been concerned with the question of why there exist smaller wage differentials

(by skill) among the self-employed than among salaried workers. Studies by

Fuchs (1968, 1982) provide a descriptive analysis of the extent of self-

employment among older workers and in the service economy.

          In addition, non-random emigration of the immigrant population biases

the impact of t. on both market wage rates and self-employment incomes. See

Borjas (1985) for a discussion of the biases introduced by the high emigration

rates of the foreign-born.

          Of course, there are many reasons why, in actuality, the cohorts

in the 1970 and 1980 Census data may not be perfectly matched. For instance,

the presence of emigration will lead to secular trends in the size (and

quality) of a specific immigrant cohort. Similarly, institutional changes

in the Census enumeration procedures may lead to different counts of immi-

grants (and native-born persons) in particular cohorts across Censuses.

Finally, there may be age (and/or cohort) related differences in labor

supply and mortality rates which generate additional differences in the size
                                      22



of the cohort samples included in the regressions over time. Note, however,

that all these problems will impart biases on both cross-section and cohort

analyses so that, in a sense, the cohort study presented below nets out only

one of the many sources of bias, that due to violations of the assumption of

stationarity in the quality of immigrants at the time of entry.

          The sampling fractions for 1970 are: white native-born (.001 of

the population), all other groups (.01). The 1980 sampling fractions are:

black natives (.00245), black immigrants (.01651), Mexican natives (.01652),

Mexican immigrants (.01638), white natives (.00042), white immigrants (.00249),

all other groups (.05).
     6    The Hispanic samples do not include the group of Puerto Rican

men since Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico are not asked the year they

migrated to the U.S. by the Census.

          The t-ratios in Table 4 refer to the relevant transformations

of the logit coefficients and are estimated from the covariance matrix of the

regression coefficients.

          Note that since the constraints             y and 670 = 680
have been imposed on the estimates, the cross-section regressions in Table 3

are not directly comparable to the cross-section estimates in Table 4.    In

particular, Table 3 constrains the socioeconomic variables to have the same

impact for the foreign- and native-born in the 1980 Census year, while Table 4

allows a differential impact between the two groups but assumes this difference

is invariant to calendar year.

          See Jasso and Rosenzweig (1986) for an interesting discussion and

empirical study of some of the implications of the family reunification

emphasis in the current law.

           The analysis was also conducted with alternative definitions for

the variable       These specifications included such variables as percent

Mexican, percent Cuban, etc. The model in equation (15) does as good a job

in describing the enclave effect as the more detailed specification.

           It would be of interest, of course, to analyze -   along similar
lines -   the relative levels of salaried and self-employment incomes. Unfortu-
nately, this extension of the work introduces the problem of correcting for

sample selection biases both within and across immigrant cohorts. In addition,

self-employment incomes, as reported in the Census, are an amalgam of returns

to human and physical capital. A complete study of the income levels, therefore,

will require much more detailed data on the source and types of incomes of the

self-employed.
