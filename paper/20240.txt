                                               ABSTRACT

According to the endowment effect there is some discomfort associated with giving up a good, that
is to say, we are willing to give up something only if the price is greater than the price we are willing
to pay for it. This implies that the indifference curves should designate a reference point at the current
level of consumption. Such indifference maps are kinked at the current level of consumption. The
kinks in the curves imply that the utility function is not differentiable everywhere and the budget constraint
does not always have a unique tangent with an indifference curve. Thus, price changes may not bring
about changes in consumption which may be the reason for the frequent stickiness of prices, wages
and interest rates. We also discuss a multiple period example in which the indifference map shifts
as the reference point shifts implying that the curves cross over time even though tastes do not change.

        It is important to update the way we teach indifference curves. The standard depiction

is still being taught to millions of students annually, although a crucial inconsistency with its

conceptualization was discovered more than three decades ago, namely that it fails to indicate

the reference point or the current level of consumption (Knetsch and Sinden, 1984;

Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1990; Knetsch, Riyanto, and Zong, 2012). According to the

conventional indifference curve diagrams when deciding between two goods, say, food and

clothing, it is as though we’ve never consumed them before. Thus, we are assumed to come to

the problem in a pristine state, without indicating the amount of the goods in question we

consumed in the prior period or are adapted to. However, this is contradictory, because if we

have not consumed these items before how are we supposed to know how much utility we

should expect from them.

        Hence, the customary indifference curve depends on the implicit assumption that

choice along indifference curves are reversible. That is, if an individual owns x and is

indifferent between keeping it and trading it for y, then when owning y the individual should

be indifferent about trading it for x. If loss aversion is present, however, this reversibility will

no longer hold (Knetsch 1989; Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1991). Knetsch and Sinden

were the first to point out that the standard assumption pertaining to the equivalence of losses

and gains is contradicted by the experimental evidence: “the compensation measure of value

seems to exceed significantly the willingness to pay measure, which would appear to call into

some question… interpretations of indifference curves” (Knetsch and Sinden, 1984).

        Thus, the mainstream representation of indifference curves is outdated, inconsistent,

and misleading, because it overlooks the ample empirical evidence that current consumption

(or current endowment) matters to subsequent consumption decisions as it becomes a
reference point to which other states of the world are compared (Rabin 2008). The

endowment effect implies that there is an excess discomfort associated with giving something

up, i.e., in excess of the pleasure associated with acquiring it. Let us suppose that the current

level of consumption is (Qx1, Qy1) (Figure 1). Then point “a” becomes the origin of the

coordinate system and the relevant reference point for the current period 1. While recently

there has been some discussion about how to define the reference point in various

circumstances (Heffetz and List, 2013), in this example it is straightforward, it is simply the

current level of consumption at point a.

       We divide the plane into four quadrants (numbered counter clockwise) with the axis

going through the origin at point a. In quadrant 1 the reference point is irrelevant as both x

and y are increasing. In this quadrant the standard convex-to-the-origin indifference curve is

unchanged. However, x decreases in quadrant 2 while y increases; in quadrant 3 both x and y

decrease, and in quadrant 4 x increases while y decreases. (All changes are relative to the axis

that go through the initial reference point a (Figure 1).

       Thus, lowering consumption of (x) below the initial level, Qx1, requires a larger

amount of a compensating good (y) in order to maintain the same level of utility than the

amount of y required to be given up if there were an identical increase in x beyond Qx1. In

other words, at point a the loss in marginal utility of giving up a unit of x is larger (in absolute

value) than the marginal utility of obtaining a unit of x; i.e., decreasing one’s consumption

from the current level is more painful than increasing consumption from the current level is

beneficial. This is critical, because it implies that the indifference curves are kinked at the axis

that go through point a, with slopes steeper in quadrant 2 than in quadrant 4, a factor

overlooked in conventional treatments of indifference curves. David Just works out the

properties of such behavioral indifference maps with straight lines, i.e., with constant

marginal rate of substitution (Just 2014, p. 81), while Knetsch et al demonstrate with
indifference curves the discrepancy of evaluating welfare in the domains of gains and losses

(Knetsch, Riyanto, and Zong, 2012).

       To demonstrate the impact of the endowment effect on the indifference map with

declining marginal rate of substitution (mrs) let us suppose that the standard (mrs) along an

indifference map were mi=        , and the endowment effect of x at a point i is given by xi and

that of y is given by yi where >0 is the extra price (in terms of the other good) required to

give up an object above the price for which it would be acquired. Then the mrs of the

behavioral indifference curve in quadrant 2 relative to the reference point a is bmi=             ,


in quadrant 3 is bmi=          , and in quadrant 4 is bmi=          . Hence, in quadrant 2 the

slope of the indifference curve is steeper than the standard indifference curve because in order

to give up 1 unit of x one would need a greater amount of y as compensation on account of

the pain of giving up x relative to the level to which one is accustomed. Similarly, in quadrant

4 except in this case the indifference curve is flatter than the standard indifference curve

because in this case it is more difficult to give up y. In quadrant 3 the slope of the behavioural

indifference curve relative to the standard one is ambiguous depending on the sizes of xi and

yi; the curve is drawn in this quadrant in such a way that the endowment effects cancel each

other and the standard indifference curve obtains.

       The implication is that there is a kink in the behavioral indifference curves as they

cross the axis from one quadrant to another. This implies that the utility function is not

differentiable everywhere and that preferences are not homothetic. Moreover, budget lines

cannot be tangent to the indifference curve along the axis that divides the plane into four

quadrants. For instance, budget lines 1 and 2 in Figure 2 show that changes in price will not

bring about any change in the consumption bundle at point a, contrary to conventional
analysis. This may well explain the oft found stickiness in adjustment to changes in wages,

prices, and interest rates (Anderson 1998; Carlton, 1986; Ausubel, 1991).

       Furthermore, let us suppose that in period 1 the actual budget line 3 is tangent to the

indifference curve at b in quadrant 4 (b is not on an axis in period 1). Thus, Figure 2 shows

that with budget constraint 3 the new consumption bundle becomes (Qx2, Qy2) at point b. Once

choosing to consume at point b in period 1, however, the origin of the new axis of the

behavioral indifference map shifts to b and, in turn, that becomes the new reference point in

period 2. This implies that the two sets of indifference maps cross over time even if the taste

of the consumer does not change over time.1

       Moreover, the new indifference map of period 2 is superimposed on the previous one

of period 1 (Figure 3). However, the budget constraint, which was tangent to the old

indifference curve at b is no longer tangent to the new indifference curve at b (Figure 4).

Therefore, the tangency with the new set of indifference curves will be elsewhere implying

that consumption will change in period 2 even if prices, income, or taste remain unchanged.

Thus, the consumption bundle can change even if there is no fundamental change in either the

economy or in the consumer’s preferences. In other words, the adjustment to the new budget

constraint occurs in two steps: the first step uses the initial reference point in order to choose

the optimal bundle and having made that choice the reference point also shifts implying that

the whole indifference curve shifts. This, in turn, displaces the optimal consumption bundle

once again to c even if there are no other changes in the relevant parameters.

       In sum, behavioral indifference curves are relative to a reference point.

The endowment effect implies that people are willing to give up an object only at a higher

price than the price at which they are willing to buy it, i.e., it is psychologically more difficult

to give up an object than to acquire it. This changes the shape and properties of the

indifference map that has far-reaching implications and not only in the classrooms but also in
applied areas such as the evaluation of welfare states and stickiness of economic variables

such as wages, prices, and interest rates (Knetsch, Riyanto, and Zong, 2012). This salient

issue ought no longer be ignored and needs a much wider research agenda than hitherto

allotted to it at the margins of the discipline.

        Even at this stage it is important to incorporate the behavioral indifference curves into

the curriculum and stop teaching outdated concepts. If you think that behavioral indifference

curves would be too complicated for beginners then I would urge you not to teach the

conventional ones until the students are ready for the current version because one should not

mislead students by teaching inappropriate concepts. If the straight-talking Nobel-prize

winning physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88) were still with us he would concur with this

view; in his famous 1974 commencement address at the California Institute of Technology, he

beseeched the graduating class to practice scientific integrity, utter honesty, and to lean over

backwards so as not to fool ourselves [and of course others] (Feynman 1985). I believe that

the same is true for us: teachers of economics: it is time to start leaning over backwards and to

stop teaching the standard indifference curves.
