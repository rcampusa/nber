                                 ABSTRACT

      This paper investigates empirically how returns and
volatilities of stock indices are correlated between Tokyo and New
York.   Intradaily data are used, so that daytime and overnight
returns are defined for both markets. Tokyo daytime hours overlap
with New York overnight hours, while New York daytime hours overlap
with Tokyo overnight hours. We find that in general Tokyo (Mew
York) daytime returns are significantly correlated with New York
(Tokyo) overnight returns.   This suggests that information revealed
during the trading hours of one market has a global impact on the
returns of the other market. One exception is that after the
October 1987 Crash, the Tokyo overnight returns were not
significantly affected by New York daytime returns. We propose and
estimate a signal extraction model with GARCH processes to determine
the global factor from daytime returns.   This is the problem of
setting the opening price of a domestic market conditional on the
foreign daytime returns.   We also investigate lagged return and
volatility spillovers.   Except for a lagged return spillover from
New York to Tokyo for the period after the Crash, there are no
significant lagged spillovers in returns or in volatilities.

1   Introduction
      When the New York stock market opens its business      day,   many things that
have happened overnight have to be incorporated in its pricing.         One relevant

piece of     information is how the Tokyo stock market did earlier in the day.

Similarly, Tokyo   stock brokers take notice   how the New. York market   ended a few
hours before the   Tokyo market opens. There are many reasons why the returns and
volatility of   the two largest equity markets nay be related. The two economies

are related through trade and itvestment, so that any news about fundamentals in

one country most   likely has implications for the other country. According to
this view,   stock returns priced by international factors imply international

correlations   in an international asset pricing modal. Growing financial market

integration implies that,   according to this type of model, changes in stock

prices in one market quickly affect those of another market (often in the same

direction).

      Another reason for international correlations of stock price changes is

"market psychology." The October 1987 Crash (Black Monday) in New York setting

off worldwide stock price declines is often cited as evidence for international

contagion of bear psychology.      Speculations (or fads, noises, or even a herd

instinct) may be transmittable across borders. One survey (Shiller, Konya, and

Tsutsui (1991)) has found that Tokyo participants are influenced by what happens

in New York (and not vice versa). An excellent paper by King and Sladhwani (1990)

proposes to model such a phenomenon as a signal extraction problem.
       Since Tokyo and New York do not have any overlapping trading hours, clean

tests of how information is transmitted from one market to the other can be

formulated. Decomposition of daily movement (returns and conditional volatility)

into daytime (open-to-close)movement and overnight (close-to-open) movement is

crucial for meaningful analyses.Z For example,      the following efficient market

hypothesis can be tested:    any   predictable returns and conditional volatility

of one market because of the movement of the other market should be incorporated

                                         1
in the opening price (that is, overnight movement). In order to carry out this

inference, a global factor end a local factor have to be separated.         For this,

the paper proposes a signal-extraction method similar to King and Wadhwani

(1990).  In particular, a test of "heat waves" (market-specific volatility

clustering) end "meteor showers" (worldwide volatility clustering), as proposed
in Engle, Ito and tin (1990) and Ito, Engle. and Lin (1991), can be implemented

in the stock market.

       The purpose of this paper is three-fold: First, we will carefully decompose

daytime and overnight stock movements in Tokyo and in New York and pay attention
to the nonaynchronoua trading problem; second, we will estimate "contemporaneous"

correlation between the (daytime)        returns and volatility in one market and the

overnight returns and volatility of the other; and third, we will test whether

(daytime)    returns and volatility of one market would predict those of the other

market.



1.1.   Related Literature

       The worldwide scope of the October 1987 Crash stimulated many studies on

the international transmission of returns and volatility: Bennett and Kelleher

(1988),     }lamao, Nasulis, and   Ng   (1990),   Neumark, Tinsley. and Tosini (1991),

Schwert (1990), Susmel and Engle (1990). and Von Fursrenberg and .Joen (1989), to

name a few-      In these papers several features were claimed to be found:'       (i)

Volatility of stock prices is time-varying. It rose considerably around October

1987, but quickly decreased afterwards, even to         a level lower than that before
the Crash.     (ii) Vhen volatility is high, the price changes in major markets tend

to become highly correlated. (iii) Correlations in volatility and prices appear

to be asymmetric in causality between the United States and other countries. The

US movement affects other markets, but not vice versa. (iv) Spillovers of price

changes and volatility are found between major markets even with non-overlapping

time zones.     These features are often presented without a logical link between

                                              2
them.     In this paper, we will present a general framework, in which a link

between these features comes out naturally.4

        In summary, our framework is based on a contagion model proposed by King
and Wandhwani (1990),    but with finer frequency so that daytime returns and

overnight returns are separated. In particular, we provide a direct test of the

contagion model,     identify the    proportions of     global and   local   factors

(information contents) in the variances of prices, and examine how promptly

market prices would react to news revealed in the other market.        Our approach

also yields an insight into a often-made claim that correlations in international

equity prices are positively related to volatility.



1.2.    Tokyo Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange
        The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are

the world largest equity markets.        We adopt the Nikkei 225 and S&P 500 as the
stock price indices for our analysis.5 The NYSE opens its trading at 9:30 a.m.

and continues trading until 4:00 p.m.        The TSE opens at 9:00 a.m. and trades

until 11:00 a.m., then breaks for lunch until 1:00 p.m.'      The afternoon session

continues until 3:00 p.m.    Since Tokyo is ahead of New York by 14 hours (in the

winter)   or 13 hours (in the summer), these trading hours do not overlap in real
time.

        At the beginning of the   day,   overnight orders for each stock have to be

marched at some price.   Tm the NYSE, trading is done through specialists who can

directly participate in trading and take inventory positions.        In the TSE, a

particular type of securities firms, saitori members,       specialires in matching

orders without taking positions.7        Not all stocks are traded as anon as the

market opens. It often takes from several minutes to am hour before most of the

"major" stocks have transactions.' Whenever a stock price index is used, the

"opening" price of the index has to be carefully dealt with, since many of the
 individual stock prices included in the index are not transaction prices of that

                                            3
day.    In the usual          case, "stale quotes" such as the preceding day's closing price

are     used if en initial transaction of the day is yet to come.'                             It may be the
case that the market is groping for a price level to balance demand and supply

of the moment, which may be quite different from the preceding day's closing

price. If so, the measured index does not accurately reflect the true underlying

price index.         This is a problem of nonsynohronous trading.                     In order to minimize
this problem, we take 10:00 am, quotes as the opening of the day for both Tokyo

and New York.           By   10   am., most of the               stocks   in both the Nikkei225 and S&P 500
have had their initial trade of the day.



2.     Model and Econometric Speoifcations

2.1. General Framework and Notation

        For both Tokyo and New York, daily (close-to-close) returns are divided

into daytime (open-to-close)returns and overnight (close(t-l)-to-open) returns:

        NY,    —   NEST4    + NED,

         SF, — SF5,        + SF0,
where    STE   and SF denote returns in Nikkei 225 and S&F 500, respectively, and

suffix 0 or N defines daytime or overnight, respectively.

         During the trmding hours of each of the two markets, information or trading
noises will be incorporated into stock prices.                             We denote as   en, or as, that parr

of returns which can not be predicted based upon public information when the
market opens.              Suffix n or s                denotes Nikkei 225 or S&F 500, respectively.

Allowing for possible autocorrelations from overnight returns, and for post-

holiday effects through a dummy variable, OH, and Friday effects through a dummy

variable, OF, we can                write the daytime returns as follows:"

        NED.    —   c      + aw5TEN, + bDM, + d,,,DF, + en,                    (1)

         SF0,   — c,4 +      a,4SFN,   +   b,dDM,   +   d.9DF,   + as,        (2)

Note that NED and SF0 do not overlap in real time.

         The following analysis is an exercise for investors who plan to place
orders and price stocks at the opening. While the domestic market is closed, the

information from the foreign market is available to domestic investors.                               This

information is vsluable for pricing domestic stock returns when the market re-

opens.    If the market is efficient, it should be reflected in the opening price

of the domestic market.                      The question is how to use the foreign market

information.
          The first avenue is to use the unexpected returns of the foreign market.

We tall this the aggregate shock model.                         In this model, the   541'   500   overnight

returns are modeled as a function of the preceding 54? 500 daytime returns, the

Monday dummy, and influences from abroad:

         SPN,       —     c,, + a,,S?D,., ÷ s,,,en, ÷ bJJM + vn,              (3)
where the       effect of unexpected returns from Tokyo is p,,,en,, and effects                    revealed

after the close of the Tokyo market but before the opening of the New York market
are denoted by vn. Similarly, the Nikkei 225 overnight returns of calendar date
t exploit information revealed during the New York market hours of calendar date
t-l:
         5KM        —     c,,,   ÷ ajflCD,, + p,,,es, +  (4)
                                                          b,,0M, +   vs,
Again, vs is information revealed after the New York close but before the Tokyo
open. The Friday dummy is not used in equations (3) and (4) because, for
overnight returns, the                 Monday dummy covers the weekend (Friday close to Monday

open).

         The second avenue is to decompose the unexpected returns in the foreign

market    into      two     types of shocks, uncorrelated with each other, global end local.
 Specifically,             we assume       that
         en,    —   wn,   + tin,
 and

         as,    —   ws, +        us,
 where wit, and ws, are the globsl factors, and un, and us, are the local factors.
 The   global factor influences stock returns in hone and foreign markets, and the
local factor contains only ahocks and noises idiosyncratic to the home market.

A global factor may be a shock to intarnatonal fundamentals or internationally

contagious psychology, and a local factor may be a shock to local fundamentals
ot local market moods.

         In an efficient market, information that is revealed in Tokyo and that is

relevant for New York --               in       short, the global factor --         will be fully reflected
in the opening price in New York.                     The key assumption here is that investors and

econometrioians cannot identify global and local shocks, but would try to infer

them.      Investors are assumed to                    lusow    the parameters of returns generating

processes and to estimate, through the signal extraction process, relevant
information about the global factor from observed daytime returns.t1                                Through
this signal extraction procedure, we denote the estimate                             of the global factor as

wn, and   ws',.       Henoe,    in an efficient market, the global factor in Tokyo,                wn,,   will

influence the S&P 500 overnight returns, SPN, but not its daytime returns, SF0.

Nence,    the New       York overnight return could be written as
         SPN,     —    c,, ÷    emSPO,.l    +           b,,0M,      ÷ vn,            (5)

where * indicates the estimate conditional upon information after the close of
the Tokyo market and the effect of the global factor from Tokyo is j,,.
Similarly, the Nikkei overnight returns of t exploit global information revealed
during the New York trading hours of calendar date t-l.
         NKN,     —    c,   ÷   a,,N100,4   ÷ ts,,,ws,' + b,,0M, + vs,                (6)
         At   this point, it is             instrnctive to summarize timing and notation as shown

in Figure 1, where TKO, TKC, NYO, and NYC, are                              the time of Tokyo opening, Tokyo
closing,        New York opening,               and New York closing in real time.              The daytime

returns and overnight returns are defined as the changes between those timings,

respectively.

         The information set containing returns and other stock price related public

information up to the point of time                       j    (j
                                                                    — TKO, TKC, SF0, NYC) is denoted by

0(j).     In the aggregate shook model, shocks em and vm, for m—n or a, are assumed

 is 9:30 a.m.(EST) in New York on dare r-l, it is 11:30 p.m. (same day) in Tokyo.
 Tarious vertical lines show the correspondence of the timings,         with the
 following exceptions: the opening time in arrual market hours are 9:00 a.m. it
 :okyo and 9:30 a.m. in New York, but                   it
                                           is 10:00 am. in the definitions ot
 returns of price indioes of both markets. This adjustment is done to correot
 for the non-synchronous trading problem at opening.

to be serially uncorrelated and mutually independent. Moreover, those shocks are
assumed to follow a OARCH process:

  em[Q(j)— N(0, cm1)             ((m,Th     ((n,TKO)    (s, NYO))   (7)

  vmQ(j) — N(E, Ir.)             ((m,j))    ((n,TKC)    (s, NYC))   (8)

The same assumptions are held for the distribution of the global end the local

factors in the signal extraction model.          That is

  wmO(j) — N(0, gr)              {(m,j))    ((n,TKO)    (a, NYO))   (9)

  un0(j) — N(O, hr.)             ((m,j)) — {(n,TKO)(a, NYO))        (10)

where N(,,.) denotes a normal distribution with the first element being the mean,

and the second element being the variance ccndticnal on 0(j).



2.2 Aggregate Shock Model

       The aggregate shock model can be formulated as equations (1) to (4), and

(7)   to (8).     Since the shocks em and vm,          for m     n end    s,       are mutually

uncotrelated, we can apply a two-stage GAROH estimation method cc estimate the

model.      In the first stage, we employ the GARCH method to the Nikkei 225 daytime

returns in equations (1) and (7).          Obtaining the fitted value of unexpected
return en1 in the first stage and substituting it into the mean equation of the

S&P 500     ovor-night returns, we can estimate equations (4) and (8)               by the OARCN
method again.      A similar procedure can be applied to S&P 500 daytime returns
and Nikkei overnight returns.         Note that this two-stage procedure will yield

consistent estimators if the model i5 correctly specified.

          The aggregate shock model and the estimation method are similar to those

used in Namac et al. (1990).        However, there is a technical difference between
Hamac et el. and this paper in the specification of daytime                    (   or   overnight)

frequency samples.



2.3   Signal Extraction Model
       From equation              (1), the unexpected part of daytime returns of the Tokyo

market, that is,         en,,     has two components: wn, and    un,.   However, New York investors

are assumed to observe only the combined shock, not the individual components.

This is a classic problem of signal extraction. To minimize the mean squared

errors of the estimators, New York investors can estimate the global factor vu,

from the unexpected Tokyo price changes as

       vu',
              —   [   go, /     (gn, + hn,)1   en,                                    (11>

where *   is   the expectation based on public information Q(TKG).                        The estimate of

the   Tokyo global factor is proportional to the unexpected foreign daytime
                                                         of the global factor to
returns, with the proportion equal to the variance ratio

the unexpected returns. As the global information becomes more important in the
total variances, the proportion of the extracted global factor in the unexpected

returns increases.

       The variance of estimated global information,                       gn',,    conditional on the

information available after the close of the Tokyo market becomes

       gn'.
               — gn, Cl       -
                                  [go, / (gn, ÷ hn,)]                              (12)

gecause part of Tokyo closing prices reflects the global factor, using the Tokyo
                                                                        of the
closing prices to estimate the global factor can reduce the uncertainty

 estimated global factor.               This information    (   or   Kalman filter )       gain   decreases

 the variance of the estimated global factor as shown in the second term of

 equation (12).               As the prices contain more global information (or the
 noise-to-information variance ratio is lower),                      information gain from observing

 Tokyo closing prices becomes larger,                   and then the variance of the estimated

 global information will be smaller.
                                                                       New York
        Substituting equation (11) into equation (5), we can vrite the
overnight returns,              SPN,, as

      SPN,—        c      + aSPD,4 +          p.(    gn,   / (gn+ hnj]en         +    bDN + 'vn (13)
If the shocks have tine-varying conditional variances, the signal extraction

model predicts that the correlation coefficient between the foreign daytime and

ihe domestic overnghr returns, i.jgnJ(gn,+ hn31en,                                              is time-varying     and is

dependent on volatility measures.                                  If the shocks do not have time-varying

variances, then the correlation coefficient is tine-invariant and the New York

overnight return process becomes equation (3) with $ equal to                                             [gn/(gn÷ hn)]
The assumption of GARCH processes can reconcile two stylised facts                                                  in the

literature survey of section 1.1: (i) time-varying vo1atilty and (ii) the time-

varying correlations in international stock returns,
      A similar signal extraction process can also be employed by Japanese
investors to estimate the global factor revealed in the New York market.                                            Hence,
the Tokyo overnight returns are

      NKN           c + aNKDn + p,[ gs /                          (gs1+   hs3jes + bDH + vs               (14)



2.4. CARCH        Hodel
      The        approach is very popular in modeling the second moments
              GARCH                                                                                                    of
financial data (see a recent survey by Bollerslev, thou, and Kroner (1990)).                                            It
captures the         phenomenon of volatility clustering by specifying that large price

changes are likely to be followed by large price changes but of either sign.                                           We

assume that        gm1,       qm,   hip,   and Ici follow (pseudo)                  GARtH processes:

      gis     —           + am[(vIsa? +             gm,4] +       fL   gm,4   + Ym   Dli,   ÷   &   OF,      (15)

          — a,.÷ a,,,

for suffix m — n or                 s.


      The process is analogous to the ARCH models employed by Diebold and Nerlove

(1989), and King, Sentena,                     end Kadhwani (1990) with latent factor structures, as


                                                                    10
well as one by Harvey and Ruiz (1990).                 Specifically, if news          win,   or   usi,   follows

a CARCH process with a normal density, than without directly observing                             win,   or urn,,

the best estimators of          urn2.,   conditional on public information 0(j)                   for j — TKC

or NYC,    is

                 I(i) )    —    (w,,)Z      + gm•.t.

Hence,   gm', enters into the variance process               of equation      (15).      Similarly, hin,

enters in equation (16).' The density function of                 win,   or   urn,   conditional on the

information Set is no longer normal. As a result, the Kalinan filtering process

still produces      6MS    (minimizing mean squared errors) estimators,                           but is not

optimal.       Diebold and Nerlove (1989). and King,             Sentana, and Wadhwani (1990)

estimate the conditional variance process similar to equations (15) to (16)

without the term of         gil,.,       in equations (15) and (16).           However, fonte               Carlo

experiments by Harvey and Ruiz (1990) show that a correction of                          gil,,     is needed.

in order to obtain a better estimator with smaller mean Squared errors. Hence,

their correction of the conditional variance is adopted in equations (15) and

(16).

           scoring algorithm described in Pagan (1980), and Watson and Engle
         The

(1983) is employed to estimate the whole system for the Tokyo daytime and the New
York overnight returns, or for the New York daytime and the Tokyo overnight
retu.rns. The log likelthood function is
 log L — -
for   suffix m —    n or   s.
         The scoring algorithm is to             calculate   the values of       vm,,    em,,     gm,,    and   his,



according to the signal extraction process described in equations (11) to (18),
and to use the updating process to seek the estimates that maximize the log

 likelihood function. The standard errors are calculated by H'(S'S)H' where H                                   is
 the Hessian     matrix and S is the score vector.              In the second step, we examine

 whether this model can fully explain the volatility and the return correlations

 across markets.      Such tests are conducted by Bollerslev and Wooldridge (1988)'s

                                                       11
robust LM tests,        The LM tests and standard errors that we construct here are

robust to the density function, which will minimize the problem of non-normality

of the shotks.



3. Primary Analysis

3.1. Data Summary

      Because the effect of the Crash of 1987 on international stock returns has

generated great interest in the literature, Table I reports the data summary for

the Nikkei 225 and the Standard and Poor 500 (S&P 500) indices over the periods

before,    around,    and after the Crash as well as the whole sample period.      The

stock returns on October 19, 1987 experienced the largest one-day drop in the

history of major stock indices since 1885.         The S&P 500 fell about 20.4 percent

on October    19,    1987 During the two months around the Crash, the average daily
returns for the S&P 500 decreased by 34.6 percent.        As this financial shock was
transmitted to       the TSE   on the following day, the average daily reruns for the

Nikkei 225 fell by 29.3 percent. Before and after this abnormal avent, the two

markets have a positive daily return. In general, the daily N[kkei 225 returns

were higher than the S&P 500         returns before and after the Crash.   Particularly

after the Crash, the Nkkei 225 rebounded and surpassed the pre-Crash record high

n   the two years.       On the last day of 1989,     it reached 38915, or 77 percent

above the day after the Black Monday (29190).       The gain in the Nikkei 225 returns

was larger than a 57 percent rebound of the S&P 500 returns from 224 to 353

during the same period.            Further examinstion of Table   1 reveals that the

distribution of stock returns is not normal.            During the Crash period, the

distributfon of daytime stock returns became fatter tailed, indicating a more

volatile movement of the stock prices.

          Investigating the variance ratio of daytime returns to overnight returns
also shows a pattern similar to that found by Amihud and Siendelson             (1987),

Oldfield and P.ogalski (1980), and Stoll and tmaley (1990) in the NYSE before the

                                              12
Crash.     Despite different sample periods and stock returns, the variance ratio

ranges from 4.26 to 5.40 in the NYSE.        Amihud and Nendelson (1989) also show that

this ratio amounts to 2.40 for the fifty moat traded stocks in the TSE.               Because

we measure the 10:00         a.m. quote as the opening price, the variance ratio before

the Crash is 3.1 in the S&P 500           and 1.60 iq the Nikkei 225, smaller.than the

previous results.          Around and after the Crash, the variance ratio dropa.

         Table   1.   also reports the correlation between the overnight and the daytime

returns in the NYSE and the TSE, which have an overlapping time segment.                  The

correlation between the MEN and the SF0 returns increases around the Crash, and

drops after           the Crash.    Bennett and      Eelleher    (1988)   report that   daily

correlations of returns for three major world stock markets ranged from 0.09 in

1980 to 0.26 in September 1987, and were much higher than thoae in the l970a.

         0-or   last    obaervation from Table      1   is that the significant    Ljung-Box
statistics for the serial correlation of the twelfth order indicate evidence for
aerial correlation in the intra-daily stock returns.                  The evidence will be

further examined in the next section for dependence between the daytime and the

overnighc returns.



3.2. Teats for Serial Dependence         of Stock Returns

         The fact that        the close-to-close stock returns have          positive auto-

correlation has long been recognized in many studies.             Foterba and Summers (1988)

and Fame end French (1988) exemine the proposition that stock prices take long

temporary swings from fundamental values; the eventual reversal causes a negative

correlation in some future holding period. Lo end NacKinlay (1989) investigate

the      importance of nonsynchronous         trading     in    generating positive     serial

correlation, and show only week evidence in favor of this interpretation. The

role of noisy traders and positive feedback traders in inducing positive

correlations of stock returns has been modeled by Campbell end Kyle (1988) end

De Long, Shleifer,         Summers, end Weldmenn (1990).

                                               13
      It is well-Intown that   price correlations exist in the high frequency data.
In Table 2 we test for serial dependence of intra-daily stock returns.          The

results are presented for the SPD, the SPN, the MCD, and the NICN returns, end the

standard errors are adjusted for hereroskedasricity of an unirnown form.      Table

2 shows some evidence for positive serial dependence of daytime returns on the

overnight returns.     This is different from the findings of negative serial

dependence by   Atsihud and Mendelson (1999).   As we measure the opening prices at

thirty minutes or one hour after the market re-opens, the finding of positive

significant impacts of the previous overnight returns on the daytime returns more

likely indicates   that price reversals last only for one   hour or less.   As shown
in Table 2, White heteroskedastcity      tests or Lagrangean multiplier tests for

ARCH reveal   that the volotllty of stock returns is time-varying.

4. Aggregate   Shock Nodel
      A focus of attention in the study of world equities market has been how
returns and volatilities in major markets are correlated and have changed as
financial integration has progressed.° Using a vector autoregressions approsch
to model the transmission of daily stock returns, Eun and Shim (1989) have found
that only United States stock returns can explain the movements of nine other
world stock returns, but not vice versa. Hamso, Hasulis, and Hg (1990), and King
and Wadhwani (1990) also have given empirical support to this asymmetric
transmission pattern between the New York market and the Tokyo market. The
former paper estimated that the impact of the S&P 500 Daytime returns on the
Nkkei overnight returns amounts to only 0.02 by the CARCN-in-mean model with
HA(l) errors, whereas the latter work estimates the contagion coefficient implied
by daily S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 returns ranging from 0.40 to 0.11.
       In this section, we employ an aggregate stock return model, that is, we do
not attempt to decoripose unexpected daytime returns into global or local factors,
but investigate whether the (non-decomposed)unexpected daytime returns in Tokyo

                                          14
have any impact on the overnight returns in New York.           If any information

revealed in Tokyo is relevant to the stock prices in New York, then New York

investors will use it in pricing the New York stock returns.            This will show

international, contemporaneous spillovers from unexpected daytime returns of the

Tokyo   market tothe unexpected overnight returns of the New York market. The
contemporaneous spillovers themaelves do not
                                                  violate the efficient market

hypothesis, but indicate that the unexpected returns in Tokyo contain aome global

information. The sensitivity coefficient of the contemporaneous apillovers is $.
        Conditional   variances of unexpected returns in the two markets are modeled

as CARCN processes. The two-stage GARtH estimation method        is applied to the
aggregate shock model     for Tokyo daytime returns and New York overnight returns

aa described in section 2.2.      The results are reported in Table 3. In Table 4,

a parallel investigation is done for daytine New York and overnight Tokyo
returns.      After fitting the GARtH model, we calculate the skewness and the

kurtosis of standardized residuals.       These statistics are still too large to

accept the null hypothesis of normal distribution. Therefore, we report the
robust standard errors as calculated by Bollerslev and Wooldridge (l9g).
        The   first salient feature in Tables 3 and 4 is the existence              of

                                                                                   Put
contemporaneous spillover suggested by significant t statistics of •.
                                                               has glohal impacts
differently, information revealed in trading hours of a market
on stock returns in the other markets. Moreover, results in Tables 3 and 4 show

that (i) before the Crash, the contemporaneous spillover was synnetric:          Tokyo

daytime returns affected New York overnight returns and vice versa; and (ii)

after the Crash, the contemporaneous spillover became asymmetrit: Tokyo daytime

returns influenced the New York overnight returns, but New York daytime returns

 did not influence the Tokyo overnight returns.         In a   sense,    Tokyo returns

 contained a statistically significant global factor, while New York returns did

not.

         The results (i) and (ii) are in sharp contrast to those of Namao et al.

                                           15
(1990), Becker, Finnerty,           and Gupta (1990), and King and Wadhweni (1990). These

researchers fonnd that the stcck returns of the U.S.A. can influence other stock

markets in a sizable way, but not vice versa.                 This difference in results must

oome from the fact that          we correct fot non-synchronous trading by taking 10 am.
as opening time, while Namao et al. (1990) takes 9:01                  am.      for Tokyo and 9:30

am. for New York, and the fact that King and Wadhwanl                  (1990)    use   da1y   (close-

to-close) returns without decomposing into daytime and overnight returns. It is
our understanding that our new finding offers a clear-cut conclusion to this

issue.

         Next, we examine the estimates          of parameters in the variance process. The

persistence of a shock to volatility is measured by the sum of s and                    fl.   The sum
of   s   and   fl   ate mote   than 0.85 in all cases except for NKN after the crash (the

sum was 0,70).           We interpret these results as evidence for a persistent effect

of a shock on volatility.               Tables    3   and 4 show the lower persistence of

volatility of the NKD,             the NK3, and the SPD returns after the Crash.                  The

conclusion here is that volatility would diminish much faster for the post-Crash

period than for the pre-Crash period.                 This conclusion is in accordance with

Engle and Muatafa (1989) and Schwert (1990).                Neither the Monday         duy nor    the

Friday     dcy         shows significant effects on the returns in most cases.                    The

overnight returns are more              volatile during holidays partly because                  more

no-trading hours and the clustering of foreign news during the domestic holidays
raise the total volatility.



5. Signal Extraction Model

         It is an implicit assumption in the           aggregate   shock model that all the news

revealed during the trading hours of one market has global impacts on stock

returns.            Realistically, part of the infornation revealed through trading may

affect the returns locally.             Only a global factor influences the other market.
If the market is efficient, the impacts of the global fsctor will be priced at


                                                  16
the opening of the subsequent market. The question is how investors learn about

the global factor when they do not have any precise information about the global

and the local factors.        In the signal extraction model, domestic investors are

assumed to optimally extract the global information from the observed price
changes. Consequently, the estimate of the global information is proportional
to unexpected price changes with the proportional coefficient equal to the
variance   ratio of the global information to unexpected price changes.

        In Table    5   (and similarly in Table 6),        the equations for     Tokyo daytime
returns and New York overnight returns are simultaneously estimated via a state-

space model with GARCH errors as described in Section 2.4.                   After estimation,

we test whether local factors,          Un,,   have a CARCH(l) term im the conditional
variance processes. 5y evaluating the           126   test statistics, we find that the null
                                   —0       cannot be rejected at least at the 5%
hypothesis of a GARCIT(l).              ,                                                level.

From Tables S and 6, we draw       four conclusions:
        First, in Table 5,     we investigate bow the New York investors extract the
global factor from Tokyo daytime returns and how much New                York overnight returns
are sensitive to the estimated global factor.                Table   6   is similarly done for

Tokyo  investors learning overnight from New York daytime returns. In Table 5,
the coefficient of      is the sensitivity of New York overnight returns to the
estimated global factors revealed in Tokyo daytime returns. The estimated global
factor, wn*,, is the product of the time-varying signal extraction coefficient
(gn,J(gn,+hn)) and estimated unexpected returns (en,).   Table 5 shows that the
sensitivity    increased  after the Crash.  Put  differently. New York investors

became moresensitive to what is revealed to be a global factor in Tokyo. Table
6 shows that the sensitivity    became statistically insignificant after the
Crash. Tokyo investors' sensitivity to a global factor in New York became less
statistically significant after the            Crash.
              coefficient of contemporaneous spiliover is compared. Recalling
        Second, a
that the sensitivity 4, shown in Table 3 was with respect to the aggregate
                                                 17
unexpected returns,        we have to adjust for the signal extraction coefficient in

order to compare the sensitivity obtained from Table 5.                         Let us denote

p(gm/(gm+hm)), for suffix          m     n or    s,   as the time-verying sensitivity,

comparable to $      in   Table 2. Sfnce p(gm/(gm+hz)) is time-varying, only its time-

series average over the sample period is presented in Table 5.                   The estimated

                                                                              the
p(gm/(gn+hm)) for SFN is 0.075, 0.064, and 0.191 for the whole sample period,

periods before and after the Crash, respect1vly.                Comparing $   in Table     2 with

p(gm/(gm+hm)) in Table 5, we find a similar pattern;              the sensitivity increased

after the Crash, and the magnitude is snilar, too.                Comparing Tables 4 end 6,

we also find that the sensitivities are sni1ar.            This shows a robustness in our

procedures.

         Third,    the estimated variance ratio of the global factor to the local

factor in the Tokyo market is presented as gn/hm.              This is also time-varying, so

that a time-series average over the sample period is presented.                    We find, as

shown in Table 5, that the weight of the global factor revealed in Tokyo

increased after the Crash.         This suggests that the Tokyo stock returns after the

Crash contain more of a global component than before,               Table 6 also shows that

the variance ratio of a global factor to a local factor increased in the New York

market.         Nowever, recalling that the Tokyo investors' sensitivity              js
                                                                                           became

statistically      not different    from zero,   an increase    in the weight    of the    global

factor    in New York does not contribute to explafning the Tokyo overnight returns.

         Fourth,    we corpare the performance of the aggregate shock model with the

signal extraction model.           The signal extraction model will be nested into the

aggregate shock model because, if unexpected returns have no local impacts, then
the two models become equivalent. We compute the Weld statistics, shown in the

 lest rows of Tables 5 and 6, to examine the null hypothesis that the parameters

 in the conditional variance of the local factor equal zero.             These show that the

null hypothesis can be rejected in cases where the estimate of $                          or   z is

 signifcent.       The result suggests that if the stock returns contain some global

                                                 lB
effects,   then the signal extraction approach is a batter way to characterize the

investors' use of the information in pricing opening quotes than the aggregate

shock model.




6.   Lagged   International Spillovera
6.1         eturns Spillovers
       Lagged
      In Tables 3 to 6, we investigate contemporaneous spillovers from daytime
returns in one market to overnight returns in the other market. The two returns

are defined in hours that are overlapping in real tine. In this section, we
investigate whether returns spillover from the daytime returns in one market to
the daytime returns in the other market which starts trading several hours later,
If the strict version of the efficient market hypothesis holds, we should not

expect any (mean)    spillovers of this type.
      In Table 7, the Tokyo daytime return is a function of its preceding
overnight returns and the New York daytime return (plus dummy variables).  Note

that the two regressors, the Tokyo overnight and the New York daytime returns,

overlap in real time. The coefficient s shows the sensitivity of the Tokyo
market returns to the New York daytime returns (of day t-l). The equation could

be regarded as a causality test of whether New York daytime returns have any
additional information (additional to Tokyo's own market overnight returns) in
predicting Tokyo daytime returns. Alternatively, the equation maybe interpreted
as the test of lagged spillover effect from New York daytime returns to Tokyo
daytime returns a half day later.          In panel A of Table 7,   the   Lagrangean

multiplier test shows that there is indeed such an effect in the post-Crash

period,    but not the pre-Crash period.

        This result is somewhat counter-intuitive. If the market is efficient, one

expects no spillovers from New York daytime returns to Tokyo daytime returns.
Note that we have allowed one hour in the beginning of the day to avoid the non-


                                           19
                                                        for the efficient market
synchronous trading problem, giving a favorable setting

hypothesis14       In panel S of Table B, we re-estimate the model and find the

impact of the S&P 500          daytime returns on the Nikkei 225 overnight returns

emounting to 0.13.         The significant t    statistic confirms      the findings of the

                                                                            the
Lagrangean multiplier tett statiatica. The estimates of other parameters in

mean and variance proceaaes of Tokyo       (   New York   )   daytime returns are similar to
those in Table S      (   Table 6), showing the robust results.

      Recall that Tables 4 and 6 showed that the Tokyo overnight returns were

insensitive to the New York daytime returns.               Combining the lagged spillover
                                                                     the
result with the results in Tables 4 and 6 and with those in Table 8,

following scensro emerges.            After the Crash,        Tokyo   investors became less

confident in calculating the impact of New York daytime returns on Tokyo, taking

time to react to the news.          The spillover appears to last more than one hour

after the opening of the Tokyo market. This, however, is a major puzzle from the

efficient market point of view.

       Table   S   shows that there is no lagged spillover from Tokyo daytime returns

to New York daytime returns.          All information revealed in the Tokyo daytime

returns seems to be incorporated in the New York stock prices by 10:00 e.m., so

that overnight returns are affected <Tables 3 and 5), but not daytime returns.



6.2 Lagged Volatility Spillovera

       In   this   section,   we will investigate what kinds of information influence

the conditional variance of the global factor.                The equation of gm has a CARtS

                                                                              r.
process with an additional tern to capture a possible effect from past shock,

 Several candidates we use for s are: the unexpected daytime returns of the
                                                          the shocks revealed
 foreign market, the global factor of the foreign market,
 after the close of the foreign market but before the opening of the domestic

 market,    and the overnight returns of the doreatic market.              These candidates

 contain information which is available to domestic investors at the opening of

                                                20
the market.    Hence, we are able to perform a clean test to examine whether eny

of this information will generate volatility clustering across the border.

         Table 9 shows that the conditional variance of Tokyo's global factor is

influenced, for the post-Crash period, by the squared shocks observed between the

New York close and the Tokyo open (or the estimated error terms of the New York

overnight equations). Table 10 shows that New York's global factor, for the pre-

Crash period, is influenced by the squared shocks observed between the Tokyo

close and the New York open.       However, on the whole, the effects of other
                                                                             of
possible realized volatility measures do not affect the conditional variance
the global factor. In particular, there is no statistically significant effect

from the squared shocks in the global factor in one market to the conditional

variance of the other market's global factor (see the second line of Tables    9   and

10) .°

         The results are different from those of Nanso et   al.   (1990) who found a

volatility spillover from the New York daytime returns to the Tokyo daytime
returns,   This difference is likeiy attributable to their use of the opening

quote of 9:01 a.m., which may contain some stale quotes, as opposed to our 10:00

a.m.     Our result conforms more with that of Susmel and Engle (1990), who used

hourly data and found that the volatility spilloversbetween New York and London

equity markets only last for one hour after the market is open.



7. Comclusiom

         Using intra-daily data to decompose daily returns into         daytime and
                                                                            been
overnight returns, this paper re-assesses several characteristics that have
found in the literature on the transmission of returns and volatility among world

stock markets.     Our data, methods, and findings contain several novel aspects.

First, we define the opening price of a carket as a price index thirty minutes

(in New York) or one hour (in Tokyo) after the market is actually open, in order

to minimize the problem of stale quotes or nonsynchronous trading         Second, we


                                         21
investigate contemporaneous correlations, Tokyo daytime with New York overnight,
and New York daytime with Tokyo overnight. Our results show that the foreign

daytime returns cen significantly influence the domestic overnight returns,

resulting in a price jump at the opening of the domestic market.                    Put

differently, the bull or bear trend moves across the border.           It has been

suggested in the literature that spillovers take place in the direction from New
York to other markets including Tokyo, but not in the opposite direction,           In

contrast, we find that returns and volatility spillovers are generally symmetric.

Information (market fundamentals or psychology) revealed during the trading hours

of one market are taken into account in the other markets when they open.
         Second, we propose two models to describe the ways that investors learn

information revealed in the foreign market during the overnight.        One is the

aggregate shock model,    in which investors uae the unexpected returns from the

other model for setting opening prices.         The second is the signal extraction

model in which unexpected returns are decomposed into two parts, global and local

factors,    and in which investors optimally extract the information from the

observed price changes.       We compare these two models and find that the signal

extraction mudel characterizes investors' behavior better than the aggregate

shock model.

         Third, several competing hypotheses regarding lagged spillovers in both

returns and volatility are also tested.         We find some evidence of the lagged

return spillovers from New York daytime to Tokyo daytime in the period after the

Crash.     This is a puzzling finding.    We conjecture that after the Crash, Tokyo

participants needed more time to extract the global factor from the New York

market,        On the other   hand,   we also find that,   in general, there   is   no

volatility spillover from one market to the other several hours later.

2. Many studies have used daily returns in studying international transmission.
Among them are King and Wadbwani (1990), von Furstenberg and Then (1989), and Kun
and Shim (1989), Without decomposing daily returns into overnight and daytime
returns, it is impossible to test the type of questions related to an efficient
market hypothesis.    For example, King and Wadhwani (1990) show the signal
extraction method that market participants of country A can use to infet from
country B's stock returns, but their analysis cannot address the question of
whether all adjustments are done at the opening of B's market.

3.  King and Wadhwani (1990) report features (ii) and (iii); Hamao et al. (1990)
document (i), (iii), and (iv); and Schwert (1990) reports (i).



4.  Our framework is similar to King and Wsdhwani (1990) in its use of the signal
extraction method, but wa decompose daily returns- that was the frequency of King
and Wadhwani--into overnight and daytime returns. This finer frequency is also
adopted in Hamao, Masulis, Hg (1990), but we define tha opening price at 10 a.m.
in order to avoid nonsynchronous trading problems which seem to bias their
results in favor of volatility of spillovers. In addition, our model has several
features, such as an explicit modeling of a signal extraction problem and a one-
step estimation of a multi-variate (two country) GARtH problem, that are improved
over Hamao, et al. (1990).

mean of 500 stocks selected by Standard and Poor. The hourly data of S&P 500 are
kindly provided to us by Dr. J. Harold Mukherlin. The Nikkei 225 (Hikkei 225)
is sprite-weighted simple average of 225 stock prices selected by Nikkei. The
equity-value weighted index in Tokyo is TOPIX, which covers all stocks in the
first section of the TSK. Because of its broad coverage, the nonsynchronous
trading and stale quotes problems become serious if we use TOPIX. Moreover, the
opening TDPIX is very hard to obtain.

8. 1rge order imbalances at the opening of the day are likely to result, due to
divergentbeliefs of investors regarding overnight news. As pointed out by Brook
and Kleidon (].989), large overnight changes in underlying pricing of stocks are
nor fully reflected the opening price, but extend over several trades at the
beginning of the day. Put differently, it may take some time for inveators to
rebalance their portfolios after the opening.         This produces volatility
continuation or spillover.

process of groping for an equilibrium price.

effects.

11.   As noted above, our approach is similar to the one by King and Wadhweni
(1990). Gut approach is en improvement on theirs, in that time-varying variances
are considered, daytime and overnight returns ere separated, and thus updating
procedures ste explicitly specified.

see this, after wn is observed, Un — en - wn, where wn is known.      Hente, the
conditional variance of en equals the conditional variance of un.

13.    The exsisinstion of monthly international stock returns and their
impliostions of financial integration have long been discussed. Recently,
several papers have studied correletions in high frequency stock returns. In one
of  the early studies,  Hillimrd (1979) concluded that daily contemporaneous
returns among ten world stock markets were not so highly correlated, even during
the l973-4974 oil crisis.

14.  Hsmmo et al. (1990) find a similar spillover effect from New York returns
to Tokyo returns.  However, they speculate that it is due to the beginning-of-
the-dsy nonsynohronous trading problem, because they use 9:01 mm. We have used
10:00 a.m. as open so that the efficient market hypothesis will work, but still
find evidence of spillovers. King end Wedhwsni (1990) find similar effects, but
since they use the close-to-close returns of the two markets, they cannot judge
from their results whether the spillover effect is resolved in overlepping hours
or in lagged hours.

15. This means that there are no "meteor shower" effects (in the sense of Engle,
Ito and Lin (1990)) in the stock price indices of Tokyo and New York.
