The Political Economy of Trade and International Labor Mobility

NBER Working Paper No. 21274

JEL No. F13,F22

                                          ABSTRACT

We explore the political economy of trade and migration policies in several models of
international trade. We show that in a Ricardian world, free trade and no international labor
mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome, but free trade and free international labor mobility is not.
The result holds under different assumptions about the set of goods, preferences and the number
of countries. An analogous result also holds in multifactor economies such as: a version of the
standard two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin model, the Ricardo-Vinner specific factors model, and a
three-sector model with a non-tradeable sector. We also study three extensions of our model in
which free trade and at least partial labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome. One extension
introduces increasing returns to scale. Another an extractive elite. Finally, we allow the recipient
country to charge an immigration fee in the form of an income tax and distribute the proceeds
among domestic workers, which induces a Pareto improvement for the global economy.

in advanced and low-income countries differ by a factor of 10 or more (see, for example, Rodrik 2002,
and Freeman 2006); which suggests that restrictions on labor mobility could be the largest distortion
in the world economy (see, for example, Clements 2011). Moreover, there are at least two good rea-
sons to study the political economy of trade and migration policies simultaneously rather than as two
independent policies.
      First, theoretical trade models explicitly or implicitly imply that international trade and factor mo-
bility could be complements and/or substitutes. If they are complements, why do we observe harsher
restrictions to international migrations than to international trade? If they are substitutes, why do we
observe illegal migration between countries that engage in free trade? Second, countries can potentially
engage in free international trade and labor mobility, impose trade and migration restrictions, choose
a combination of free trade and migration restrictions or vice versa. Indeed, as Brexit reminds us, the
political economy of trade and migration cannot be simply mapped into a one-dimension policy decision
(say, more, or less globalization). On the contrary, it seems that the pro-Brexit coalition favors free trade,
but opposes free labor mobility.1
      We develop an international political economy model for the determination of trade and labor mobility
policies. First, all countries simultaneously decide on their trade and migration policies with the aim of
maximizing the wellbeing of domestic workers. In order to keep things as simple as possible, we assume
that only a fraction of the labor endowment of each country is mobile and that trade and migration policies
can adopt only two values: free trade and no trade, and free labor mobility and no labor mobility.2 In
the case of two countries, no trade is equivalent to complete autarky and no labor mobility implies that
mobile workers must stay in their countries of origin. In the multi-country case, each country must select
its trade and labor mobility partners. In other words, the trade policy of any given country can be
described as the set of countries with which that country agrees to engage in free trade. The situation
with respect to migration policy is analogous. Second, mobile workers decide where they will reside and
work. Finally, countries engage in trade, production and consumption.
      We consider two families of economies (and several variations within each family): Ricardian
economies and factor proportions models. For all these models, we obtain a rather negative result.
We show that, although it is always possible to find conditions under which free trade and no labor
mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome of the political economy game, free trade and free labor mobility
is never a Nash equilibrium outcome. From a positive point of view, this may help to explain why inter-
national labor markets are much less integrated than international markets of commodities are. However,
this suggests a significant misallocation of resources in the global economy as well as a substantial failure
of international institutions. From a normative point of view, this result could also be judged undesirable

      In Section 5 we relax this assumption.

based on fairness considerations. For this reason, we also explore several ways of overcoming this negative
result. In particular, we show that if quantitative migration restrictions are replaced by a migration fee
implemented as an income tax on migrants whose revenue is distributed among domestic workers in the
recipient country, workers all over the world will be better off. Thus, free trade and free labor mobility
will become a Nash equilibrium outcome.

1.1      The challenge of achieving free trade and international labor mobility

1.1.1      Ricardian economies

In a Ricardian economy, trade is not a source of conflict because everybody gains when countries specialize
in their comparative advantages and engage in international trade. Thus, free trade and no labor mobility
is a Nash equilibrium outcome of the political economy game that we studied. In a Ricardian world, free
trade does not produce real wage equalization because countries use different production technologies.
As a consequence, if countries that engage in trade also allow free labor mobility, workers will move from
poor to rich countries until real wages are equalized. Then, under free trade, labor mobility reduces wages
in rich countries and, hence, workers from rich countries prefer to block migration flows. Free trade and
free labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome of the political economy game.
      We show that this logic applies not only to a simple Ricardian model, but also to more complex
Ricardian economies, including those with a continuum of goods (as in Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson,
1977), non-homothetic preferences (as in Matsuyama, 2000) and multiple countries (as in Eaton and
Kortum, 2002). In a nutshell, we confirm the basic results obtained using the simple Ricardian model
under several variations in the model’s assumptions (set of goods, preferences, and set of countries). For
each Ricardian model, we also deduce the conditions under which free trade induces partial convergence,
full divergence and a reversal of fortune in terms of the well-being of workers in each country. In all
cases, free trade and free labor mobility lead to full convergence, but this is never a Nash equilibrium
of the political game. Thus, in a Ricardian world, the lack of convergence in levels of well-being across
countries can be attributed to an international political equilibrium that blocks free labor mobility.

1.1.2      Factor proportions models

A Ricardian world is by no means the unique economic environment in which free trade does not preclude
international migrations, but political interactions lead to no labor mobility. Several multifactor models
produce analogous results. We study three of them: a version of the standard two-sector Heckscher-
Ohlin model, the Ricardo-Vinner specific factors model, and a three-sector model (two tradeable goods
and one non-tradeable good).3 In a two country Heckscher-Ohlin model with country-specific total factor
  3
      See, Galiani, Heymann and Magud (2017), Galiani, Schofield and Torrens (2014), and Galiani and Somaini (2018).


                                                            3
productivity, free trade does not induce full wage equalization, which opens the door to migration flows.
However, free trade and free labor mobility is never a Nash equilibrium outcome. The reason is that
domestic workers in the country with high real wages under free trade prefer to block free labor mobility
because the flow of immigrants would reduce their real wages. We also show that in a Heckscher-Ohlin
economy is more complicated than in a Ricardian economy to support free trade and no labor mobility
as a Nash equilibrium outcome. Only when the country with high real wages under free trade is fully
specialized in the non-labor intensive good (which requires that the countries are endowed with very
dissimilar relative factors endowments), workers in both countries are willing to support free trade.
   In a Ricardo-Vinner specific factors economy, free trade and free labor mobility is not a Nash equilib-
rium outcome either. Once again, under free trade, real wages decrease with the size of the labor force,
inducing workers in the country with high real wages to favor blocking labor mobility. In order to keep
things as simple as possible, we assume that both industries are equally labor-intensive, which makes
free trade and no labor mobility a Nash equilibrium outcome. On the contrary, if industries differ in
their labor intensities, workers in the country with a comparative advantage in the non-labor-intensive
industry might prefer to block free trade.
   Finally, we explore trade and migration policies in a model with three sectors (two tradeable and one
non-tradeable) and three factors of production (e.g., capital, natural resources and labor). This model
allows us to capture a different channel through which workers are in favor of free trade, namely, the
role of the non-tradeable sector. In the poor country, which specializes in the natural resource-intensive
good, workers are employed in the non-tradeable sector. They support free trade because it increases the
demand of the non-tradeable good and, hence, wages. In the rich country, which is diversified, workers are
employed in the capital-intensive manufacturing sector and in the non-tradeable sector. They support
free trade because it expands the demands for the manufactured good and the non-tradeable good,
inducing higher wages. Thus, free trade and no labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome. Regarding
international labor mobility, workers in the poor country clearly support free labor mobility because they
want to be able to migrate to the rich country. Even if some workers are immobile, they will also support
free labor mobility since a reduction in the labor force of the poor country will increase wages and improve
the terms of trade. However, workers in the rich country prefer to block immigration because any increase
in the domestic labor force reduces their wages and deteriorates the country’s terms of trade. Thus, free
trade and free labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome.

1.1.3   Inducing free trade and free labor mobility

We also study three alternative ways of overcoming this negative result, that is, we explore changes in
the economic and political environment as well as in the set of policy instruments available, that make



                                                     4
trade and labor mobility a Nash equilibrium outcome.
   First, we introduce differentiated products, monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale,
à la Krugman (1979) and Helpman (1981), in one of the tradeable sectors of a simple Ricardian economy.
In this environment, workers from a scarcely populated rich country may prefer to allow migration flows,
at least for a certain range of the population, because a bigger labor force induces an expansion of the
number of varieties produced and a reduction in the price of each variety. Indeed, we deduce conditions
under which free trade and some, but not full, free international labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium
outcome of the political economy game. This may help to explain why immigration policies in the U.S.
were very liberal until the end of the 19th century, but then became much more restrictive in the early
20th century.
   A second way of generating free labor mobility is to introduce an elite that extracts income from
workers as in Acemoglu and Robinson (2012). In particular, we show that, if the extractive elite in the
rich country is powerful enough, then free labor mobility is possible. The reason for this is that, although
the extractive elite in the rich country is hurt by the reduction in wages induced by an inflow of workers,
immigrants are also a new source of income for the elite (more workers to extract from). Hence, if the
second effect outweighs the first one and the elite is relatively powerful, then the rich country will permit
an inflow of workers. Trade, however, is not a source of conflict between workers and the elite because,
in a Ricardian world, everybody gains from trade. In other words, workers in a rich country only care
about wages, while the extractive elite cares about total labor income. This produces a conflict of interest
between workers and the elite in regard to labor mobility but not with regard to trade policy.
   Finally, we introduce an immigration fee. In particular, we assume that the recipient country can
charge an income tax to immigrant workers and pay transfers to domestic workers. Under free trade, the
flow of immigrants has an ambiguous effect on the wellbeing of workers from the rich country because,
on the one hand, it reduces real wages in the rich country, but, on the other hand, it increases the
revenue from immigration fees. Moreover, we find conditions under which the second effect dominates
the first one and, therefore, workers from the rich country are better off charging an immigration fee that
induces positive migration flows rather than completely blocking migration. Mobile workers in the poor
country are always better off if they can migrate to the rich country, while immobile workers from the
poor country benefit from the rise in real wages caused by the outflow of workers. Thus, free trade and
international labor mobility subject to a positive, but not prohibitive immigration fee could be supported
as a Nash equilibrium outcome.

1.2       Related literature

As we have already mentioned, the economic and political economy literature has devoted much less
attention to migration than to international trade in both theoretical and empirical terms (Facchini,
2004, and Facchini, Mayda and Mishra, 2007). Nevertheless, there is a very interesting body of literature
on labor mobility, migration policies and the political economy of migration. First of all, there is a well-
established body of literature on international factor mobility and, in particular, on the determinants
and effects of migration (see, among others, Mundell 1957, Markusen 1983, Grossman 1983, and Wong
1995).
       Second, several works have shed light on the crucial role played by international labor mobility
in the convergence of living standards between Europe and America during the 19th and early 20th
centuries (e.g., Taylor and Williamson, 1997, O’Rourke and Sinnott, 2003, O’Rourke, 2004, and Hatton
and Williamson, 2005).4 These studies suggest that international labor mobility has a strong influence on
cross-country convergence of levels of well-being. Numerous authors have also documented the fact that
migration policies became much more restrictive in the 20th century and that, nowadays, international
labor markets are much less integrated than international markets of commodities are (e.g., O’Rourke,
2004 and Hatton and Williamson, 2007, Rodrik 2002, Freeman 2006 and Clements 2011).5
       Third, there is an empirical literature that investigates the effects of several shocks that affected
migration flows on wages and employment of domestic workers. See, among others, Nickell and Saleheen
(2009) for a recent evaluation of the literature and new estimates for Great Britain. Unfortunately, these
works focus on relatively small shocks in migration flows and, therefore, they are not necessarily informa-
tive on the effects of unrestricted mass migration. Indeed, in a Ricardian economy with a finite number
of goods, there is a simple theoretical argument that suggests that under free trade small migration flows
may have no effect on wages, while free labor mobility has a significant impact on wages (for details,
   4
       Taylor and Williamson (1997) find that international real wage dispersion declined by 28% from 1870 to 1910, but
that without the mass migrations that occurred during this period, wage dispersion would have increased by 7%. In the
same vein, O’Rourke (2004) reports that wages rose in emigration countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
converging with countries of immigration (see also Hatton and Williamson, 2005). O’Rourke and Sinnott (2003) argue that
”One hundred years ago mass emigration raised living standards significantly in countries such as Ireland, Italy and Sweden,
enabling them to converge on the core countries of the day, Britain and the U.S. Indeed, mass migration can account for as
much as 70% of the convergence in living standards worldwide which occurred during the late 19th century.”

    O’Rourke (2004) and Hatton and Williamson (2007) show that liberal policies on immigration during the 19th century
came to an end in the early 20th century, when many popular destination countries began imposing severe restrictions on
immigration. Moreover, they document that these restrictions have remained in place even after many restrictions on the
movement of goods have been eliminated. Freeman (2006) examines the degree of international economic integration in
labor compared with other factors and concludes that the labor market is the least developed facet of globalization. In line
with this view, see also Rodrik (2002) and Clements (2011).

see section 3.2). There is also evidence that large trade shocks have significant effects on wages and
employment (see, among others, Autor, Dorn and Hanson 2016), suggesting that large migration flows
also produce large effects on wages. Indeed, in a Heckscher-Ohlin model with country-specific total factor
productivity, the effect of trade and labor mobility on real wages is greater than the effect of trade alone
(see, section 4.1).
   Fourth, although the political economy of labor mobility has not been fully explored, several works
have discussed different economic and political determinants of migration policies. Foreman-Peck (1992)
develops a simple political economy model of factor mobility focused on the receiving country. He
shows that if the government of the receiving country gives a great deal of weight to the interests
of landowners (workers) and if land and labor are complements, then immigration policies will tend
to be open (restrictive). Along the same lines, Benhabib (1996) shows that, under majority voting,
immigrants with skills that are complementary with those of the median voter will be selected. Razin
and Sadka (1999) study the political economy of immigration when the receiving country has a pay-
as-you-go pension system, and Razin, Sadka, and Swagell (2000) investigate how unskilled immigration
affects redistribution policies in the host country. Hatton and Williamson (2007) emphasize that trade is
based on comparative advantage, while migration is based on absolute advantage. They also mention the
spread of democracy and the decline of empires as an explanation for the change in migration policies
in the 20th century. Mayda (2007), in line with our multifactor model with a non-tradeable sector,
attributes the observed differences in attitudes toward trade and immigration (today, people are more
pro-trade than pro-immigration) to the influence exerted by individuals working in non-tradeable sectors.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no formal international political economy model that
explains the existence of very few restrictions on international trade in conjunction with severe restrictions
on international labor mobility. In this paper we develop a simple but formal model of trade and labor
mobility policies.
   Finally, our extension with an immigration fee used to finance transfers to domestic workers is related
to and Eichenberger and Stadelmann (2017), who explore labor mobility with residency fees, and Posner
and Weyl (2018), who propose a system for democratizing immigration visas that could generate benefits
for unskilled workers in developed countries.
   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an international political economy
model for the determination of trade and labor mobility policies. Sections 3 and 4 characterize the
equilibrium of the model for different Ricardian economies and for factor proportions models, respectively.
Section 5 develops three extensions in which free trade and at least some labor mobility is a Nash
equilibrium. Section 5.1 introduces monopolistic competition, differentiated products and economies of
scale in one of the sectors of the simple Ricardian model. Section 5.2 introduces an extractive elite in
the political economy model. Section 5.3 introduces migration fees. Section 6 concludes.

2     A simple model of trade and labor mobility policies
In this section we present a simple model of international trade and labor mobility. All the models in
the paper are particular cases of this framework.

2.1   Countries, endowments, technologies and preferences

Consider a world integrated by J countries indexed by j = 1, ...,J. Each country
                                                                                 is characterized by
                      j                                   j         j     j
its labor endowment L̄ , its endowment of other factors F̄ = F̄1 , ..., F̄F and technologies for the
production of a set of goods Z. Let Qjz indicate the aggregate production of good z ∈ Z in country j
and Ljz (Ff,z
           j
              ) the amount of labor (factor f ) employed in industry z in country j. All agents have the
same utility function u cj , where cj is the consumption plan of an agent in country j.
                          


2.2   Factor mobility

Only a fraction m ∈ [0, 1] of the labor endowment of each country is mobile at zero cost. The rest of
the labor endowment and all other factors are completely immobile. Let JM be a partition of J. A
set JM ∈ JM is a subset of countries that allow labor mobility among them, but do not allow it with
the rest of the world. Then, for each j ∈ JM , the labor force of country j, denoted by Lj , is given by
Lj = (1 − m) L̄j + θ j m i∈JM L̄i , where θ j is the proportion of the mobile labor force in JM that selects
                        P

to locate in country j. Naturally, θ j ∈ [0, 1] and i∈JM θ i = 1. Mobile workers locate in the country
                                                       P

in which they get a higher utility. Thus, choice-of-location decisions come from selecting θ i i∈J in
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                         M
order to maximize i∈JM θ i v i , where v i is the indirect utility of a worker located in country i. Although
                   P

all workers located in country j will earn the same utility v j , not all workers originally from country j
necessarily get the same utility. For this reason, we will denote by v j,m (v j,im ) the indirect utility of a
mobile (immobile) worker originally from country j.

2.3   Trade

Let ZT ⊂ Z be the set of tradeable goods and ZN ⊂ Z the set of non-tradeable goods. Logically,
ZT ∪ ZN = Z. Let JT be a partition of J. A set JT ∈ JT is a subset of countries that allow trade among
themselves, but do not allow it with the rest of the world. pjz denotes the price of good z in country j
and Czj indicates
                 the aggregate
                               consumption of good z in country j. Then, for z ∈ ZT , pjz = pz for j ∈ JT
and j∈JT pz Qjz − Czj = 0, and for z ∈ ZN , Qjz = Czj .
    P




                                                      8
2.4       Politics

In each country there is a government which selects trade and migration policies in order to maximize the
welfare of its native worker (mobile and immobile workers of the country). When we refer to the “trade
and labor mobility policies” of a country, we are talking about whether the country allows international
trade and labor mobility with each of the other countries in the world or not. When we refer to the
“welfare of native workers”, we are saying that the government of each country selects its trade and labor
mobility policies with the aim of maximizing the utilitarian social welfare function

                                              WGj = mv j,m + (1 − m) v j,im

that gives exactly the same weight to every native-born worker (mobile and immobile) and no weight
at all to foreign immigrants. The implicit assumption is that potential foreign immigrants do not have
political power to influence domestic decisions on trade and labor mobility.
       The timing of events is as follows: 1) Governments simultaneously determine trade and labor mobility
policies. 2) Mobile workers choose their location. 3) Given the labor force of each country, countries
produce, trade and consume.


2.5       Equilibrium

We define the equilibrium as a combination of market equilibrium6 for the economy and Nash equilibrium
for policy decisions. Formally, an equilibrium is: (i) a pair of partitions of the set of countries (JT , JM ); (ii)
for each (JT , JM ), a distribution of the labor force into countries Lj j∈J ; and (iii) for each (JT , JM ) and
                                                                          
                                                                                                    

3     Trade and labor mobility policies in Ricardian economies
This section studies international trade and labor mobility in a Ricardian world.

3.1    A simple Ricardian economy

Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and one non-
tradeable good (ZN = {3}). Production functions are Qjz = Ljz /ajL,z , where ajL,z > 0 is the unit labor
requirement in industry z ∈ Z = ZT ∪ ZN in country j ∈ J. Let Az = a2L,z /a1L,z and assume A1 > A2 ,
i.e., country 1 has a comparative advantage in good 1. Let L̄j and Lj be the labor endowment and the
labor force of country j, respectively. Onlya fraction
                                                       m ∈ [0, 1] of L̄j is mobile. All agents have the same
preferences, given by u cj = z∈Z αz ln cjz , with αz > 0 and z∈Z αz = 1. Let wj and pjz denote
                                P                                     P

                    priceof good z in P
                                        country j, respectively. Thus, the indirect utility function is
 j
         P            j  j
v = C + z∈Z αz ln w /pz , where C = z∈Z αz ln (αz ).
    Lemma 1 characterizes the effects of trade and labor mobility on the relative well-being of workers
in both countries. Let v j (λT , λM ) be the utility of a worker located in country j, where λT = 1 if
JT = {{1, 2}} and λT = 0, otherwise, and λM = 1 if JM = {{1, 2}} and λM = 0, otherwise. Thus,
λT = 1 indicates that both countries accept free trade, while λT = 0 indicates that at least one country
refuses to trade and, hence, both countries operate under autarky. λM = 1 indicates that both countries
accept free labor mobility, while λM = 0 indicates that at least one country does not accept free labor
mobility and, hence, mobile workers are forced to remain in their own country.
                                                                           

    1. If ∆ > T 1 − T 2 , then trade produces divergence in real wages, but trade and labor mobility undo the
       divergence, inducing complete convergence. Formally: v 1 (1, 0) − v 2 (1, 0) > v 1 (0, 0) − v 2 (0, 0) >
       v 1 (1, 1) − v 2 (1, 1) = 0.

    2. If 0 < ∆ < T 1 − T 2 , then trade produces convergence in real wages, and trade and labor mobility
       produces complete convergence. Formally: v 1 (0, 0) − v 2 (0, 0) > v 1 (1, 0) − v 2 (1, 0) > v 1 (1, 1) −
       v 2 (1, 1) = 0.

    3. If ∆ < 0, then trade produces a reversal of fortune but trade and labor mobility undo this reversal
       inducing complete convergence in real wages. Formally: v 1 (0, 0) − v 2 (0, 0) > v 1 (1, 1) − v 2 (1, 1) =
       0 > v 1 (1, 0) − v 2 (1, 0). Proof: see Appendix A.1. 

       Under free trade, labor mobility induces complete convergence in real wages. The reason for this is
that mobile workers migrate from the poor country to the rich country until real wages are the same
in both places. There are two implicit assumptions behind this result. First, there must be a suffi-
cient number of mobile workers. Otherwise, even if all mobile workers in the poor country migrate
to the rich country, real wages will not be fully equalized. Second, real wages must be equalized be-
fore the rich country starts producing both tradeable goods. A1 > α1 L̄2 + mL̄1 /α2 (1 − m) L̄1 >

alone has a positive effect on the well-being of everybody, but an ambiguous effect in terms of con-
vergence. While, under autarky, differences in real wages depend only on relative aggregate productivity
(real wages are higher in country 1 when T 1 > T 2 ), under free trade, they depend on relative la-
bor abundance, expenditure shares and relative levels of productivity in the non-tradeable sector, but
not on relative levels of productivity in the tradeable sector (real wages are higher in country 1 when
∆ = (α1 + α2 ) ln α1 L̄2 /α2 L̄1 + TN1 − TN2 > 0). That is, under free trade, country 1 is relatively richer
                                           

than country 2 if it is relatively labor-scarce, it specializes in a good with a relatively high expenditure
share and it is relatively more productive in the non-tradeable sector. Indeed, it is even possible for
trade to produce a reversal of fortunes if the country with higher aggregate productivity is relatively
labor-abundant, it specializes in a good with a low expenditure share and productivity differences in the
non-tradeable sector are small.
       Let WGj (λT , λM ) denotes the social welfare function of country j when trade and migration policies
are (λT , λM ). Proposition 1 characterizes the political equilibrium.
                                                                                                                    −α3

                                                                                                            > (A3 ) α1 +α2 >

equilibrium outcomes: (i) neither trade nor labor mobility; (ii) no trade and free labor mobility; and (iii)
free trade and no labor mobility.7 Moreover:

   1. WG1 (1, 0) > WG1 (0, 1) = WG1 (0, 0), i.e., for country 1, free trade and no labor mobility is better than
         no trade and free labor mobility or no trade and no labor mobility;

             WG2 (1, 0) , WG2 (0, 1) > WG2 (0, 0), while WG2 (1, 0) > WG2 (0, 1) if and only if:

       Note that some of the Nash equilibrium outcomes can be reached using different Nash equilibrium strategy profiles. For
example, the outcome free trade and no labor mobility can be reached by both countries accepting trade and blocking free
labor mobility or by both countries accepting trade and only the rich country under free trade blocking free labor mobility.
The same applies to all the propositions in the paper.


                                                              11
         In other words, for country 2, free trade and no labor mobility and no trade and free labor mobility
         are better than no trade and no labor mobility, while free trade and no labor mobility are better
         than no trade and free labor mobility when productivity differences are not too large. Proof: see
         Appendix A.1. 

       No trade and no labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome because if one country decides to isolate
itself, there is nothing that the other country can do to change the political equilibrium. This is a very
unlikely equilibrium, however. In fact, free trade and no labor mobility is also a Nash equilibrium outcome,
and it is strictly preferred to complete isolation by both countries.8 No trade and free labor mobility
is also a Nash equilibrium outcome. If one country decides to restrict trade, free trade is impossible
no matter what policy is chosen by the other country. In such circumstances, domestic workers in the
rich country and immobile workers in the poor country do not worry about immigration because real
wages are fully determined by domestic productivity and do not depend on labor endowments. Mobile
workers in the poor country are eager to migrate to the rich country because productivity and, hence, real
wages are higher there. For the rich country, this equilibrium outcome is always dominated by free trade
and no labor mobility. For the poor country, the comparison between the two equilibria is ambiguous
(condition (1)). On the one hand, free trade generates gains from trade for all citizens. On the other
hand, free labor mobility generates an increase in real wages for mobile workers equal to the aggregate
productivity differences between the countries. Note, however, that no trade and free labor mobility is
not a robust equilibrium outcome. For example, if workers in the rich country have a slight aversion to
immigration, then no trade and free labor mobility ceases to be a Nash equilibrium outcome. Finally,
free trade and free labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. Under free trade, domestic workers
in a rich country (a labor-scarce country that specializes in the production of tradeable goods with a high
expenditure share and with high productivity in the non-tradeable sector) are opposed to labor mobility
because the flow of immigrants would reduce their real wages. Proposition 1, in conjunction with Lemma
1, suggests that part of the lack of convergence in real wages among countries can be attributed to a
political equilibrium that allows trade but bans migration.
   8
       Bagwell and Staiger (1999) study a two-country game in which governments simultaneously select their tariffs. They
show that Nash equilibrium tariffs are inefficient because neither government internalizes the negative terms-of-trade effect
that an increase in its import duties has on the other country. They also show how trade agreements could partially resolve
this problem, inducing a Pareto improvement from the Nash equilibrium. We can reinterpret autarky in our model as the
equilibrium without a trade agreement (high tariffs) and free trade as the equilibrium with a trade agreement (low tariffs).

   Next we show that essentially the same results hold for more complex Ricardian Economies. In
particular, we explore three changes in the economy. First, we briefly discuss various changes in the set
of goods. Introducing more tradeable and/or non-tradeable goods does not affect the results regardless
of whether we are dealing with a continuum of goods with exogenous non-tradeable goods or endogenous
non-tradeable goods induced by iceberg transportation costs (Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson, 1977).
Second, we consider a Ricardian model with non-homothetic preferences, following Matsuyama (2000).
Finally, we study the determination of trade and labor mobility policies in a multi-country Ricardian
model with a continuum of goods, along the lines of Eaton and Kortum (2002).

3.2   Multiple goods (Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson, 1977)

The results obtained in section 3.1 can easily be extended to a finite set of tradeable and non-tradeable
goods (see Appendix A.2 for details). The key complication is that, under free trade, the marginal
tradeable good in the chain of comparative advantage may or may not be produced by both countries.
If, under no labor mobility in the trading equilibrium, each country produces a different set of tradeable
goods, then labor mobility increases real wages in the poor country and decreases them in the rich one.
As a consequence, workers in the rich country are opposed to free labor mobility. Conversely, if, under
no labor mobility in the trading equilibrium, both countries are producing the marginal good, then small
changes in the country-allocation of mobile workers do not affect either the set of goods produced by
each country or real wages in either country. As a consequence, the rich country will be willing to allow
some immigrants to enter. However, once the poor country stops producing the marginal good and that
good’s production is fully relocated to the rich country, real wages in the rich country start decreasing
and, hence, workers in the rich country no longer accept labor mobility. This could explain why several


                                                                                       13
empirical works find that small migration flows have no effect on domestic wages, while historical studies
that focus on mass migration suggest that there are significant effects on real wages and convergence.
    A more elegant way of introducing multiple goods is to consider a continuum of goods as in Dornbusch,
Fischer and Samuelson (1977) (see Appendix A.2 for details). Indeed, in this setting, it is always the
case that, under free trade, any reallocation of mobile workers to other countries changes the marginal
industry and, as a consequence, increases real wages in one country and decreases them in the other.
This holds in the case of exogenous non-tradeable goods and also in the case of endogenous non-tradeable
goods induced by iceberg transportation costs. Hence, with a continuum of goods, under free trade, labor
mobility always reduces real wages in the rich country, which implies that workers in the rich country
are opposed to labor mobility.


3.3    Non-homothetic preferences (Matsuyama, 2000)

Until this point, we have assumed Cobb-Douglas preferences. It is well-known that many trade and
development patterns can be explained much more accurately when using non-homothetic preferences.
In order to verify that our results are consistent with those preferences, in this section we consider a
Ricardian economy with non-homothetic preferences as in Matsuyama (2000) (see Appendix A.3 for
details).
    Consider an economy with two countries (J = {1, 2}) and a continuum of tradeable goods Z = [0, ∞)
indexed by z (in order to stress the role of non-homothetic preferences we assume that all goods are
tradeable.) Country 1 has a comparative advantage in higher indexed goods. Specifically, assume that
Az = a2L,z /a1L,z is a continuously differentiable strictly increasing function, A0 < 1 and limz→∞ Az > 1.
Each agent owns 1 unit of labor and is either mobile or immobile. Goods come in discrete units and
each agent can consume a unit or no unit of each good. Specifically, the utility function is given by
     R∞
u cj = 0 bz cjz dz, where bz > 0 is the utility weight of good z and cjz = 1 if good z is consumed and
cjz = 0 if it is not. Moreover, bz /ajL,z is a decreasing function of z for each j. Proposition 2 characterizes
the political equilibrium.
                                                                                                           R v̄1

   Proposition 2 suggests that our results continue to hold even when preferences are non-homothetic.
Free trade and free labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome because workers in the rich country
under free trade prefer to block labor mobility. All other outcomes are Nash equilibria. For the rich
country under autarky (country 1), free trade and no labor mobility prevail over all other possible
equilibrium outcomes. For the poor country under autarky (country 2), free trade and no labor mobility
prevail over no trade and free labor mobility when condition (2) holds, i.e., when the gains from trade

3.4    Multiple countries (Eaton and Kortum, 2002)
In this section, we introduce multiple countries. We base our analysis on the Ricardian model developed
by Eaton and Kortum (2002) (see Appendix A.4 for details). Consider an economy with a finite set of
countries, J and a continuum of tradeable goods, ZT = [0, 1]. Assume there are no geographic barriers
that limit the mobility of tradeable goods, i.e., we consider the zero-gravity case. However, as in previous
sections, not all workers are mobile. Let L̄j and Lj be the labor endowment and the labor force of country
j, respectively. Only a fraction m ∈ [0, 1] of L̄j is mobile. Preferences are identical for all agents in every

i.e., the cumulative distribution function of aL,z is given by Pr aL,z ≤ a = 1 − e −T      , where T j > 0
and θ > σ − 1. These distributions are independent across goods and countries.
   Proposition 3 characterizes the political equilibrium when each country can decide to trade or not and
can decide to allow labor mobility or not with each other country. The only restriction that we impose
is that if country i accepts free trade (labor mobility) with country j and country j accepts free trade
(labor mobility) with country k, then country i must accept free trade (labor mobility) with country k.

      In other words, if the above condition holds, then for country j, complete free trade and no labor
      mobility are better than complete free factor mobility and no trade.

  4. Any pattern of trade policy other than complete autarky and any pattern of labor mobility policy
      within the countries that trade with each other other than no labor mobility are not a Nash equi-
      librium outcome. In particular, complete free trade and any pattern of labor mobility policy other
      than no mobility are not a Nash equilibrium outcome. Proof: see Appendix A.4. 

   Proposition 3 confirms our main results in a multi-country setting. Although there are many equilib-
rium outcomes, note that complete free trade is incompatible with any form of labor mobility. The reason
for this is that, under free trade, workers in a relatively rich country always prefer to block labor mobility
from relatively poor countries. This produces a cascade effect. The richest country does not want to
accept labor mobility. Then, the second-richest country also prefers to block labor mobility and so on
until labor mobility is completely blocked. Moreover, it is not possible to divide the world into zones that
allow free trade and free labor mobility within the zone but do not allow trade or labor mobility with the
rest of world. The problem is that each free trade zone is a miniature version of the world under complete
free trade. Hence, the richer countries within the zone will prefer to block intra-zone labor mobility.
   Proposition 3 also extends our results concerning how countries rank different equilibrium outcomes.
If there is no trade at all, then all countries will be at least as well off with full labor mobility as
with any other equilibrium outcome that restricts labor mobility. Mobile workers will relocate to the
most productive country in the world, while immobile workers all over the world and all workers in the
most productive country in the world will not be affected by migration flows, since their wages are only

                                                        16
determined by the level of productivity. If there is no labor mobility at all, then all countries are better
off with complete free trade rather than with any other equilibrium outcome that imposes restrictions
on trade. This is a standard gains-from-trade argument in a Ricardian model. The larger the set of
countries that engage in free trade, the larger the gains from comparative advantage and trade. Finally,
we can compare free trade and no labor mobility with no trade and free labor mobility. Equation (3)
is the key condition. The left-hand side of it represents the gains for country j associated with moving
from complete autarky to complete free trade. The right-hand side represents the gains for country j
associated with moving from no labor mobility to full labor mobility (all the while under autarky). Note
that, for the richest country in the world under autarky (the country with the highest T j ), condition (3)
always holds because the gains from trade are positive, while labor mobility under autarky does not have
any effect on the country. In general, in this model, gains from trade are relatively high for a sparsely
                                                1      θ
populated country with low productivity ( T j 1+θ L̄j 1+θ low), while gains from labor mobility under
autarky are relatively high for a country with low productivity (T j low). Since some very poor countries
are also very populous, it is not clear which countries will prefer free trade and no labor mobility to no
trade and free labor mobility.


4        Trade and labor mobility policies in factor proportions models
In a Ricardian economy, trade policy is not a source of internal conflict because everybody gains when
countries engage in international trade. On the contrary, in a multiple factors economy, potentially, there
are winners and losers from international trade. This section studies trade and migration policies in
several models with multiple factors of production. First, we consider a Heckscher-Ohlin model with
country-specific total factor productivity. Second, we explore a Ricardo-Vinner specific factors model.
Finally, in the context of a single small open economy, Galiani, Schofield and Torrens (2014), Galiani,
Heymann and Magud (2017), and Galiani and Somaini (2018) develop several versions of multi-factors
models, in which workers employed in the non-tradeable sector do not support protectionist policies. We
build on these models, extending them to the case of two economies that could potentially engage in
trade of goods as well as into labor mobility between them.
        In all cases, we assume that each government selects trade and migration policies to maximize the
utility of domestic workers. For example, this could be the case of two democracies, where workers
are the majority of the voters. Formally, the objective function of country j’s government is given by
WGj = mvLj,m + (1 − m) vLj,im , where vLj,m (vLj,im ) denotes the utility of a mobile (immobile) worker in
country j.9

    Proposition 4 extends the main result in Section 3 to a Heckscher-Ohlin economy. In a Heckscher-
Ohlin economy free trade and free labor mobility is never a Nash equilibrium outcome (see Fig 2.a).
The reason is that domestic workers in the country with high real wages under free trade prefer to
block free labor mobility because the flow of immigrants would reduce their real wages. For example,
within the diversification cone, the utility of a worker in country j under free trade is vLj (1, λM ) =
             α̃  T 1 F̄ 1 +T 2 F̄ 2 α̃
T j C 1−α̃α̃       T 1 L1 +T 2 L2         . Thus, if mobile workers are allowed to choose their location, they will locate
in country 1 (since T 1 > T 2 ), reducing the utility of workers in country 1 (note that vL1 (1, λM ) is
decreasing in L1 /L2 ).
    There are also some differences between the political equilibria of the trade and labor mobility game
under a Heckscher-Ohlin and a Ricardian economy. First, in a Heckscher-Ohlin economy is more compli-
cated than in a Ricardian economy to make free trade and no labor mobility a Nash equilibrium outcome.
country does not accept free labor mobility.


                                                           18
For example, within the diversification cone (regions a1 and a2 in Fig 2.b), the workers of the country
importing the labor-intensive good always prefer to block international trade. Indeed, the only way in
which workers in both countries are willing to support free trade is when the relative factors endowments
of the countries are very different (regions b2 , c2 , e2 and f2 in Fig. 2.b), inducing the country with high
real wages under free trade to fully specialized in the non-labor intensive good.
    Second, unlike in a Ricardian economy, in a Heckscher-Ohlin economy, no trade and free labor mobility
is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. In a Ricardian economy, under autarky, real wages are not fully
determined by the productivity of the country and, hence, they are not affected by the size of the labor
force. On the contrary, in a Heckscher-Ohlin economy, under autarky, real wages depend on the country’s
total factor productivity, but also on factor endowments (ceteris paribus, real wages decrease with F̄ j /Lj ).
Therefore, workers in the country with high real wages under autarky oppose labor mobility.

Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and three factors of
                                                                                 b  1−b

with b ∈ (0, 1). Factor endowments in country j are F̄1j , F̄2j , L̄j > (0, 0, 0). All agents have the same

characterize the equilibrium under autarky and free trade. The following proposition characterizes the
political equilibrium.

trade and no labor mobility; and (ii) free trade and no labor mobility. Moreover, WGj (1, 0) > WGj (0, 0)
for j = 1, 2. Proof: see Appendix B.2. 

    As in a Heckscher-Ohlin economy, in a Ricardo-Vinner specific factors economy, free trade and free
labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. The intuition is analogous. Real wages under free
trade decline with the size of the labor force and, hence, workers in the country with high real wages
under free trade prefer to restrict labor mobility. Under autarky, real wages also fall as workers relocate
to the country with high real wages under autarky. Therefore, no trade and free labor mobility is not a
Nash equilibrium outcome, either. Finally, free trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium
outcome. The reason is that we have assumed that both industries are equally labor-intensive. Otherwise,
the workers in the country with a comparative advantage in the non-labor-intensive industry might prefer
to block free trade.


4.3    Multiple factors and non-tradeable goods

Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (a rural good F and manufactures
M ), one non-tradeable good (services N ) and three factors of production (capital K, natural resources F
                                                                b  j 1−b j              b     1−b

                                              , with αz > 0 and z∈Z αz = 1. In the appendix we fully
characterize the equilibrium under autarky and free trade. Moreover, we find conditions under which
country 1 has a comparative advantage in manufactures and country 2 specializes in rural products. The
following proposition characterizes the political equilibrium.

Proposition 6 (multiple factors and non-tradeable goods).                            There is a vector of thresholds
(κ̄1 , κ̄2 , κ̄3 ) such that, if K̄ 1 /K̄ 2 > κ̄1 , L̄1 F̄ 2 /L̄2 F̄ 1 > κ̄2 and TN1 /TN2 > κ̄3 , then, the trade and labor
mobility game has only two Nash equilibrium outcomes: no trade and no labor mobility and free trade
and no labor mobility. Moreover, WGj (1, 0) > WGj (0, 0) for j = 1, 2. Proof: see Appendix B.3. 

       As in previous sections no trade and no labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome. Nothing can be
done if one country decides to fully isolate itself. Free trade and no labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium
outcome because workers in both countries gain from free trade. Workers in country 1 are better off
accepting international trade than under autarky for two reasons. First, in country 1 free trade leads to
an expansion of the manufacturing sector and a contraction of the rural sector. This induces an increase
in the demand of labor. Second, free trade expands the aggregate income in the tradeable sectors, which
increases the demand of the non-tradeable good and, hence, the demand of labor. Both effects operate
in the same direction, pushing wages up. The situation for workers in country 2 is more complicated. On
the one hand, free trade produces a contraction in the manufacturing sector and an expansion in the rural
sector. This leads to a decrease in labor demand. On the other hand, free trade expands the demand
of the non-tradeable good and, therefore, labor demand. This effect is bigger the higher the equilibrium
terms of trade. The first condition in Proposition 6 assures that the equilibrium terms of trade are high
enough for the second effect to be dominant. The second condition in Proposition 6 implies that workers
in country 1 are richer than workers in country 2. Thus, if international labor mobility is allowed, there
will be migrations to country 1. This will lead to an increase in the labor supply of country 1, depressing
domestic wages. In addition, the increase in the labor supply will expand the production of manufactures,
inducing export-biased growth in country 1 and a corresponding decline in the terms of trade of country
1. In order to avoid these effects, workers in country 1 will oppose international labor mobility. As a
consequence, free trade and free labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. No trade and free
  10
       We could have easily assumed different coefficients in the production function of each tradeable sector. Qualitative
results do not depend on this simplification.



                                                             21
labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome either. The workers in the high-wage country under
autarky will block migration flows because any increase in the domestic labor force depresses wages.
    The logic behind Proposition 6 applies beyond the particular model we studied in this section. Workers
employed in the non-tradeable sector gain from free trade because the demand of non-tradeable goods is
maximized when the country engages in international trade. If workers in the non-tradeable sector are an
important proportion of the labor force, as it is the case in many postindustrial economies, in each country
there is a solid majority that supports free trade. International labor mobility, however, increases labor
supply in high-wage countries, pushing wages down. As a consequence, workers in high-wage countries
oppose massive immigration.


5     Inducing free trade and free labor mobility
In this section we study three ways to support free trade and free labor mobility as a Nash equilibrium
outcome of the trade and labor mobility game. First, we introduce product differentiation, monopolistic
competition and increasing returns to scale as in Krugman (1979) in one of the tradeable industries of
an, otherwise, simple Ricardian economy. This makes free trade more complicated, but it relaxes the
incentives to block international labor mobility. Second, keeping the economic environment of Section 3
fixed, we explore a change in the political game. Following Acemoglu and Robinson (2012), we introduce
an extractive elite in each country. Under the proper distribution of political power in each country, this
could induce a political equilibrium in which both countries agree to trade and allow free labor mobility.
Finally, we expand the policy instruments available to the governments, allowing the recipient country
to charge a migration fee to foreign workers that decide to locate in the country. If the revenue from
migration fees is used to pay transfers to domestic workers, free trade and free labor mobility could be
supported as a Nash equilibrium outcome.

5.1    Increasing returns to scale (Krugman, 1979)

Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and one non-
tradeable good (ZN = {3}). Goods 2 and 3 are homogenous products, but good 1 is a differentiated
                                                                                      hR           i1

where αz ∈ (0, 1), z∈Z αz = 1, ρ ∈ (0, 1), σ = (1 − ρ)−1 , and cj1 (i) indicates the quantity of variety
                   P

i ∈ [0, n] that is consumed. The production function in sector 1 is Lj1 (i) = ajL,1 Qj1 (i) + f , where Lj1 (i)
is the labor employed in the production of variety i of good 1, Qj1 (i) is the production of variety i of
good 1, f > 0 is the fixed cost of producing a variety of good 1. Production functions in sectors 2 and
3 are as in the simple Ricardian model, i.e., Lj2 = ajL,2 Qj2 , Lj3 = ajL,3 Qj3 . Let Az = a2L,z /a1L,z and assume


                                                       22
A1 > A2 , i.e., country 1 has a comparative advantage in good 1. As in previous sections, L̄j indicates
the labor endowment of country j and only a fraction m ∈ [0, 1] of L̄j is mobile. Contrary to previous
sections, suppose that countries can place partial restrictions on labor mobility. In particular, assume
that each country can choose among three migration policies. Let λM = 0 indicate that at least one
country does not accept labor mobility and, hence, mobile workers are forced to stay in their country,
while λM = 1 indicates that both countries accept complete free labor mobility. Let λM = λ̄M < 1
indicate that the recipient country accepts, at most, no more than a fraction λ̄M of the mobile workers
from the other country, while the country of origin allows at least some portion λ̄M of the mobile workers
of that country to emigrate. As in previous sections, trade policy can be no trade (λT = 0) or complete
free trade (λT = 1).
       The following proposition characterizes the political equilibrium.

Proposition 7 (increasing returns to scale). Suppose that:

       (4) ensures that, under autarky, country 1 is richer than country 2 no matter where mobile workers decide to
go.     This allows us to avoid dealing with multiple economic equilibria.      If complete or partial labor mobility is al-
lowed, mobile workers will always decide to go to or stay in country 1. It is possible to relax this condition to
T 1 − T 2 > [α1 / (σ − 1)] ln (1 − m) L̄2 / L̄1 + mL̄2 , provided that we assume that, when there are two equilibria, all
                                                     

mobile workers decide to go to or stay in country 1. In other words, the cost of relaxing this condition is the imposition of
an equilibrium selection assumption.
  (5) deals with the effects of labor mobility under free trade. First, it ensures that there are enough mobile workers to
equalize real wages under free trade and that real wages are equalized before the rich country starts producing both tradeable
goods. Second, it rules out uninteresting cases in which partial labor mobility is not binding because even when λM = λ̄M ,
enough workers can move to equalize real wages in the countries. Finally, to simplify the analysis, (5) also rules out the
                                                                                                                   −α3
possibility of a reversal of fortune. Thus, under free trade, it is always the case that L2 /L1 ≥ (α2 /α1 ) (A3 ) α1 +α2 , which
implies that country 1 is never poorer than country 2.
  (6) ensures that immobile workers in country 2 are better off under free trade and partial labor mobility than under
autarky and no labor mobility. Moving from autarky and no labor mobility to free trade and partial labor mobility has
two effects on immobile workers in country 2. The first term of (6) captures the standard gains from trade coming from
specialization in the sector with a comparative advantage. Moreover, migration to country 1 only reinforces this effect. The
second term of (6) captures the effects on the number of varieties produced in equilibrium. Under autarky and no labor

      bor mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome, but free trade and free labor mobility is not a Nash
      equilibrium outcome. Proof: see Appendix C.1. 

    As in previous sections, no trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium outcome because
there is no way that a country can change the world equilibrium with a unilateral move in policy. No
trade and partial (free) labor mobility is also a Nash equilibrium outcome. The intuition is as follows.
Under autarky, country 1 favors labor mobility because this brings more workers to the country and,
hence, more varieties of good 1 can be produced in equilibrium. Under autarky, immobile workers in
country 2 are opposed to labor mobility because mobile workers will leave the country, thereby reducing
the varieties of good that can be produced in equilibrium. Conversely, mobile workers in country 2
support labor mobility because they are better off if they relocate to country 1. The condition in part 2
(3) assures that the gains from partial (free) labor mobility enjoyed by mobile workers in country 2 more
than compensate for the losses sustained by immobile workers. Note also that, when these equilibria
exist, the less restrictive equilibrium outcome always dominates more restrictive one. Free trade and
no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium outcome. Since country 1 specializes in the sector that
operates under increasing returns to scale, in addition to the standard gains from trade coming from the
specialization in the sector with a comparative advantage, free trade allows country 1 to further exploits
mobility, country 2 produces n2 = α1 L̄2 /σf varieties of good 1, while under free trade and partial labor mobility in the
trading equilibrium, n = (1 − α3 ) L̄1 + λ̄M mL̄2 /σf varieties are produced. Note that, if n ≥ n2 , then (6) holds trivially;
                                                 

while if n < n2 , (6) simply means that the comparative advantage effect always prevails over the variety effect.


                                                                      24
economies of scale in sector 1. For country 2, free trade has two effects. First, country 2 also enjoys the
standard gains from trade. Second, under autarky, country 2 produces n2 = α1 L̄2 /σf varieties of good
1, while in the trading equilibrium n = (1 − α3 ) L̄1 /σf varieties are produced. The condition in part 4
ensures that the comparative advantage effect prevails over the variety effect.
       The most interesting result in Proposition 7 is part 5. Free trade and partial labor mobility is a
Nash equilibrium outcome, but free trade and complete free labor mobility is not. The intuition is as
follows. Under free trade, labor mobility has two effects on country 1. First, there is a terms-of-trade
effect. As workers move to country 1, L1 increases and L2 decreases, which leads to a deterioration in the
terms of trade of country 1. Second, there is a scale effect. As L1 increases, more varieties of good 1 are
produced in the trading equilibrium. Thus, under free trade, labor mobility has an ambiguous effect on
the well-being of country 1. The condition in part 5 of the proposition simply states that the scale effect
prevails over the terms-of-trade effect when country 1 allows partial labor mobility, but the opposite is
true when there is completely free labor mobility.

5.2       Extractive elites (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012)

Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and one non-
tradeable good (ZN = {3}). Production functions, endowments and preferences are as in section 3. The
novelty is that each of the countries is populated by two types of agents: Lj workers, each of whom
owns one unit of labor, and E j elite members. The elite is a purely extractive one with no productive
role in society (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012). The elite simply appropriates a fraction β j ∈ (0, 1) of
Lj . Moreover, expropriation is socially costly. A fraction δ ∈ (0, 1) of each unit expropriated by the
elite is lost in the process. Formally, after expropriation, each worker keeps 1 − β j units of labor and
                                                                                      

each member of the elite gets δβ j Lj /E j units of labor. Thus, the effective labor force of country j is
L̃j = B j Lj = 1 − β j (1 − δ) Lj . As in previous sections, only a fraction m ∈ [0, 1] of the labor force of
                             

each country is mobile at zero cost. The rest of the labor force and elite members are immobile.
       Each government selects trade and migration policies in order to maximize an utilitarian wel-
fare function WGj , whose weight depends on the size of each group as well as on how influential
they are in the political process. In particular, we assume that each government maximizes WGj =
L̄j [(1−m)vj,im +mvj,m ]+E j (1+ϕj )vj,e
             L̄j +E j (1+ϕj )
                                         , where v j,im , v j,m , v j,e are the indirect utility functions of an immobile
worker, a mobile worker and a member of the elite, respectively.12 ϕj ∈ [−1, ∞] is a measure of the
political power of the elite. If ϕj = −1 (ϕj = ∞), then the government is a perfect agent for domestic
workers (the elite). ϕj can also be considered a measure of how unequal political institutions are (Ace-
  12
       Grossman and Helpman (2001) provide several sets of micro-foundations for a welfare function of this type, including a
combination of a probabilistic voting model with a lobby model.



                                                              25
moglu and Robinson, 2012). Note also that WGj takes into account the welfare of emigrants, but not the
welfare of immigrants. The reason for this is that immigrants tend to have much less political influence
than domestic workers do, particularly with regard to immigration policies. The timing of events is as
in previous sections, and we assume that the elite groups collect their shares after migration has taken
place but before production, trade and consumption decisions have been made.

       (7) implies that, regardless of migration flows, if countries trade, country j specializes in good z = j, and that, under
free trade, labor mobility induces full wage convergence. (8) simply means that the elite of country 1 is less extractive than
the elite of country 2, in the sense that it appropiates a lower fraction of its labor force. (9) ensures that the elite of the rich
country under autarky (country 1) prefers free trade and free labor mobility to autarky and free labor mobility. Intuitively,
for the elite of country 1, when there is free labor mobility, gains from trade prevail over the negative effect that trade
liberalization has on the size of the labor force of country 1. Finally, (10) states that workers in the poor country under
autarky (country 2) prefer free trade and free labor mobility to autarky and free labor mobility. Intuitively, the gains from
trade for all workers in country 2 are higher than the productivity gains under autarky for mobile workers.

       No trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium outcome because, if one country decides
to isolate itself, there is nothing that the other country can do to change the political equilibrium. This
is also a very unlikely equilibrium, however. In fact, free trade and no labor mobility is also always a
Nash equilibrium outcome which dominates complete isolation. No trade and free labor mobility is a
Nash equilibrium outcome when workers in the poor country under autarky (country 2) are politically
powerful (ϕ2 low). The intuition is straightforward. If one country decides to restrict trade, free trade is
impossible no matter what policy is chosen by the other country. Under autarky, workers in country 1
and immobile workers in country 2 do not worry about immigration because real wages do not depend on
labor endowments. Mobile workers in country 2 are eager to migrate to country 1 because real wages are
higher there. The elite in country 1 favors labor mobility because it brings more workers to the country.
The only group that will oppose free labor mobility is the elite in country 2, which would not be able to
extract resources from mobile workers anymore. As a consequence, autarky and free labor mobility is an
equilibrium if the elite in country 2 do not have sufficient political power.
       Free trade and free labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome when the elite of the high-wage
country under free trade and the workers in the low-wage country under free trade are politically pow-
erful.14 The intuition behind this result is straightforward. Domestic workers in a high-wage country
                                                                                                                         α3

       Real wages in country 1 are higher than in country 2 under free trade if and only if α1 Γ1 L̄2 /α2 Γ2 L̄1 (A3 ) α1 +α2 > 1,
                                                                                                                

i.e., when country 1 has a relative shortage of labor (L̄2 /L̄1 high), it has a relatively less extractive elite (Γ1 /Γ2 high),
it specializes in goods with a high expenditure share (α1 /α2 high) and it has relatively high level of productivity in non-
tradeable goods (A3 high).


                                                                            27
under free trade are opposed to labor mobility because the flow of immigrants would reduce their wages.
The extractive elite is also hurt by the reduction in the wage rate, but immigrants are also a new source
of income (more workers to extract resources from). If the second effect outweighs the first, then the
elite is in favor of labor mobility. As a consequence, labor mobility will be allowed only when the elite
is powerful enough to impose its views. Domestic workers in a low-wage country under free trade are
in favor of labor mobility because the flow of emigrants would increase their wages. Higher wages also
benefit the extractive elite, but as mobile workers migrate to the other country, the elite has a smaller
domestic labor force to extract resources from. If the second effect outweighs the first one, the elite is
opposed to free labor mobility. Therefore, labor mobility will be allowed only when workers are powerful
enough to impose their views. Thus, labor mobility can be a major source of conflict between workers
and the elite. In the high-wage country, workers prefer to block labor mobility, while the elite prefer
to allow it. Conversely, in the low-wage country, workers prefer to allow labor mobility, while the elite
prefer to block it. Trade, on the other hand, is not a source of conflict between workers and the elite.
The main reason for this is that, in the Ricardian model, there is only one factor of production and,
hence, free trade makes it possible to exploit the gains from specialization and trade without generating
any redistributive effect. Recall, however, that labor mobility produces different effects under autarky
and free trade and, hence, the elite of country 1 and workers in country 2 might prefer autarky and free
labor mobility to free trade and free labor mobility, which is ruled out under Assumption 7.
   An historical application of the model in this section is Argentina from 1875 to 1930, when the country
was ruled by a landowning-elite. With the pattern of land ownership determined by the political history
of the country, and the prices of exports, imports and capital set by international markets, total land rents
depended on the labor supply. Therefore, immigration policy became a critical variable under the control
of the government. Not surprisingly, the Argentine elite chose to promote immigration. This decreased
wages and increased the return on land. Indeed, Taylor (1997) calibrates a general equilibrium model
to estimate the impact on wages of the massive flow of immigration to Argentina up to the First World
War. His calibration suggests that the flow of immigration reduced real wages by approximately 20%
from what wage levels would have been if immigration had not taken place. During the same period,
Australian immigration policies were substantially different from those of Argentina. Despite having
similar factor endowments, land was more concentrated in Argentina than in Australia, where family-
operated, medium-sized farms were relatively more common. Therefore, landowners in Australia never
controlled the government as they did in Argentina (Hirst, 1979). Additionally, the Australian mining
sector significantly contributed to the emergence of a unionized labor force across the economy. Trade
unions and entrepreneurs involved with mining formed a powerful coalition that opposed the creation of
a ruling land-owning elite as well as free immigration (Diaz Alejandro, 1984).

Proposition 8 shows that, if we introduce a powerful elite that cares about aggregate income (wL), then
free trade and free labor mobility could be a Nash equilibrium outcome. More generally, all we need is a
mechanism through which the payoff for each citizen in the rich country depends on aggregate income.
Next, we eliminate the extractive elite and assume that rich countries charge an entry fee to foreign
mobile workers, which is then distributed among domestic workers.
    Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and one non-
tradeable good (ZN = {3}). Production functions, endowments and preferences are as in the simple
Ricardian economy. Let τ j ∈ [0, 1] be the income tax rate that country j charges to foreign mobile workers
that decide to locate in j. Since there is no tax imposed on domestic workers, τ j can be interpreted as
an entry or immigration fee. The revenue from immigration fees is used to pay transfers to domestic
workers. Let T f j ≥ 0 indicates the transfer per capita received by country j’s workers. The government
of country j selects its trade and migration policies in order to maximize WGj = mvLj,m + (1 − m) vLj,im
subject to T f j L̄j = τ j max Lj − L̄j , 0 , government j’s budget constraint. As in previous sections,
                              

trade policy is λT ∈ {0, 1}, where λT = 1 indicates that both countries accept free trade and λT = 0 that
at least one country refuses to trade. Migration policy is slightly more complicated. Let λM ∈ {0, (1, τ )}
with τ ∈ [0, 1], where λM = 0 indicates that at least one country does not accept free labor mobility and
λM = (1, τ ) indicates that both countries accept labor mobility with the recipient country charging a
proportional income tax τ ∈ [0, 1] to foreign mobile workers.
    The following proposition characterizes the political equilibrium.

      As in Proposition 1 and, for exactly the same reasons, no trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash
equilibrium outcome. It is also an outcome dominated by other Nash equilibrium outcomes. Indeed, as
in Proposition 1, free trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium outcome and it is strictly
preferred to no trade and no labor mobility by both countries. There are also important differences
between Propositions 1 and 9.
      First, when the recipient country cannot charge an immigration fee, no trade and free labor mobility
is a Nash equilibrium outcome (Proposition 1). Under autarky, domestic workers in the rich country
(country 1) and immobile workers in the poor country (country 2) are indifferent with any migration
policy because real wages are fully determined by domestic productivity, while mobile workers in the
poor country are better off migrating to the rich country because real wages are higher there. When
the recipient country can charge an immigration fee, no trade and free labor mobility with immigration
fee τ̂ = 1 − e−(T1 −T2 ) > 0 is a Nash equilibrium outcome (Proposition 9 - Part 1). Under autarky,
domestic workers in the rich country are better off allowing immigration because their real wages are
fully determined by domestic productivity and they receive the transfers from immigration fees, while
workers from the poor country are indifferent with any migration policy. For immobile workers in the
poor country, real wages are fully determined by domestic productivity. Mobile workers from the poor
country locate in the rich country and, hence, earn a high real wage. However, they must also pay an
immigration fee equal to the difference between real wages in the rich and the poor country.
      Second, when the recipient country cannot charge an immigration fee, free trade and free labor
mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome (Proposition 1). Under free trade, domestic workers in a

      τ̄ = 1 − α2 L̄1 /α1 L̄2           (A3 )−α3 is the prohibitive immigration fee. That is, τ ≥ τ̄ implies L1 = L̄1 and L2 = L̄2 .


                                                                      30
rich country are opposed to labor mobility because the flow of immigrants would reduce their real wages.
On the contrary, when the recipient country can charge an immigration fee, free trade and free labor
mobility with immigration fee τ ∗ > 0 is a Nash equilibrium outcome provided that conditions (11) and
(12) hold (Proposition 9 - Part 2). Moreover, whenever (λT , λM ) = (1, (1, τ ∗ )) is a Nash equilibrium
outcome, it is strictly preferred to all other Nash equilibrium outcomes by both countries. Under free
trade, the flow of immigrants reduces real wages in the rich country (country 1), but it increases the
revenue from immigration fees and, hence, the transfer received by each worker in the rich country.

of the immigration fee and, hence, workers from the rich country are better off charging an immigration
fee that induces positive migration flows rather than imposing the prohibitive immigration fee. Mobile
workers in the poor country (country 2) are also better off if they are allowed to migrate to country 1,
while immobile workers from the poor country benefit from the rise in real wages caused by the outflow
of workers.
    Note, however, that (λT , λM ) = (1, (1, τ ∗ )) is not always a Nash equilibrium outcome. There are two
potential complications. First, it is possible that the rich country prefers to deviate to no trade and free
labor mobility with immigration fee τ̂ . The advantage of doing so is that the revenue from immigration
fees could be higher under (λT , λM ) = (0, (1, τ̂ )) than under (λT , λM ) = (1, (1, τ ∗ )). The disadvantage is
that gains from trade are lost. (11) assures that gains from trade are high enough, so this deviation is
not profitable. Second, it is possible that the poor country prefers to deviate to (λT , λM ) = (0, (1, τ ∗ )).
The advantage of doing so is that for mobile workers from the poor country, when τ ∗ < τ̂ and countries
do not trade, migration leave a positive rent. The disadvantage is that gains from trade are lost. (12)
assures that gains from trade for workers in country 2 are high enough, so they do not have an incentive
to deviate from (λT , λM ) = (1, (1, τ ∗ )).


6    Conclusions
We have shown that, by combining a Ricardian economy with a simple international political economy
model, we can explain the salient stylized facts about international trade and labor mobility. In a
Ricardian world, countries use different technologies and, as a consequence, there is no wage equalization
under free trade. This wedge in real wages opens the door to migration flows, which, combined with
free trade, induce full wage convergence. However, workers in rich countries block immigration in order
to protect their high wages. In contrast, nobody is willing to block free trade because, in a Ricardian
world, everybody gains from international trade. Thus, our model naturally explains the present world
equilibrium: few restrictions on international trade in goods and very restrictive barriers to international


                                                        31
labor mobility.
   We have also shown that several multifactor models lead to an analogous result. In particular, we
have studied a version of the standard two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin model, the Ricardo-Vinner specific
factors model, and a three-sector model (two tradeable goods and one non-tradeable good). In all cases,
we have shown that, although it is always possible to find conditions under which free trade and no labor
mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome of the political economy game, free trade and free labor mobility
is never a Nash equilibrium outcome.
   Given this rather negative result, we have explored three extensions of our model in which free trade
and, at least, some migration flows, can be sustained as a Nash equilibrium outcome. One possibility
is to introduce increasing returns to scale. Then, workers in a sparsely populated rich country might
prefer, at least during one phase in the development process, to allow immigration because a bigger labor
force increases the number of varieties of the differentiated good that can be produced in equilibrium,
which can offset the negative effect of immigration flows on wages. Another possibility is to introduce an
extractive elite that prefers to have a bigger labor force to extract resources from. A third alternative is
to introduce an immigration fee in rich countries, implemented as an income tax on immigrants, and use
the revenue generated to pay transfers to domestic workers, which formally backs some recent proposals
to reform immigration policies in developed countries (see, for example, Eichenberger and Stadelmann
2017 and Posner and Weyl 2018).
   Apart from explaining broad patterns of trade and migration policies, this study points to profound
implications for the political economy of development. First, according to our model, workers in rich
countries constitute a very conservative force worldwide. Does this imply that less inclusive political
institutions in rich countries could be beneficial for the world as a whole? A naive interpretation of
our extension involving an extractive elite would lead us to conclude that this is the case. Indeed, as
the extractive elite in the rich country becomes more powerful (ϕ increases), it is more likely that, in
equilibrium, there will be free trade and free labor mobility, which would induce full convergence in the
levels of well-being of workers across the world. An important limitation of this interpretation, however,
is that it fails to take into account the endogenous link between political and economic institutions.
As the extractive elite in the rich country becomes more powerful, we should expect to see economic
institutions deteriorate (β increases). In other words, our model highlights the fact that a socioeconomic
group can play a very progressive internal role by favoring inclusive domestic economic institutions and,
at the same time, a very conservative role in terms of worldwide equilibrium by supporting policies that
restrict cross-country convergence in levels of well-being.
   Second, the model illustrates a more general principle. Institutional differences combined with no
factor mobility induce large differences in economic development across locations, while institutional
differences and free factor mobility are associated with smaller or no differences in economic development

                                                     32
across locations and a greater concentration of resources in locations that have properly functioning
institutions. Thus, institutional differences point to a theory of differential development under no factor
mobility, while they point to a theory of concentration of economic activity under free factor mobility.
However, it is worth noting that, even when there is free factor mobility, better institutions in any location
induce better economic outcomes. In other words, under free factor mobility, the quality of institutions
does not account for differences in economic development across locations, but institutional change could
still be a key determinant of global economic development over time.

A. Trade and labor mobility policies in Ricardian economies
Appendix A presents the proofs of all the results in Section 3. It also develops the details of the results
discussed in Section 3.2 (multiple goods).

A.1 A simple Ricardian economy
Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and one non-
tradeable good (ZN = {3}). Production functions are Qjz = Ljz /ajL,z , where ajL,z > 0 is the unit labor
requirement in industry z in country j. Let Az = a2L,z /a1L,z and assume A1 > A2 . Let L̄j and Lj be the
                                                                        fraction m ∈ [0, 1] of L̄j is mobile.
labor endowment and the labor force of country j, respectively. Only a 
All agents have the same preferences, given by u cj = z∈Z αz ln cjz , with αz > 0 and z∈Z αz = 1.

    Under autarky all goods must be produced domestically and, hence, pjz = wj ajL,z for all z ∈ Z and
j = 1, 2. The indirect
                    utility
                            of a worker who owns one unit of labor in country j is v j = C + T j , where
  j
         P             j
T = − z∈Z αz ln aL,z is a measure of the aggregate productivity of country j. If labor mobility is
allowed, all mobile workers go to or stay in the country with the highest aggregate productivity T j .
      Under free trade, if A1 > α1 L2 /α2 L1 > A2 , then country j specializes in good z = j ∈ {1, 2}. Thus,
p1 = w1 a1L,1 , p2 = w2 a2L,2 , pj3 = wj ajL,3 and the balanced trade condition is α2 w1 L1 = α1 w2 L2 . Therefore,
the indirect utility of a worker who owns one unit of labor is v 1 = C + T 1 + α2 ln α1 L2 /A2 α2 L1 in
                                                                                                               

country 1 and v 2 = C + T 2 + α1 ln A1 α2 L1 /α1 L2 in country 2. If labor mobility is not allowed, then
Lj = L̄j . If labor mobility is allowed, mobile workers will go to or stay in the country with the highest
v j . Since v 1 is decreasing in L1 /L2 while v 2 is increasing in L1 /L2 , if there are enough mobile workers,
                                                                           −α3
they will relocate until v 1 = v 2 . This implies L2 /L1 = (α2 /α1 ) (A3 ) α1 +α2 and, hence, v 1 = v 2 = C + T 2 +
α1 ln (A1 ) + [α1 α3 / (α1 + α2 )] ln (A3 ). Moreover, there will be migrations to country 1 whenever L̄2 /L̄1 >

    (λT , λM ) = (0, 0) is always a Nash equilibrium outcome because, if both countries are selecting no
trade and no labor mobility, then, conditionally on the decision of the other country, there is no policy
that can move the economy toward free trade or toward free labor mobility. Thus, any unilateral deviation
will not change the payoff for any player.

    Under autarky, all goods must be produced domestically and, hence, pjz = wj ajL,z for all z ∈ Z and
j ∈ J. The indirect

goods z ∈ [z̄, k) and non-tradeable goods z ∈ ZN = [k, 1]. The marginal tradeable industry z̄is given
by Az̄ = w1 /w2 . The balanced trade condition is w1 /w2 = [α (z̄) / (1 − αN − α (z̄))] L2 /L1 , where

If labor mobility is not allowed, then Lj = L̄j . If labor mobility is allowed, mobile workers will go to

country 1 to 2, v 2 will decrease and v 1 will increase. Therefore, and, provided     that there are enough

where TNj = − k αz ln ajL,z dz is the average productivity of country j in the production of non-
tradeable goods. This expression determines the ratio w1 /w2 which makes mobile workers indifferent to
the possibility of settling in one country or the other. It depends only on the productivity differences in
the non-tradeable industries. Once we know w1 /w2 , we can use Aẑ = w1 /w2 to determine the marginal
tradeable industry ẑ. Then, the balanced trade condition implies L2 /L1 = Aẑ (1 − αN − α (ẑ)) /α (ẑ).

     Proof : Under autarky, regardless of mobile workers’ location decisions, v j (0, λM ) = C + T j . Thus,
v 1 (0, 0) − v 2 (0, 0) = T 1 − T 2 , which is positive by assumption. Under free trade, if there is no labor

v 1 (1, 0) − v 2 (1, 0) = TN1 − TN2 + (1 − αN ) ln (Az̄ ). Under free trade, if there is free labor mobility

v 1 (1, 1) = C + T 1 + ẑ αz ln (Aẑ /Az ) dz and v 2 (1, 1) = C + T 2 + 0 αz ln (Az /Aẑ ) dz. Hence v 1 (1, 1) −
v 2 (1, 1) = TN1 −TN2 +(1 − αN ) ln (Aẑ ). Provided that assumption 1 holds, we have ln (Aẑ ) = ln w1 /w2 =
− (1 − αN )−1 TN1 − TN2 and, hence, v 1 (1, 1) − v 2 (1, 1) = 0. Simple comparisons complete the proof of

the lemma. 
     As in the simple Ricardian model, under free trade, labor mobility leads to a complete convergence in
real wages. The reason for this is that mobile workers move from the poor country to the rich country until
they equalize real wages (with Assumption 1 ensuring that there are enough mobile workers to make this
happen). Trade alone has an ambiguous effect on convergence. While, under autarky, the wage difference
depends on the average productivity differential (real wages are higher in country 1 when T 1 > T 2 ), under
free trade, it depends on the productivity differential in the marginal tradeable industry as well as on
the average productivity differential in non-tradeable industries (real wages are higher in country 1 when
∆z̄ = (1 − αN ) ln (Az̄ ) + TN1 − TN2 > 0). In turn, the productivity differential in the marginal industry
(Az̄ ) is high when country 1 is relatively labor-scarce and expenditure shares in low-indexed tradeable
goods are high. Note that we can interpret ∆z̄ as a measure of the productivity differential under free
trade. When it is higher than the average productivity differential, free trade induces divergence; when
it is positive but lower than the average productivity differential, free trade induces partial convergence;
and when it is negative, free trade leads to a reversal of fortune.
     Proposition 1 characterizes the political equilibrium.

       Proposition 1 (continuum of goods) is the analogous of Proposition 1 (finite set of goods) when there
is a continuum of goods. Other than free trade and free labor mobility, any other outcome is a Nash
equilibrium outcome. As in the previous section, free trade and free labor mobility are not a Nash
equilibrium outcome because workers in the rich country under free trade prefer to block labor mobility
(since the inflow of labor reduces real wages). Free trade and no labor mobility always dominates other
Nash equilibria for the rich country     R z̄ under autarky (country 1). The
                                                                           same is true for the poor country
under autarky (country 2) when 0 αz ln (Az /Az̄ ) dz > m T 1 − T 2 holds. The logic behind this result
is as follows. Under autarky, labor mobility does not affect workers in country 1 because their wages
are fully determined by the aggregate productivity of the country and they will not relocate even if they
have the chance to do so. Since all workers in country 1 gain from trade, free trade and no labor mobility
dominates other equilibria for country 1. Under autarky, mobile workers in country 2 will relocate to
country 1. Compared with a situation in which there is no trade and no labor mobility, this will produce

                                                        8

labor mobility, free trade will produce a gain of 0 αz ln (Az /Az̄ ) dz for each worker in country 2. Thus,
country 2 prefers free trade and no labor mobility to autarky and free labor mobility when gains from
trade for all (mobile and immobile) workers are higher than the productivity gains for mobile workers.

A.2.3 Endogenous non-tradeable goods (iceberg trade costs)
As in the case of exogenous non-tradeable goods, consider an economy with two countries (J = 2) and
a continuum of goods (Z = [0, 1]). The production functions are Qjz = Ljz /ajL,z , where ajL,z > 0 is
the unit labor requirement in industry z in country j. Let Az = a2L,z /a1L,z and assume that country
1 has a comparative advantage in lower-indexed goods. Specifically, for z ∈ [0, 1] Az is a continuously
differentiable strictly decreasing function. In contrast with the previous section, all goods are assumed to
be tradeable, but there are transportation costs. A fraction g < 1 of each good shipped from one country
to the other is lost.
     Under autarky, the analysis is the same as in the previous section. Under free trade, in a trading
equilibrium, country 1 produces low-indexed goods z ∈ [0, z̄L ], country 2 produces high-indexed goods z ∈
[z̄H , 1] and both countries produce goods z ∈ [z̄L , z̄H ]. Goods in the ranges [0, z̄L ] and [z̄H , 1] are tradeable,
while goods in the range [z̄L , z̄H ] are non-tradeable. The marginal industries 0 < z̄L < z̄H < 1 are given by
gAz̄L = w1 /w2R= Az̄H /g. The balanced trade condition implies         w1 /w2 = [α (z̄L ) / (1 − α (z̄H ))] L2 /L1 ,
                                                                                                                     
                   z
where α (z) = 0 αz dz. There is a unique tuple z̄L , z̄H , w1 /w2 with 0 < z̄L < z̄H < 1 and w1 /w2 > 0 that
                                                                    

simultaneously satisfies the two marginal industry conditions and the balancedR1        trade condition. Then, the
indirect utility of a worker who owns one unit of labor is v 1 = C + T 1 + z̄H αz ln (Az̄H /Az ) dz in country 1

and v 2 = C +T 2 + 0 Lαz ln(Az /Az̄L ) dz in country 2, where gAz̄L = [α (z̄L ) /1 − α (z̄H )] L2 /L1 = Az̄H /g

                R1
and T j = − 0 αz ln ajL,z dz. If labor mobility is not allowed, then Lj = L̄j . If labor mobility is
allowed, mobile workers will go to or stay in the country with higher v j . If v 1 > v 2 , then mobile
workers will move from country 2 to 1, v 1 will decrease and v 2 will increase. Analogously, if v 2 > v 1 ,
then mobile workers will move from country 1 to 2, v 2 will decrease and v 1 will increase. Therefore,
and,                                                                                     1   2

    w 2 = α(ẑL ) − ẑL αz ln (Az ) dz − [1 − α (ẑH )] ln (AẑH ) + ln g, where gAẑL = w /w = AẑH /g. Once
we have determined ẑL , ẑH , w1 /w2 , the balanced trade condition determines the country allocation of

Finally, we must verify that the distribution of mobile workers between countries does not violate Lj ∈
  (1 − m) L̄j , L̄j + mL̄−j . In order to avoid such a situation, we impose the following assumption.

    Free trade and free labor mobility lead to full convergence in real wages, and trade has an ambiguous
effect on relative wages. Trade can produce, divergence,  partial convergence, or even a reversal of fortune,
depending on the values of ∆z̄L ,z̄H and T 1 − T 2 . Once again, we can interpret ∆z̄L ,z̄H as a measure of
                                                   

the productivity differential between the countries under free trade. There are, however, two novelties.
First, since there are two marginal industries, we must average these productivity differentials. Second,
the average productivity of country j in the production of non-tradeable goods is now endogenous.

    Proposition 1 shows that iceberg transportation costs do not affect the political economy of trade and
labor mobility. Free trade and free labor mobility are not a Nash equilibrium. All the other outcomes
are Nash equilibria, but free trade and no labor mobility always dominate other equilibria for the rich
country
      R z̄under autarky (country 1), while the
                                            same is true for the poor country under autarky (country 2)
when 0 L αz ln (Az /Az̄L ) dz > m T 1 − T 2 holds, i.e., when aggregate productivity differentials between
the countries are lower than the gains from trade for country 2.

A.3 Non-homothetic preferences
Consider an economy with two countries (J = {1, 2}) and a continuum of tradeable goods Z = [0, ∞)
indexed by z. Assume that Az = a2L,z /a1L,z is a continuously differentiable strictly increasing function,
A0 < 1 and limz→∞ Az > 1. Each agent owns 1 unit of labor and is either mobile or immobile. Goods
come in discrete units
                    R ∞ and each agent can consume a unit or no unit of each good. The utility function is
given by u c = 0 bz cz dz, where bz > 0 is the utility weight of good z and cjz = 1 if good z is consumed
              j           j

and cjz = 0 if it is not. Moreover, bz /ajL,z is a decreasing function of z for each j.
    Under autarky, all goods must be produced domestically. Hence, if good z is produced, pjz = ajL,z wj ,
                                                                                                    R∞
where wj is the wage rate in country j. A worker in country j tries to maximizes u cj = 0 bz cjz dz
                                                                                              
            R∞ j j
subject to 0 pz cz dz = wj . Since bz /ajL,z is decreasing, the worker selects cjz = 1 for z ∈ 0, ṽ j and
                                                                                                      
                                                              R ṽj
cjz = 0 for z ∈ v j , ∞ , where ṽ j is the unique solution of 0 ajL,z dz = 1. Therefore, the indirect utility
                       
                                                   R ṽj
function of a worker in country j is v j (0, 0) = 0 bz dz. If labor mobility is allowed mobile workers will
go to or stay in the country with                 j
                                 n the highest v o.
    Under free trade pz = min a1L,z w1 , a2L,z w2 . Since Az is continuous and strictly increasing, in the
trading equilibrium country 1 produces high-indexed goods z ∈ [z̄, ∞) and country 2 produces low-
indexed goods z ∈ [0, z̄]. The marginal industry is given by Az̄ = w1 /w2 . A worker in country j tries

to maximizes u cj = 0 bz cjz dz subject to 0 pz cjz dz = wj . Since bz /ajL,z is decreasing for each j,
                              

it must be the case that             for       any w1 and w2 , bz /pz is decreasing in z. Hence, a worker in country j
selects cz = 1 for z ∈ 0, v̄ j and cjz = 0 for z ∈ v̄ j , ∞ , where v̄ 1 and v̄ 2 are given by (assuming that
             j                              
                        R z̄                R v̄1                  R z̄          R v̄2

Q2z = L2z /a2L,z . Since v̄ j > z̄, each agent demands 1 unit of z ∈ [0, z̄], which implies that the aggregate
                                                                  R z̄                     R z̄

because L1 /Az̄ L1 + L2 > 0, v̄ 1 > z̄ if and only if Az̄ > L2 / L1 + L2 . The indirect utility of a worker

              R v̄j
is v j = 0 bz dz. If labor mobility is not allowed, then Lj = L̄j . If labor mobility is allowed, then
mobile workers will go to or stay in the country with the highest v j (equivalently the highest v̄ 1 ). If
Az̄ > 1, then v̄ 1 > v̄ 2 and, hence, mobile workers will move from country 2 to 1. As a consequence, v̄ 1
will decrease and v 2 will increase. Conversely, if Az̄ < 1, then v̄ 1 > v̄ 2 and, hence, mobile workers will
move from country 1 to 2. As a consequence, v 2 will decrease and v 1 will increase. Therefore, provided
that there are enough mobile workers, they will relocate until v 1 = v 2 , which implies v̄ 1 = v̄ 2 = v̂ and
Aẑ = w1 /w2 = 1. Once we have determined ẑ, the country-allocation of mobile workers is given by

already seen that, under free trade and free labor mobility, the indirect utility of a worker is the same in
both countries, i.e., v 1 (1, 1) − v 2 (1, 1) = 0. Finally, v 1 (1, 0) − v 2 (1, 0) > v 1 (0, 0) − v 2 (0, 0) if and only

     Trade and labor mobility induce full convergence because workers move from the poor country under
free trade to the rich country under free trade until the level of well-being in the two countries is equalized.
When Az̄ > 1, under free trade, country 1 is richer than country 2 and, hence, some workers will migrate
to country 2. Since we are assuming that country 1 is the rich country under autarky, Az̄ > 1 implies
that free trade will no alter the countries’ relative positions. However, it is possible that free trade will
reduce or amplify the difference between the countries’ levels of well-being. Without specifying bz , it is
difficult to determine when trade will induce convergence beyond the general condition that the gains
                                                                              R v̄1       R v̄2

     For example, if bz = 1/z, then there will be convergence whenever v̄ 1 /ṽ 1 < v̄ 2 /ṽ 2 , i.e., if free trade leads to a higher
percentage increase in the range of goods consumed by the poor country than it does in the rich country. If we also specify

Az̄ > 1. Therefore, when Az̄ > 1, if there is free labor mobility, L1 > L̄1 and L2 < L̄2 . Then, v̄ 1 < v̂ < v̄ 2 ,
                                        R v̄1                                       R v̂
which implies WG1 (1, 0) − WG1 (1, 1) = v̂ bz dz > 0 and WG2 (1, 1) − WG2 (1, 0) = v̄2 bz dz > 0. Conversely,
when Az̄ < 1, if there is free labor mobility, L1 < L̄1 and L2 > L̄2 . Then, v̄ 2 < v̂ < v̄ 1 , which implies
                           R v̂                                           R v̄2
WG1 (1, 1) − WG1 (1, 0) = v̄1 bz dz > 0 and WG2 (1, 0) − WG2 (1, 1) = v̂ bz dz > 0. Thus, provided that
Az̄ 6= 1, free trade and free labor mobility will never be a Nash equilibrium outcome.
     We have already shown that WG1 (1, 0) > WG1 (0, 0) = WG1 (0, 1) and WG2 (1, 0) > WG1 (0, 0) and
                                                                      R v̄2                          R ṽ1
WG2 (0, 1) > WG2 (0, 0). The last step is to compare WG2 (1, 0) = 0 bz dz and WG2 (0, 1) = m 0 bz dz +
          R ṽ2                                          R v̄2         R ṽ1

A.4 Multiple countries
Consider an economy with a finite set of countries J countries, indexed by j = 1, ..., J, and a continuum
of tradeable goods, ZT = [0, 1] indexed by z. Assume there are no geographic barriers that limit the
mobility of tradeable goods. Let L̄j and Lj be the labor endowment and the labor force of country j,
                                                                                         hR 1  ρ i ρ1
respectively. Only a fraction m ∈ [0, 1] of L̄j is mobile. Preferences are given by u cj = 0 cjz dz ,
with σ = (1 − ρ)−1 > 1, for all agents in every countries. Let ajL,z be the unit labor requirement of good
                                                                                                     j θ
z in country j. The cumulative distribution function of ajL,z is given by Pr ajL,z ≤ a = 1 − e−T a ,
where T j > 0 and θ > σ − 1. These distributions are independent across goods and countries.
   Given ajL,z , if good z is produced in country j, its price will be pjz = ajL,z wj , where wj is the wage rate in

comparisons complete the proof of the lemma. 
    Under free trade, labor mobility induces full convergence in real wages in all of the countries in the
world. The reason is that mobile workers migrate from the relatively poor countries under free trade
(those with low T i /L̄i ) to the relatively rich countries under free trade (those with high T i /L̄i ) until real
wages are the same in all locations. There is only one implicit condition behind this result: There must
be enough mobile workers in poor countries so that migration from poor to rich countries is sufficient
to fully equalize T i /Li in all countries. Assumption 3 ensures that this is the case even for the poorest
country in the world (lowest T i /L̄i ). Formally, Assumption 3 implies that, if all the mobile workers in
the poorest country in the world decide to migrate to other countries, the real wage of a worker in that
country will be higher than in the rest of world. Trade alone has an ambiguous effect on convergence.
While, under autarky, differences in real wages depend only on relative levels of productivity (real wages
are higher in country j than in country k when T j > T k ), under free trade, they also depend on relative
labor abundance (real wages are higher in country j than in country k when T j /L̄j > T k /L̄k ). Since it
is perfectly possible that T j > T k , but T j /L̄j < T k /L̄k , trade can lead to a reversal of fortune if the
country with a higher aggregate level of productivity is relatively labor-abundant.
    So far, we have considered polar cases, i.e., “free trade” means that all countries are allowing free
trade and “autarky” means that there is no trade at all. The same is true of our consideration of labor
mobility. However, it is possible that countries are trading only with some countries. Similarly, countries
may accept labor mobility only with a restricted group of countries. Proposition 3 characterizes the
political equilibrium when each country can decide to trade or not and can decide to allow labor mobility
or not with each other country. The only restriction that we impose is that if country i accepts free trade
(labor mobility) with country j and country j accepts free trade (labor mobility) with country k, then
country i must accept free trade (labor mobility) with country k.

   1. No trade and any pattern of labor mobility policy is a Nash equilibrium outcome. Moreover, among
      those equilibria, no trade and complete free labor mobility prevail over the other equilibrium outcomes

      librium outcome. In particular, complete free trade and any pattern of labor mobility policy other
      than no mobility are not a Nash equilibrium outcome.

    Proof : No trade and any pattern of labor mobility policy is a Nash equilibrium outcome. Suppose
that no country allows free trade and consider any partition JM of the set of countries J. Each element
of JM is a set of countries that allow factor mobility among them, but do not allow it with the rest of
world. Arbitrarily select j ∈ JM ∈ JM . Since all countries are blocking trade, there is no unilateral
move by j that can induce trade. Since countries in J − JM do not accept labor mobility with countries
in JM , there is no unilateral move by j that can induce labor mobility outside JM . Therefore, the
only relevant decision for j is about labor mobility with countries in JM . In fact, given that mobile
workers can move from one country to another at no cost, j must decide between accepting free labor
mobility with all countries in JM or with none of them. Regardless of j’s decision, immobile workers
in country j get v j = − ln γ + (1/θ) ln T j . If j does not allow labor mobility, then mobile workers in j
also get v j = − ln γ + (1/θ) ln T j . Conversely, if j allows labor mobility, mobile workers in j will relocate
in the richest country in JM . Thus, they will get v j = − ln γ + (1/θ) maxi∈JM ln T i . Since WGj =
                                                                                        

mv j,m + (1 − m) v j,im , it follows that WGj when j allows labor mobility will be higher than or equal to WGj
when j blocks labor mobility. Finally, since j ∈ JM ∈ JM were also selected arbitrarily, the same analysis
applies to any j ∈ JM ∈ JM , which completes the proof that no trade and any pattern      of labor mobility are
a Nash equilibrium outcome. Finally, note that WGj = − ln γ + (m/θ) maxi∈JM ln T i + [(1 − m) /θ] ln T j
                                                                                    
                                          j
is nondecreasing in JM . Indeed, W       G is strictly increasing in JM for all countries except the one with
the highest T j , for which maxi∈JM ln T i does not change with JM . Thus, under complete autarky, the
                                        

pattern of labor mobility that maximizes WGj for all j ∈ J is JM = J. This completes the proof of part
1.

    No labor mobility and any pattern of trade policies is a Nash equilibrium outcome. Suppose that no
country allows migration and consider any partition JT of the set of countries J. Each element of JT
is a set of countries that allows free trade within that group, but does not allow it with the rest of the
world. Arbitrarily select j ∈ JT ∈ JT . Since no country is offering free labor mobility, there is nothing
that country j can do to bring about labor mobility. Suppose that country j decides     to trade only with
                              j
                                                                                hP            1      θ i

Since WGj increases with the number of countries in JT , the best response for country j is to set J˜T = JT .
Since we have picked an arbitrary country, the same analysis applies to all j ∈ JT ∈ JT . Therefore,
complete free trade and any pattern of labor mobility policyhP are a Nash     equilibrium   outcome. Finally,

Thus, when there is no labor mobility, the pattern of trade that maximizes WGj for all j ∈ J is JT = J.
This completes the proof of part 2.

     Free trade and any pattern of labor mobility other than no mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome.
Assume that all countries are allowing free trade and consider any arbitrary labor mobility partition JM
for which at least one set JM has more than one country. Among the countries in JM , let j be the one
with the highest T j /L̄j ratio. Next, we show that, if country j blocks labor mobility with countries in
JM , then WGj increases. The utility of a worker in country j ∈ JM ∈ JM is given by:

Thus, v j is decreasing in Lj and increasing in Li .
    Results 1-3 imply that v 1 prefers to block labor mobility. Thus, under complete free trade, the richest
country in a set of countries that are allowing free labor mobility within that set prefers to deviate and
block labor mobility. This completes the proof that complete free trade and any pattern of labor mobility
policy other than no mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. This result can also be used to prove
that any pattern of trade policy except complete autarky and any pattern of labor mobility policy within
the trading-partner countries other than no labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. Take any
partition JT and consider any arbitrary set JT ∈ JT . Then, any pattern of labor mobility within JT
other than no mobility is not part of a Nash equilibrium outcome. The proof arises immediately from
the previous results because each JT can be treated as a world economy with JT countries among which
there is complete free trade. This completes the proof of part 4. 

B Trade and labor mobility policies in factor proportions models
Appendix B presents the proofs of all the results in Section 4. Throughout Appendix B we employ the
following notation: v j (λT , λM ), vLj,m (λT , λM ) and vLj,im (λT , λM ) denote the utility of a worker located in
country j, the utility of a mobile worker from country j and the utility of an immobile worker from country
j, respectively, under trade and labor mobility regime (λT , λM ). WGj (λT , λM ) = mvLj,m (λT , λM ) +
(1 − m) vLj,im (λT , λM ) indicates the welfare of domestic workers in country j under trade and labor
mobility regime (λT , λM ).

     Next we prove three results that will allow us to compare vLj (1, 0) and vLj (1, 1).
     Result 1: vL1 (1, λM ) and vL2 (1, λM ) are continuous functions of L1 and L2 for any T 1 ,
T 2 , F̄ 1 and F̄ 2 .      From a simple inspection of vL1 (1, λM ) and vL2 (1, λM ), it is clear that,
in the interior of each of the seven regions, vL1 (1, λM ) and vL2 (1, λM ) are continuous.                            It
is also easy to prove that vL1 (1, λM ) and vL2 (1, λM ) are continuous in the boundary of
each
 1 region.         For example, the intersection between the boundaries of regions a and b is

          (a) If ¯l1 , f¯1 ∈ κ, then the trade and labor mobility game has two Nash equilibrium outcomes: (i)
                          

              no trade and no labor mobility; and (ii) free trade and no labor mobility. Moreover, WGj (1, 0) >
              WGj (0, 0) for j = 1, 2.

              no trade and no labor mobility.

     Proof :
     No trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium outcome.
     Free trade and no labor mobility could be a Nash equilibrium outcome only if, under free trade and no
labor mobility, the country relatively well endowed with factor F specializes in good 1. In order to prove
                                                                                                                     α̃
this we must consider seven possible cases. From Lemma 4 Part 1, vLj (0, 0) = CT j [(1 − α̃) /α̃]α̃ F̄ j /L̄j
for j = 1, 2.
     a. Suppose that max η1 ¯l1 , η2 ¯l1         < f¯1 < min η3 ¯l1 , η4 ¯l1 . Then, from Lemma 5 Part

                                                                                                                   α̃
1-a, both countries are diversified and vLj (1, 0) = T j C [(1 − α̃) /α̃]α̃ T 1 F̄ 1 + T 2 F̄ 2 / T 1 L̄1 + T 2 L̄2 .

Moreover, f¯1 > ¯l1 implies WG1 (0, 0) = vL1 (0, 0) > vL1 (1, 0) = WG1 (1, 0), while f¯1 < ¯l1 implies WG2 (0, 0) =
vL2 (0, 0) > vL1 (1, 0) = WG2 (1, 0). Thus, free trade and no labor mobility is not a Nash equilibrium
outcome.

       No trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium outcome.

    When the above condition holds, if allowed, workers will have an incentive to migrate from country
2 to country 1. This willh increase L1 and decrease       2

Since vL1 (1, λM ) is decreasing in L1 and pF /pM , as workers move from country 2 to country 1, vL1 (1, λM )
decreases. Since vL2 (1, λM ) is decreasing in L2 and increasing in pF /pM , as workers move from country
2 to country 1, vL2 (1, λM) increases. Under labor mobility, workers will move until vL1 (1, 1) = vL2 (1, 1),

Then, the trade and labor mobility game has only two Nash equilibrium outcomes: no trade and no labor
mobility and free trade and no labor mobility. Moreover, WGj (1, 0) > WGj (0, 0) for j = 1, 2.
   Proof :
   No trade and no labor mobility is always a Nash equilibrium outcome.
   Free trade and no labor mobility is a Nash equilibrium outcome if and only if vLj (1, 0) > vLj (0, 0) for
j = 1, 2. vL1 (1, 0) > vL1 (0, 0) if and only if

T 1 − T 2 < [α1 / (σ − 1)] ln (1 − m) L̄2 / L̄1 + mL̄2 , then all mobile workers go to or stay in country 2
because v 2 > v 1 for any allocation of mobile workers to countries. The intuition is straightforward. Due
to the existence of increasing returns to scale in sector 1, under autarky the indirect utility of workers
increases in step with the labor endowment of the country (a higher labor endowment implies that more
varieties of good 1 are produced in the autarky equilibrium). As a consequence, once mobile workers start
moving to one country, the indirect utility of workers in the recipient country goes up, which reinforces
migration flows in the same direction.

try 2. If labor mobility is not allowed, then Lj = L̄j . Under free labor mobility, mobile workers
will go to or stay in the country with higher v j . Note that, although v 1 can be increasing or de-
creasing in L1 , v 1 − v 2 is always decreasing in L1 and increasing in L2 , as in the simple Ricardian
model. Therefore, and, provided that there is enough mobile workers, they will relocate until v 1 = v 2 ,

which implies L2 /L1 = (α2 /α1 ) (A3 ) α1 +α2 . Moreover, there will be migration to country 1 whenever
                         −α3                                                                       −α3
L̄2 /L̄1 > (α2 /α1 ) (A3 ) α1 +α2 and migration to country 2 whenever L̄2 /L̄1 < (α2 /α1 ) (A3 ) α1 +α2 . The in-
tuition is straightforward. Under free trade, country 1 specializes in the production of good 1, the sector
that operates under increasing returns to scale. Therefore, the number of varieties of good 1 produced
in the trading equilibrium and consumed by both countries only depends on the size of country 1’s labor
force. This implies that the effect that the allocation of mobile workers has on the varieties of good 1 that
are produced affects both countries symmetrically.        Finally, the distribution of mobile workers between
the countries does not violate either Lj ∈ (1 − m) L̄j , L̄j + mL̄−j or A1 > α1 L2 /α2 L1 > A2 , provided

C.2 Extractive elites
Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and one non-
tradeable good (ZN = {3}). Production functions, endowments and preferences are as in the simple
Ricardian economy. Each of the countries is populated by two types of agents: Lj workers, each of
whom owns one unit of labor, and E j elite members. The elite appropriates a fraction β j ∈ (0, 1) of
Lj . A fraction δ ∈ (0, 1) of each unit            expropriated by the elite is lost in the process. After expro-
priation, each worker keeps 1 − β j units of labor and each member of the elite gets δβ j Lj /E j units
                                           

m ∈ [0, 1] of the labor force of each country is mobile at zero cost. The rest of the labor force and
elite members are immobile. Each government selects trade and migration policies in order to maximize

immobile worker, a mobileworker                                                       j
                                     and a member of the elite, respectively, and ϕ ∈ [−1, ∞].
    Let T j = − z∈Z αz ln ajL,z be the productivity of country j. In order to highlight the role of the
                 P

elite, assume T 1 = T 2 = T . Then, under autarky, the utility of a worker is vj,h = C + T + ln 1 − β j
                                                                                                              

and the utility of a member of the elite is v j,e = C + T + ln δβ j + ln Lj /E j . If labor mobility is not
allowed, then Lj = L̄j . If labor mobility is allowed, then all mobile workers go to or stay in the country
with the lowest β j .
    Under free trade, if A1 > α1 L̃2 /α2 L̃1 > A2 , then country j specializes in good z = j ∈ {1,2}.
Therefore, the utility of a worker is given by v 1,h = C + T+ α2 ln α1 B2 L2 /A2 α2 B 1 L1 + ln 1 − β 1 in
country 1 and v 2,h = C + T + α1 ln A1 α2 B 1 L1 /α1 B 2 L2 + ln 1 − β 2 in country 2, while the utility
of an elite member is given by v 1,e = C + T + α2 ln α1 B2 L2 /A2 α2 B1 L1 + ln δβ1 + ln L1 /E 1 in

country 1 and v 2,e = C + T + α1 ln A1 α2 B 1 L1 /α1 B 2 L2 + ln δβ 2 + ln L2 /E j in country 2. If
labor mobility is not allowed, then Lj = L̄j . If labor mobility is allowed, mobile workers will go to
or stay in the country with the highest v j . Since v 1 is decreasing in L1 /L2 while v 2 is increasing in
L1 /L2 , if there are enough mobile workers, they will relocate until v 1 = v 2 . This implies L2 /L1 =

The first inequality simply means that the elite of country 1 is less extractive than the elite of country 2,
in the sense that it appropiates a lower fraction of its labor force. The second inequality ensures that the
elite of the rich country under autarky (country 1) prefers free trade and free labor mobility to autarky
and free labor mobility. Intuitively, for the elite of country 1, when there is free labor mobility, gains
from trade prevail over the negative effect that trade liberalization has on the size of the labor force of
country 1. The third inequality states that workers in the poor country under autarky (country 2) prefer
free trade and free labor mobility to autarky and free labor mobility. Intuitively, the gains from trade
for all workers in country 2 are higher than the productivity gains under autarky for mobile workers.

Consider an economy with two countries (J = 2), two tradeable goods (ZT = {1, 2}) and one non-
tradeable good (ZN = {3}). Production functions, endowments and preferences are as in the simple
Ricardian economy. Let τ j ∈ [0, 1] be the income tax rate that country j charges to foreign mobile
workers that decide to locate in j and let T f j ≥ 0 be the transfer per capita received by country j’s
workers. The government of country j selects its trade            and   migration policies in order to maximize
   j        j,m              j,im
WG = mvL + (1 − m) vL subject to T f L̄ = τ max L − L̄j , 0 , government j’s budget constraint.

Trade policy is λT ∈ {0, 1}, where λT = 1 indicates that both countries accept free trade and λT = 0
that at least one country refuses to trade. Migration policy is λM ∈ {0, (1, τ )} with τ ∈ [0, 1], where
λM = 0 indicates that at least one country does not accept free labor mobility and λM = (1, τ ) indicates
that both countries accept labor mobility with the recipient country charging a proportional income tax
τ ∈ [0, 1] to foreign mobile workers.
     Under autarky, all goods must be produced domestically. Hence, pjz = wj ajL,z for z ∈ Z = {1, 2, 3}.
If labor mobility is not allowed, then v j,im (0, 0) = v j,m (0, 0) = C + T j and,  hence,   Wj (0, 0) = mv j,m +

Since T 1 > T 2 and τ j ∈ [0, 1] for j = 1, 2, this inequality always holds. Thus, mobile workers in country

only if T 1 + ln 1 − τ 1 ≥ T 2 + ln 1 + τ 2 max L2 − L̄2 , 0 /L̄2 . Since L2 ≤ L̄2 , this inequality becomes
T 1 + ln 1 − τ 1 ≥ T 2 . Therefore,     if T 1 + ln 1 − τ 1 ≥ T 2 , then L1 = L̄1 + mL̄2 and L2 = (1 − m) L̄2 ,

   We have already proved that when (λT , λM ) = (0, (1, τ ∗ )) is a Nash equilibrium outcome,
WG1 (1, (1, τ ∗ )) ≥ WG1 (1, 0) > WG1 (0, 0), WG1 (1, (1, τ ∗ )) ≥ WG1 (0, (1, τ̂ )), and WG2 (1, (1, τ ∗ )) ≥ WG2 (1, 0).

WG1 (1, (1, τ̄ )) = WG1 (1, 0) and    WG2 (1, (1, τ ∗ )) > WG2 (1, (1, τ̄ )) = WG2 (1, 0). Finally, we have also proved
that WG2 (1, 0) > WG2 (0, (1, τ̂ ))   = WG2 (0, 0), which completes the proof of part 2. 
