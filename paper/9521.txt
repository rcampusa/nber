Doomed to Deficits? Aggregate U.S. Trade Flows Re-Examined

                                            ABSTRACT

       This paper examines the stability of import and export demand functions for the United
States over the 1975q1-2001q2 period. Using the Johansen maximum likelihood approach, an export
demand function is readily identified. In contrast, there appears to be a structural break in the import
demand function in 1995; specifications incorporating this break pass tests for cointegration,
although the price elasticity is not statistically significant. Only when excluding computers and parts
from the import series is a stable import demand function detected. The resulting point estimates do
not exhibit the income asymmetry typically found in other studies of aggregate U.S. trade flows.

1. Introduction

This paper examines the relationship between U.S. aggregate trade flows, real exchange

rates and incomes. While this literature has a long and venerable history, a re-

examination is justified, as some of the most recent work on this subject cast doubt on the

existence of a stable link between relative prices and trade flows. Moreover, the

burgeoning U.S. trade deficit (illustrated in Figure 1) has imparted some urgency to the

mission of estimating the empirical determinants of trade flows; in particular, interest is

focused on whether the well-known income elasticity asymmetry first noted by

Houthakker and Magee (1969) persists. Some observers have pinned hopes for stabilizing

the trade deficit on a convergence of the income elasticities of the U.S. and her trading

partner economies, combined with accelerated growth in the rest of the world.

       The analysis relies upon the Johansen procedure, which is used to determine

whether cointegrating relations exist, and how trade flows respond to deviations in long

run relationships. Special attention is focused on how the results differ depending upon

the exact measure of the exchange rate used and the composition of the trade variable

examined. Three measures are examined – consumer price index (CPI), a producer price

index (PPI) and unit labor cost (ULC) deflated indices – as each one exhibits somewhat

different behavior.

       The results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between

total exports of goods and services, U.S. income and the real exchange rate. The unit

labor cost deflated measure of the dollar yields the strongest evidence of cointegration.

However, for U.S. imports, there appears to be little evidence of cointegration. Only by
allowing for a structural break in 1995 does one obtain some evidence of a long run

relationship. Delving further, I find that use of non-computer imports yields a satisfactory

fit without resort to the use of intervention dummies. Furthermore, once the quantity of

non-computer imports is made the variable of interest, the famous income elasticity

asymmetry of Houthakker and Magee (1969) disappears. 1



2. Theory and literature review

The empirical specification is motivated by the traditional, partial equilibrium view of

trade flows. Goldstein and Khan (1985) provide a clear exposition of this “imperfect

substitutes” model. To set ideas consider the algebraic framework that Rose (1991) uses.

Demand for imports in the US and the Rest-of-the-World (RoW) is given by:



         US
        Dim = f 1US (Y US , PimUS )                  (1)

        DimRoW = f 1RoW (Y RoW , PimRoW )            (2)

where Pim is the price of imports relative to the economy-wide price level. The supply of

exports is given by:

        S exUS = f 2US ( PexUS )                     (3)

        S exRoW = f 2RoW ( PexRoW )                  (4)




 1
   This study is not the first one to provide an explanation for the income asymmetry.
Helkie and Hooper (1988) argue that inclusion of relative supply, via a relative capital
stock measure, makes the gap in elasticities disappear. Arora et al. (2001) obtain
estimates income elasticities that appear to be converging. They interpret these results in
the context of the Krugman (1989) model, where these income elasticities are actually
functions of income growth rates.



                                             2
Note that the price of imports into the US is equal to the price of foreign exports adjusted

by the real exchange rate.

        PimUS = E × PexRoW = QPexRoW                  (5)

where E is the nominal exchange rate in US$ per unit of foreign currency, and the real

exchange rate is

           EP RoW
        Q=
            P US

where P represents the aggregate level of prices. An analogous equation applies for

imports into the rest-of-the-world. Imposing the equilibrium conditions that supply equals

demand, then one can write out import and export equations (assuming log-linear

functional forms):



       imt = β0 + β1q t + β2 y tUS + ε 2 t            (6)

        ex t = δ 0 + δ 1q t + δ 2 y tRoW + ε1t        (7)

where δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 and β1 < 0 and β2 > 0.

       One can interpret equations (6) and (7) as semi-reduced form equations. Consider

equation (6); this expression collapses the relationship between the relative import price

and imports (equation 1) and the relationship between the exchange rate and relative

prices (equation 5) into one equation. To the extent that one takes the real exchange rate

as “more exogenous” than the relative price of imports, this approach makes more sense




                                                 3
when the economic question at hand is “what is the response of imports to a one percent

change in the real exchange rate?” 2

       The literature on trade equations is vast, and no survey can do justice to the

variety of findings that have been obtained. In this review, I focus on those studies

conducted in the cointegration framework, largely because the earlier econometric

literature pertains to much earlier data samples.

       Rose and Yellen (1989) estimated regressions of the general form of (6) and (7),

but focused on the trade balance. They examined monthly data over the 1960-85 period,

and failed to detect evidence of cointegration using the Engle-Granger procedure. Hence,

they estimated a first difference specification using instrumental variables and failed to

find a substantial effect of relative prices on the trade balance. For our purposes, the

important point is that this finding held up to disaggregation to individual import and

export flows.

       Meade (1992) provides a useful update to the Rose and Yellen results. Using the

Engle-Granger cointegration methodology, she found that extending the analysis to

quarterly data from 1970 through 1991 yielded more favorable results. Real

nonagricultural exports appear to be borderline cointegrated with the real exchange rate

and income. Meade’s results differ from Rose and Yellen’s largely because of the

difference in sample period, which spanned the reduction in the trade deficit in the late

1980’s. However, imports failed to exhibit evidence of cointegration.


 2
   This specification has the additional drawback that it does not fulfill the assumption of
homogeneity in prices. In contrast, a specification including the relative price of imports
(or exports) to the GDP deflator would fulfill this condition. As long as the ratio of the
GDP deflator to the alternative deflators I use does not have a large stochastic trend, then
the use of this specification may not do too much violence to the data.



                                              4
        Recent work has relied on more powerful econometric techniques, such as the

multivariate maximum likelihood estimation procedure of Johansen (1988). In

conjunction with additional data, this procedure has provided more evidence of

cointegration than obtained in previous studies. Johnston and Chinn (1996) find evidence

of a long run relationship between trade flows, incomes and the real exchange rate over

the 1973-93 period. Boyd et al. (2001) examine the behavior of the trade ratio (the log of

real exports divide by real imports) over the 1970-94 period and find evidence of

cointegration, although the specification they use constrains the import and export

elasticities to be equal and opposite in sign.

        The analysis most closely related to this one is an exhaustive study conducted by

Hooper et al. (1998). They find evidence of cointegration for both U.S. exports and

imports over the 1960-1994 period, using relative prices (either import or export prices

relative to broad deflators) or a real effective exchange rate. Interestingly, they obtain an

incorrect sign for the price elasticity for imports when using a real effective exchange rate

index. That is, a weaker dollar is associated with greater imports, according to their

results. 3

        They also confirm that the income asymmetry first noted by Houthakker and

Magee persists in their sample. Income elasticities for imports exceed those of exports by

about 0.4 to 0.5.




 3
   It should be noted that Hooper et al. (1998) focused their attention on results using
relative prices (e.g., the price of imports relative to the general price deflator), rather than
those relying upon real exchange rates. Those price elasticity estimates were typically
larger than the corresponding ones based on real exchange rates.



                                                 5
3. Data and Estimation

3.1 Data4

         For measures of trade flows, data on real imports and exports of goods and

services (1996 chain weighted dollars) were obtained. These series are depicted in Figure

2. Additional data on real imports and exports of non-computer goods and services were

also compiled. While the focus of this study is aggregate trade flows, I have also

examined selected disaggregate trade flows (goods and services separately). These results

are reported in Appendix 2.

         Domestic economic activity was measured by U.S. GDP in 1996 chain weighted

dollars. Foreign economic activity was measured by Rest-of-World GDP (expressed in

1996 dollars). This measure rest-of-world GDP is weighted by U.S. exports to major

trading partners.

         Three different exchange rate indices were utilized. The first was the most

ubiquitous – the Federal Reserve Board’s major currencies trade weighted exchange rate.

This index uses the CPI as the deflator. The second is the J.P. Morgan broad trade-

weighted real exchange rate, deflated using the PPI. Finally, the IMF’s trade-weighted

real exchange rate deflated using unit labor costs. All three series are shown in Figure 3

(rescaled to equal 0 in 1973q1).5 Additional details on all these variables are contained in

the Appendix 1.



 4
     The data are described in further detail in Appendix 1.
 5
   The various exchange rate indices also differ in terms of their construction. The Fed
index uses time varying trade weights, while the J.P. Morgan index uses fixed trade
weights, with one discrete change in the weights. The IMF series uses fixed trade
weights, although in using a spliced series in this analysis, a change in trade weights is
artificially introduced. Both the Fed and IMF series account for third market effects using


                                              6
       The first two indices approximate measures of “price competitiveness”. Of these,

the CPI-deflated measure is probably the least desirable on a priori grounds since it

incorporates the prices of many non-traded goods that are unlikely to be relevant to flows

of traded goods (although they might be indicative of costs of services).

       The third measure merits some more detailed discussion. The unit labor cost

deflated measure is best thought of as an empirical proxy for “cost competitiveness”. It is

an imperfect measure, at best, measuring labor costs, rather than total costs. To see how

this variable is related to the PPI based index, consider a markup model of pricing:



                                          W                             (8)
                        pt = log (1 + µ ) t  
                         T

                                           At  



where pT is the log nominal price of tradable goods, µ is percentage markup, W is the

nominal wage rate, A is labor productivity per hour. W/A is therefore unit labor cost. Re-

expressing the real exchange rate



                   q t = et − ptUS + ptRoW                             (9)



using equation (8) for prices yields:



                                                                            (10)
          q tULC = et − ( wtUS − a tUS ) + ( wtRoW − a tRoW )



the Armington assumption. See Chinn (2002) for a detailed discussion of the
characteristics of these indices.



                                                     7
(holding markups constant). In this case, the real exchange rate is the nominal rate

adjusted by wages and productivity levels. As productivity levels rise, the real dollar cost

of production falls, while rising wages cause an appreciated real dollar. This definition of

the real exchange rate also fits in with a Ricardian model of trade (Golub, 1994).

3.2 Estimation

       Estimation is implemented on data spanning a period of 1975q1-2001q2. This

period spans two episodes of dollar appreciation and two episodes of dollar depreciation.

Truncation to 2001q2 is motivated by the desire to omit possible distortions in the trade

flow relationships due to the events of 9/11.

       Estimation proceeds in two steps: (1) Lag length selection and (2) estimation of

the vector error correction model (VECM). The latter step entails interpretation of the

cointegration results, and examination of the short run dynamics.

       The lag length is determined by the minimum AIC for the unconstrained VAR,

with the lag lengths of up to 8 lags considered. In all cases, the 2 lag specification yields

the minimum AIC.

       The Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) maximum likelihood

procedure is implemented in order to test for cointegration and identify the cointegrating

vector. For the import system, the procedure estimates the following vector error

correction model: 6




 6
   For expositional simplicity, I have assumed only one cointegrating relationship per
system; in fact neither theory nor econometric technique requires this condition.

Two test statistics for testing the alternative of cointegration against the null of no

cointegration are calculated: the trace and the maximum eigenvalue statistic. Both are

referred to, although generally they will agree on the existence of a cointegrating

relationship, and the number of cointegrating vectors. 7

          There are also additional specification issues related to the allowance for

constants and trend terms in either the data or the cointegrating vector. For most of the

specifications, the AIC selects a model with deterministic trends allowed in the data, but

not in the cointegrating vector.8



 7
   Cheung and Lai (1993) have shown that it is often important to account for degrees of
freedom when using highly parameterized VARs. However, with the short lag lengths
implemented and relative parsimony of the specifications, the conclusions would be
unchanged using finite sample critical values.
 8
     See Chapter 8 of Banerjee, et al. (1993) for additional discussion.



                                                                9
        The procedure provides estimates of the long run coefficients (the β’s and δ’s) as

well as the reversion coefficients (the φ’s). The reversion coefficients are of interest for a

number of reasons. First, the reversion coefficients on the trade flows should be negative,

and statistically significant, indicating that imports and exports respond to a

disequilibrium in the cointegrating relationship by closing the gap. Second, to the extent

that one would like to interpret the estimated coefficients as it would be useful to be able

to interpret the trade flows as responding to exogenous movements in the other variables,

while the reverse is not true. Technically speaking, this is equivalent to weak exogeneity

of these two variables, i.e., statistically insignificant reversion coefficients for the

exchange rate and income.



3.3 Empirical Results

Table 1 reports the results for imports of goods and services. In column 1, results are

shown for the specification incorporating the CPI deflated real exchange rate. The trace

and maximum eigenvalue statistics do not indicate evidence for cointegration, even at the

10% marginal significance level.

        Imports accelerate in the mid-1990’s, roughly contemporaneously with the

acceleration in trend GDP growth. Thus, it makes sense to account for a possible

structural break in 1995q1. This is accomplished by including an (exogenous) dummy at

this date. The results for this specification are shown in column 2. There is now evidence

of cointegration, at the 10% level according to the trace statistic, and at the 5% level

according to the maximum eigenvalue statistic. The long run income elasticity is




                                               10
substantial, at 2.1, while the price elasticity estimate is correctly signed but not

statistically significant.

        The reversion coefficients in the lower panel of Table 1 indicate that imports

respond to disequilibria in the long run import relationship, at a rate of about 18% per

quarter. The real exchange rate responds, albeit more slowly, and with borderline

statistical significance. GDP does not respond at all, a finding consistent with weak

exogeneity of the income variable.9

        Similar results are obtained using a PPI deflated measure of the real exchange

rate. There is little evidence of cointegration over the entire sample (column 3). However,

when allowance is made for a break in 1995, then there is strong evidence of

cointegration. 10 In this case the price elasticity is statistically significant. Imports and the

real exchange rate respond to the long run disequilibrium. However, it should be noted

that the long run price elasticity of imports is quite low: 0.18. This estimate is

substantially below what is conventionally perceived as the sensitivity of imports to

exchange rates. 11

        The analogous regression results for exports of goods and services are reported in

Table 2. Overall, the results are much more favorable toward a finding of cointegration.

There is no need to allow for a structural break in order to make this conclusion. The



 9
   While weak exogeneity is discussed informally in terms of the t-statistics on the
adjustment coefficients, formal likelihood ratio test statistics typically concur (Johansen
and Juselius, 1990).
 10
    A caveat is necessary here. The critical values used are based on the absence of
exogenous dummy variables. Accounting for these dummies would likely reduce the
statistical significance of the results.
 11
    As pointed out by Bill Helkie, another potential reason for the difficulty in detecting
evidence for cointegration is the inclusion of oil imports in the aggregate. I reserve this
avenue of inquiry for future work.


                                               11
sensitivity of exports to the real exchange rate is between 0.7 to 0.8 when using the CPI

deflated measure, and slightly higher – 0.8 to 0.9 – when using the PPI deflated measure.

Overall, income elasticity estimates are relatively robust. They range from 1.7 to 2.

       The reversion coefficients indicate that it is only export flows that respond to

disequilibria in the long run export relationship. In other words, the real exchange rate

and foreign income are weakly exogenous for exports. Depending upon the deflator used,

the rate at which exports respond ranges from 10% to 17% per quarter.

       One implication of the exchange rate coefficient estimates is that the Marshall-

Lerner condition only barely holds even in the long run; the sum of the (absolute value of

the) point estimates is just over unity. If one takes into account the fact that the import

price elasticity is not statistically significant, then the trade balance does not improve in

response to an exchange rate depreciation.

       As previously discussed, the CPI and PPI deflated real exchange rates conform to

the concept of “price competitiveness”, while the unit labor cost deflated measure is more

closely linked to “cost competitiveness”. Import and export regression results are

reported in Table 3. Column 1 indicates that there is little evidence of cointegration over

the entire sample, using this real exchange rate index. Column 2 provides more promising

results – evidence of cointegration is found. However, the price coefficient is not

statistically significant, indicating no long run response of imports to the real exchange

rate, even after allowing for a structural break.

       This is a somewhat surprising result. Typically, one would think that unit labor

costs should be strongly related to trade flows. One possible reason for the weakness of

the link is that this measure focuses on trading patterns and productivity trends of other




                                              12
industrial countries (Zanello and Desruelle, 1997), and import sources are oriented

slightly more towards LDCs than are export destinations. 12

        In contrast, there does appear to be a stable long run export relationship using this,

or any of the other, real exchange rate indices. The price elasticity is somewhat less than

identified using the other measures. In this case, the price elasticity is 0.5 to 0.6 vs. the

0.7 to 0.9. The income elasticity also appears to be somewhat lower too. On the other

hand, the reversion rate is more rapid, at roughly 23% per quarter. 13



4. Interpreting the Structural Break

        From an econometric standpoint, allowing for a structural break in the import

equation is successful. However, the result is unsatisfying from an economic perspective.

In particular, one does not know the cause of the break; consequently, one does not know

if the effect will be reversed. This particular issue is of importance because the

intervention dummy manifests itself as a larger drift term in the error correction model. If

this shift is permanent, then imports far outstrip exports, even when U.S. and Rest-of-

World income grow at the same rate, and the exchange rate stays constant.

        Another perspective on the role of the shift dummy is that it is capturing the effect

of mis-specification. One particular form of mis-specification is suggested by previous

empirical work finding that imports of computers, peripherals and parts are particularly



 12
    Furthermore, unit labor costs are probably subject to greater measurement errors, as
they are quite difficult to measure.
 13
    These findings extend to disaggregated data to a limited extent. The results in
Appendix 2 indicate that it evidence of a cointegrating relationship for goods exports is
readily obtained, but a similar conclusion does not hold for services exports. As
anticipated the real exchange rate elasticity for goods exports is typically higher than the
corresponding elasticity for goods and services exports.

difficult to model. Lawrence (1990) and Meade (1991) were the first to observe that

stripping out these components was useful in obtaining a stable relationship. As discussed

in CEA (2001), trade in computers and semiconductors boomed in recent years, rising

from about 3.5% in 1990 to 6% in 2000 (their role in exports is much smaller). At this

same time, the real price of computers and parts has fallen dramatically, implying a large

drop in the relative price. The time series behavior of log total imports and computers, in

chained 1996$, is shown in Figure 4. It is apparent that the real magnitudes differ in

trends substantially, so that aggregating computer and non-computer trade data may be

unjustified.

       In Table 4, estimates are reported using imports of goods and services excluding

computers, over the 1975q1-2000q3 period. In column 1, the results of testing for a long

run relationship between non-computer imports, the PPI deflated real exchange rate, and

U.S. GDP, are reported. The results are not encouraging, as little evidence of

cointegration is detected. A similar story is told by the results in column 2, where the PPI

deflated exchange rate variable has been replaced by the unit labor cost deflated index.

       The robustness of the results to alternative lag specifications is assessed in column

3. The lag length is increased to 4 (consistent with quarterly data). The AIC selects a

specification with a trend in the cointegrating vector. The results are implausible,

however. First, two cointegrating vectors are indicated. Second, the income elasticity is

implausibly large. Each one percent increase in U.S. GDP increases imports by 15

percent! The trend term appears to be picking up much of the movement in imports; the

coefficient implies imports increase by 13 percent each quarter.




                                             14
       In column 4, I report the results of a specification where the trend is restricted to

exist only in the data (that is, the same specification as in Tables 1-3). The AIC in this

case is –15.90 vs. –15.97 for the previous specification, so the fit is still adequate, relative

to that of column 3. Note the Schwartz Information Criterion indicates a tie between the

two.

       The results from this specification indicate evidence for cointegration according

to both the trace and maximum eigenvalue statistics. The income elasticity is in line with

the estimates in Tables 1 and 3, while the price elasticity, while small, is more plausible,

and statistically significant. Interestingly, in this case we reverse the finding of Hooper et

al. (1998), who found that the real exchange rate measure had the wrong sign. These

results suggest that non-computer imports are related in a stable fashion to the real

exchange rate and GDP. A similar finding is obtained when using non-computer imports

of goods; as shown in Table A1 in Appendix 2, only the non-computer category of goods

imports appears cointegrated with the real exchange rate and income. Goods imports as

whole do not exhibit evidence of a long run relationship with theses variables. Moreover,

the estimated elasticities for non-computer goods imports are similar to those for non-

computer goods and services imports. 14

       In contrast, real computer imports are quite difficult to model. AIC statistics from

VARs indicates a 2 lag structure is appropriate. Among various model specifications, the

AIC selects a quadratic trend in the data. Estimation of this model yields ample evidence

of cointegration, with a very large income elasticity of 2.6. The point estimate for the real



 14
    It is standard to subject estimated models to out-of-sample forecasting tests. I have
not conducted a formal test of structural stability; however, Appendix 3 provides a
discussion of the out-of-sample forecasting ability of the specifications estimated.


                                              15
exchange rate is incorrectly signed – it is 1.4, indicating that a one percent depreciation

increases imports of computer parts.

       Almost certainly, this result is a reflection of the fact that the PPI deflated real

exchange rate used here gives too little weight to the prices for computers and parts,

given the dependent variable is the quantity of computer imports. For illustrative

purposes, Figure 5 depicts the trends in the chain price deflator for U.S. computer

imports, and the U.S. PPI.



5. Conclusions and Re-Interpretation

There are several significant findings to be gleaned from this analysis. First, a stable long

run relationship exists for U.S. exports, the real exchange rate and rest-of-world income.

The evidence for cointegration is particularly strong for a real exchange rate measure

constructed using unit labor costs. The finding of a stable export relationship is not

dependent upon allowance for a structural break.

       In contrast, aggregate U.S. imports are quite difficult to model, regardless of the

real exchange rate measure used. Only by allowing for a structural break in 1995q1 can

some evidence for cointegration be found. However, even in this case, the price elasticity

is economically small and statistically insignificant.

       Aggregate imports excluding computers, peripherals and parts do, however,

appear to be related to the real exchange rate and income, in a stable fashion. In contrast,

I cannot isolate a plausible demand function for imports of computers. The exchange rate

coefficient is invariably wrong-signed, while income picks up a large proportion of the

variation.




                                             16
       It may be useful to summarize at this point what has been learned in revisiting this

subject. Regarding the adjustment process for U.S. trade flows, these results provide a

different set of lessons than that drawn from previous studies. Consider Table 5. In the

top panel, import estimates are reported. The estimate of non-computer import price

elasticity in column (4) is correctly signed, in contrast to those obtained by Hooper et al.

using an exchange rate index. However, it is substantially smaller than the estimate

obtained by Boyd et al. from their (constrained) Johansen estimation procedure. The

estimated income elasticity appears much in line with those obtained by Hooper et al.,

and most other studies (see Mann, 1999, Table 8.2; Lawrence, 1990).

       On the export side, the estimated export price and income elasticities are

somewhat higher than those reported by Hooper et al., as long as the PPI deflated

measure is used. The results in column 4 indicate that when using the same exchange rate

index as Hooper et al. used, the point estimates are essentially the same as theirs.

       One interesting conclusion of this study is that the asymmetry in income

elasticities, first pointed out by Houthakker and Magee (1969), may no longer be as

pronounced as is typically thought. The income elasticity of export demand estimated

when using the PPI-deflated real exchange rate is the same as that of non-computer

imports. 15 Hence, it appears that including real computer imports into the import

aggregate provides a potentially misleading impression of price and income elasticities.




 15
    These income elasticity estimates still deviate from the value of unity implied by the
standard imperfect substitutes model, combined with the assumption that traded goods
are normal goods. However, relaxing any number of assumptions can lead to non-unitary
elasticities, including trade in intermediate goods, or increasing returns to scale
production. See Hong (1999) for a recent survey.



                                             17
           One last finding of interest is that the import price elasticity remains quite low.

This finding suggests that improvements in the U.S. trade balance may require large

movements in the value of the dollar, especially when starting from an initial position of

deficit.

Notes: “Coeff” is the coefficient from equation (6) or (7). “Pred” indicates predicted sign. “Trace” (λ-max)
is the trace (maximum eigenvalue) test statistic for the null of zero cointegrating vector against the
alternative of one. CR is the number of cointegrating relations implied by the asymptotic critical values for
the trace, λ-max statistics and 10% significance level. Critical values assume no exogenous regressors.
Coefficients are long run parameter estimates from the Johansen procedure described in the text. Lag is the
number of lags in the VAR specification of the system. N is the effective number of observations included
in the regression. Smpl is the sample period. Dummies are indicator variables taking on a value of one at
the indicated date. *(**)[***] denotes significance at the 10%(5%)[1%] level.

Notes: “Coeff” is the coefficient from equation (6) or (7). “Pred” indicates predicted sign. “Trace” (λ-max)
is the trace (maximum eigenvalue) test statistic for the null of zero cointegrating vector against the
alternative of one. CR is the number of cointegrating relations implied by the asymptotic critical values for
the trace, λ-max statistics and 10% significance level. Coefficients are long run parameter estimates from
the Johansen procedure described in the text. Spec. is the specification of the vector error correction
model; “trend in data” indicates a trend in the data, but not the cointegrating vector, is allowed for. “trend
in cointegrating vector” indicates that a trend is allowed for in the long run relationship. “quadratic trend”
allows a deterministic quadratic trend in the cointegrating vector. Lag is the number of lags in the VAR
specification of the system. N is the effective number of observations included in the regression. Smpl is
the sample period. Dummies are indicator variables taking on a value of one at the indicated date.
*(**)[***] denotes significance at the 10%(5%)[1%] level.

       from BEA, and post-1987, calculated using Tornqvist approximation. See Whelan
       (2000) for an explanation of the procedure. Computer imports before 1987 are
       measured using fixed weight measures (the difference between chain weighted
       and fixed weighted imports was minor in 1987q1), extending back to 1970. For
       observations recorded as NA, it was assumed computer imports were $0.05
       billion.

Notes: “Coeff” is the coefficient on the indicated variable (q, y) from equation (6) or (7);
“rev” is the reversion coefficient on the trade flow, corresponding to either φ1 or φ4. CR
is the number of cointegrating relations implied by the asymptotic critical values for the
trace, λ-max statistics and 10% significance level. Coefficients are long run parameter
estimates from the Johansen procedure described in the text, a specification allowing a
trend in the data, but not the cointegrating vector. Lag length is set at 2 in VAR
specification of the system. The sample is 1975q1-2001q2. *(**)[***] denotes
significance at the 10%(5%)[1%] level.
†
  Denotes borderline significance according to λ-max statistic.

                              Out-of-Sample Peformance

The out-of-sample performance of the import and export equations is illustrated in the

following graphs. For non-computer imports of goods and services, a specification

corresponding to column 4 of Table 4 is estimated over the 1975q1-97q4 period. For

exports of goods and services, a specification corresponding to column 3 of Table 2 is

estimated over the 1975q1-97q4 period. Static out-of-sample forecasts are depicted in

Figures A1 and A2 for imports and exports, respectively. The static forecasts are

generated using only the import or export equation; hence, no interactions between the

separate equations of the VAR are allowed.
