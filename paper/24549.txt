Going With the Flows: New Borrowing, Debt Service and the Transmission of Credit Booms

                                         ABSTRACT

Traditional economic models have had difficulty explaining the non-monotonic real effects of
credit booms and, in particular, why they have predictable negative after-effects for up to a
decade. We provide a systematic transmission mechanism by focusing on the flows of resources
between borrowers and lenders, i.e. new borrowing and debt service. We construct the first cross-
country dataset of these flows for a panel of household debt in 16 countries. We show that new
borrowing increases economic activity but generates a pre-specified path of debt service that
reduces future economic activity. The protracted response in debt service derives from two key
analytic properties of credit booms: (i) new borrowing is auto-correlated and (ii) debt contracts
are long term. We confirm these properties in the data and show that debt service peaks on
average four years after credit booms and is associated with significantly lower output and higher
crisis risk. Our results explain the transmission mechanism through which credit booms and busts
generate non-monotonic and long-lasting aggregate demand effects and are, hence, crucial for
macroeconomic stabilization policy.

1      Introduction

Macroeconomists have long been interested in the real eects of nancial market develop-
ments (eg Bernanke, 1983). This interest has been renewed by the Great Financial Crisis of
2008/09, with a particular focus on the eects of household debt (eg Mian and Su, 2010;
Mian et al, 2013; Jorda et al, 2011, 2013). However, the literature has been held back by
the lack of systematic data on the aggregate            ows   of resources between borrowers and len-
ders. We identify these ows as a crucial part of the transmission mechanism from nancial
markets to real economic activity.
    Flows from lenders to borrowers, in short new borrowing, are systematically associated
with economic expansions, whereas ows in the reverse direction, in short debt service, are
associated with economic contractions and increased crisis risk.
                                                                            1   Given that credit expansions
tend to be persistent and involve long-term debt, new borrowing implies a pre-specied future
path of debt service, consisting of interest payments and amortizations.                    This generates a
systematic lead-lag relationship between the two ow variables that lies at the heart of the
transmission mechanism from credit booms to the real economy. Furthermore, it gives rise
to substantial predictability.




                                 Figure 1: New borrowing and debt service


    Our rst contribution is to show that new borrowing implies a well-specied and systema-
tic schedule of debt service in the future, using a simple analytic framework. In particular,
we show that when new borrowing is auto-correlated and debt is long term  features that are
present in the real world  two systematic lead-lag relationships between our ow variables
emerge that may be quite long-lasting: First, debt service peaks at a well-specied interval
after the peak in new borrowing. The lag increases both in the maturity of debt and the
degree of auto-correlation of new borrowing. The reason is that debt service is a function of
the stock of debt outstanding, which continues to grow even after the peak in new borrowing.
Second, net cash ows from lenders to borrowers reach their maximum before the peak in
new borrowing and turn negative before the end of the credit boom.
    Our second contribution is to compile the rst cross-country dataset of the aggregate ows
of new borrowing and debt service of household debt for 16 countries from 1980 to 2015. This
contrasts with previously available data on private debt that focus on stocks. We construct

    1 Although the focus of our paper is mainly empirical, we observe from the outset that these associations are
consistent with models of nancial market imperfections in which borrowers have higher marginal propensity
to consume than lenders, as eg in Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), Farhi and Werning (2016), Korinek and
Simsek (2016).    By contrast, our observations are dicult to reconcile with models of rational agents in
perfect nancial markets in the context of household debt  in such models, new borrowing and debt service
would be used to smooth household consumption and would therefore associated with economic expansions.




                                                        2
the ows by modeling the amortizations of up to six dierent household debt categories, such
as mortgages, credit card debt, student loans and other household borrowing.
                                                                                        2   Using this new
dataset, we provide empirical evidence on the lead-lag relationship between new borrowing
and debt service. This relationship is already visible in the raw data, and conrmed in a
formal impulse response analysis. Following an impulse to new borrowing, debt service shows
a hump-shaped response that peaks after four to six years. In line with the predictions of the
analytical framework, the lead-lag relationship is also more drawn-out for mortgages than
for other household debt as they have longer maturities.
    Our third contribution is to show that the aggregate ows between lenders and borrowers
explain the real eects of credit booms and busts, both in the short and medium run. New
household borrowing has a signicant positive eect, and its counterpart, debt service, a
signicant negative eect on output growth in the near term.                  And once we control for
the ow variables, we demonstrate that more traditional measures of credit booms, such as
growth rates in the credit-to-GDP ratio, lose their explanatory power.
    We show that these two ow eects together imply that the impulse response of output to
new borrowing is non-monotonic over time. Initially, output growth increases. But it turns
signicantly negative in the medium run, at a horizon of ve to seven years, as debt service
builds up.
             3   By developing and applying a novel decomposition method that extends the local
projection method of Jorda (2005), we demonstrate that the delayed eects of debt service
can, to a large extent, account for the negative medium run impact on output from credit
growth. Other variables highlighted in the macro-nance literature, such as net-worth, have
much less explanatory power for the transmission mechanism than debt service. Similarly,
we nd that debt service is the main channel through which new borrowing increases the
probability of nancial crises in the medium run.
                                                          4
    Taken together, our results provide a systematic transmission mechanism for the real
eects of credit booms and busts.
    These ndings are robust to the inclusion of range of control variables as well as changes
in sample and specication.          Our baseline controls consists of variables that we expect to
directly inuence new borrowing and debt service, such as collateral values and interest
rates. But results are similar when we only control for GDP growth or include a large set of
additional variables such as credit spreads, net-worth, productivity, banking sector provisions
and GDP forecasts. The results also hold in dierent sub-samples of the data, e.g. a sample
leaving out the Great Recession, or when we allow for time xed eects and cross-country
heterogeneity.

   2 We focus on household data since long-term debt contracts are most prevalent in this sector, especially
for mortgages.     But we also draw comparisons with the corporate sector at several points in the paper.
Furthermore, we found similar results when using total non-nancial debt in each country.
   3 The negative medium-run eect of increases in the stock of credit on growth are documented e.g. by
Mian and Su (2014), Mian et al. (2013, 2017) and Lombardi et al. (2016). Claessens et al. (2012), Jorda et
al. (2013), and Krishnamurthy and Muir (2017) document a link between credit booms and deep recessions.
Brunnermeier et al.     (2017) report a similar impulse-response pattern to credit shocks and attribute the
medium-term output losses to monetary policy.       Our paper contributes a more systematic transmission
mechanism to this literature by showing that it is the ows of resources between borrowers and lenders that
matter. Furthermore, employing our ow variables generates stronger empirical relationships.

                                                      3
    Our results are consistent with the view that credit supply shocks, as postulated e.g. by
Mian et al. (2017) and Mian and Su (2018), lead to signicant aggregate demand eects
that are dicult to counteract by macroeconomic policymakers.                       Although we nd that
monetary policy systematically responds to credit booms and busts, it does not fully oset
the eects of credit uctuations on aggregate demand, even if we only focus on periods in
which the economy was          not   in a liquidity trap.
    The transmission mechanism from new borrowing to debt service and real economic
activity that we document in this paper is of great relevance for developing realistic models
and policies to deal with credit booms and busts.               The ows of new borrowing and debt
service enter budget constraints directly and thus encapsulate contemporaneous and future
liquidity eects of credit relationships, as emphasized eg by Eberly and Krishnamurthy
(2014).
          5   Our results highlight an important trade-o when trying to stimulate the economy
by encouraging the expansion of debt.              New borrowing has positive eects in the short
run, but as it will mechanically increase debt service in the future, these benets must be
weighed against the associated drag on growth in the medium run. Equally, this trade-o
has potential implications for using monetary policy to lean against the wind as dampening
a credit boom with higher policy rates may weaken growth in the short run but avoid higher
debt service  and low output and higher crisis risk  in the medium run.
                                                                                        6   More broadly, our
results show that policy needs to take into account contractual features that aect future
debt service and, thus, have a predictable eect on economic activity.


    The paper is structured as follows. In the ensuing section, we provide a simple analytic
framework to illustrate the main channels at work.                 In Sections 3 and 4, we discuss the
data and document the lead-lag relationship between new borrowing and debt service. In
Section 5 we describe the transmission channel from new borrowing to debt service and, in
turn, to economic activity and crisis risk. Section 7 concludes.




2      Analytic Lead-Lag Structure

This section lays out a simple analytic framework that claries the key mechanism underlying
the lead-lag relationship between new borrowing, future debt service, and the net cash ows
between borrowers and lenders. The framework highlights the key roles of auto-correlated
new borrowing and long-term debt contracts, both of which are present in the data, in
generating an interesting lead-lag structure.


Analytic framework             Consider a borrower who borrows an amount               Bt   of long-term debt
in period     t.   Assume, for simplicity, a constant amortization rate        δ   and xed interest rate     r.
In the following period       t + 1,   this contract implies a debt service of      (r + δ) Bt ,   consisting of

    5 From a statistical point of view, an additional benet is that, once normalized by GDP, new borrowing
and debt service do not show pronounced trends, in contrast to traditional credit-to-GDP aggregates. Hence,
we do not need to apply detrending methods typically used in the literature.
    6 Juselius et al (2017) develop this theme further by introducing debt service and leverage into a standard
reduced form model of the economy.        They run counterfactual simulations and conclude that a monetary
policy rule that takes debt service systematically into account during both good and bad times could dampen
both nancial and real cycles.



                                                       4
interest payments and amortization, and a remaining stock of debt outstanding of                     (1 − δ) Bt
at the end of the period, which is carried over to the next period. After k periods, a balance
           k−1
of (1 − δ)     Bt is left of the original amount borrowed, implying debt service obligations of
(r + δ) (1 − δ)k−1 Bt .
   The total stock of debt outstanding at the end of period            t, Dt ,   follows the law-of-motion


                                      Dt = (1 − δ) Dt−1 + Bt                                                (1)
                                               t
                                               X
                                          =           (1 − δ)t−j Bj
                                                j=0


Hence, the stock of debt can be represented as a moving average of current and past new
borrowing.
   Total debt service,    St , is given by the debt        service obligations from all past borrowing
that are due in period    t, or equivalently, on the       stock of debt,   Dt−1 ,    carried into period   t,


                                  St = (δ + r) Dt−1                                                         (2)
                                         t−1
                                         X
                                     =         (δ + r) (1 − δ)t−j−1 Bj
                                         j=0


   The net cash ow from lenders to the borrowers in a given period                     t   consists of the new
borrowing    Bt   minus all the debt service obligations due in period           t,

                                 Nt = Bt − St = Bt − (δ + r) Dt−1                                           (3)


Observe that the standard case of short-term debt corresponds to              δ = 1. In that case, the
above formulas reduce to      Dt = Bt , St = (1 + r) Bt−1       and   Nt = Bt − (1 + r) Bt−1 . In other
words, with short-term debt, it is unnecessary to distinguish between new borrowing and
the stock of debt carried into the next period.


Dynamic implications of a credit boom                      We now use these analytic relationships to
trace out the implications of a boom in new borrowing for the lag structure between borro-
wing and debt service.
   Consider an exogenous process of new borrowing     {Bt }, which involves positive new bor-
rowing Bt > 0 for a nite number of periods t ∈ {0, ...T } with T ≥ 0 and is hump-shaped,
                                                    ∗
i.e. there is a unique interior peak at a time 0 ≤ t ≤ T such that Bt∗ = maxt∈{0,...T } {Bt }
and borrowing is increasing up until the peak B0 < B1 < · · · < Bt∗ and decreasing after the
peak Bt∗ > Bt∗ +1 > · · · > BT .
   For expositional simplicity, we maintain the assumptions of constant interest and amor-
tization rates. Furthermore, we impose a mild condition on timing: the process of new
                             ∗
borrowing up until the peak t cannot be too drawn out over time, captured by the analytic
                   ∗
condition (δ + r) t < 1. After T , we assume no further borrowing so Bt = 0 for t > T .
   Given these assumptions, we nd the following relationships between new borrowing and
debt service:



                                                       5
Proposition 1 (Lead-lag structure of new borrowing and debt service). (i) The
peak in debt service t̂ occurs after the peak in new borrowing t∗ . The lag between the two
peaks t∗ − t̂ is weakly decreasing in the amortization rate δ .
    (ii) The net cash ow from lenders to borrowers peaks weakly before the peak in new
borrowing and turns negative after the peak in new borrowing but weakly before the end of
the credit boom.
      The formal proof of the proposition is given in Appendix A.1 but the intuition is straig-
htforward.      For part (i) of the proposition, observe that debt service is a function of the
stock of debt, or technically speaking, debt service is a moving average of new borrowing.
When new borrowing peaks, the stock of debt and thus debt service is still increasing, since
new borrowing is still positive and existing debt depreciates at the comparatively low rate
of   δ.   After the peak in new borrowing, a lower amortization rate pushes back the time when
debt service outweighs the positive (but declining) eects of new borrowing, which moves
the peak in debt service further away from the peak in new borrowing.
      For part (ii) of the proposition, observe that at the peak of new borrowing, where the
growth rate of new borrowing is zero, debt service is still increasing. This implies that the
the dierence between the two, i.e. the net cash ow from lenders to borrowers, is decreasing
and must have already peaked. At some point, the net cash ow turns negative since debt
service becomes greater than new borrowing. As long as the credit boom is not too drawn
out, this happens after the peak in new borrowing. Furthermore, it happens before the end
of the credit boom  once the boom is over and there is no more new borrowing, the net
cash ow consists entirely of debt service and must be negative.
      Some of the results in the proposition are stated as weak inequalities due to the discrete
time nature of our framework.         Appendix A shows that in an equivalent continuous time
framework all of the stated inequalities hold strictly.
      Figure 2 illustrates our ndings. We assume that new borrowing (light-blue bars) is given

from lenders to borrowers, i.e. the dierence between new borrowing and debt service. In
line with Proposition 1, the net cash ow peaks before the peak in new borrowing and turns
negative before the boom is over.


Analytic results for a unit impulse in new borrowing                            Although new borrowing in
the data is typically a bell-shaped process during credit booms, it is useful to consider the
special case of a unit impulse in new borrowing that decays exponentially. This process allows
us to obtain analytic results for the timing of the peak in debt service. It also corresponds
to the way that shocks are typically modeled in theoretical models.
     Assume that there is a unit impulse to new borrowing at time                0 that decays exponentially
at rate    ρ ∈ [0, 1).   As a result, new borrowing at time          t   is   Bt = ρt . This process of new
borrowing is a limit case of the class of credit boom processes covered by Proposition 1 with
t∗ = 0 and T → ∞. The results of the proposition therefore still apply, but they can be
sharpened by obtaining analytic expressions for the timing of the peak in debt service.
     The debt stock resulting from a unit impulse in new borrowing is a moving average given
by the geometric sum

Proposition 2 (Peak in debt service). Following a unit impulse of new borrowing that
decays at rate ρ 6= 1 − δ with ρ, δ ∈ (0, 1), debt service peaks at an integer time index in the
interval t̂ ± 1 where
                                                ln [ln ρ/ ln (1 − δ)]
                                         t̂ =                         −1
                                                 ln (1 − δ) − ln ρ
which satises dt̂/dρ > 0 and dt̂/dδ < 0.8
     As in the previous proposition, our discrete time setup implies that we can only obtain an
                  
interval    t̂ ± 1    for the peak. Appendix A.1 provides a proof and shows that an equivalent

proposition for a continuous time version of our model delivers a precise value for                  t̂.
     Intuitively, the proposition captures that a higher amortization rate              δ   leads to an earlier
peak in debt service since debt is paid o more quickly. Similarly, higher auto-correlation,
ρ,   leads to a later peak in debt service since borrowers continue to accumulate debt for a
longer period.
     To showcase that both long-term debt (δ             < 1) and auto-correlated new borrowing (ρ > 0)
are necessary to obtain an interesting and non-degenerate lead-lag structure, it is useful to
consider the two extremes          δ=1   and    ρ = 0:
     7 For illustration purposes, we set r = 5% and δ = 15% in this simulation.
     8 In the special case ρ = 1 − δ , the geometric sum for D is given by ρt (t + 1), which is maximized at
                                                              t
t̂ = −1/ ln ρ − 1.

Figure 3: The evolution of new borrowing and debt service after a unit impulse to new borrowing The
simulation uses equations (1) and (2) with               r = 5%      to derive debt service and net cash ows. If debt is short

term   δ = 100%.     If it is long term    δ = 15%.          If new borrowing is autocorrelated,ρ             = 0.8.


Corollary 3 (Necessity of both auto-correlation and long-term debt). If either δ = 1
or ρ = 0, the lag between an impulse to new borrowing and the peak in debt service becomes
degenerate and collapses to t̂ = 1.
    The case        δ =1     captures one-period debt contracts as is typically considered in theory
models (see the left-hand panel of Figure 3 for an illustrative example). New borrowing is
                                                           t
still autocorrelated and continues to be given by Bt = ρ  after the initial unit impulse at
t = 0, it decays slowly. Debt service is given by St = (1 + r)ρt−1 for t ≥ 1, and is simply the
mirror image of new borrowing lagged by one period. Intuitively, since any new borrowing
is immediately paid o in the following period, there is no interesting lead-lag relationship
between new borrowing and debt service. Given that new borrowing peaks at                                                        t = 0,   debt
service peaks at        t = 1.
    The case        ρ = 0 captures a unit impulse to new borrowing without auto-correlation (center
panel, Figure 3). In that case, no new borrowing occurs after the initial impulse. Hence, the
stock of debt peaks at               t = 1,
                              i.e. in the period right after the impulse to new borrowing,
                                                                              t−1
and is declining immediately after. Debt service, given by St = (r + δ)(1 − δ)    for t ≥ 1,
follows the same pattern and also peaks at                        t = 1.
    The case with auto-correlation (ρ                          > 0) and         long term debt (δ             < 1)       is illustrated in
the right-hand panel of Figure 3. In this case, we obtain a non-degenerate lag relationship
between the peak in new borrowing and the peak in debt service, as described by the corollary.
This case is rarely considered in theory papers but is empirically the most relevant.
    In summary, our simple analytic framework thus suggests that it is the combined eects
of auto-correlated new borrowing and long-term debt that account for the substantial lags
between peaks in new borrowing and debt service. The key empirical issues that we address
in the remainder of this paper is to document that this relationship holds in the data and
to investigate to what extent the lagged response of debt service can account for delayed
negative real eects of credit booms.




                                                                       8
3       Data and Measurement

Our main variables of interest are the ows of new borrowing and debt service. This section
discusses how we measure both variables in the aggregate, which variables we use to assess
their real eects, and what controls we employ. We use an unbalanced panel of annual data
for 16 countries from 1980 to 2015.
                                               9   The exact denitions, sources, and availability for all
variables are listed in Tables 2 and 5 in Appendix D.
     We focus on the household sector for a number of reasons.                         First, this is the sector in
which long debt maturities and auto-correlated new borrowing are most prevalent, giving
rise to the most interesting lead-lag relationships. Second, in doing so, we also complement a
literature that has demonstrated negative eects of household debt in the medium run (e.g.
Jorda et al (2016) or Mian et al (2017)) and show that their results arise from the lead-lag
relationship between new borrowing and debt service that we identify.                              Third, borrowing
by the household sector is unlikely to result in productive investments that add to future
output. Finally, data availability on debt maturities is considerably better in the household
sector compared to the corporate sector. For comparison, we report a summary of results
for the corporate sector in Appendix C.                Our results are also largely unchanged when we
consider total non-nancial debt.



3.1 New borrowing and debt service
From our analytic framework we obtain expressions for new borrowing and debt service.
Adding the sub-index         i   to refer to the country in question, equation (1) tells us that new
borrowing,    Bi,t ,   equals the change in the stock of debt plus amortizations; and equation (2)
tells us that debt service,       Si,t ,   is the sum of interest payments and amortizations.
     Data on debt stocks and interest payments are readily available across countries and time.
We take the outstanding stock of debt in country                   i   at time    t, Di,t ,   from the BIS database
compiled by Dembiermont et al (2013). This variable captures credit to the household sector
from all sources, including bank credit, cross-border credit and credit from non-banks. For
interest payments we use total interest paid by households,                     Ri,t , from national   accounts and
obtain the average interest rate on the stock of debt                  ri,t   = Ri,t /Di,t .10
     We construct time series for amortizations of household debt, since these are generally
not recorded. We do so by modeling the repayment streams of up to six dierent categories of
household debt. First, we split household debt into mortgages and other household debt. If
relevant, we separately take account of interest-only mortgages. And as far as necessary and
possible, we consider credit card debt, student loans and auto loans as separate categories
within other household debt.
    9 The countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
    10 As in Drehmann et al (2015), we also include nancial intermediation services indirectly measured
(FISIM) from national accounts in our measure of          Ri,t .   FISIM is an estimate of the value of nancial
intermediation services provided by nancial institutions which consumers pay as part of their borrowing
costs. In the beginning of our sample, national accounts data on interest paid is not available for all countries.
In that case, we proxy interest paid on the stock of debt by using an alternative interest rate such as the
average interest rate on bank loans.




                                                          9
    Except for credit card loans and interest-only mortgages, we follow the methodology of
Lucket (1980) and Dynan et al (2003) to model repayments for each category l = 1, ..., L of
                                                         l
household debt, assuming that the amortization rate, δi,t , is given by the amortization rate
                                                               l
of an installment loan with the average remaining maturity mi,t and the average interest rate
       l
paid ri,t on the outstanding stock of debt in that category:

                                                                ri,t
                                            δi,t   =              l                                             (5)
                                                               l mi,t
                                                       1 + ri,t         −1
A derivation of this formula is provided in Appendix A.3. For credit card debt, we also follow
Dynan et al. (2003) and assume δ
                                     credit−card
                                                 = 2.5%.12 By denition, interest-only loans have
                       interest−only
no amortizations, ie δ               = 0.
    Aggregate amortizations at time           t for country i are then simply the sum                 of the amorti-
                                               l

                                                                  L
                                                                  X
                                                                          l    l
                                     amortizationsi,t =                  δi,t Di,t                               (6)
                                                                   l=1

    To compile time series for amortizations using equation (5) and (6), we collect data from
a wide range of sources on the stock of debt, average interest rates and maturities for the
dierent debt categories (see Table 2 in Appendix D).
                                                                         13
    Data on maturities is available for mortgages, which account for around 70% of household
debt on average.       But for many countries it is infrequently recorded.                       In these cases we
linearly interpolate between consecutive observations and extend the initial (last) observation
backward (forward) to obtain complete annual series. In most cases, we only have information
on the contractual maturity of new loans and use a formula derived in Appendix A.3 to
approximate the average maturity of the outstanding stock of debt. Contractual maturities
of new mortgages are on average 25 years but range from 11 years in Finland to 45 years
in Sweden. Data on maturities for other household debt and student loans are scarce. We
only have time varying information for auto-loans in the United States. For other countries,
we assume xed 5-year and 10-year initial maturities for other household debt respectively
student loans in line with data from the United States.
    For the ensuing empirical analysis, we normalize both new borrowing and debt service
by nominal GDP obtained from the national accounts. We denote the resulting normalized
variables by   bi,t = Bi,t /Yi,t   and   si,t = Si,t /Yi,t .   We plot these series for all countries in our
sample in Figure 16, Appendix D.
    We verify the robustness of our approach by comparing our time series with the only
available long time series on amortizations, which is constructed from Australian micro
data. Figure 17, Appendix D, shows that our series for new borrowing and debt service of

  11 This methodology is also used by the US Fed and the Bank of Canada to construct time series of
aggregate debt service.
  12 Dynan et al (2003) base this assumption on the Senior Loan Ocer Opinion Survey in the United
States.   Informal discussions with other central banks indicate that similar minimum repayments apply
broadly internationally as well.
  13 When no data on interest rates for sub-categories are available, we use         ri,t .   We performed robustness
checks for countries where all data are available to verify that this is a good approximation.



                                                          10
mortgages in Australia match the dynamics of the time series constructed from micro data
closely.



3.2 Real variables and controls
Real variables       We study the real implications of new borrowing and debt service by
looking at two main variables:     output growth and the incidence of banking crises.               We
denote the logarithm of real GDP from national accounts by       yi,t = ln(Yi,t /Pi,t )   so that real
output growth is   ∆yi,t .
   For crisis dates, we use the ocial ECB/ESRB EU crises database for the European
countries in our sample (Lo Duca et al (2016)).      For the remaining countries, we rely on
Laeven and Valencia (2012) and extend their dataset using additional information from
central banks as in Drehmann and Juselius (2014). We only consider crises that originated
from domestic developments. We therefore exclude crises that the ECB/ESRB identied as
imported from abroad as a result of cross-border contagion (Lo Duca et al (2016)).                 This
leaves us with 18 crises, of which 8 are related to the Great Financial Crisis.


Controls    In our regressions, we include several dierent control variables to account for
factors that might be expected to inuence the relationship between new borrowing and debt
service as well as real outcomes. We use three dierent sets of controls throughout our analy-
sis: (i) a minimal set consisting only of real GDP growth , (ii) a baseline set that, in addition
to real GDP growth, consists of variables that we expect to directly inuence new borrowing
and debt service, and (iii) a set that extends the baseline set with variables that aect new
borrowing and debt service as well as macroeconomic outcomes more generally. These three
sets of controls ensure that our results are not driven by under- or over-controlling. They
are summarized in Table 1.
   Our minimal set (i) consists real GDP growth to capture the eects of past real deve-
lopments on our ow variables and real outcomes. Since we normalized new borrowing and
debt service by output, this set of controls also ensures that our results are not driven by
the normalization.
   The baseline set (ii) adds variables that may directly inuence the persistence (auto-
correlation) of new borrowing and the evolution of debt service. To capture the eects of
credit limits on new borrowing, we include the growth rate in real residential property prices
as a proxy for changes in collateral values, and the lending spread between the 3-month
money market rate and the prime lending rate as a proxy for the cost of access to credit. We
also include the (ex-post) real 3-month money market rate to capture the eect of the real
interest rate level on future new borrowing. An additional benet of the two interest-rate-
based controls is that they ensure that the debt service eects that we identify do not result
merely from interest rate eects. Since outstanding loans are only partially repriced in each
period, we also control for the change in the average lending rate to identify movements in
debt service that are due to new borrowing rather than changes in lending rates             .   Finally,
we add one crisis dummy that takes the value of 1 in the year when a banking crisis starts,
as well as a dummy that takes the value of 1 in 2009 with the onset of the global nancial
crisis, to capture potential non-linear eects associated with crisis events.

Table 1: The set of controls for our dierent specications. 1 Control is not included in the crisis regressions.



    Our extended set of controls adds variables that capture changes in the macroeconomic
environment more generally, and that may therefore aect the relationship between the
ows of new borrowing and debt service, as well as their real eects. These additional macro
variables are: the change in CPI ination, the growth rate of unemployment, the change
in the real eective exchange rate, the change in the current account, the growth rate in
labor productivity,
                       14   and the term spread measured by the dierence between the 10-year
government bond and the three-month money market rate.
                                                                         15   We include 1-year-ahead GDP
growth forecasts from Consensus Economics to control for expected future activity.                                    To
control for other channels highlighted in the macro-nance literature that may aect credit
markets and real activity, we add real household net worth, a corporate credit spread, and
the change in loan loss provisions by banks.
                                                       16   Given the limited number of crisis, we cannot
use the full set of additional controls in our crisis regressions as it would constrain the sample
too much. The controls that are dropped are indicated in Table 1.
    In all of our regression specications we include a generic vector variable,                       controlsi,t ,
consisting of the variables in the relevant set of controls. Except for the crisis regressions, we
also add one lag of each of the controls (the results remain largely the same with up to three
lags). The only variables that we do not lag are the dummy variables, and GDP forecasts
when the additional controls are used.
  14 Gorton and Ordonez (2016) nd that shocks to productivity often start booms, and that booms are
more likely to end in crisis if productivity is low.
  15 It is well know that CPI ination, the unemployment rate and the real exchange rate contain sizable
low-frequency components across countries.        As this can bias their coecients toward zero when used as
regressors for a non-trending variable, such as real GDP growth, we use their growth rates rather than
levels.
  16 Adding household net worth to our controls reduces the sample size considerably; this is the reason why
we only include it in the additional controls and not the baseline controls.

4     New Borrowing and Debt Service

In this section we document that the basic relationships identied in the analytic framework
are indeed present in the data: new borrowing is signicantly auto-correlated, and there is a
clear multi-year lead-lag relationship between new borrowing and debt service that depends
on the maturity of the loan stock.



4.1 Patterns in the raw data
New borrowing is signicantly autocorrelated, with a correlation coecient                                                                    ρ   across con-
secutive periods of 0.88 as illustrated in the autocorrelogramme for new borrowing in the
left-hand panel of Figure 4. The autocorrelation of new borrowing is positive for up to eight
years.
    New borrowing is also positively correlated with future debt service for an extended time
period (middle panel) in line with the prediction of our analytic framework under highly
autocorrelated new borrowing and long-term debt contracts. It leads debt service by several
periods, with the peak correlation occurring after period 4.                                                 Proposition 2 of our analytic
framework implies a similar lead-lag pattern with                                       ρ = .88      and      δ = 0.15.
    The right-hand panel of Figure 4 depicts the phase-shift between new borrowing and
debt service by focusing on peaks.                               It reports the average evolution of the two variables
around peaks in new borrowing across countries (dened as local maxima within a ve-year
window). The gure shows that debt service continues to rise when new borrowing already
decreases. Peaks in new borrowing are followed by peaks in debt service on average three
years later. Figure 16 in Appendix D documents that the lead-lag relationship is also present
at the individual country level.




                                                                            13
4.2 New borrowing and future debt service
To study the relationship between new borrowing and debt service in the data more sys-
tematically, we use local projections a la Jorda (2005) and control for other factors that
may aect credit markets. In particular, we estimate for each horizon                h   projections for new
borrowing,     b,   and debt service,   s,   with,


                bi,t+h = µh+1    h+1          h+1          h+10                h
                          b,i + βbb bi,t−1 + βbs si,t−1 + βbc controlsi,t−1 + εb,i,t+h                          (7)




                si,t+h = µh+1    h+1          h+1          h+10                h
                          s,i + βsb bi,t−1 + βss si,t−1 + βsc controlsi,t−1 + εs,i,t+h                          (8)

where   µh+1
         j,i   is a country xed eect,          controls   captures our control variables, and         εhj,i,t+h   is
the projection residual for j = {b, s}. With this convention for the indices, the h successive
 h        h
βbb and βsb coecients trace out the impulse response of future new borrowing and future
debt service, respectively, to a unit increase in new borrowing at time t over h successive
years (see Appendix B). Since we are primarily interested in the eects of a unit increase in
new borrowing in this section, debt service can be seen as an additional control in (7) and
(8).
   There are two alternative ways to interpret our regression results:
   Firstly, we can interpret the change in household credit as largely arising from from
exogenous credit supply shocks, as e.g. forcefully argued by Mian and Su (2016). Under
this interpretation, our regression results indicate how these exogenous shocks transmit from
new borrowing to debt service and, as we show in Section 5, to the real economy, generating
predictable reversals.
                           17
   Secondly and more broadly, we can interpret the unit change in household new borrowing
as an initial condition, arising from an unknown combination of exogenous structural shocks.
Under this interpretation, we cannot single out any specic structural shock as the source
for the impulse responses, but this is not necessary from the perspective of the analytic
framework. It still allows us to trace how elevated new borrowing aects debt service and
ultimately correlates with real economic activity. This provides an empirical benchmark that
a full theoretical characterization of debt and output dynamics needs to match.


   The impulse responses to new borrowing conrm the impression from the patterns in the
raw data. A unit increase in new borrowing takes more than six years to dissipate (Figure 5,
Tables 6 and 7, Appendix D).             And immediately after the shock, debt service begins to
rise; it peaks after four to six years and remains signicantly elevated even after eight years
(right-hand panel).
   The patterns remain the same irrespective of whether we use only real GDP growth
as a control (orange line with circles), the baseline set of controls (black solid line), or
the additional set of controls (green line with triangles).              But the autocorrelation of new
borrowing, and hence the persistence of the debt service response, increases as we successively

  17 There is signicant evidence for this view: First, increases in household debt are largely independent of
improved economic circumstances and, in fact, predict lower growth in the future. See Mian and Su (2016)
for a more comprehensive discussion.         (We follow the convention of using the word   prediction   to refer to
within-sample impulse responses.)

add more controls, especially at horizons ve and beyond. Therefore forces captured by some
of the controls, e.g. interest rates, have a systematic dampening eect that mitigates the
lead-lag pattern between new borrowing and debt service in the raw data.
      However, the presence of a lead-lag relationship is a very robust feature of the data, as
the analytic framework suggests.               Results from additional specications and sample splits
(Tables 6 and 7, Appendix D) show the same lead-lag pattern, for instance, in pre- and
post-2000 samples, if we add time xed eects, or allow for full panel heterogeneity by using
the mean-group estimator.


4.2.1 Loan types and the lead-lag relationship
Our analytic framework predicts that the lead-lag relationship between new borrowing and
debt service depends on the features of the underlying debt contracts.                                                For instance, the
distance between the peaks in new borrowing and debt service should increase with both the
auto-correlation of new borrowing and the average maturity of the debt stock. More broadly,
exible interest rate loans may have a more compressed lead-lag pattern compared to xed
rate loans if monetary policy counteracts the real eects of transfers between borrowers and
lenders.
      The predictions regarding maturity are borne out in the data. To show this, we analyze
mortgages and other household debt separately.                                     Other debt consists mainly of consumer
loans and credit card debt that have a shorter maturity than mortgages. In addition, the
autocorrelation of new borrowing of mortgages is also higher than for other household debt
(upper left-hand panel, Figure 6). Given these two factors, the lead-lag relationship is much
more drawn out for mortgages than for other debt, as predicted by the analytic framework
(upper right-hand panel, Figure 6, and Tables 6 and 7 in Appendix D). Following an impulse
to new mortgage borrowing, mortgage debt service peaks after eight years.

debt service on other household debt peaks after four years.
    Within mortgages, the type of mortgage also matters for the lead-lag relationship between
new borrowing and debt service (lower panels, Figure 6 and Tables 6 and 7, Appendix D).
We split the sample into countries with predominantly xed versus oating-rate mortgages.
                                                                                                                                          19
The average maturity of new mortgages is approximately 25 years in both samples.                                                         As
illustrated in the left-hand panel, the autocorrelation of new mortgage borrowing is also
broadly similar across both samples, in particular up to horizon ve. However, mortgage debt
service peaks much more quickly if mortgages are exible rate. This suggests that monetary
policy may be able to counteract high household debt service burdens more eectively in
countries with oating-rate mortgages.
    Comparisons with the corporate sector also provide support for the impact of matu-
rities and autocorrelations on the lead-lag relationship that we identied in the analytic
framework. Corporate debt has a shorter average remaining maturity of 13 years, and the
autocorrelation of new borrowing across periods is 0.4 compared to 0.88 in the household
sector. Together, this generates a shorter lead-lag relationship between new borrowing and
debt service (Figure 14, Appendix C).

new borrowing is indeed after eight years.
  19 In each country of our sample, one mortgage type is dominant with a share of more than 75% (see
CGFS (2006) and ECB (2009)). For our country classication see Table 5, Appendix D.

5      New Borrowing, Debt Service and Real Activity

In this section, we document the eects of the ows of new borrowing and debt service on
future real economic activity, and show that debt service represents the main transmission
channel through which new borrowing aects subsequent output growth and the probability
of crisis in the medium term.



5.1 Eects on output growth
To shed light on the link between new borrowing,                                         b,   debt service,       s,   and real output growth,
∆y ,   we estimate local projections of the form


                    ∆yi,t+h = µh+1    h+1          h+1          h+1,0
                               y,i + βyb bi,t−1 + βys si,t−1 + βyc    controlsi,t−1 + εhy,i,t+h                                               (9)

                                                                              h                h
for increasing values of            h.   The estimates of                    βyb     and      βys   for successive values of        h   trace out
the impulse response of GDP growth to a unit increases in new borrowing and debt service,
respectively.


    New household borrowing initially boosts output but then predicts a slowdown in the
medium run (Figure 7). In the baseline case, GDP growth signicantly increases by around
10 basis points for the rst two years following a percentage point increase in new borrowing,
after which it declines and becomes around 10 basis points lower than normal in years 4 to 8
(Figure 7, left-hand panel). Since new borrowing rises on average between 5 to 10 percentage
points above normal during credit booms, this implies eventual cumulative losses of 1.5 to 3
percentage points of GDP. The negative eects of new borrowing at medium horizons are in
line with the output responses to a unit change in the credit-to-GDP ratio that has recently
been documented in the literature (e.g. Mian et al. (2017)).




                                                                             17
   In contrast, the local projection of GDP growth to a unit increase in household debt
service (right-hand panel) is large and signicantly negative for the rst ve years.
                                                                                             20   It then
becomes insignicant. On impact, a unit increase in debt service decreases GDP growth by
more than 20 basis points. This is also large as peaks in debt service are on average between
2 to 6 percentage points above normal across countries. This result is novel and highlights
the value added of debt service in the presence of long-term debt contracts for understanding
debt dynamics and their impact on the real economy.
   The estimated output eects of debt service are robust. In particular, the eect of debt
service on next year's GDP growth is the same, whether we use the baseline specication or
control for additional factors (Table 9, Appendix D). The eect are also stable in pre- and
post-2000 samples. But allowing for country heterogeneity leads to an even bigger impact.
   In contrast, the output eects of new household borrowing are more sensitive to the
precise specication. For example, the impact of new borrowing is signicantly more negative
than in the other specications when only lagged real GDP growth is used as a control
(Figure 7).   This dierence is primarily due to the real money market rate and the crisis
dummies. Hence, new borrowing appears to go together with real higher interest rates and
higher crisis probabilities, which in turn lower output down the road. This seems natural,
as increases in real interest rates reduce activity beyond their impact on new borrowing.
Moreover, the connection between borrowing and the probability of a banking crisis is well
documented in the literature and something we will explore in Section 5.4. Further robustness
checks conrm the initial positive and then negative impact of new borrowing on output but
show that magnitudes are somewhat sample- and specication-specic (Table 9, Appendix D)
   The dynamics are similar for the corporate sector, although coecient estimates are lower
(see Figure 15 in Appendix C). This is in line with Mian et al (2017) who found little impact
of corporate debt on GDP. The medium-term negative eect of new borrowing on GDP also
occur earlier for the corporate sector (the maximum negative impact is in year 4) than for
the household sector (year 6).



5.2 A novel method for decomposing local projections
So far, we have shown that new borrowing decreases output growth in the medium run. At
the same time, new borrowing increases debt service over time and debt service, in turn,
has a strong negative eect on output next year.           This suggests that the negative eects
of new borrowing may ow through debt service.             To assess this formally, we decompose
the impulse response function of new borrowing.            We provide an intuitive description of
our decomposition method in the following and develop a detailed formal description in
Appendix B.
   The local projections of new borrowing on GDP growth trace out an impulse response
function. After the rst round, this impulse response includes all factors that dynamically
respond to the initial impulse to new borrowing and feed into GDP growth, including the
eects of future debt service on GDP growth.           Hence, they capture the net eect of an

  20 This nding complements micro level evidence in e.g. Olney (1999), Johnson and Li (2010), and Dynan
(2012) who document negative eects from debt service burdens on household expenditure.

borrowing at time t on debt service at time t + h − 1, ie βsb . Second, we know from
estimating equation (9) that the rst-round eect of debt service at t + h − 1 on output
                    1
growth at t + h is βys . Combining these estimates, we calculate the debt service eect as:

                                                                                           1 h−1

and the eects of all remaining factors as

The other eects will include, for example, any direct eects of new borrowing on output.



5.3 Decomposing the eect of borrowing on future output
The decomposition shows that increasing debt service can, to a large degree, account for the
delayed slowdown in GDP growth following an initial increase in new household borrowing.
Figure 8, left-hand panel, reports the net eect (black line), the debt service eect (beige
bars) and other eects (light-blue bars) given the baseline specication up to 8 years after
an impulse to new borrowing.
    The dynamics of these eects largely follow the patterns predicted by our analytic fra-
mework (Figure 2). The black line is the net eect  or in terms of the analytic framework
                                       h
the eect of net cash ows. It equals βyb and thus is simply the impulse respone of GDP
growth to new borrowing in                      t0    (Figure 7). It turns negative (period 4 in the baseline speci-
cation) between the peak of new borrowing (period 1) and the peak in debt service (period
6, Figure 5) as the analytic framework predicts.


                                                                              19
    The service eect is always negative and accounts to a large extent for the negative
medium run impact of an impulse to new borrowing.               Other eects are generally positive
and decline over time. This is broadly in line with what one would expect from new borrowing
and the fact that it is autocorrelated. The only exception occurs in years 5 and 6 where the
other eects are visibly negative.
    The estimated service eect is very robust across specications, in contrast to the net
eect and hence the other eects. The middle and right-hand panels shows the decomposition
for the additional and minimal sets of controls, respectively. Dierences between the service
eect across the three specications only become noticeable from horizon 6 onward.                        In
contrast, both the net eect and the other eects are less stable across the specications.
For instance, the negative other eects at horizons 6 and 7 become larger when the additional
controls are used. The main reason is that this set of controls is only available for a shorter,
more recent, sample that places more emphasis on the global nancial crisis.
                                                                                          21    The other
eects become consistently more negative when only GDP growth is used as a control for
the same reasons as in Section 5.1.
    The negative other eects between years ve and seven are interesting more generally,
as they may partly reect non-linearities associated with nancial crises.                For instance,
if we dummy out crises fully, the negative other eects disappear completely (Figure 18,
Appendix D). Equally, if we condition the impulse responses on periods where the output
gap is initially negative, the negative other eects also disappears. In contrast, if we condition
on positive output gaps, the negative other eects become larger. These observations point to
potential asymmetric eects related to nancial crises, which we analyze in the next section.
    The decomposition is also robust across several alternative specications and samples
(Figure 18, Appendix D).          For instance, controlling for lending standards has no impact.
And the overall pattern does not change much if we split the sample around year 2000,
suggesting that the results are not exclusively related to the Great Recession and the boom
that preceded it. The eects become larger when we allow for heterogeneity in the panel
using the mean group estimator (Pesaran and Smith (1995)). The pattern is also the same
if we use consumption rather than real output as the left hand variable.               Interestingly, in
this case the estimated decomposition looks virtually identical to our analytical simulation
in the right-hand panel of Figure 3.
    So far we have used our decomposition method to show that debt service explains the
majority of the medium-run eects of new borrowing. We can use the same method to de-
monstrate that other variables do not play an important role in the medium-run transmission
of new borrowing to output, as shown in Figure 9. First, we apply our decomposition method
to new borrowing itself (upper left-hand panel). As would be expected in the presence of
autocorrelated new borrowing, and given the rst-round positive impact of new borrowing
on growth, the     direct eect   of new borrowing is (nearly) always positive.
    Other variables that are commonly viewed as playing a systematic adverse role in the
transmission of credit booms have much less explanatory power than debt service.

  21 This is conrmed by Table 8 in Appendix D, where we show the local projection of a unit impulse to
new borrowing using the baseline controls but constraining the sample to the periods when all additional
controls are available.
  22 We also looked at the impact of provisions, which shows the expected dynamics, ie bank provisions for
bad loans go up following a impulse to new borrowing, and this aects output negatively. But the overall

prices, which capture the value of collateral in leverage dynamics, do seem to explain some of
the negative output eects following an impulse to new borrowing, but much less so than the
debt service eect (bottom left-hand panel). The role of the household net-worth channel
seems very small in the decomposition (bottom right-hand panel), although this is likely
driven by the fact that the stock of assets in nancial accounts is not marked to market. In
summary, debt service plays by far the most important role in the transmission of impulses
of new borrowing to medium-run output growth.
    Last, while our results imply that monetary policy does not fully oset the ow eects,
the evidence nevertheless suggest that it does so partially.             This can be seen by tracking
the eect that go through the money market rate (bottom right-hand panel). Following an
impulse to new borrowing, this eect is initially negative, osetting some of the positive
eects of the credit expansion. Conversely, once debt service peaks, the eects turn positive,
countering some of the negative debt service eects.



5.4 Eects on the probability of crises
There is a growing empirical literature on the link between credit booms and nancial crises
(e.g. Borio and Lowe (2002), Reinhart and Rogo (2009) or Schularick and Taylor (2012))
that nds strikingly similar lead-lag relationships to the ones that we report for new borro-
wing and output growth. For instance, a large increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio above a
long run trend substantially increases the probability of a banking crisis. The results in the
previous section also indicated that some of the negative output eects of new borrowing are
related to the incidence of nancial crisis. In this section, we therefore investigate the extent
to which projected future debt service, resulting from a debt impulse, can account for the
increase in crisis probability.
                                  23    This is natural because it is the debt service, not borrowing
in itself, that risks triggering defaults and ultimately nancial crises.
    To study the eects of new borrowing and debt service on the probability of banking
crises, we adapt our previous empirical framework to binary response models. We take the
crisis indicator at   t + h as the outcome variable and use it to model the probability of a crisis
conditional on new borrowing, debt service and our baseline control variables in a panel logit
framework with country xed eects.
                                             24


    The local projections show that both new borrowing and debt service increase the pro-
bability of a crisis, but the eect of debt service is immediate whereas the eect of new
borrowing takes time to fully materialize (Figure 10). New borrowing (left panel) does seem
to aect the likelihood of crisis in the following year, but the strongest and most signicant
eects are in year 3. By contrast, a unit increase in debt service (right panel) has its lar-
gest eect on the crisis probability in rst year after which it declines slowly and becomes

impact of this channel is very small.
  23 A few recent studies that look at debt service in this context nd that it is an excellent early warning
indicator, particularly at shorter forecasting horizons (e.g.   Drehmann and Juselius (2014), Detken et al
(2014)).
  24 Given country xed eects, countries that do not have a crisis drop out of the sample. To avoid post-
crisis bias (Bussiere and Fratzscher (2006)), we drop the years between the beginning and the ocial end of
crisis management actions as identied by Lo Duca et al (2016) for the European countries or Laeven and
Valencia (2012). In case of no information, we dropped the rst two years after the outbreak of the crisis.

dicating that the control variables generally counteract the eects of our ow variables on
crisis probabilities.



5.5 Decomposing the eect of debt on the crisis probability
As before, our results suggest that debt service is the main transmission channel through
which a credit boom leads to a higher probability of a crisis in the future. This is formally
conrmed in Figure 11, which decomposes the local projections from a unit increase in debt
on the crisis probability into the service eect and other eects, in a similar manner as
in Section 5.3:        debt service always has a sizable positive eect on the crisis probability.
And after year one (when debt service eect is zero by construction), it explains most of
the positive eects of new borrowing. Interestingly, after year three, other eects become
increasingly negative, osetting some of the positive eects of debt servicing and thereby
reducing the net eect. The dynamics of these eects are robust with respect to the dierent
sets of control variables.

emphasized eg by Eberly and Krishnamurthy (2014).                                                       Traditional measures, on the other
hand, relate to credit stocks. Changes in the stock of credit partly depend on the ows but
not the ow of interest payments, as we emphasized in equation (1) in our analytic framework.
Furthermore, they commingle the ow of new borrowing with the ow of amortizations. Since
these two ows are in opposite directions (ie from lenders to borrowers and from borrowers
to lenders, respectively), they will partly oset each other, with unclear eects on regression
results.
    A second dierence is that credit-to-GDP ratios have been growing for decades in most
countries. Researchers have therefore either detrended (e.g. Drehmann et al (2011)) or dif-
ferenced credit-to-GDP ratios (e.g. Schularick and Taylor (2012)) in empirical work linking
credit booms to real developments. Such detrending reduces the informational content in-
herent in the variables and makes it more dicult to economically interpret the estimated
relationships. Calculating debt service, by contrast, can be seen as an economically mea-
ningful way of detrending the credit-to-GDP ratio, since low-frequency changes in the terms
of credit over the past four decades, such as declines in nominal interest rates, have roughly
oset the upward trends in credit-to-GDP ratios so that both new borrowing and debt service
normalized by GDP are stationary.

Empirical comparison                            Whether stock or ow concepts have more explanatory power for
real variables is ultimately an empirical question. To assess this, we run a horse race between
the two.
    The existing literature on the real eects of credit booms has successfully employed
multi-year growth rates in the stock of credit, normalized by GDP, and has uncovered that
these measures predict real outcomes. For example, Mian et al (2017) assess the impact of
the three-year growth rate of this measure on future GDP, or Taylor and Schularick (2012)

  25 Technically speaking there is a cointegrating relationship between credit-to-GDP ratios and interest rates
(Juselius and Drehmann (2015)).

                                                                                            26   To relate growth
rates in the stock of credit to our ow measures, we refer back to the analytic framework that
we developed in Section 2. As we observed there, the annual change in the stock of credit is
a proxy for the ow of new borrowing, since it equals new borrowing minus amortizations.
Similarly, the multi-year growth rates in the stock of credit are a moving sum of this ow
variable and therefore proxy for the ow of debt service at intermediate horizons.
                                                                                                       27
    To compare the empirical performance of our ow measures and of multi-year growth
rates in the stock of credit in predicting real outcomes, we observe that the local projection
of the   n-year growth rate in credit on, say, real GDP, is a convolution of the local projections
of one-year growth rates at dierent horizons. For this reason, we compare the predictive
performance of new borrowing and the one-year growth rate in the stock of credit normalized
by GDP,      ∆cyi,t ,   in the following. In Appendix D we show that our ow-based measures also
outperform the three- and ve-year growth rates in credit stocks (Figures 19 and 20).
    Our horse race uses the specication

for horizons     h = 1, ..., 8, where controlsi,t−1 consists of the baseline control variables. We
                                h+1           h+1             h+1             h+1
consider     four cases: (i) βyb    = 0 and βys    = 0, (ii) βys  = 0, (iii) βyb  = 0, and (iv) no
restrictions. The rst case allows us to study the local projection to credit-to-GDP growth
in isolation.     The second case runs a horse race with respect to new borrowing and will,
by construction, reveal if our measure provides useful additional information for predicting
GDP growth. The third case runs a horse race with respect to debt service. If credit-to-GDP
growth is a suciently close proxy for new borrowing, this should give a similar pattern to
that in Figure 7. The fourth case runs a horse race between all three variables. We also do
the same from the perspective of new borrowing and debt service, ie we rst consider them
individually, then add the other two variables in turn, and nally combine all three variables.
    The left-hand panel of Figure 12 shows the dierent local projections to an impulse to
credit-to-GDP growth for the dierent specications, whereas the middle and right-hand
panels show the corresponding projections from impulses to new borrowing and debt service.
We use large solid diamonds to indicate signicance at the 1% level, medium solid diamonds
to indicate signicance at the 5% level, and medium hollow diamonds indicate signicance
at the 10% level, respectively.

  26 The early warning indicator literature has also used the credit-to-GDP gap as suggested by Basel III for
the countercyclical capital buer. We also ran horse races with this variable and results are similar to the
multi-year growth rates in the credit-to-GDP ratio reported here.
  27 Technically speaking, the     n-year growth rate in the stock of credit comes arbitrarily close to the stock of
credit as   n → ∞.   However, as   n grows too large, the non-stationary components of the stock of credit begin
to dominate, which reduces its usefulness and predictive relevance at cyclical frequencies. This is why growth
rates over intermediate horizons, e.g. three- to ve-year growth rates in the stock of credit normalized by
GDP, appear the most useful predictors of real outcome. By contrast, the ow of debt service is constructed
by multiplying the stock of credit with the sum of the interest and amortization rates and is a stationary
variable, since the trends in interest and amortization rates roughly oset the trends in credit-to-GDP. As we
will see in the following paragraph, this additional information makes debt service an even better predictor
of real outcomes than growth rates in credit-to-GDP.

    The horse races show that new borrowing, in particular, outperforms credit-to-GDP
growth in predicting real GDP. While the local projection to a unit increase in credit-to-
GDP growth performs well on its own (left-hand panel, solid orange line), it looses its
signicance completely once we include new borrowing in the specication (blue dashed
line). This suggest that new borrowing is a more relevant concept to explain real outcomes
such as GDP growth. Put dierently, properly measuring the ow of resources from lenders
to borrowers by subtracting amortizations from the change in the stock of credit is more
useful in predicting real variables. If we instead include contemporaneous debt service, the
local projection to credit-to-GDP growth is almost the same as it is in isolation, as expected.
Finally, when all three variables are added jointly, the projection to credit-to-GDP growth
changes form and becomes largely insignicant (maroon dash-dotted line).
    In contrast, the local projections to unit increases in new borrowing and debt service
remain signicant and fairly stable across specications. In particular, they hardly change
when we add credit-to-GDP growth to the model.                                                           The only big change occurs when we
include both new borrowing and debt service in the model, in which case the local projections
have larger eects and are more signicant. This highlights the importance of distinguishing
between ows from lenders to borrowers and from borrowers to lenders to maximize predictive
performance.
    New borrowing and debt service are also superior indicators to predict crises (Figure 13).
Credit-to-GDP growth performs reasonably well as long as new borrowing is not included.
But as soon as we add new borrowing, credit-to-GDP growth looses its signicance (and even
changes sign). The coecients on new borrowing and debt service, on the other hand, are
stable over the dierent horizons. This stability is also reected in their high signaling quality,
as measured by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (see Figure 21 in Appendix ). New
borrowing and debt service, in particular, are very strong indicators at short horizons, with
AUC values of above 0.9. In contrast, the signaling quality of credit-to-GDP is considerably
lower.

7       Conclusions

This paper shows that the ows of resources between borrower and lenders are crucial for
understanding how credit market developments aect the real economy. In particular, new
borrowing is associated with higher economic growth. Its counterpart, debt service, accounts
for much of the adverse real eects of credit, systematically linking past credit booms to
predictable future slumps in economic activity.                                                 We lay out a simple analytic framework
that describes how debt service can build up with a sizable lag if debt is long-term and new
borrowing is auto-correlated, as it typically is in the data. We construct the rst systematic
cross-country data set of these ows for a panel of 16 countries from 1980 to 2015 and show
that the lag between peaks in new borrowing and debt service is on average four years for the
household sector. We also show that predicted future debt service accounts for the majority
of the transmission mechanism from an impulse to household borrowing to predicted output
losses and increases in crisis probability in the medium run.
     Our ndings raise several important questions related to both the measurement and
theory of credit cycles. For one, given the important real eects of the ows between borrower
and lenders, it is crucial to improve their measurement. It would be particularly benecial
to obtain more regular and granular information on maturity and amortization schedules.
This applies to the household sector and even more to the corporate sector, where these data
are not very reliable.
     Our results also highlight the need for theory models to incorporate the credit market
features that account for the lag structure of debt service in the data. In particular, doing
justice to the data requires auto-correlated new borrowing and long-term debt.

by ows from lenders to borrowers and vice versa begs explanation.                 This pattern is con-
sistent with models in which lenders and borrowers have dierent marginal propensities to
consume and borrowers are nancially constrained so the negative demand eects of high
debt service cannot be oset by additional borrowing. Monetary policy cannot easily coun-
ter the resulting aggregate demand eects when it is constrained by the zero lower bound.
                                                                                                        29
However, our paper also nds strong negative output eects of debt service that seem not to
have been oset by monetary policy during normal times. This raises the question of whether
monetary policymakers were unable to counter the aggregate demand eects of debt service
due to some other constraint, or whether they did not do so because they failed to fully
account for this channel. We leave this for future research.
   The systematic transmission channel whereby credit expansions have long-lasting adverse
real eects also highlights an important policy trade-o.           Our empirical results show that
the ows of new borrowing have positive eects but debt service has negative eects on the
real economy.     But new borrowing necessarily generates future debt service.               Hence, any
policy that aects the economy by inuencing the process of credit generation, for example
monetary policy, has to trade o current output concerns with future debt service obligations.
We hope that our ndings will be useful for future eorts to model nancial cycles and guide
policy making.

A        Proofs and Additional Results

A.1 Lag Structure Between New Borrowing, Net Cash Flows, and
    Debt Service
Proof of Proposition 1        (i) At the peak of new borrowing t∗ , debt is still growing, ∆Dt∗ =
−δDt∗ −1 + Bt∗ > 0, if new borrowing exceeds amortization, Bt∗ > δDt∗ −1 , at t∗ . An upper
                             ∗
bound on debt Dt∗ −1 is t Bt∗ . Our analytic condition on timing implies that δDt∗ −1 <
δt∗ Bt∗ < Bt∗ so debt is still growing at the peak of new borrowing and ∆Dt∗ > 0. Debt
service is a linear transformation of the stock of debt outstanding St = (δ + r) Dt−1 and
                         ∗
therefore peaks after t .
    At the peak t̂ in the stock of debt, we nd ∆Dt̂ > 0 > ∆Dt̂+1 . If we consider a

higher amortization rate δ̃ > δ , the resulting time series for the stock of debt D̃t features
∆D̃t̂ < ∆Dt̂ , which turns negative weakly before t̂. Since the peak in new borrowing t∗ is
                       ∗
exogenous, the lag t − t̂ is decreasing in δ .
                                                                                         ∗
    (ii) The change in the net cash ow at the peak of new borrowing issuance t is given
                                         ∗
by ∆Nt∗ +1 = ∆Bt∗ +1 − ∆St∗ +1 . At t , we nd that ∆Bt∗ +1 < 0 by the denition of the
peak in new borrowing, and the second term is negative since, per point (i), ∆Dt∗ > 0 and
St∗ +1 = (r + δ) Dt∗ . This implies that net cash ow is declining at t∗ or earlier.
                                                                                       ∗
    Our condition on the timing of new borrowing implies (δ + r) Dt∗ −1 < (δ + r) t Bt∗ < Bt∗ .
As a result, we nd Nt∗ > 0 so net cash ow is still positive at the peak in new borrowing.
Furthermore, after the the credit boom at time T +1, we observe that NT +1 = − (δ + r) DT <
0. Taken together, Nt∗ > 0 > NT +1 , proving point (ii) of the proposition.

Proposition 1 in continuous time                 The results of Proposition 1 on the lag structure
between new borrowing, debt service, and net cash ows can be proven with strict inequalities
when we move to a continuous time framework.
    Consider an exogenous hump-shaped process of new borrowing over a continuous interval
[0, T ] that satises B0 = BT = 0 and Bt > 0 in between, i.e. for t ∈ (0, T ). The process
                                                                                            ∗
is continuous and dierentiable over the interval [0, T ) with a single maximum at t so that
Ḃ > 0 for t ∈ [0, t∗ ) and Ḃ < 0 for t ∈ (t∗ , T ), i.e. new borrowing is increasing up to its peak
and decreasing after the peak. Furthermore, assume that the process of new borrowing until
            ∗
the peak t is reached is not too drawn out over time, captured by the analytic condition
(δ + r) t∗ < 1. After T , we assume no further issuance so Bt = 0 for t > T .
    Given these assumptions, total debt outstanding grows at rate


                                          Ḋt = Bt − δDt                                        (14)


The two statements that are the equivalent of Proposition 1 in continuous time and their
respective proofs are as follows (with the modications due to the continuous time setup
emphasized in bold):
    (i) The peak in debt service t̂ occurs after the peak in new borrowing t∗ . The lag between
the two peaks t∗ − t̂ is strictly decreasing in δ .
Proof.   At the peak of new borrowing     t∗ ,
                                           debt is still growing Ḋt > 0 if borrowing exceeds
amortization,   Bt >   δDt . An upper bound on debt Dt∗ is t∗ Bt∗ . Our analytic condition on

                                                    33
timing implies that        δDt∗ < δt∗ Bt∗ < Bt∗     so debt is still growing at the peak of new borrowing
and Ḋt∗ > 0.        Debt service is a linear transformation of the stock of debt outstanding
                                                             ∗
St = (δ + r) Dt      and is therefore also still growing at t when debt issuance is starting to
decline.
     Let us denote the peak of debt service by            t̂ > t∗ ,    which is when the stock of debt peaks
so Ḋt̂ = 0. We observe that t̂ < T , i.e. the stock of debt and debt service peak before the
                                                                                  ∗
process of new borrowing is over at T , since ḊT = −δDT < 0. In summary, t̂ ∈ (t , T ). Since
dḊt̂ /dδ = −Dt̂ < 0, a higher amortization rate δ strictly reduces the time index t̂ at which
                                  ∗
debt and debt service peak. As t is given exogenously, this implies that the lag between the
           ∗
two peaks t − t̂ is strictly decreasing in δ , proving the last part of the statement in (i).


    (ii) The net cash ow from lenders to borrowers peaks strictly before the peak in new
borrowing and turns negative after the peak in new borrowing but strictly before the end of
the credit boom. Net cash ow reaches its minimum after the peak in debt service.
Proof.     Net cash ows in our setting here are given by               Nt = Bt − (δ + r) Dt           with derivative


                                               Ṅt = Ḃt − (δ + r) Ḋt                                            (15)


At the peak of new borrowing            t∗ ,   we nd that     Ṅt∗ < 0   because the rst term            Ḃt∗ = 0   by
the denition of the peak, and the second term is negative since we have just shown that
Ḋt∗ > 0. This implies that net cash ow is already declining at t∗ when new borrowing
reaches its peak, proving the rst part of the statement.
     Our condition on the timing of new borrowing implies                    (δ + r) Dt∗ < (δ + r) t∗ Bt∗ < Bt∗ .
This implies thatNt∗ > 0 so net cash ow will turn negative after the peak in new borrowing.
Furthermore, at the end of the credit boom, we observe that NT = − (δ + r) DT < 0. Taken
                                                                         ∗
together, Nt∗ > 0 > NT , and by continuity of Nt there must be a value t < t < T such that
Nt = 0, proving the second part of the statement
     Finally, we observe that net cash ow is still declining when the level of debt and debt
service peak at     t̂   since
                                    Ṅt̂ = Ḃt̂ − (δ + r) Ḋt̂ = Ḃt̂ − 0 < 0
This proves the last part of the statement.


Proof of Proposition 2             The peak in debt service coincides with the peak in debt. Alt-
hough equation (4) is derived for integer values of t, it denes a continuous function of                       t with
a maximum that is interior to the interval              [0, ∞).    Maximizing the expression with respect
to   t   yields the rst-order condition

which readily simplies to the expression reported in the proposition,

The sign of dt̂/dρ equals the sign of the expression

Proposition 2 in continuous time                                 In continuous time, we consider the same expo-
nentially declining process of new borrowing                          Bt = ρt = e−ηt as in the discrete version of
Proposition 2, where          η = − ln ρ.          The statement that is the equivalent of Proposition 2 in
continuous time and its proof are as follows:
   Following a unit impulse of new borrowing that decays at rate η 6= δ with η, δ ∈ (0, 1),
debt service peaks at
                                                                   ln η − ln δ
                                                            t̂ =
                                                                      η−δ
which satises dt̂/dη < 0 and dt̂/dδ < 0.30
   (The dierence from the discrete-time case is that we can determine the exact peak
instead of providing an interval that contains the peak in debt service.)

Since   sign dt̂/dρ = −sign dt̂/dη                    , the signs are the same as in the discrete time case.



A.2 Accounting for Write-Downs and Default
If we account explicitly for write-downs and default, the laws-of-motion in our analytic
framework are modied in two ways.

 30 In the case   η = δ,   the solution is     Dt = e−ηt t       which is maximized at               t̂ = 1/η .


                                                                     35
Missed payments             First, borrowers may default on the ow of debt service by missing an
amount    Mt     of the debt service payments that they owe. This implies an actual ow of debt
service payments




                                           St = (δ + r) Dt−1 − Mt                                     (16)


We assume that missed payments             Mt   are added to the stock of debt and are, for simplicity,
compounded at the same interest rate            r.

Write-downs            Secondly, lenders may write down an amount        Wt   of the stock of debt. As a
result, the modied law of motion for debt is




                                  Dt = (1 − δ) Dt−1 − Wt + Bt + Mt                                    (17)


and the net cash ow from lenders to the borrowers in a given period              t   satises


                                Nt = Bt − St = Bt − (δ + r) Dt−1 + Mt                                 (18)


Mapping to the data              Our measurement of new borrowing and debt service is aected
as follows:
      The data series on the stock of debt fully accounts for the implications of both write-
downs and missed payments, captured by the two new terms in equation (17).                       To obtain
a times series of new borrowing that accounts for these eects, we thus have to add back
write-downs and subtract missed payments,


                                     Bt = ∆Dt + δDt−1 + Wt − Mt

      The time series for debt service owed that we constructed in Section 3 is based on ac-
tual interest paid (which       excludes   missed interest obligations) and estimated amortizations
owed (which       include   missed amortizations). If we assume that borrowers miss interest and
amortization in equal proportion       m,    then missed payments are described by


                                       Mt = m (δDt−1 + rDt−1 )                                        (19)


Actual interest payments are then given by the expression


                                            Rt = (1 − m) rDt−1                                        (20)


If   Dt−1 , Mt   Rt are observable in the data and we use our usual imputation procedure
                 and
for amortization δ , we can eliminate r and solve the two equations (19) and (20) for m. This
allows us to obtain both debt service obligations δDt−1 + Rt / (1 − m) as well as actual debt
service ows St = (1 − m) δDt−1 + Rt .

A.3 Debt service on installment loans
Consider a debt in the amount of      D    at interest rate        r   that is to be repaid in   m equal future
installments. The value of debt must equal the present discounted value                        of m future debt
service payments    S,   discounted at the interest rate          r.   This gives rise to the geometric series


        S             S          S                           m−1       S      1 − (1 + r)m

or equivalently

                                           S=                                                                (21)

Debt service as a fraction of the stock of debt can be decomposed into the corresponding
interest and amortization rate,     S/D = r + δ .       Using this in equation (21), the amortization
rate can be expressed as


                  S             r            r − r + r (1 + r)−m         r
             δ=     −r =               − r =                     =
                  D      1 − (1 + r)−m
                                                1 − (1 + r)−m
                                                                   (1 + r)m − 1

Notice that we nd that


            dδ   (1 + r)m − 1 − rm (1 + r)m−1   (1 + r)m−1 [1 − r (m − 1)] − 1
               =                      2       =                      2         <0
            dr          [(1 + r)m − 1]                 [(1 + r)m − 1]

where the sign of the numerator of the expression follows since                       (1 + x)m (1 − mx) < 1   for
any   x, m > 0.

environment in which the initial maturity of new borrowing is given by                       m,   we consider the
steady-state of an economy with       m    overlapping generations of households. Each period, a
new generation engages in      D   units of new borrowing of maturity                  m.   Loans are structured
as installment loans, resulting in debt service             S   as given by equation (21) above over the
following   m periods.   At any given time, there are           m generations that we may index k = 1...m
that are each obliged to make debt service payments                 S for k more periods and thus owe a
market value of debt outstanding

B        Decomposing Impulse Response Functions

This appendix explains our econometric methodology for decomposing the impulse responses
of new borrowing. We rst explain our decomposition using a linear local projection with one
auto-regressive term that can easily be compared to a VAR(1) benchmark. We also describe
how it can be applied in our specic setting to decompose the eects of new borrowing on real
variables. We then present the methodology for a more general auto-regressive structure.


Econometric setup                   zt be a n × 1 random vector with n ≥ 3 partitioned into four
                                    Let
                                      0 0
elements zt = (z1,t , z2,t , z3,t , z4,t ) , where for convenience the three rst elements are scalars
and the last element, z4t , is a vector (possibly the empty vector, if n = 3). Suppose that
we are primarily interested in knowing how z2,t+h responds to a shock to z1,t . Moreover, we
also want to know how much of this impulse response is due to the fact that z3,t , ..., z3,t+h−1
changes in response to the original shock to z1,t .
       In the specic context of Section 5, for example, the rst element is new borrowing, i.e.
z1,t = bi,t ,   the second element is output growth, i.e.                     z2,t = ∆yi,t ,   the third element is debt
service, i.e.    z3,t = si,t ,    and the fourth element is a vector of controls, i.e.                  z4,t = controlsi,t .
       To express the impulse response and its decomposition, we need to specify a process for
zt .   For ease of exposition, we rst consider the linear local projection of                           zt+h    on the space
generated by       zt−1 ,      which is given by


                                              zt+h = µh+1 + Ah+1 zt−1 + υh,t+h                                                (22)


where     µh+1   is a vector of constants,            Ah+1    is an       n×n   matrix of coecients, and               υh,t+h    is
an error term. The error term is a                  hth   order moving average of a set of reduced form                       i.i.d.
disturbances,      νt ,   arriving in each time period from              t to t + h (see Jorda ( 2005)).              For   h = 0,
specically, we have            υ0,t = νt .   Using the index        h + 1 on the parameters of (22) is               convenient
for expressing the impulse response at                    t + h,   as will become clear shortly.


Impulse response                  Let   di   be a shock to the      ith   element of vector    zt ,   technically dened as
a linear combination of the reduced form disturbances, νt . The simplest example is a unit
                       0 31
shock d1 = (1, 0, 0, 0) .   The impulse response of zt+h from di , denoted IR(zt+h , di ), can
be dened as


                          IR(zt+h , di ) = E(zt+h | νt = di ; Zt ) − E(zt+h | νt = 0; Zt )                                    (23)


forh = 0, 1, ..., where E(· | ·) denotes the                       expectation from the best mean squared error
                                    0
predictor and Zt = (zt−1 , zt−2 ...) represents                    past information that is known at time                t.
       To calculate the impulse response (23) based on the process dened in (22), note that
E(zt+h | Zt ) = E(E(zt+h | zt ) | Zt ) by the law of iterated expectations. The expectation
E(zt+h | zt ) can be found by leading the time index in (22) by one period and considering
the forecast h − 1 periods ahead. This gives E(zt+h | zt ) = µ̂h + Âh zt where the hat denotes
the estimated value from the predictor. Moreover, from (22) with h = 0 we nd that

   31 More generally,     di   could refer for example to a column of the inverse lower triangular matrix that is used
in a Cholesky decomposition, if shocks are identied by a Wold-causal order of                  zt    when   h = 0.


                                                                   38
zt = µ1 + A1 zt−1 + di              when   υ0,t = νt = di   and   zt = µ1 + A1 zt−1          when      νt = 0.   Combining
these results we get


             IR(zt+h , di ) = E (E(zt+h | zt ) | νt = di ; Zt ) − E (E(zt+h | zt ) | νt = 0; Zt )
                                                                                           
                            = µh + Âh (µ1 + A1 zt−1 + di ) − µh + Âh (µ1 + A1 zt−1 )
                                   = Âh di                                                                           (24)


with the normalization       Â0 = I . The impulse response in (24) is our rst object of interest.
                                         0 0                       0 0
With zt = (bi,t , ∆yi,t , si,t , controlsi,t ) and d1 = (1, 0, 0, 0 ) , the expression (10) in the main
text corresponds to IR(∆yi,t+h , d1 ).


Decomposition                    Next we decompose how a shock         d1    to   z1,t   at time   t   propagates through
the system (22) to aect                 z2,t+h at horizons h ≥ 0. Specically, we ask how much of the
impulse response of              z2,t+h runs through the predictable eects of the shock on the realizations
of   z3,t , . . . , z3,t+h−1 .   (In the application in Section 5, this corresponds to asking how much of
the eect of a credit impulse at time             t on output yt+h occurs via debt service st+1 , . . . , st+h−1 .)
For this purpose, rewrite the prediction of equation (22) as


                                 ẑt+h|t−1 = µ̂h+1 + Âh+1 zt−1
                                                                                  
                                           = µ̂h+1 + Â1 Âh zt−1 + Âh+1 − Â1 Âh zt−1
                                           ≈ µ̂h+1 + Â1 Âh zt−1                                                     (25)


where      ẑt+h|t−1    is shorthand for       E(zt+h | Zt−1 ).     The critical step in this derivation is the

approximation in equation (25). This step is valid as long as                            Âh+1 ≈ Â1 Âh .   The equation
holds exactly if the true data generating process (DGP) for zt is a vector auto-regression
                            h+1
(VAR), since Âh+1 = (Â1 )     in that case. In the more general case where the true DGP
                                                       h
is not a VAR we are still likely to have Âh+1 ≈ Â1 Â1 because the local projection and the
                                                                  h
VAR are the same at h = 0 and the approximation error in Â1 Â1 does not compound with
h.
      The approximation in (25) allows us to separate between rst round and higher round
eects in the impulse responses. Using (24) together with (25) we get


                                      IR(zt+h , di ) =   Âh di
                                                     ≈   Â1 Âh−1 di
                                                     =   Â1 IR(zt+h−1 , di )
                                                     =   IR (zt+h , IR(zt+h−1 , di ))                                 (26)


This captures that the impulse response of a shock                      di       h > 1 is approximately
                                                                             at horizon
equal to the rst round eects of the expected position of the system h − 1 periods ahead.
                                                                  nd
   In Section 5, our interest lies in the response of the 2          element of the vector zt+h (output
yt+h ) to a shock d1 (i.e. to new borrowing). Focusing only on this rst element and separating
                                                                           n

Given our specication (22), we can denote these two terms in matrix notation as


                   service_eect        = IR (z2,t+h , IR(z3,t+h−1 , d1 )) = Â23,1 Â3·,h−1 d1                   (27)


where   Âij,h   denotes the    ij th   element of     Âh   and   Âi·,h   denotes its   ith   row.   The part of the
impulse response that is due to all other factors is given by

                                                                                       
       other_eects      = IR z2,t+h , (IR(zi,t+h−1 , d1 ))i6=3 = Â2·,h − Â23,1 Â3·,h−1 d1 .                   (28)


With   zt = (bi,t , ∆yi,t , si,t , controls0i,t )0   and   d1 = (1, 0, 0, 00 )0 , Equations (27) and (28) reduce
to (11) and (12) in the main text.


General case          It is easy to generalize these calculations to a               pth   order local projection of
the form
                           zt+h = µh+1 + Ah+1,1 zt−1 + ... + Ah+1,p zt−p + υh,t+h                                 (29)

Again we can rewrite the prediction of (29) in terms of its projected rst-order eects as


                     ẑt+h = µ̂h+1 + Âh+1,1 zt−1 + ... + Âh+1,p zt−p

                             + Âh+1,1 − Â1,1 Âh,1 − ... − Â1,p Âh−p,1 zt−1 + ...

                           ≈ µ̂h+1 + Â1,1 Âh,1 + ... + Â1,p Âh−p,1 zt−1 + ...
                                                               
                             + Â1,1 Âh,p + ... + Â1,p Âh−p,p zt−p                                             (30)



with the normalization        Â1−j,j = I      Â1−j,k = 0 for j ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ k 6= j , as well as, µ−j = 0
                                             and

for j ≥ 0. The expression          on the last line is valid if Âh+1,j ≈ Â1,1 Âh,j + ... + Â1,p Âh−p,j , for
j = 1, ..., p. As before, it       will be zero if the true underlying DGP for zt is a VAR. To see
this, note that zt can be written           in companion form as

From Jorda (2005) we know that             A1,k        = Ah+1,k                for all    h≥0            and   k = 1, ..., p.   But given
the denition of   wt   this also implies
                                                                                                           

with the normalizations      Ah+1−j,j−h = I            and       Ah+1−j,k−h = 0                    for     j ≥ h+1     and   0 < k 6= j .
But then the assumed VAR structure also implies that

                                  (h+1)                      (h)

                                            = A1,1 Ah,j + ... + A1,p Ah−p,j
which shows the proposition.
      Using (23) together with (30) gives


                IR(zt+h , di ) = Âh,1 di
                                 ≈ Â1,1 Âh−1,1 di + ... + Â1,p Âh−1−p,1 di
                                 = Â1,1 IR(zt+h−1 , di ) + ... + Â1,p IR(zt+h−1−p , di )
                                   IR (zt+h , IR(zt+h−1 , di ), ..., IR(zt+h−1−p , di ))                                             (31)


which concludes our decomposition in the                   pth     order case.

Figure 17: Comparison of our measures of new borrowing and debt service for Australian mortgages with
alternative measures from the Reserve Bank of Australia.                           The Reserve Bank of Australia (2016) reports

data on the stock of mortgages outstanding and newly issued mortgages and renanced mortgages. From

these series, we calculate new borrowing as all newly issued mortgages minus renanced mortgages, and

amortizations as the change in the stock of debt minus new borrowing.

Figure 18: Decomposition of the net eect of new borrowing on future GDP growth (equation (10)) into
the service eect (equation (11)) and the other eects (equation (12)) for horizons h=1 to 8.                                                      We always

include the baseline controls (see Table 1).                                Lending standards controls for lending standards.                            Given

limited observations we only forecast up to horizon 5. Before 2000 (after 2000) uses data before 2000 (from

2000 onward). Output gap positive (negative) and spread high (low) considers data when the output gap

was positive (negative), respectively credit spreads were above (below) country specic means, in the initial

period. Dummy out crises adds country and crisis specic dummies that are 1 at the start of a crisis. Mean

group estimator allows for full cross-country heterogeneity (Peseran and Smith (1995)). In Consumption

(Unemployment) we decompose the net eect of new borrowing on future consumption (unemployment)

growth. Mortgages (Other) decomposes the net eect of new mortgage (other household debt) borrowing.

Fixed rate (Flexible rate) decomposes the net eect of new mortgage borrowing splitting the sample into

countries with predominantly xed rate (exible rate) mortgages.

Table 10: The impact of new borrowing and debt service on the probability of crises as measured by the
respective coecients in local projections for horizons           h=1   to 8. We estimate a panel logit with country

xed eects and controls.        Only GDP, Base and Additional refers to the three sets of controls (see

Table 1). No controls employs no controls except new borrowing and debt service. Base res.                       uses the

baseline controls but only considers observations when all other additional controls are available. OLS uses
