                                             ABSTRACT

We develop a new class of nonlinear time-series models to identify nonlinearities in the data and to
evaluate nonlinear DSGE models. U.S. output growth and the federal funds rate display nonlinear
conditional mean dynamics, while inflation and nominal wage growth feature conditional heteroskedasticity.
We estimate a DSGE model with asymmetric wage/price adjustment costs and use predictive checks
to assess its ability to account for nonlinearities. While it is able to match the nonlinear inflation and
wage dynamics, thanks to the estimated downward wage/price rigidities, these do not spill over to
output growth or the interest rate.

1        Introduction

Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are now widely used for
empirical research in macroeconomics, as well as for forecasting and quantitative
policy analysis in central banks. In these models, decision rules of economic agents
are derived from assumptions about agents’ preferences and production technologies
utilizing some fundamental principles such as optimization, rational expectations,
and competitive equilibrium. In practice, this means that the functional forms and
parameters of equations that describe the behavior of economic agents are tightly
restricted by the equilibrium conditions. Consequently, a careful evaluation of the
DSGE model-implied restrictions is an important aspect of empirical research.

    Until recently, much of the research that estimates DSGE models used first-order
approximations to the equilibrium decision rules. This made linear models such as
vector autoregressions (VARs) appropriate for evaluating the restrictions of the DSGE
model. With the advance of methods to estimate DSGE models using higher-order
approximations, as developed in Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2007), an
important avenue of research has opened. The end of the Great Moderation also
makes nonlinear models all the more relevant for empirical macroeconomics.1 While
there is a burgeoning literature on both the methods to solve nonlinear DSGE models
and their applications, there does not seem to be an obvious nonlinear time-series
model in use to evaluate these DSGE models.

    The objective of this paper is to develop a class of time-series models that mimic

    1
        There are in principle two types of nonlinearities that can appear in a nonlinear DSGE model.
First are (approximately) smooth nonlinearities, where decision rules display curvature and possibly
asymmetries such as those that are generated by asymmetric loss or cost functions. Second are kinks
in decision rules such as those that are generated by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.
This paper is about the former. While the latter is also crucial and we intend to extend our work to
address this type of nonlinearities, solving and estimating DSGE models with kinks in decision rules
is very difficult. See, for example, Gust, Lopez-Salido, and Smith (2012), Aruoba and Schorfheide
(2013), Bocola (2013), and references therein.
                                                                                                2


nonlinearities of DSGE models and to use these models as a benchmark for the eval-
uation of a nonlinear DSGE model. Motivated by the popular second-order pertur-
bation approximations of DSGE model dynamics, we consider autoregressive models
that involve quadratic terms of lagged endogenous variables as well as interactions
between current-period innovations and lagged endogenous variables, which generate
conditional heteroskedasticity. These time-series models are derived from a perturba-
tion solution to a nonlinear difference equation and have a recursively linear structure
that makes it straightforward to characterize stability properties and derive moments.
While multivariate extensions are possible, we focus in this paper on univariate spec-
ifications, which we refer to as QAR(p,q) models, where “Q” stands for quadratic.2
In the empirical work, we use p = q = 1.

    After documenting some of the theoretical properties of the QAR models, the
first step of the empirical analysis is to fit QAR(1,1) models to growth of real gross
domestic product (GDP), inflation, nominal wage growth, and interest rate data for
the U.S. We start our sample in 1960 but consider various subsamples, using 1983
(the end of the Volcker era and the start of the Great Moderation) and 2007 (the end
of the Great Moderation and the start of the Great Recession) as additional start
and end points. We find three sets of important nonlinearities across the variables
and samples we consider. First, GDP growth displays pronounced nonlinearities in
the post-1983 samples with sharp output losses during recessions and relatively slow
recoveries. Second, for inflation and wage growth the long samples that start in 1960
and extend beyond the 1990s exhibit high volatility in times of high inflation and
wage growth, which is mainly driven by the observations in the 1970s. Finally, QAR
estimates for interest rates imply an asymmetric behavior by the Federal Reserve,
cutting interest rates faster but not increasing them as fast in the post-1983 era.

    The second step of the empirical analysis consists of the estimation of a DSGE
model. In our application we focus on the estimation and evaluation of a New Keyne-
   2
       The abbreviation QAR has previously been used for quantile autoregressions; see Koenker and
Xiao (2006).
                                                                                     3


sian DSGE model with asymmetric price and wage adjustment costs, building on work
by Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009). This model can generate downward nominal wage
and price rigidity and is interesting for several reasons. First, it is well known that
in the absence of the zero-lower-bound (ZLB) constraint on nominal interest rates,
unrealistically large shocks, or high degrees of risk aversion, New Keynesian DSGE
models do not generate significant nonlinearities (see, for instance, An (2007)). How-
ever, once one allows for asymmetric adjustment costs, agents’ decision rules can
become strongly nonlinear. Thus, ex ante, to the extent that there are nonlinearities
in the data, the model may be able to deliver some of these.

   Second, downward rigidity is a well-documented feature of nominal wage changes
at the micro level, e.g., Gottschalk (2005), Barattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk (2010),
and Daly, Hobijn, and Lucking (2012). Third, a number of papers have incorporated
downward nominal wage rigidity into DSGE models to study its macroeconomic ef-
fects. For instance, Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009) study optimal monetary policy in
the presence of downward nominal wage rigidity. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2013)
use downward nominal wage rigidity to generate large output losses and a jobless
recovery in a deflation (or liquidity-trap) equilibrium of a New Keynesian model with
ZLB constraint. Thus, a careful evaluation of the nonlinearities that this mechanism
generates is important.

   In estimating the DSGE model, we use the same data set as in the estimation of
the univariate QAR models and consider two samples, one long and one short, both
of which end in 2007 to avoid using data where the ZLB starts to bind. By and large,
the parameter estimates for the DSGE models are consistent with estimates that
have been reported elsewhere in the literature. In particular, our estimates indicate
asymmetries in the adjustment costs for both prices and nominal wages that make
increases less costly than decreases.

   The final and most important step of the analysis is to conduct a posterior pre-
dictive check of the DSGE model that compares coefficient estimates obtained from
                                                                                                4


data simulated from an estimated DSGE model to coefficient estimates obtained from
actual data. The predictive check amounts to assessing how far the QAR estimates
obtained from the actual data lie in the tails of the predictive distribution. The
general conclusion is that the DSGE model does not generate very strong nonlinear-
ities except for inflation and nominal wage growth, both of which show conditional
heteroskedasticity. This means that the asymmetric adjustment costs in prices and
wages are able to deliver asymmetric behavior in inflation and nominal wage growth
in line with the data, but this asymmetry does not spill over to real GDP growth or
to the policy instrument of the Federal Reserve.

   Our work is related to several branches of the literature. There exists a large body
of work on nonlinear time-series models.3 However, none of these model classes seem
to be directly usable for our purposes since either the nonlinearities do not match
the nonlinearities of DSGE models solved with higher-order perturbation methods,
or the models have undesirable instability properties.

   The proposed QAR family is most closely related to generalized autoregressions
(GAR) discussed in Mittnik (1990) in the sense that the conditional mean of the
dependent variable yt is a polynomial function of its lags. Our QAR models also in-
volve interactions between lagged dependent variables yt−j and innovations ut , which
is a defining property of bilinear models and linear autoregressive conditional het-
eroskedasticity (LARCH) models, e.g., those in Giraitis, Robinson, and Surgailis
(2000). However, rather than simply augmenting a linear autoregressive model by
quadratic terms and interactions between lagged endogenous variables and innova-
tions, we derive its structure from a second-order perturbation approximation to the
solution of a nonlinear difference equation along the lines of Holmes (1995). To the
extent that both conditional mean and variance depend on quadratic functions of

   3
       These include regime-switching models, e.g., Hamilton (1989) and Sims and Zha (2006), time-
varying coefficient models, e.g., Cogley and Sargent (2002) and Primiceri (2005), threshold and
smooth-transition autoregressive models, e.g., Tong and Lim (1980) and Teräsvirta (1994), and
bilinear models, e.g., Granger and Andersen (1978) and Rao (1981).
                                                                                      5


the innovations ut our model is also related to the class of (G)ARCH-M models, e.g.,
those in Engle, Lilien, and Robins (1987) and Grier and Perry (1996). Finally, the
QAR model can be viewed as a set of tight restrictions on the coefficients of a Volterra
(1930) representation of a nonlinear time series.

   There exists an abundant literature that develops methods to evaluate DSGE
models based on comparisons with more flexible and densely parameterized time-series
models. However, much of the existing econometric work is based on linearized DSGE
models. A natural benchmark for the evaluation of such models is provided by vector
autoregressions (VARs) that relax the cross-coefficient restrictions. In fact, there
exists an extensive literature that develops and applies methods to evaluate DSGE
models based on comparisons with VARs, e.g., Cogley and Nason (1994), Schorfheide
(2000), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets,
and Wouters (2007), and Fernández-Villaverde, Rubio-Ramı́rez, Sargent, and Watson
(2007).

   In this paper we use so-called posterior predictive checks to evaluate a prototyp-
ical DSGE model. A general discussion of the role of predictive checks in Bayesian
analysis can be found in Lancaster (2004) and Geweke (2005). Canova (1994) is the
first paper that uses predictive checks to assess implications of a DSGE model. While
Canova (1994)’s checks were based on the prior predictive distribution, we use poste-
rior predictive checks in this paper as, for instance, in Chang, Doh, and Schorfheide
(2007). Finally, Abbritti and Fahr (2013) use a model with asymmetric wage adjust-
ment costs and search and matching frictions to investigate the ability of the model
to deliver nonlinearities, focusing on skewness and turning-point statistics.

   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the
structure of second-order perturbation approximations of DSGE models. The QAR
model is developed in Section 3, where we discuss some of its theoretical properties as
well as Bayesian inference. Estimates of the QAR model for U.S. data are presented
in Section 4. The DSGE model with asymmetric price and wage adjustment costs

is introduced in Section 5. The estimation and evaluation of the DSGE model is
presented in Section 6 and Section 7 concludes. An online appendix contains detailed
derivations of the properties of the QAR model, as well as details about the Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods employed in this paper.



2     DSGE Model Nonlinearities

Most estimated nonlinear DSGE models are solved with perturbation methods be-
cause they can be efficiently applied to models with a large state space. A DSGE
model solved by second-order perturbation can be generically written as

                ci,t = ψ1i (θ) + ψ2ij (θ)xj,t + ψ3ij (θ)zj,t

                          +ψ4ijk (θ)xj,t xk,t + ψ5ijk (θ)xj,t zk,t + ψ6ijk (θ)zj,t zk,t

             xi,t+1 = ζ1i (θ) + ζ2ij (θ)xj,t + ζ2ij (θ)zj,t                               (1)

                          +ζ4ijk (θ)xj,t xk,t + ζ5ijk (θ)xj,t zk,t + ζ6ijk (θ)zj,t zk,t

              zi,t+1 = ξ2ij (θ)zj,t + ξ3i (θ)i,t+1 ,

where θ denotes the parameters of the model and the DSGE model variables are
grouped into control variables ci,t , e.g., consumption; endogenous state variables xi,t ,
e.g., the capital stock; and exogenous state variables zi,t , e.g., total factor productivity.
The notation aijk xj,t xk,t in (1) is shorthand for nj=1 nk=1 aijk xj,t xk,t . Since not all
                                                   P P

of the control and state variables are observable, it is common to augment the system
by a measurement equation of the form

               yi,t = A1i (θ) + A2ij (θ)cj,t + A3ij (θ)xj,t + A4ij (θ)zj,t + ei,t ,       (2)

where the ei,t ’s are measurement errors. Typically, the vector of observables yt is
composed of a subset of the state and control variables such that the A matrices are
simple selection matrices.

    Nonlinear features may arise endogenously or exogenously. Curvature in utility
functions, adjustment cost function, and production functions can generate nonlinear
                                                                                     7


decision rules of households and firms endogenously. An example of an exogenous
nonlinearity is stochastic volatility in the exogenous shocks that generate business
cycle fluctuations. In (1) the endogenous nonlinearity is captured by the quadratic
functions of xt and zt that appear in the law of motion of the control variables ci,t
and the endogenous state variables xi,t+1 . The representation assumes there are no
exogenous nonlinearities as the exogenous states xexo
                                                  i,t evolve according to a linear

autoregressive process.

   The objective of this paper is to propose an econometric method to assess the em-
pirical adequacy of the nonlinear terms in the DSGE model solution (1). The DSGE
model generates cross-coefficient restrictions between the first-order terms and the
higher-order terms that may or may not be correctly specified. In principle, one
could try to estimate two versions of the state-space model given by (1) and (2): a re-
stricted version that imposes the functional relationship between the low-dimensional
DSGE model parameter vector θ and the state-space coefficients ψ(·), ζ(·), and ξ(·)
and an unrestricted version in which the ψ’s, ζ’s, and ξ’s are freely estimated. The
discrepancy between the restricted and unrestricted estimates provides a measure of
empirical adequacy. However, due to the large number of parameters and some in-
herent identification problems, the unrestricted estimation of the state-space system
(1) and (2) is difficult to implement. In fact, even the literature that evaluates lin-
earized DSGE models has by and large abstained from trying to estimate unrestricted
state-space representations.

   A more common approach in the literature on linearized DSGE models is to
compare properties of the DSGE model to properties of an unrestricted VAR. This
comparison can take many different forms, e.g., assessing the discrepancy between
unrestricted VAR coefficient estimates and the DSGE-model-implied VAR approx-
imation as in Smith (1993), or the comparison of VAR and DSGE model impulse
responses as in Cogley and Nason (1994) or Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2005). Since our goal is to identify nonlinearities, a linear VAR would not be of any
use. Instead, we compare parameter estimates of nonlinear autoregressive time-series
                                                                                      8


models obtained from actual U.S. data and data simulated from a nonlinear DSGE
model. If the DSGE model is well specified, then the estimates of the auxiliary mod-
els ought to be very similar. This comparison is formalized as a Bayesian posterior
predictive check. We proceed by providing a detailed description of the auxiliary
time-series model that is used for the DSGE model evaluation.



3     Quadratic Autoregressive Models

The most popular (and empirically successful) nonlinear time-series models are those
capturing time variation in the coefficients of linear time-series models, e.g., Markov-
switching models, time-varying coefficient models, GARCH models, and stochastic
volatility models. However, none of these models provides a good characterization of
the nonlinearity generated endogenously by the DSGE model solution in (1). For this
reason we develop a new class of nonlinear autoregressive time-series models that are
more closely tied to the DSGE model solution in (1).

    We introduce the specification of a first-order quadratic autoregressive (QAR)
model in Section 3.1. We subsequently characterize some of its important properties
in Section 3.2 and describe the implementation of posterior inference in Section 3.3.
Section 3.4 provides generalizations of the basic specification and discusses the rela-
tionship of our QAR models to other nonlinear time-series models.



3.1    Specification of the QAR(1,1) Model

The starting point is a perturbation approximation of the solution for a nonlinear
difference equation of the form

                                                    iid
                          yt = f (yt−1 , ωut ),   ut ∼ N (0, 1).                    (3)

We assume that the process characterized by (3) has a unique deterministic steady
state that solves the equation y∗ = f (y∗ , 0). Following the literature on perturbation
                                                                                                             9


methods, e.g., Holmes (1995) and Lombardo (2011), we construct an approximate
solution of the form
                                                     (0)      (1)         (2)
                                            yt∗ = yt + ωyt + ω 2 yt .                                       (4)

It turns out that this solution is second-order accurate in the sense that

                                                   yt = yt∗ + Op (ω 3 )                                     (5)

as ω −→ 0.

   To obtain yt∗ , we take a second-order Taylor expansion of the function f around
yt = y∗ and ω = 0:

                        yt − y∗ = fy (yt−1 − y∗ ) + fu ωut                                                  (6)
                                    1
                                  + fy,y (yt−1 − y∗ )2 + fy,u (yt−1 − y∗ )ωut
                                    2
                                    1
                                  + fu,u (ωut )2 + higher-order terms,
                                    2

where fx,y denotes the (x, y)’th derivative of f evaluated at the point (yt = y∗ , ω = 0).
Substituting (4) into (6) and neglecting terms of order Op (ω 3 ), one obtains:

           (0)                  (1)          (2)
          yt − y∗ + ωyt + ω 2 yt

We undertake a few additional modifications. We define st ≡ ωyt                           and introduce the
parameters

               φ0 = y∗ ,   φ1 = fy ,    φ̃2 = fy,y ,       γ̃ =      fy,u ,       σ = fu ω.
                                             2                    2ω
Moreover, we drop the term 12 fu,u u2t to obtain a conditional Normal distribution of
yt . Overall, this leads to the nonlinear state-space model:

                  yt = φ0 + φ1 (yt−1 − φ0 ) + φ̃2 s̃2t−1 + (1 + γ̃s̃t−1 )σut                            (9)

                   s̃t = φ1 s̃t−1 + σut ,     ut ∼ N (0, 1).

To complete the specification of the time-series model we assume that the initial
values in period t = −T∗ have distribution F−T∗ and that the innovations ut are
normally distributed:
                                                            iid
                            (y−T∗ , s̃−T∗ ) ∼ F−T∗ ,      ut ∼ N (0, 1).                               (10)

We refer to (9) as the QAR(1,1) model. The first number indicates the number of
lags in the conditional mean function, and the second number indicates the number
of lags that interact with the innovation ut .

   It is convenient to reparameterize the QAR(1,1) model as follows. Define φ2 , γ,
and st such that
                                                                              p
                          σ2                 σ                                    1 − φ21
               φ2 = φ̃2         ,   γ=p             γ̃,     and st =                      s̃t .        (11)
                        1 − φ21             1 − φ12                                σ
Under the reparameterization, the coefficients φ2 and γ interact with standardized
versions of s2t−1 and st−1 , respectively. Thus, (9) becomes

                  yt = φ0 + φ1 (yt−1 − φ0 ) + φ2 s2t−1 + (1 + γst−1 )σut                               (12)

3.2       Important Properties of the QAR(1,1) Model

In order to appreciate two of the important implications of the recursively linear
structure of the QAR(1,1) model given by (12), consider the alternative specification
                                                                            2
(omitting the constant term and the volatility dynamics) yt = φ1 yt−1 + φ2 yt−1 + ut ,
0 < φ1 < 1 and φ2 > 0. It is straightforward to verify that this specification has two
                    (1)           (2)
steady states: y∗ = 0 and y∗ = (1 − φ1 )/φ2 . The second steady state arises as an
artefact of the quadratic representation even if the underlying nonlinear model (3) has
only a single steady state. Moreover, from writing ∆yt = (−1 + φ1 + φ2 yt−1 )yt−1 + ut
                                                                                              (2)
notice that the system becomes explosive if a large shock has pushed yt−1 above y∗ .
This explosiveness can arise regardless of the value of φ1 .

    The multiplicity of steady states and the undesirable explosive dynamics have been
pointed out in the context of second-order perturbation solutions of DSGE models
by Kim, Kim, Schaumburg, and Sims (2008), who proposed an ex-post modification
of quadratic autoregressive equations to ensure that unwanted higher-order terms do
not propagate forward and generate explosive behavior not present in the underly-
ing nonlinear model. This modification is called “pruning” in the literature.4 Our
derivation of the QAR model in Section 3.1 automatically generates a recursively
linear structure with a unique steady state and nonexplosive dynamics for suitably
restricted values of φ1 . If the marginal distribution of s−T∗ is N (0, 1), then the process
st , t ≥ −T∗ , is strictly stationary under the restriction |φ1 | < 1. In turn, the vector
process zt = [st−1 , s2t−1 , ut ]0 is strictly stationary and we can rewrite the law of motion




   4
       Lombardo (2011) constructs a pruned perturbation solution of a DSGE model directly rather
than by ex-post adjustment. Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2013) solve DSGE models by constructing
approximate second-order Volterra series expansions for the model variables, which also eliminates
unwanted higher-order terms. Andreasen, Fernández-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2013) derive
the moments of observables from a general state-space representation for pruned DSGE models to
facilitate moment-based estimation.

of yt in (9) as
                                                                          ∞
                                                                          X
                         yt = φ0 + φ1 (yt−1 − φ0 ) + g(zt ) = φ0 +              φj1 g(zt−j ).                  (13)
                                                                          j=0


This representation highlights that yt is a stationary process. Since g(zt ) is a nonlinear
function of ut and its history, the process is, however, not linear in ut anymore. In
fact, under the assumption that yt was initialized in the infinite past (T∗ −→ −∞),
we obtain the following representation:
                                                                       
            ∞               ∞ X∞                       min {j,l}
            X               X                           X
 yt = φ0 +σ     φj1 ut−j +σ      γ̃I{l > j}φl−j
                                             1   + φ̃2           φj+l−k
                                                                  1
                                                                         ut−j ut−l . (14)
                 j=0                j=0 l=0                                k=0


(14) is a discrete-time Volterra series expansion, in which the Volterra kernels of order
one and two are tightly restricted and the kernels of order larger than two are equal to
zero.5 The recursively linear structure also facilitates the computation of higher-order
moments of yt . Further details are provided in the appendix.

    For the purpose of the empirical analysis the most important characteristic of (9)
is that the model is able to generate nonlinear dynamics that are akin to the nonlinear
dynamics of DSGE models solved with perturbation methods. In particular, impulse
responses defined as

                                 IRFt (h) = Et [yt+h |ut = 1] − Et [yt+h ]

are state dependent. For instance, for h = 1 we obtain
                                                               q            
 IRFt (0) = σ(1 + γst−1 ), IRFt (1) = σ φ1 (1 + γst−1 ) + 2φ1 φ2 1 − φ21 st−1 . (15)

Moreover, the model generates conditional heteroskedasticity. The conditional vari-
ance of yt is given by
                                       Vt−1 [yt ] = (1 + γst−1 )2 σ 2 .                                        (16)

{ut−j ut−l ut−k }j≥0,l≥0,k≥0 , etc. are called Volterra kernels.
                                                                                          13


3.3    Posterior Inference for the QAR(1,1) Model

We estimate the QAR(1,1) model using Bayesian methods. Starting point is a joint
distribution of data, parameters, and initial states:

                      p(Y0:T , θ, s0 ) = p(Y1:T |y0 , s0 , θ)p(y0 , s0 |θ)p(θ),

where p(Y1:T |y0 , s0 , θ) is a likelihood function that conditions on the initial values of
y0 and s0 , p(y0 , s0 |θ) characterizes the distribution of the initial values, p(θ) is the
prior density of the QAR(1,1) parameters, and θ = [φ0 , φ1 , φ2 , γ, σ 2 ]0 . Since for large
values of |st−1 | the term (1 + γst−1 ) in (12) may become close to zero or switch signs,
we replace it by                                       
                                               γ
                                  (1 − ϑ) exp     st−1 + ϑ ,                            (17)
                                              1−ϑ
where 1 + γst−1 is the first-order Taylor series expansion of (17). The exponential
transformation guarantees non-negativity of the time-varying standard deviation, and
the constant ϑ provides some regularization ensuring that the shock standard devia-
tion is strictly greater than σ exp(ϑ) in all states of the world.

   It is convenient to factorize the likelihood function into conditional densities as
follows:
                                                    T
                                                    Y
                           p(Y1:T |y0 , s0 , θ) =         p(yt |y0:t−1 , s0 , θ).
                                                    t=1

Given s0 and θ, it is straightforward to evaluate the likelihood function iteratively.
Conditional on st−1 the distribution of yt is normal. The equation for yt in (12) can be
solved for ut to determine st , which completes iteration t. In addition to the likelihood
function, we need to specify an initial distribution p(y0 , s0 |θ). We assume that the
system was in its steady state in period t = −T∗ , that is, y−T∗ = φ0 and s−T∗ = 0.
Based on iterating the original system (9) forward we compute a mean and variance
for (y0 , s0 ) and assume that the initial values are normally distributed. Further details
of this initialization are provided in the appendix. Since the dimension of θ is small,
we use a single-block random walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm to generate draws
from the posterior of θ.
                                                                                                             14


3.4    Further Discussion

The QAR(1,1) model in (8) has a straightforward generalization in which we include
additional lag terms:
                   p                            p p                                 q
                                                                                                     !
                   X                            X X                                 X
    yt = φ0 +             φ1,l (yt−l − φ0 ) +             φ̃2,lm st−l st−m +   1+         γ̃l st−l       σut(18)
                    l=1                         l=1 m=l                             l=1
            p
            X
    s̃t =         φ1,l st−l + σut .
            l=1

We refer to (18) as the QAR(p,q) model. As in the standard AR(p) model, the
stationarity of yt is governed by the roots of the lag polynomial 1 − pl=1 φ1,l z l .
                                                                     P

The quadratic terms generate an additional p(p + 1)/2 coefficients in the conditional
mean equation for yt . Since the number of coefficients grows at rate p2 , a shrinkage
estimation method is required even for moderate values of p, in order to cope with
the dimensionality problem. The QAR model can also be extended to the vector
case, which is an extension that we are pursuing in ongoing research. The empirical
analysis presented in Section 6 is based on the QAR(1,1) specification.

   The QAR model is closely related but not identical to some of the existing nonlin-
ear time-series models. For γ = 0, the QAR(1,1) can be viewed as a pruned version of
the generalized autoregressive model (GAR) discussed in Mittnik (1990), which aug-
ments the standard AR model by higher-order polynomials of the lagged variables.
The conditional heteroskedasticity in (9) has a linear autoregressive structure. For
φ2 = 0, our model is a special case of the LARCH model studied in Giraitis, Robin-
son, and Surgailis (2000). Since the conditional variance of yt can get arbitrarily close
to zero, likelihood-based estimation of LARCH models is intrinsically difficult. We
circumvent these difficulties by introducing exponential transformation in (17).

   Grier and Perry (1996, 2000) have estimated GARCH-M models on macroeco-
nomic time series. GARCH-M models provide a generalization of the ARCH-M mod-
                                                                                                15


els proposed by Engle, Lilien, and Robins (1987) and can be written as

                           yt = φ0 + φ1 (yt−1 − φ0 ) + φ2 (σt2 − σ 2 ) + σt ut

                     σt2 − σ 2 = γ1 (u2t−1 − σ 2 ) + γ2 (σt−1
                                                          2
                                                              − σ 2 ).

Under suitable parameter restrictions, yt can be expressed as a nonlinear function
of ut and its lags. As in the case of the QAR model, yt depends on the sequence
{u2t−j }. In addition, the term σt ut introduces interactions between ut and u2t−j , j > 1.
However, coefficients on terms of the form ut−j ut−l , j 6= l are restricted to be zero.
From our perspective, the biggest drawback of the GARCH-M model is that nonlinear
conditional mean dynamics are tied to the volatility dynamics: In the absence of
conditional heteroskedasticity, the dynamics of yt are linear. The QAR model is
much less restrictive in this regard: yt can be conditionally homoskedastic (γ = 0)
but at the same time have nonlinear conditional mean dynamics, that is, φ2 6= 0.



4        QAR Empirics

We begin the empirical analysis by fitting the QAR(1,1) model to per capita out-
put growth, nominal wage growth, GDP deflator inflation, and federal funds rate
data.6 The choice of data is motivated by the DSGE model that is being evaluated
subsequently. The DSGE model features potentially asymmetric wage and price ad-
justment costs, and we will assess whether the nonlinearities generated by this DSGE

        All series are quarterly and obtained from the FRED database of the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis. Output growth is the log difference of real GDP (GDPC96). We compute log differences
of civilian noninstitutional population (CNP16OV) and remove a one-sided eight-quarter moving
average to smooth population growth. The smoothed population growth series is used to obtain
per capita GDP growth rates. Inflation is the log difference of the GDP deflator (GDPDEF).
Nominal wage growth is the log difference of compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector
(COMPNFB). For interest rates, we use quarterly averages of monthly effective federal funds rates
(FEDFUNDS).

mates for the QAR model in Section 4.1 and explore the properties of the estimated
models in Section 4.2.



4.1    Estimation of QAR(1,1) Model on U.S. Data

We estimate QAR(1,1) models for output growth, inflation, nominal wage growth, and
interest rates using five different sample periods, which are summarized in Table 1.
The longest sample spans the period from 1960:Q1 to 2012:Q4. This sample includes
the high-inflation episode of the 1970s, the subsequent disinflation period, and the
Great Recession of 2008-09. We then split this sample after 1983:Q4 into a pre-
Great-Moderation sample that ranges from 1960:Q1 to 1983:Q4 and a post-Great-
Moderation sample from 1984:Q1 to 2012:Q4. Since the 2008-09 recession involves
large negative GDP growth rates that may be viewed as outliers, and the federal
funds rate has been at or near the lower bound of 0% since 2008, we consider two
additional samples that exclude the Great Recession data and end in 2007:Q4.

   To specify the prior distribution for the QAR parameters we use normal distri-
butions for φ0 , φ2 , and γ. The autoregressive coefficient φ1 is a priori also normally
distributed, but the normal distribution is truncated to ensure stationarity of the
QAR model. Finally, the prior distribution of σ is of the inverted gamma form. We
                                                                                      17


use pre-sample information to parameterize the priors. The pre-sample periods for
our five estimation samples are provided in the last column of Table 1. Throughout
the estimation the tuning constant ϑ in (17) is fixed at ϑ = 0.1. The prior distribu-
tions for φ1 , the first-order autoregressive coefficient, are centered at the pre-sample
first-order autocorrelations of the four time series. The inverse Gamma distribution
of σ is centered at the residual standard deviation associated with the pre-sample
estimation of an AR(1) model. Finally, the prior mean of φ0 is specified such that the
implied E[yt ] of the QAR(1,1) model corresponds to the pre-sample mean of the re-
spective time series. The priors for φ2 and γ are centered at zero and have a standard
deviation of 0.1. Further details are provided in the appendix.

   Figure 1 summarizes the posterior distributions of φ2 and γ. Detailed estimation
results for the remaining QAR(1,1) parameters are tabulated in the appendix. The
φ2 posteriors for GDP growth using the three samples starting in 1960 are essentially
centered at zero with the 90% credible interval covering both positive and negative
values. The γ posterior medians for the same samples are slightly negative, around
-0.05, but the 90% credible sets also cover positive values, providing only some mild
evidence for conditional variance dynamics. For the two post-Great-Moderation sam-
ples, the φ2 estimates drop to about -0.1 and the credible set now excludes zero. The
strongest evidence for nonlinearity in GDP growth is present in the 1984-2012 sample,
which includes large negative growth rates of output during the Great Recession, in
the form of φ2 < 0 and γ < 0. Nonlinearities in wages and inflation are reflected in
positive estimates of γ. These nonlinearities are most pronounced for the 1960-2007
and the 1960-2012 samples. For the federal funds rate we obtain estimates of φ2 near
zero and estimates for γ of about 0.4 for samples that include the pre-1984 obser-
vations. For samples that start after the Great Moderation, the pattern is reversed:
The estimates of φ2 are around -0.2 and the estimates of γ are close to zero. We will
discuss the interpretation of these estimates in Section 4.2.

linear autoregressive AR(1) model. The AR(1) models are estimated by setting φ2 =

equal prior probabilities, the difference in log marginal data density between the two
models has the interpretation of log posterior odds. By and large, the marginal
likelihood differentials favor the QAR(1,1) specification. The evidence in favor of the
nonlinear specification is strongest for the federal funds rate. Marginal likelihood
differentials range from 20 to 60. For output growth, there is substantial evidence in
favor of the QAR model for the post-Great-Moderation samples, whereas for inflation

4.2     Properties of the Estimated QAR Models

In this section we discuss what the nonlinearities we identified in the previous section
mean for each variable. For ease of exposition, we focus on the subsample that
“maximizes” the nonlinearities for each variable, which roughly corresponds to picking
the subsample that has the largest marginal data density differential between the
AR(1) and the QAR(1,1) models.

GDP Growth. Our results show that the posterior medians of φ2 and γ for GDP
growth are less than zero. The largest estimates (in absolute terms) are obtained for
the 1984-2012 sample. As (16) shows, with a negative γ, the periods of below-mean
growth (likely to be recessions) are also periods where volatility is higher, which is a
                                                                                                  20


            Figure 3: Impulse Responses of GDP Growth (in Absolute Terms)




Notes: 1984-2012 sample. Solid and dashed lines correspond to median impulse responses to one-
standard-deviation shocks and shaded bands represent 60% credible intervals (equal tail probability).
To initialize the latent state s0 we compute two-quarter moving averages based on the states associ-
ated with the estimated QAR model and calculate the minimum and the maximum of the smoothed
series. For the left panel (large negative s0 ) the initialization is based on the minimum and in the
right panel (large positive s0 ) it is based on the maximum.


well-known business cycle fact. A negative φ2 along with a negative γ also implies that
the response to shocks is a function of the initial state s0 . Using the formulas in (15),
Figure 3 depicts the absolute responses of GDP growth to a negative and a positive
one-standard-deviation shock. In the left panel, we assume that the initial state s0
takes on large negative values, whereas the responses in the right panel condition
on large positive s0 ’s.7 This figure highlights, that regardless of the initial state,
negative shocks are more persistent than positive shocks. Moreover, both shocks
are more persistent in recessions. Combining these results, we deduce that multiple
positive shocks are necessary to recover from a recession, while a small number of
negative shocks can generate a recession.

    The impulse-response findings are consistent with the time-series plot of GDP
growth, which is provided in Figure 4. In this figure, and all the other time-series plots

       To obtain the s0 for a given draw, we compute a two-period moving average to smooth the st
series and use the minimum and the maximum values for this smoothed series.

below, shaded areas indicate NBER recessions and the solid vertical line indicates
the year 1984, which is the starting point of two of the five estimation samples. The
unconditional mean of the variable is shown as a horizontal dashed line. In the post-
1983 sample, the most extreme observations are all during recessions, confirming the
effect of γ < 0. Looking at the quarters just prior to and just after NBER recessions,
we see that the declines in GDP growth are always very sharp, but the recoveries,
defined as getting back to and staying at pre-recession levels, take much longer.

    It is easy to see why the nonlinearities identified in the samples starting in 1984
are not as pronounced in the samples that start in 1960. First, prior to 1984 there are
more episodes of large positive GDP growth rates. These are, in absolute terms, as
large as the negative growth rates observed between 1960 and 2012. Thus, recessions
are not necessarily periods of higher volatility. Second, the recoveries from recessions
are as sharp as the entries, not displaying the clear asymmetry in the later sample.
These findings explain why a linear AR(1) is a good description of GDP growth

pre-1984.8

Inflation and Wage Growth. The nonlinearities in the inflation dynamics are most
pronounced in the 1960-2007 sample with γ > 0 and φ2 = 0. Once again referring
to the conditional variance formula in (16), we conclude that periods of above-mean
inflation are associated with high volatility. In fact, Figure 5 shows that the period
from 1970 to 1980 has high and volatile inflation. A similar conclusion can be reached
in the post-1983 sample, but to a lesser degree. Figure 6 shows that nominal wage
growth displays properties similar to inflation. In the 1960-2007 sample, which is also
the relevant one for nominal wage growth, volatility tends to be high when the level
is high. Because nominal wage growth is more volatile than inflation, and there are
many large negative observations, the estimate of γ is smaller for the former series.

Federal Funds Rate. Figure 7 shows the plot of the federal funds rate. Based on
the QAR(1,1) estimation results, there are two samples with strong nonlinearities. In
the 1960-2007 sample, we find a positive γ. As was the case for inflation and nominal
wage growth, this is due to the observations from late the 1960s to the mid-1980s,
which are typically above the unconditional mean; thus, volatility is higher when the
level is higher. For the 1984-2012 sample we find φ2 < 0 and γ = 0. In this period
the extreme observations are equally likely to be positive or negative and thus γ = 0
is reasonable. φ2 < 0 implies that interest rates fall faster than they rise. This seems
to be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s operating procedures in the post-1983
sample, and it can have two separate explanations. First, the Federal Reserve may
have an asymmetric policy rule, in which reactions to deviations from targets may

       Qualitatively, our results for GDP growth are in line with findings by Brunner (1997), who
estimated three nonlinear models for real gross national product. Based on a sample from 1947
to 1990 the author obtained strong evidence of countercyclical volatility, that is, recessions are
periods of high volatility. Moreover, Brunner (1997) detects nonlinear conditional mean dynamics:
According to the impulse responses, the effects of a negative shock accumulate faster than those of a
positive shock, in line with our findings. Similarly, McKay and Reis (2008) find that the brevity and
violence of contractions and expansions are about equal in a sample that encompasses our longest
sample, once again in line with our results.

depend on the sign of the deviation. This can happen, for example, if the Federal
Reserve is risk averse and wants to avoid recessions: When GDP growth falls, the
central bank is willing to cut the policy rate quickly, but when GDP growth starts to
improve, it is reluctant to increase the policy rate immediately. Second, the variables
that the Federal Reserve tracks may have asymmetries themselves. Given our finding
that φ2 < 0 for GDP in this sample, the second explanation is certainly reasonable.
There is some evidence for the first explanation as well. For example, Dolado, Maria-
Dolores, and Ruge-Murcia (2004) and Cukierman and Muscatelli (2008) estimate
a nonlinear Taylor rule using GMM and find that U.S. monetary policy is better
characterized by a nonlinear policy rule after 1983, especially with respect to the
reaction to output gap deviations.

    To sum up, the estimation of QAR(1,1) models provides evidence of interesting
and substantial nonlinearities in the U.S. macroeconomic time series. For the two
samples that start in 1960 and extend beyond the 1990s the nonlinearities are re-

flected in the run-up in inflation in the 1970s, with spillovers to nominal wage growth
and the federal funds rate. In the shorter post-1983 samples, there are two important
nonlinearities: the asymmetries in GDP growth, which are particularly pronounced
if the 2008-09 recession is included in the sample, and the federal funds rate. In the
remainder of this paper we examine whether a DSGE model with asymmetric adjust-
ment costs for prices and wages can possibly generate the nonlinearities documented
in this section.



5     A DSGE Model with Asymmetric Price and Wage
      Adjustment Costs

By now there exists a large empirical literature on the estimation of New Keyne-
sian DSGE models, including small-scale models such as the one studied in Lubik
and Schorfheide (2004) and Rabanal and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2005), as well as variants
of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model. It turns out that, in the absence of zero-
lower-bound constraints on nominal interest rates, high degrees of risk aversion, large
shocks, or exogenous nonlinearities such as stochastic volatility, these models do not
generate strong nonlinearities, in the sense that first-order and higher-order perturba-
tion approximations deliver very similar decision rules. In order to generate stronger
nonlinearities that can be captured in higher-order perturbation approximations, we
consider a model with potentially asymmetric price and wage adjustment costs that
builds on that of Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009).

    The model economy consists of a final good producing firm, a continuum of in-
termediate goods producing firms, a representative household, and a monetary and
a fiscal authority. The model replaces Rotemberg-style quadratic adjustment cost
functions by linex adjustment cost functions, which can capture downward (as well
as upward) nominal price and wage rigidities. Our model abstracts from capital
accumulation. In the subsequent empirical analysis we examine whether the asym-
                                                                                          26


metric adjustment costs can generate the observed nonlinearities in inflation and wage
growth and whether the effects of asymmetric adjustment costs translate into nonlin-
earities in GDP growth and the federal funds rate. In a nutshell, asymmetric price
adjustments should lead to asymmetric quantity adjustments. To the extent that
the central bank sets interest rates in response to inflation and output movements,
nonlinearities in the target variables may translate into nonlinearities in the interest
rate itself.

Final Good Production. The perfectly competitive, representative, final good
producing firm combines a continuum of intermediate goods indexed by j ∈ [0, 1]
using the technology

Here, 1/λp,t > 1 represents the elasticity of demand for each intermediate good. The
firm takes input prices Pt (j) and output prices Pt as given. Profit maximization
implies that the demand for intermediate goods is

Intermediate Goods. Intermediate good j is produced by a monopolist who has
access to the following production technology:

                                     Yt (j) = At Ht (j),                                 (22)

where At is an exogenous productivity process that is common to all firms. Interme-
diate goods producers buy labor services Ht (j) at a nominal price of Wt . Moreover,
they face nominal rigidities in terms of price adjustment costs. These adjustment
costs, expressed as a fraction of the firm’s revenues, are defined by the linex function
                                                                   

where we let x = Pt (j)/Pt−1 (j) and π is the steady-state inflation rate associated with
the final good. The parameter φp governs the overall degree of price stickiness, and
ψp controls the asymmetry of the adjustment costs. Taking as given nominal wages,
final goods prices, the demand schedule for intermediate products, and technological
constraints, firm j chooses its labor inputs Ht (j) and the price Pt (j) to maximize the
present value of future profits:

Here, Qt+s|t is the time t value of a unit of the consumption good in period t + s to
the household, which is treated as exogenous by the firm.

Labor Packers. Labor services used by intermediate goods producers are supplied
by a perfectly competitive labor packer. The labor packer aggregates the imperfectly
substitutable labor services of households according to the following technology:
                                             Z       1                          1−λ1 w

                                     Ht =                 Ht (k)           dk              .   (25)
                                                  0

The labor packer chooses demand for each type of labor in order to maximize his
profits, taking as given input prices Wt (k) and output prices Wt . Optimal labor
demand is then given by
                                                                      − λ1

                                                               Wt
Perfect competition implies that labor cost Wt and nominal wages paid to workers
are related as follows:

Households. Each household consists of a continuum of family members indexed
by k. The family members provide perfect insurance to each other, which equates
their marginal utility in each state of the world. A household member of type k
derives utility from consumption Ct (k) relative to a habit stock. We assume that the
habit stock is given by the level of technology At . This assumption ensures that the
                                                                                      28


economy evolves along a balanced growth path even if the utility function is additively
separable in consumption, real money balances, and leisure. The household member
derives disutility from hours worked Ht (k) and maximizes

where β is the discount factor, 1/τ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, and
χH is a scale factor that determines the steady-state hours worked. Moreover, ν is
the Frisch labor supply elasticity.

   The household member is a monopolist in the supply of labor services. As a
monopolist, he chooses the nominal wage and labor, taking as given the demand
from the labor packer. We assume that labor market frictions induce a cost in the
adjustment of nominal wages. Adjustment costs are paid as a fraction of labor income
and they have the same linex structure assumed for prices:
                                                                

where x = Wt (k)/Wt−1 (k), γπ is the growth rate of nominal wages, and γ is the
average growth rate of technology defined below. In addition to his labor choices,
the household member faces a standard consumption/saving trade-off. He has access
to a domestic bond market where nominal government bonds Bt (k) are traded that
pay (gross) interest Rt . Furthermore, he receives aggregate residual real profits Dt (k)
from the firms and has to pay lump-sum taxes Tt . Thus, the household’s budget
constraint is of the form

                              Wt−1 (k)
where SCt (k) is the net cash inflow that household k receives from trading a full set
of state-contingent securities. We denote the Lagrange multiplier associated with the
budget constraint by λt . The usual transversality condition on asset accumulation
applies, which rules out Ponzi schemes.

Monetary and Fiscal Policies. Monetary policy is described by an interest rate
feedback rule of the form
                                  Rt = Rt∗ 1−ρR Rt−1

where R,t is a monetary policy shock and Rt∗ is the (nominal) target rate. Our
specification of Rt∗ implies that the central bank reacts to inflation and deviations of
output growth from its equilibrium steady state γ:

Here, r is the steady-state real interest rate, πt is the gross inflation rate defined
as πt = Pt /Pt−1 , and π ∗ is the target inflation rate, which in equilibrium coincides
with the steady-state inflation rate. The fiscal authority consumes a fraction ζt of
aggregate output Yt , where ζt ∈ [0, 1] follows an exogenous process. The government
levies a lump-sum tax (subsidy) to finance any shortfalls in government revenues (or
to rebate any surplus).

   The model economy is perturbed by four exogenous processes. Aggregate produc-
tivity evolves according to

           ln At = ln γ + ln At−1 + ln zt ,     where     ln zt = ρz ln zt−1 + z,t .   (32)

Thus, on average, technology grows at the rate γ, and zt captures exogenous fluctu-
ations of the technology growth rate. Define gt = 1/(1 − ζt ). We assume that

                          ln gt = (1 − ρg ) ln g + ρg ln gt−1 + g,t .                  (33)

The inverse-demand elasticity for intermediate goods evolves according to a first-order
autoregressive processes in logs:

                      ln λp,t = (1 − ρp ) ln λp + ρp ln λp,t−1 + p,t .                 (34)

Finally, the monetary policy shock R,t is assumed to be serially uncorrelated. The
five innovations are independent of each other at all leads and lags and are normally
distributed with mean zero and standard deviations σz , σg , σp , and σR , respectively.

6     Estimation and Evaluation of the DSGE Model

The estimation and evaluation of the DSGE model proceeds in three steps. In Sec-
tion 6.1, the DSGE model is estimated for two samples: 1960-2007 and 1984-2007,
using the same series that were studied in Section 4. In Section 6.2, we use posterior
predictive checks that are based on posterior mean estimates of QAR(1,1) parame-
ters to assess whether the nonlinearities captured in the second-order approximated
DSGE model are commensurate with the nonlinearities captured by the QAR(1,1)
model. Finally, in Section 6.3 we assess the effect of adjustment cost asymmetries on
the model’s ability to generate nonlinear inflation and wage growth dynamics.


6.1    DSGE Model Estimation on U.S. Data

The second step in the empirical analysis consists of estimating the DSGE model
based on the same data used to estimate the QAR(1,1) models in Section 4. The
marginal prior distributions for the DSGE model parameters are summarized in Ta-
ble 2. We use pre-sample evidence to quantify a priori beliefs about the average
growth rate of the economy, as well as average inflation and real interest rates. We
use the same priors for both samples. The prior mean for τ implies a risk-aversion
coefficient of 2. Our prior for the Frisch labor supply elasticity covers some of the low
values estimated in the microeconometrics literature, as well as a value of 2 advocated
in the real-business-cycle literature based on steady-state considerations. The prior
for the price-adjustment-cost parameter ϕp is specified indirectly through a prior for
the slope κ(ϕp ) of the New Keynesian Phillips curve. This prior encompasses values
that imply an essentially flat as well as a fairly steep Phillips curve. The prior for
the wage rigidity is directly specified on ϕw and spans values ranging from 0 to 30.
The priors for the asymmetry parameters ψp and ψw are centered at zero (symmetric
adjustment costs) and have a large variance, meaning that the asymmetries could po-
tentially be strong. We do not restrict the signs of ψp and ψw , i.e., we allow a priori
for both downward and upward price and wage rigidities. The priors for the monetary

policy rule coefficients are centered at 1.5 (reaction to inflation), 0.2 (output growth),
and 0.5 (interest rate smoothing). Finally, we use priors for the parameters associated
with the exogenous shock processes, then generate a priori reasonable magnitudes for
the persistence and volatility of the observables.

    The DSGE model presented in Section 5 is solved using a second-order approx-
imation, which leads to a nonlinear state-space representation. We use the particle
filter developed in Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2007) to evaluate the
likelihood function of the DSGE model. To facilitate the likelihood evaluation with

the particle filter, the measurement equation contains mean-zero iid Gaussian mea-
surement errors. The measurement error variances are set equal to 10% of the sample
variances of GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and nominal wage growth. Poste-
rior inference is implemented with a single-block RWM algorithm, described in detail
in An and Schorfheide (2007). Theoretical convergence properties of so-called particle
MCMC approaches are established in Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein (2010).

   Posterior summary statistics for the DSGE model parameters are reported in
Table 3. The most interesting and important estimates are those of the asymmetry
parameters in the price and wage adjustment cost function. The wage and price
                                                                                              33


rigidity estimates differ substantially across subsamples. For instance, the estimated
slope of the New Keynesian Phillips curve is 0.02 for the 1960-2007 sample, whereas
it increases to 0.2 for the post-1983 sample. Likewise, the estimated wage rigidity
is larger over the long sample. The positive estimates of ψp and ψw imply that it is
more expensive to lower prices and wages than to raise them and that the asymmetry
in prices is more pronounced than in wages. The asymmetry of the adjustment costs
is more pronounced for prices (ψ̂p equals 150 and 165, respectively) than for wages
(ψ̂w equals 67 and 59, respectively).

    Compared to the estimates reported by Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009) and Abbritti
and Fahr (2013), who report estimates of ψ̂w = 3, 844 and ψ̂w = 24, 700, respectively,
our estimates of the ψw ’s are considerably smaller.9 In our experience, such large
values of ψw lead to a clear deterioration of the model’s ability to track U.S. data.
Moreover, the second-order solution of the DSGE model relies on a third-order ap-
proximation of the linex cost function that becomes very inaccurate for large values
of ψ. In particular, we found that for values of ψw above 500 the adjustment costs
for large positive wage changes (that lie in the support of the ergodic distribution)
would become negative due to the polynomial approximation of the linex function.

    We estimate the risk-aversion parameter τ to be fairly large, around 4, and the
Frisch labor supply elasticity to be fairly low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4. The estimates of
ν are in line with those reported in Rı́os-Rull, Schorfheide, Fuentes-Albero, Kryshko,
and Santaeulalia-Llopis (2012). The policy rule coefficient estimates are similar to the
ones reported elsewhere in the DSGE model literature. The coefficient ψ1 on inflation

       Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009) estimated their DSGE model simulated method of moments
(SMM). While they also used consumption and hours-worked data in their estimation, the SMM
objective function includes only second moments. The authors find that the covariance of consump-
tion and hours worked, respectively, with wage growth playing a crucial role in their estimation.
Abbritti and Fahr (2013) use a calibration approach to parameterize their model. Given their pre-
ferred calibration of the exogenous technology, discount factor, and monetary policy shocks, they
find that a very large value of ψw is needed to match the volatility and skewness of wage growth
observed in the data.
                                                                                     34


is larger for the post-1983 sample, which is consistent with the view that following the
Volcker disinflation the Federal Reserve has responded more aggressively to inflation
movements. The government spending shock, which should be viewed as a generic
demand shock, is the most persistent among the serially correlated exogenous shocks:
ρg is approximately 0.95. The estimated autocorrelation ρz of technology growth
shock, which generates most of the serial correlation in output growth rates, drops
from 0.48 for the long sample to 0.07 for the post-1983 sample.



6.2    Posterior Predictive Checks

We proceed by examining whether QAR(1,1) parameter estimates obtained from
data that are simulated from the estimated DSGE model are similar to the esti-
mates reported in Section 4 computed from actual data. This comparison is for-
malized through a posterior predictive check. The role of posterior predictive checks
in Bayesian analysis is discussed in the textbooks by Lancaster (2004) and Geweke
(2005) and reviewed in the context of the evaluation of DSGE models in Del Ne-
gro and Schorfheide (2011). The posterior predictive check is implemented with the
following algorithm.

Posterior Predictive Check. Let θ(i) denote the i’th draw from the posterior
distribution of the DSGE model parameter θ.

       (i) Conditional on θ(i) simulate a pre-sample of length T0 and an estimation
           sample of size T from the DSGE model. The second-order approximated
           DSGE model is simulated using the pruning algorithm described in Kim,
           Kim, Schaumburg, and Sims (2008). A Gaussian iid measurement error is
           added to the simulated data. The measurement error variance is identical
           to the one imposed during the estimation of the DSGE model. Denote the

      dictive distribution of S|Y−T0 +1:T . Examine how far the actual value S(Y1:T ),
      computed from U.S. data, lies in the tail of its predictive distribution. 

   The predictive check is carried out for each QAR(1,1) parameter estimate sepa-
rately. The results are summarized in Figure 8. The top panel corresponds to the
1960-2007 sample, whereas the bottom panel contains the results from the 1984-2007
sample. The red dots signify the posterior median estimates obtained from U.S. data
and correspond to the horizontal bars in Figure 1. The blue rectangles delimit the
90% credible intervals associated with the posterior predictive distributions, and the
solid horizontal bars indicate the medians of the predictive distributions. The length
of the credible intervals reflects both parameter uncertainty, i.e., the fact that each
             (i)
trajectory Y−T0 +1:T is generated from a different parameter draw θ(i) , and sampling
uncertainty, meaning that if one were to hold the parameters θ fixed, the variabil-
ity in the simulated finite-sample trajectories generates variability in posterior mean
estimates. Because the posterior variance of the DSGE model parameters is fairly
small, these intervals mostly capture sampling variability. Accordingly, they tend to
be larger in the bottom panel (short sample) than in the top panel (long sample).

   By and large, the QAR parameter estimates for output growth, wage growth, and
inflation from model-generated data are very similar to those obtained from actual
data, in the sense that most actual estimates do not fall far in the tails of their respec-
tive posterior predictive distributions. Only interest rates exhibit large discrepancies
between actual and model-implied estimates of the QAR(1,1) parameters.

   Overall, the estimated DSGE model does not generate very strong nonlinearities.
Posterior predictive distributions for φ̂2 and γ̂ typically cover both positive and nega-

tive values. The only exceptions are the predictive distributions for wage growth and
inflation γ̂ conditional on the 1960-2007 sample, which imply that γ̂ is positive. Recall
from Table 3 that, for this sample, we estimate sizable adjustment costs (κ̂ = 0.02 and
                                                                                     37


ϕ̂w = 18.7). Moreover, the asymmetry parameter estimates are substantially larger
than zero: ψ̂p = 150 and ψ̂w = 67.4. The model-implied positive estimates of γ imply
that high inflation and wage-growth rates are associated with high levels of volatility,
which describes the experience of the U.S. economy in the 1970s and early 1980s.
However, the nonlinear inflation and wage dynamics do not generate any spillovers
to nonlinearities in GDP growth or the interest rate. Figure 8 indicates that the
predictive distributions for the corresponding φ̂2 and γ̂ are centered at zero. For the
1984-2007 sample the overall magnitude of the estimated adjustment costs is smaller,
which flattens the adjustment cost functions, makes the asymmetries less important
for equilibrium dynamics, and shifts the predictive distribution for the inflation and
wage growth γ̂’s toward zero.

   Two types of nonlinearities present in the data are not predicted by the estimated
DSGE model. First, for the short sample φ̂2 for GDP growth is negative, because the
post-1983 sample exhibits a pronounced drop in output growth during the recessions
but does not feature positive growth rates of similar magnitudes in early parts of
expansions. Second, the interest rate exhibits strong nonlinearities in the data, i.e.,
a large positive γ̂ in the 1960-2007 sample and a large negative φ̂2 in the 1984-2007
sample, which the DSGE model is unable to reproduce.

   To sum up, of the nonlinearities we identified in Section 4, the only ones the
DSGE model seems able to deliver are the conditional heteroskedasticity in inflation
and nominal wage growth. It is able to do so by relying on the asymmetric adjustment
costs that penalize downward adjustments more than upward adjustments. However,
while ex-ante reasonable, these asymmetries in prices do not spill over to quantities.
Moreover, since the interest rate feedback rule in the model does not feature any
asymmetries, which would result from the central bank having an asymmetric loss
function, and since there are no asymmetries in GDP growth in the model, the policy
instrument does not display the asymmetry we identified in the data.

6.3    The Role of Asymmetric Adjustment Costs

To further study the role of asymmetric adjustment costs in generating nonlinear
wage and inflation dynamics, we repeat the predictive checks based on φ̂2 and γ̂
for alternative choices of ψp and ψw . We focus on the 1960-2007 sample because the
nonlinearities are more pronounced there than in the post-1983 sample. For each draw
                                                                                        (i)
θ(i) from the posterior distribution of the DSGE model parameters, we replace ψp
      (i)
and ψw with alternative values ψ̄p and ψ̄w . In particular, we consider an elimination
of the asymmetries, i.e., ψ̄p = ψ̄w = 0 and an increase to ψ̄p = ψ̄w = 300. The
results are plotted in Figure 9. A decrease of the asymmetry in the adjustment costs
moves the predictive distributions of φ̂2 and γ̂ toward zero, whereas an increase shifts
them further away from zero. Relative to the overall width of the predictive intervals
the location shifts are fairly small. This highlights that a precise measurement of
nonlinearities is very difficult using quarterly observations.

   For nominal wage growth, the increase in the asymmetry parameters essentially
eliminates the gap between the median of the posterior predictive distributions for
φ̂2 and γ̂ and the estimates obtained from actual data, which are -0.05 and 0.14, re-
spectively. For inflation, the medians of the predictive distributions for φ̂2 and γ̂ shift
slightly upward, toward 0.05 and 0.06, respectively. This implies that the actual value
of φ̂2 lies further in the tail of the predictive distribution if ψw is increased, whereas
the actual value of γ̂ is less far in the tails. While an increase of ψw improves the
outcome of the predictive check constructed from the QAR parameter estimates for
nominal wage growth, if judged from the overall posterior distribution, the increased
asymmetries lead to a deterioration of fit in other dimensions of the model, which is
why the posterior estimates for ψp and ψw are only about 150 and 68, respectively.

7     Conclusion

Building on the specification of generalized autoregressive models, bilinear models,
and LARCH models, this paper uses a perturbation approximation of a nonlinear
difference equation to obtain a new class of nonlinear time-series models that can be
used to assess nonlinear DSGE models. We use these univariate QAR(1,1) models
to identify nonlinearities in the U.S. data and to construct predictive checks to as-
sess a DSGE models ability to capture nonlinearities that are present in the data.
The QAR(1,1) estimates obtained from U.S. data highlight nonlinearities in output
growth, inflation, nominal wage growth, and interest rate dynamics. Output growth
displays sharp declines and slow recoveries in the post-1983 sample. Inflation and
nominal wage growth both display conditional heteroskedasticity in the 1960-2007
sample. Finally, downward adjustments in the federal funds rate seem to be easier
than upward adjustments in the post-1983 sample.
                                                                                     40


   Among the nonlinearities identified through estimation of the QAR models, the
only ones our estimated DSGE model seems able to capture are the conditional het-
eroskedasticity in inflation and nominal wage growth. The model does so by relying
on the asymmetric adjustment costs that penalize downward adjustments more than
upward adjustments. The model is not able to generate the apparent nonlinearities
in output growth and the federal funds rate.

   The tools developed in this paper can be used to identify nonlinearities in any time
series: Doing this for other key series, such as labor market variables in the U.S., and
for key variables in other countries will be a useful exercise. The predictive checks
simply require a simulation from the model and can be applied to any model, whether
or not it is estimated, and should be a part of the toolbox for researchers working
with DSGE models. Finally, we leave to future research multivariate extensions of
the QAR model, where the main challenge is to cope with the dimensionality of the
model.
