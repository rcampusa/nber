                                           ABSTRACT

The purpose of this article is to study the effect of education on labor market participation and
household consumption in a rural environment. The Tanzanian Universal Primary Education
(UPE) program, which provides variations in education across locations and over time, is used as
a natural experiment. Exploiting these two exogenous variations to instrument education, I find
that education increases household consumption, especially in agriculture and in nonfarm self-
employment activities. I also provide evidence that education increases the probability of working
in agriculture. These results, initially surprising, suggest that returns to education in agriculture
are positive, provided that the skills taught at school are suitable for agriculture.

1     Introduction
Education is a cornerstone for economic growth; it eradicates poverty and counters the
transmission of inequalities between generations. Given its importance, policy-makers put
education at the top of their agenda. More specifically, several governments of developing
countries have implemented policies to universalize primary education. These programs
turned out to be useful in increasing the access to education, but not necessarily in
improving the quality of education. A remaining challenge is to define policies that
increase the level of education and insure high returns to education in a rural environment.
    However, estimating the returns to education in a rural environment is not straight-
forward for two reasons. First, education is likely to be endogenous, which prevents
obtaining unbiased estimates. Card (2001) reviews papers that aim to identify the causal
impact of education on earnings. Among the eleven papers included in the survey, only
two authors focus on developing countries: Duflo (2001), who instruments education
by a school construction program in Indonesia, and Maluccio (1998), who instruments
education by the distance to school in the rural Philippines.
    However, both authors restrict their analysis to wage earners, which might affect the
representativeness of the samples since wage-earning individuals are likely to be self-
selected and to have specific characteristics. Maluccio (1998) does not deal with this
sample selection issue, but Duflo (2001) adopts an imputation technique to compute a
wage for individuals from the self-employment sector. While this method is suitable for
countries with a developed formal sector, it is less adapted to countries that are mainly
agriculture-based and where few individuals are wage earners.
    Another strand of the literature estimates the returns to education among agricultural
households by considering the agricultural production. Lockheed et al. (1980) review
papers estimating the impact of education on agricultural production and find very mixed
results depending on the country and the specification of education. However, these
papers do not consider the endogeneity of education of the household head.
    Using the Universal Primary Education (UPE) program implemented in Tanzania
from 1974 to 1978 as a natural experiment, this paper contributes to this existing litera-
ture by investigating the benefits of education not only for wage-workers but also for the
entire population.
    Since developing countries are often characterized by the large size of both the nona-

                                             2
gricultural self-employed sector and the agricultural sector, I construct a consumption
aggregate to extend the analysis to all sample households. To account for the potential
endogeneity of education, I instrument education of the household head by the exposure
to the massive UPE program. In 1974, before the implementation of the UPE program,
educational levels were low at the national level, with wide variation across regions. To
reduce disparities in access to education, the Tanzanian socialist government gave pri-
ority to deprived areas, which led the latter to experience higher schooling expansion.
The results of the strict enforcement of the UPE program were substantial: 3.3 million
children aged 7 to 13 were enrolled in 1980, compared to 1.2 million in 1974 (Bonini,
2003). Thus, the UPE program provides an exogenous variation in education that I use
to instrument education and to determine the effect of education on consumption. As
returns to education might vary over sectors, I also distinguish the effect for subgroups:
the agricultural sector, the nonfarm self-employed sector, and wage-work activities.
   The second contribution of this paper is to address the effect of education on the
labor market participation, more precisely, on the choice of the sector of activity. Indeed,
education might not only increase earnings but also provide access to better paid activities
and ease mobility between sectors. To address the endogeneity of education, I adopt the
same identification strategy, and I instrument education by exploiting the exposure to
the UPE program.
   The main findings of this paper suggest that the UPE program reduced inequalities
of access to education and that returns to education are positive in every sector. Coun-
terintuitively, they are especially high in agriculture. I justify this finding by the design
of the program, which was directed toward agriculture by providing a specific curricu-
lum with agricultural classes. In this specific environment, this paper also demonstrates
that education decreases the probability of working in nonfarm self-employed activities
in favor of farm activities.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a broad picture
of the Tanzanian context and describes the data and the main variables of the analysis.
Section 3 introduces the estimation strategy, and the effect of of the UPE program on
education. Section 4 presents the main results. Finally, section 5 discuss the robustness
of the results and section 6 concludes.

2       The program and the data

2.1     Data sets

This study uses three data sources: a census data set, a household panel survey, and ad-
ministrative data. First, the census data are a 10 percent IPUMS sample from the 2002
Population and Housing Census in Tanzania. These exhaustive data, collected by the Na-
tional Bureau of Statistics (NBS), are representative at the district level and contain basic
information on dwelling characteristics, individual demographics and socioeconomics for
500,519 households. To complete the analysis and provide an accurate measure of house-
holds’ consumption, I combine the LSMS-ISA (LSMS-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture)
data and a household panel survey collected by the World Bank in 2008-2009, 2010-2011
and 2012-2013.1 The LSMS-ISA data include 3265 households in 2008, 3924 households
in 2010 and 5015 households in 2012.2 This dataset gives detailed information on labor
activities, on household consumption, and on other individual characteristics. Despite
a district reorganization between the dates of the two datasets, both datasets cover the
26 Tanzanian regions. Finally, I use administrative data collected by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Development Planning that are recorded in Jensen et al. (1968).
These data comprise information on the distribution of primary schools and on GDP3 by
regions for mainland Tanzania in 1967, just before the introduction of the UPE program.
These data are particularly interesting for investigating the effect of the UPE program
because they constitute, to the best of my knowledge, the only source of information on
primary school provision in Tanzania at this time.4


2.2     Historical background and the UPE program

When colonization ended in 1961, access to education in Tanzania was very unequal
between regions (Court and Kinyanjui, 1980).5 At this time, the purpose of primary
    1
     From October 2008 to December 2009 for the first wave, from October 2010 to December 2011 for
the second wave, and from October 2013 to December 2013 for the third wave.
   2
     The number of households is increasing over the three waves due to the high number of split-off
households and to the low attrition rate that does not exceed 5 % over the three rounds.
   3
     GDP records are divided into subactivities, such as crops, livestock, mining, manufacturing, con-
struction, public utilities, transport, rent, and other services.
   4
     The National Bureau of Statistics gives access to the number of schools by region only from 2002.
   5
     These spatial disparities were based on ecological endowments and were exacerbated by colonial
activities and transport networks. The most privileged zones were the Arusha-Kilimanjaro-Tanga and
Mwanza-Shinyanga corridors, as well as the Coast Morogoro-Kigoma (Maro and Mlay, 1979).


                                                  4
education was to prepare for secondary education and to encourage a small number of
rural students to find white-collar jobs in urban areas (Kinunda, 1975). To mark a radical
change with this elitist system, Prime Minister Nyerere, who came to power in 1964, fully
redesigned the education system. With the Education for Self-Reliance (ESR) policy,
approved in 1967, education became the mainstay of the Tanzanian socialist economy
that would ensure economic growth. The aim of this policy was threefold: i) to improve
the equity of access to education, ii) to teach agricultural skills that would be relevant
in a rural society, and iii) to offer a political and civic education (Nyerere, 1967). This
policy was supposed to lead to radical changes, but in practice, enforcement was slow.
It was only in 1974 that the government committed itself to reach Universal Primary
Education (UPE) with a forced march by 1978.
      To achieve these goals, the Tanzanian government invested massively in primary ed-
ucation. Local resources and existing infrastructures were mobilized for classrooms, and
a large number of schools were built. To provide access to schools in remote rural areas,
the government proceeded to a villagization process, which consisted of gathering people
in community villages commonly called ujamaa. This villagization started in 1968 on a
voluntary basis, but from 1974, households living in remote areas were forced to move.
As a result, more than 10 million people were moved, and 2,650 ujamaa were built from
1974 to 1977 (see Table 1). Although the distance to their prior dwelling was often less
than five kilometers, villagization greatly reduced distances to schools.
      To attain agriculture self-sufficiency defined as one of the main priorities: «kilimo cha
kufa na kupona», Agriculture for Life and Dealth(Nyerere, 1967), agricultural classes were
introduced in the curriculum. These classes were not necessarily taught by traditional
teachers but also by farmers, who shared their experiences and their technical skills
(Gillette, 1975). By the end of the reform, almost every school had access to a field in
which children worked and experimented new harvest methods.
      In addition, the starting age was postponed from 5 to 7 years old, and the examination
in the middle of the primary cycle was removed. Consequently, pupils leaving the primary
schools would be old enough and would have acquired the abilities to work in the fields.
To accompany these changes and encourage people to start working after primary school,
access to the secondary cycle was drastically limited by regional quotas (Martin, 1988).6
  6
      Despite this policy, no significant drop in the secondary enrollment rate is observed.

   The government also made additional adjustments to improve schools’ attractiveness.
Tuition fees were eliminated, primary education became mandatory, and Swahili, most
pupils’ mother tongue, was designated as the language of instruction.
   In terms of the education attainment, the results of this UPE program were con-
siderable: from 1974 to 1978, the percentage of enrolled children aged 7 to 13 increased
from 43.1 to 90.4 percent, and disparities among regions were drastically reduced (Bonini,
2003).


2.3      Measuring intensity of the UPE program

The UPE program was applied during a limited time frame and targeted areas with poor
access to education. Hence, exposure to the program is expected to vary across locations
and over time.


2.3.1    Over time

Since the official exit age to primary education was 13, individuals older than 13 years old
at the beginning of the program (in 1974) should not have been affected by the program.
However, several pilot programs were implemented in some regions from 1968. Thus, I
define a pretreatment group T0 to be household heads not affected by the UPE reform,
consisting of individuals who were 13 or were older than 13 in 1967 (born between 1945
and 1954), and I distinguish Tpt , the group that consists of household heads who were


                                             6
likely to be partially treated by the UPE program (born between 1945 and 1960). Then,
I define Ttot , the treatment group, to include all children who should have been affected
by the program. Restricting the data to the pretreatment cohort T0 (individuals born
between 1945 and 1954) and to the treatment cohort Ttot (individuals born between 1961
and 1978), I obtain from the census data two samples composed of 111, 818 and 388,701
individuals.

2.3.2      Across location

Since the program aimed at improving equity of access to education, the intensity should
be a decreasing function of the schooling supply captured by Nj,67 , the number of primary
schools per square kilometer by region of birth j. Zanzibar West, which experienced
no increase in years of schooling between 1967 and the end of the program in 1978, is
considered as untreated, and I define the intensity index as:


                                     Ij,67 = (NZanzibar W est,67 − Nj,67 )


When Nj,67 is close to the schooling supply in Zanzibar West, the intensity of the treat-
ment is expected to be small. Inversely, when Nj,67 is small, the intensity of the treatment
is expected to be high.
       As a robustness check, I provide another intensity index constructed from the educa-
                                          0
tion attainment by district of residence Id,67 = (SZanzibar W est,67 − Sd,67 ). Although this
index is likely to be less exogenous,7 it is available at a lower geographical level.8
       Figure 1a and 1b depict the education level before and after the introduction of the
UPE program and confirm two predictions. The education attainment has been increased,
   7
     It reflects the demand for education, and it is computed at the place of residence, which can be the
result from endogenous migration decisions.
   8
     All the results based on this intensity index can be found in the appendix.



                                                      7
and the education gap across location has been narrowed between these two periods.9
Figure 1c, which illustrates the school distribution, shows that the schooling supply was
also very unequal between regions in 1967 and that the supply of schools was correlated
with the education attainment at this time.




  9
    In 1967, Zanzibar West and Kilimanjaro had already reached the maximum years of primary educa-
tion, while the average education level in other regions had not exceeded two years of education.

2.3.3      Measuring household consumption

As the purpose of this article is to estimate the returns to education, it is necessary to
first describe how the households’ wealth is measured.
       Usually, living standards are measured either by income or by consumption. In de-
veloping countries where agriculture is widespread, incomes are very sensitive to current
shocks and may not be representative of household well-being (Meyer and Sullivan, 2003),
while consumption can be smooth through formal or informal mechanisms. In this re-
spect, consumption has the advantage of being more representative of long-run well-being.
The second interest of using consumption stems from the fact that income is not simi-
larly measured between activities,10 which calls into question the reliability of comparison
between sectors. Last, but not least, consumption is available for all households, which
allows avoiding selection and imputation issues. Thus, these features advocate the use of
consumption rather than income data in developing countries.
       Deaton and Zaidi (2002) propose guidelines to construct a consumption variable from
rich household survey data.11 The Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) data
are particularly well suited for constructing the consumption index since they collect
exhaustive information on consumption expenditures. However, the serious limitation of
the Deaton and Zaidi (2002) method is that such accurate data are costly to collect and
are often not included in large datasets, such as the 2002 Tanzanian census.
       Thus, to take advantage of the large sample size of the census data and obtain a
monetary value of consumption that eases comparison with the literature (Duflo (2001),
Maluccio (1998)), I follow the method developed by Elbers et al. (2003) and Tarozzi and
Deaton (2009) from census data and household survey matching to construct a consump-
tion proxy (see appendix A.1 for more details).


2.3.4      Descriptive statistics

Table 3 reports descriptive statistics from the 2002 census for the whole sample and
for the subgroups of interest: the pretreatment T0 (old cohort), the treatment group
  10
    Self-employment income is rarely a wage, and agricultural income is measured through production.
  11
    They consist of defining a weighted per capita consumption variable composed of four components:
food items, nonfood items, housing consumption and consumption from consumer durables. To adjust
household consumption for variation in household composition, the consumption variable is divided by
an equivalence scale made from the household’s size: every adult represents one unit of consumption,
and each child represents 0.3 units.

             that the majority of households are head by men and live in rural areas, although the
             prevalence of rural households decreases overtime. A significant share of household heads
             has validated less than five years of education, meaning that some of them did not finish
             the primary education cycle. However, the comparison of the young and the old cohorts
             informs that the education level has been rising: the number of years has increased by
             65%, and the percentage of households’ heads who ended the primary education cycle has


                                                                         11
more than doubled. Further, I examine whether “regions +” and “regions -” significantly
differ and have characteristics that could explain different trends. The data highlight
that regions with a low initial education level are more rural, more agricultural intensive
and are poorer. These results are not surprising since the density of schools in rural areas
is expected to be lower.
    Table A2 assimilates similar descriptive statistics, but from the LSMS panel data.
Overall, the statistics confirm what was described above, and inform that a nonnegligible
share of households diversify their sources of income by cumulating different activities.
    Although education has been increasing between age cohorts, it does not imply that
the UPE program had a causal effect on the education expansion. The following section
presents the identification strategy that I adopt to estimate the effect of the UPE program
and to measure the returns to education.



3     Empirical strategy

3.1    Identification strategy

The instrumental variable approach that I use exploits the exposure to the UPE program.
This assumes that being exposed to the program increases the probability of being enrolled
in school but is orthogonal to unobserved household characteristics that determine labor
market outcomes. To capture exposure to the UPE program, I adopt a difference-in-
differences strategy based on variations in time and in space. It consists of comparing
pretreatment cohorts (T = 0) with treated cohorts (T = 1) for whom the intensity of the
program varied across areas and instrumenting education by the interaction term T ∗Ij,67 ,
which captures the UPE program’s exposure.
    This variable is a valid instrument (IV) if two conditions are satisfied: i) the IV is
correlated with education, and ii) the IV explains the outcome of interest only through
education. In such cases, IV estimates correspond to the local average treatment effect
(LATE). Otherwise, IV estimates give inconsistent and biased results. Since the inter-
pretation of IV estimates relies on the quality of the instrument, I now discuss whether
the interaction term T ∗ Ij,67 is a valid instrument.
    The IV variable is a relevant candidate if it is highly correlated with the endogenous
variable. To check whether the instrument explains the education expansion, I plot in

                                            12
figure A2 the education increase between the pretreatment and the treatment cohorts as
a function of Nj,67 , the number of schools per square kilometers in 1967.12 The correlation
between Nj,67 and the education increase shows that indeed, the UPE program was more
intense in regions with a poor schooling supply. Likewise, the same conclusion can be
drawn from figure A3, in which I depict the education increase as a function of the
educational attainment by district of residence Sd,67 . However, this relationship is not
necessarily causal. The main concern is that the education expansion is not exclusively
due to the UPE program but to other factors correlated with the instrument and the
outcome of interest. Despite the fact that the exclusion restriction could not be tested,
I try to identify all potential sources that could discredit this condition, and I provide
evidence that the instrument is exogenous.
      First, I check whether the education expansion is due to the introduction of the UPE
program and not to a convergence phenomenon. In case of convergence, less educated
regions could have had a higher education increase in order to catch up with the more
educated regions. If this were to be true, this phenomenon would be observed before and
after the introduction of the UPE program. Subsection 3.2 addresses this question and
confirms that during the pretreatment program, the education progression was not sta-
tistically different between educated and noneducated regions. In contrast, the education
expansion was statistically higher for deprived regions during the UPE program period.
      Second, the exclusion restriction can still be invalidated if other region’s characteristics
generate the same trend reversal or are correlated with the outcomes of interest. To insure
the exogeneity of the instrument, I add a set of controls. Among these control variables, I
add the number of children aged 7 to 13 to account for the possibility that the education
expansion may depend on the size of the cohort and the level of wealth, which might
influence the development of the schooling supply.13
      Furthermore, the sectoral specialization may be another source of bias if the regions
develop different sensitivities to shocks. One way to ensure the validity of the instrument
is to control for heterogeneity in order to capture variations in shocks between regions. In
this respect, I add regional GDP by sector of activity interacted with a time trend. Among
these sectors, I distinguish between the following economic activities: crops, livestock,
mining, manufacturing, construction, and activities from the tertiary sector, including
 12
      Each dot depicts a region of birth.
 13
      Wealthy regions can have higher needs in skilled labor and invest more in education.


                                                   13
public utilities, transport, rent, and other public services.
      In addition, De Chaisemartin and d Haultfoeuille (2015) highlight that IV estimates
can be far from returns to education in any location when the homogeneity assumption
does not hold. However, the authors show that difference-in-difference (DID) methods
with fuzzy treated groups14 should provide unbiased estimates without relying on any
homogeneity assumption, as long as 1) the common trend assumption is valid and 2)
there is a control group for which the treatment does not change over time. According to
the above results, these two assumptions appear to be satisfied. In this study, 2) implies
there is at least one region where education has not evolved between the pretreatment
period and the treatment period, which is precisely the case of Zanzibar West.15 This lack
of education increase may be explained by the fact that education had already reached the
maximum years of primary education in 196716 and that access to secondary education
was cut at the time of the UPE program.
      Last but not least, IV estimates are biased if the program has influenced outcomes
other than education that explain the level of consumption. Regarding the forced vil-
lagization process, this assumption is very likely to be unsatisfied. Among the possible
channels, the program could have changed the access to other social services and the
living conditions. Nonetheless, I argue that this should not call into question the va-
lidity of the instrument because both the pretreatment and the treatment cohorts were
similarly affected by these changes. Indeed, the specificity of the villagization program
is that entire families were asked to move. In contrast, the education reform that was
part of the program was beneficial only for the treatment cohorts and had no reason to
affect outcomes other than education. This key argument that supports the validity of
the instrument will be further discussed in the discussion section.
 14
    This refers to DID when the intensity of the treatment varies between treated groups.
 15
    The education level decreases by 0.1 year between 1967 and 1978, which is negligible.
 16
    Zanzibar, independent in 1964, benefited from a better access to education.

3.2     The effect of the UPE program

3.2.1   On education expansion

Since education may be endogenous, I adopt a two-stage procedure, the first stage of
which is:
                    Sijt = α + βj + βt + γT ∗ Ij,1967 + δt ∗ Xj,1967 + µijt                   (1)

βj and βt are region-of-birth fixed effects and birth-cohort fixed effects to account for
permanent differences across regions and over time, and Xj,1967 is a set of region char-
acteristics, including the log of population aged 7 to 13 and regional GDP by sectors
of activity in 1967. Each of these controls is interacted with a time variable t. T is
a dummy taking the value 0 for people belonging to the pretreatment group and 1 for
people belonging to Ttot . The coefficient of interest, γ, represents the effect of the UPE
program on education (years of schooling). The higher the intensity of the UPE program,
Ij,1967 , the larger should be the education expansion between the pretreatment and the
treatment groups.

             that the coefficient are significantly different from 0 at the level of 1%, 5%
             and 10%. Additional controls are the population aged 7 to 13 in 1967, the
             household size and the principal sector of activity of the household head.


   Table 4 reports the results of equation (1). To consider the possible serial correlation
in errors, I cluster standard errors at the regional level (Bertrand et al., 2004). I find
that when the predicted intensity Ij,1967 is raised by one additional school per square
kilometer, education increases by 0.05 between T0 and Ttot and that the introduction

                                                  15
of GDP controls marginally lower the coefficients. This result is consistent with the
idea that the UPE program targeted regions with low initial education attainment and
contributed to the equalization of access to education among regions. Columns (3) and
(4) indicate whether the UPE plan had fully reached its goal by convincing people not
only to enroll in school but also to complete primary education. Although the UPE
program was strictly implemented for a shorter period than the duration of the primary
cycle (four and seven years, respectively), the UPE program has significantly increased
the education completion.
       I also estimate a more flexible regression that allows the effect of the UPE program
to vary with the time exposure to the program:

                                     t=1945                 t=1961


In this equation, γt , captures the effect of the UPE program on education by the age
cohort, and the difference between γt and γt+1 represents the education expansion between
t and t+1 generated by the education supply in 1967.
       For the pretreatment group, Ij,67 should have no impact on education expansion and
γt values should be close to 0. In contrast, one expects the education expansion to be
an increasing function of the time exposure to the UPE program for the treated cohorts.
This is precisely what is shown in figure 2. Each dot depicts the γt coefficients of equation
                                                              0
(2), from Ij1967 at the left-hand side of the panel and from Id1967 at the right-hand side
of the panel.17 For both intensity indexes, almost all the coefficients in the pretreatment
group were not statistically different from 0, while γt coefficients steadily increased for
the treated age cohorts. Cohorts born after 1968 were still exposed, but the slope declines
afterwards. This graph confirms that the identification strategy is reasonable: the trend
was not present before the program, and the UPE program had a significant impact on
education for the treated cohorts (all coefficients are significant at the 1% level).
       Thereafter, I instrument education by relying on equation (2), but by imposing each
γt to be 0 for the pretreatment cohorts.
  17
    The reference year is the year before the introduction of the UPE program in 1967, which corresponds
to the age cohort born in 1954.

In this equation, γt identifies the effect of the UPE program by age cohort in comparison
with the preprogram period T0 . If no regional time-varying characteristics correlated
with the program’s intensity are omitted, these fuzzy difference-in-differences correctly
estimate the impact of the UPE program (results are presented in table A5).
   Although I cannot identify the compliers of the UPE program, I can still compare the
characteristics of individuals who completed and who did not complete primary educa-
tion among the treatment age cohorts. Table A3 shows that individuals who completed
primary education have a higher consumption level, are more likely to be a wage worker,
to live in urban areas, and to be a man.


3.3    On consumption

Instead of looking at the effect of education, I exploit equation (2) to estimate the reduced
form between the UPE program and the logarithm of the consumption proxy. Graphic A4
shows that the age coefficients for the pretreatment cohorts are almost never statistically
different from 0. By contrast, all the coefficients for the treated age cohorts are positive
and significant at the 1% level. Although the size of the coefficient differs, I deduce that
the effect of the UPE program on education and on consumption follows the same trend
and becomes positive and significant for treated age cohorts.

4        The results
This section presents the main results. The first subsection is devoted to the returns to
education for the entire population, and by sectors of activity. Education may also have
the benefit of increasing the probability to work in sectors that are better paid. Then,
subsection 4.2 investigates whether education changes the labor distribution between the
sectors of activity.


4.1       The returns to education

4.1.1      For the entire population

I measure the returns to education by looking at the effect of education Sijt of household
head i born in region j at year t on current consumption Cijt . The main equation is:


                         Log(Cijt ) = α + βj + βt + θSijt + δt Xj + εijt                         (4)


where βj and βt are, respectively, region-of-birth and year-of-birth fixed effects. Regional
controls Xj are also included and interacted with a time trend.
       I first ignore the potential endogeneity of education and run OLS regressions by us-
ing the household consumption computed in the LSMS data with the Deaton and Zaidi
(2002) method. Columns (1) and (2) in Table 5 indicate that returns to education are ap-
proximately 7%. Comparing columns (2) and (4) shows that the use of the consumption
proxy LogC
       \ijt instead of the consumption significantly lowers the returns to education,

probably due to the potential downward bias described in appendix A.2. Notwithstand-
ing, the estimates from LogC
                         \ijt are very similar between the LSMS data and the census

data and are approximately 4%.
       To obtain consistent estimates of θ, I instrument education by exploiting the census
data.18
       Table 6 reports the 2-SLS estimates of the effect of education on the consumption
proxy. When I add controls for GDP by sectors of activity, I find that one additional year
of education of the household head increases the log of household consumption between
7.1 and 9.2%. F-statistics are high, which suggests that the instruments have strong
  18
    These first-stage equations are also estimated with the LSMS data, but sample sizes of subsamples
are too small and prevent capturing any significant effect (see Table A4).

predictive power, and the results are robust to specifications.
       In comparison with OLS estimates, coefficients are larger. With regard to the abil-
ity bias, this result is counterintuitive. If educated individuals have higher abilities, θ
captures both the education and the ability effect and OLS estimates should be over-
estimated. However, the opposite effect can be observed when education is measured
with error (Griliches, 1977) and when returns to education are heterogeneous19 (Card,
2001). In this framework, the most plausible explanation is that instrumenting educa-
tion removes the downward bias introduced with the use of the consumption proxy (see
appendix A.2).


4.1.2      Returns to education by sector of activity

Thus far, returns to education have been estimated for the whole population. However,
they can vary from one sector of activity to another. In this subsection, I investigate this
question and estimate the consumption equation for each sector:


                        Log(Ciajt ) = αa + βaj + βat + θa Sijt + δta Xj + iajt                              (5)


the subscript “a” depicts the main activity of the household head and indicates whether
the individual: 1) does not work or is unpaid, 2) works in agriculture, 3) works in nonfarm
self-employed activities, or 4) is a wage-worker.
       The first panel of Table 7 presents the OLS results. It shows that returns to education
are much lower in agriculture than in the nonfarm self-employment activities and in wage-
work activities. However, 2SLS estimates presented in the middle panel show that returns
to education are higher in agriculture and in nonfarm self-employed activities than in the
wage-activities. By comparing IV estimates with OLS estimates, one notices that the
size of the bias varies between sectors of activity.20
       This result might be explained by the magnitude of the ability bias between sec-
tors of activity21 , but more plausibly, this discrepancy is explained by the nature of the
  19
     When the instrument affects the education choices of less-educated subgroups, which have high
marginal returns to education, IV estimates are upward biased. Regarding the UPE program that
focused on individuals with restricted access to primary schools, IV estimates may overestimate the
average marginal returns to education of the entire population.
  20
     IV estimates are two times larger, 1.6 times larger and 20% smaller than OLS estimates in agriculture,
nonfarm self-employed activities and wage-workers activities, respectively.
  21
     If working in the formal sector requires higher abilities, the ability bias will be larger for wage workers.

treatment. Since the aim of the UPE program was to boost rural productivity through
agricultural classes (Kinunda, 1975), it is not surprising that individuals who benefited
from this education policy have higher returns in agriculture than in wage activities.


4.1.3      Sample selection bias

The household consumption has the advantage of being available for the entire population,
but estimating the returns to education for nonrandom subsamples, such as sectors of
activity, might lead to sample selection issues. To address this possibility, I adopt the
strategy described by Wooldridge (2010), which is also used by Duflo (2001). This two-
stage model allows addressing both the endogeneity of education and the selection of
samples (see appendix E for more details).
       The results with sample selection correction are reported at the bottom panel of Table
7. The introduction of sample selection corrections does not change the IV estimates.
The returns are still much higher in the agricultural sector and in the self-employment
sector, while they are lower in the formal sector. Furthermore, coefficients of the Mills
ratio are small but statistically significant, suggesting that subsamples are selected.


4.2       Effect of education on the choice of the sector of activity

Education can also ease the access to sectors that require skilled labor. To investigate
this question, I estimate a multinomial logit model where Aijt is the sector of activity,
taking the value of 1 if the individual does not work or is unpaid, 2 if the individual works
in the agricultural sector, 3 if the individual is self-employed in nonfarm activities and 4
if the individual has a wage-work employment. The activity equation has the following
functional form:
                            Aijt = α + βj + βt + θSijt + δt Xj + ijt                            (6)

To account for endogeneity issues, I instrument education with the exposure to the UPE
program and I follow a two-step control function approach (Wooldridge, 2014). After
obtaining the predicted residual from the first stage equation, I plug it into equation (6).
This predicted residual is also used to test the endogeneity of education.
       In contrast to the returns to education estimated at the household level22 , the effect
  22
    The statistical power is too low to instrument the education of several members of the households
at the same time.

of education on the choice of the sector of activity is estimated at the individual level,
which allows distinguishing the effect by gender.
   The results are reported in Table 8. From OLS estimates, I observe that education
increases the probability to work in the formal sector against agricultural and nonagricul-
tural self-employed activities for men, and against agriculture and unpaid activities for
women. However, IV estimates show a completely different picture.
   Education raises the probability of working in agriculture and reduces the probability
of having an unpaid job for both men and women. This switch towards agricultural
activities is probably explained by the curriculum of the UPE program, which is composed
of agricultural classes. In addition, the predicted residuals are statistically different from
0 in most specifications, which confirms the importance of dealing with the endogeneity
of education.


4.3      Decomposition of the monetary effect of education

The monetary benefits of education occur because education increases the consumption
level, conditional on the choice of the sector of activity, and changes the choice of the
sector of activity, in which the consumption level varies. Thus, based on the above results
and on the expected consumption: E(C) = na=1 Pa ∗Ca , where Pa denotes the probability
                                            P

of working in the sector of activity a and Ca denotes the consumption level of individuals
working in activity a, I decompose the returns to education into two components:

                                =             ∗ Ca +     Pa ∗                               (7)

   δPa                                                                                      δCa
    δS
         depicts the effect of education on the probability of working in activity a, and    δS

are the returns to education by activity. Ca and Pa are approximated by the predicted
values of Ĉa and Pˆa from equation 5 and equation 6, respectively.
   The left-hand side term represents the monetary benefit of education due to the change
in the choice of the sector of activity, while the second term corresponds to the returns
to education within sectors.
   Table 9 provides the results from equation (7). OLS estimates show that both the
distribution and the intrasector effects are positive and significant. In contrast, IV esti-

mates suggest that the monetary benefits are mostly explained by the “intrasector effect”,
while the distribution effect is much smaller and negative. Since education increases the
probability of working in the agricultural sector (see section 4.2) and because the aver-
age consumption is lower in this sector, this effect is not surprising and illustrates the
specificity of the UPE program.



5     Discussion and robustness checks
To test whether 2SLS estimates are unbiased, I implement a series of robustness checks.
    Regarding the identification strategy, one of the main concerns is that the exclusion
restriction is not satisfied. The villagization process, which consisted of gathering people
in community villages, probably had an impact over other concerns than education that
could influence consumption. However, this should not put into question the validity
of the instrument because the UPE program affected both pretreated and treated co-
horts, with the exception of the education component that benefited the treated cohorts
only. However, the identification strategy is invalidated if the age at which individuals
were affected by the villagization has a direct effect on the consumption. To empiri-
cally check this issue, I reproduce the results by minimizing the age difference between
the pretreatment and the treatment cohorts (see table A6). This entails excluding the
youngest individuals of the treatment group (column 2) and the oldest individuals of the


                                                  25
pretreatment group (column 3). I find that the point estimates are slightly higher than
the former results (column 1), but I do not reject the equality of the coefficients. I also
test whether the introduction of individuals who were likely to be partially affected by
the UPE program (individuals who were 13 years old between 1968 and 1974) change the
results, but I do not find any significant difference (column 4 of table A6).
       Heretofore, the instrument was constructed from the schooling supply by region of
birth, and standard errors were clustered at the same level. However, a small number
of clusters lead to overrejection of standard asymptotic tests (Cameron et al., 2008).
To check whether I underestimate the standard errors, I instrument education with the
           0
intensity Id,67 , constructed from the educational attainment by district of residence in
1967.23 Table A7 shows that the 2SLS estimates are slightly lower but are still significant
                                                                                    0
at the 1% level. This entails that that overrejecting issue is negligible but that Id,67 is
not purely exogenous.
       One of the main limitations of this study is that the returns to education are esti-
mated for the household head only, while everyone in the household can contribute to
the consumption.24 Although the household head is likely to take most of the decisions
that influence the household decision, the education of the most educated individual also
matters if the knowledge is shared among individuals. Thus, I also provide estimates of
the returns to education for the highest educated individual in the household, and I find
very similar estimates (see table A8).25



6        Conclusion
This paper studies the benefits of education in Tanzania and considers two particular
dimensions: household consumption and the choice of the sectors of activity. To address
endogeneity issues, I instrument education of household heads by exploiting variation in
time and in space of the exposition to the Universal Education Program.
       I find that this massive primary education program contributed to a reduction in
inequalities among regions. After this program ended, its effects persisted for the next
  23
     In 2012, there were 31 regions against 169 districts in Tanzania.
  24
     The statistical power is too low to instrument the education of different members of the households
at the same time.
  25
     The sample excludes approximately 10% of households, for which the highest education level is
reached by two or more individuals.



                                                  26
age cohorts. Despite the controversial means of villagization, the Tanzanian government
fulfilled its goals by improving access to basic education, even in remote areas. Unfor-
tunately, several changes were implemented at the same time, which prevents one from
identifying the effectiveness of each policy.
   By using a household survey, census data, and records on the number of schools, I
find that education increases household consumption between 7.3 and 9.3 percent, de-
pending on the specification and the instrument. The main contribution of this analysis
is to focus on the entire population, instead of wage workers who are in the minority
in most developing countries and are very likely to be self-selected. I also compare the
returns to education between sectors of activity. I find that the returns to education are
higher in agriculture and in nonfarm self-employed activities than in wage-work activities.
This conclusion, initially surprising, is consistent with the Tanzanian governmental policy
that aimed to put education at the service of agriculture by teaching agricultural skills.
Compared to the studies on the benefits of primary education in agriculture in African
countries that find low returns (Appleton et al., 1996; Jolliffe, 2004), I argue that returns
to education in agriculture are positive, provided that the curriculum at school is consis-
tent with agriculture. This conclusion is closer to Foster and Rosenzweig (1996)’s results,
suggesting that returns to education are positive only during specific contexts, such as
during technological changes, when education helps farmers to adopt new technologies.
   These findings suggest that the introduction of agricultural classes could help house-
holds to escape poverty by increasing the farmers’ productivity. In terms of public recom-
mendations, this result is all the more relevant in most African countries, where the large
majority of the population works in agriculture and where the agricultural productivity
remains low.

A         The proxy for consumption

A.1        Construction

By following a two step-procedure, I predict household consumption from a set of pre-
dictors P that are common to both household and census data.26 The idea behind this
method is first to estimate the joint distribution of the consumption, logC, and of P from
the household survey:
                                     LogCijt = bPijt + δj + νijt                                     (8)

where νijt is the error term of household i. Then, I use the estimated distribution b̂Pijt to
         \
predict logCijt in the census data. This method is valid if the predictors P are similarly

measured in both data sets, and if questions have the same wording for the two ques-
tionnaires.27 Table A1 shows coefficients of equation 8 in the LSMS data. As predicted,
all dwelling characteristics have a positive and significant impact on consumption. The
R-squared coefficient is high, meaning that the predictors have good explanatory power.
                                                 \
In table A2, the comparison between LogCijt and logCijt shows that the share of the

consumption explained by the dwelling characteristics reaches approximately two-thirds,
and confirms the fact that dwelling characteristics have a high explanatory power. Graph
                                  [ and logC in the LSMS data.28 I find a clear
A1 plots the relationship between logC
                                                                   [ may not capture
positive linear relationship between these two variables. Although logC
all the variation in consumption, especially at the tails of the distribution, this does not
                                                                        [ is larger,
appear to be empirically the case. The dispersion for extreme values of logC
but this effect stays negligible.
       To account for the artificially low variance of the consumption proxy, I adopt the
method proposed by Barham and Boucher (1998) and Gubert et al. (2010). This approach
recommends adding to an error term drawn from a normal distribution with the same
variance νc
          ijt that is observed in the survey data. To make sure that the results are

independent from the random draw, this procedure is replicated a large number of times.
Due to this method, the standard errors can be normally interpreted.
  26
     The number of rooms in the dwelling, whether the household has drinking water, electricity, a phone,
a flush toilet, a high-quality roof, high-quality walls, etc.
  27
     To avoid anachronism issues, I do not include in the list of predictors “having a phone”, which may
have a different meaning across time and across the data.
  28                    [ I compute the average value of logC depicted by a dot.
     For each value of logC,

A.2     Consequences of the use of a consumption proxy

To obtain unbiased estimates of the returns to education by using the consumption proxy,
one additional validity assumption should be satisfied: education and νc
                                                                       ijt obtained from

equation (8) should be uncorrelated. Heretofore, νc
                                                  ijt is assumed to be exogenous and has

been drawn from a normal distribution. However, νc
                                                 ijt , which represents the consumption

part unexplained by households’ dwelling characteristics, may result from households’
preferences and may be correlated with the education of the household’s head Sijt . For
instance, educated household heads may be more willing to spend money for the education
or health of their children. If so, there is a remaining endogenous part of the residual
         00    00
denoted νijt (νijt = νijt − νbijt ) that is not captured by the drawn residual νc
                                                                                ijt . Thus, by

combining equations (8) and (4):

   The positive correlation between education and εijt leads to the traditional upward

bias, while the positive correlation between education and νijt causes downward bias
in the coefficient of interest. Thus, if νijt is not purely exogenous, using the proxy for
consumption adds an additional source of bias.

E     Measuring the effect of education by sector of ac-
      tivity with the Heckman selection model
To overcome endogeneity and selection issues, I follow the method proposed by Wooldridge
(2010) based on the three following equations: the consumption equation, the selection
equation where Aijt represents the sector of activity of the household’s head, and the
endogenous education equation.
                                                                                     
                      Log(Ciajt ) = α1a + β1aj + β1at + θ1a Sijt + δ1ta Xj + 1isjt 
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
            Aijt   = α2a + β2aj + β2at + θ2a Ij,67 ∗ T + γ2a Nijt + δ2ta Xj + 2iajt
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
                      Sijt = α3a + β3aj + β3at + θ3a Ij,67 ∗ T + +δ3ta Xj + 3iajt 
                                                                                     

    To obtain unbiased estimates of the returns to education, I first regress the choice
of the sector of activity on the instrument in order to deduce the predicted probabilities
of working in the different sectors of activity. Then, to control for sample selection, I
compute the inverse Mills ratios λˆia that I introduce into the consumption equation:


            Log(Ciajt ) = α1a + β1aj + β1at + θ1a Sijt + δ1ta Xj + γ1a λˆia + 1iajt                 (11)

    Standard errors are bootstrapped to account for it as a two-step procedure.
