                          EXCHANGE RATE VARIABILITY AND ASSET TRADE


                                            ABSTRACT




       In discussions about different international monetary arrangements it is often

maintained that exchange rate variability has a negative influence on internationaltrade and

foreign investment. This paper addresses one specific aspect of this general issue, namely the
effect of exchange rate variabilityon capital flows and internationalportfolio diversification.

More precisely, we examine how different monetary policies-- and among those, policies that
aim at stabilizing exchange rates-- determine   the risk characteristics   of nominal assets, and

how these risk characteristics determine international portfolio composition and trade in

assets, when internationalasset markets are incomplete.

I. Introduction
       Iii popular discussions about the merits of different international monetary

arrangements one often hears the argument that increased exchange rate variability has a

negative influence on internationaltrade and capital flows. Yet    there arc few serious
analyses in the   international trade and finance literatureof how exchange rate variability
affects trade and-capitalflows. This paper addresses a specific, but also a very basic,

question within this general issue, namely the effect of exchange rate variabilityon capital
flows and internationalportfolio diversification in different assets: How do different rules for

monetary policies- - and amongthose,rulesthat aim at stabilizing exchange rates-- influence
the risk characteristics of nominal assets? How do these risk characteristics in turn affect
internationalportfolio composition and trade in assets, when internationalasset markets are
incomplete?
       The motivation for our focus on nominal assets     is evident. From   an empirical point
of view, an overwhelming proportion of international capital flows are in assets denominated
in some currency with fixed nominal interest payments. From       a theoreticalpoint of view,
monetary policy can exert a direct effect only on the risk structure of nominal assets and any
effect on the risk structure of real assets must be indirect via some other non- neutrality.   It
is also evident   that internationalasset markets must be incomplete for our analysis to be
interesting. For if markets were complete the risk characteristics   of nominal assets would
not matter.
       Previous literature in the macro tradition on internationalportfolio investment in

monetary open economies has largely relied on the "portfolio balance' approach. That
approach specifies asset demand functions directly and does not derive them from a
maximization problem given the risk- return characteristics of available assets. (See Branson
and Henderson (19S5) for a survey of the portfolio balance approach.) Such an approach is

subject to the "Lucas critique", however. Since our purpose in this paperis precisely to

investigate how differeot policy rules affect the trade pattern in assets, we cannot rely on a
portfolio balance approach.
       Previous literature in the finance tradition on international portfolio diversification

has iideed derived asset demands froni first principles, hut has typically treated the
stochastic processes for asset returns and exchange rates as exogenous rather than

determined by monetary policies in general equilibrium (see for instance Fama and Farber

(1979), Crauer, Litzenberger and Stehle (1976), and Kouri (1977)).
       An integrationof monetary policies in general equilibrium is indeed undertaken in the
international asset pricing models of Lucas (1982), Stulz (1984) and Svensson (1985). But
the focus in these papers is on prices and exchange rates and not on the trade pattern in
assets. Since a perfectly pooled eqnilibrinm is assumed, the trade pattern is indeed trivial.i
A closer antecedent to the present paper is I-lelpman and Razin (1982) who use a framework

very similar to the one we will use. Their focus is on the optimality properties of different
exchange rate regimes though, not on the associated trade patterns.
       Svensson (1988a) studies the effect of monetary policies on the trade pattern in
nominal assets by adopting   an "indirect"   approach, which exploits the general Law of

ComparativeAdvantage,as developed by Deardorff (1980) and Dixit and Norman (1980).
The indirect approach first derives a correlation between the trade pattern in assets and
autarky asset pricedifferences, and then explains autarky asset price differences by
differences in countries technologies, preferences, and monetary policies. Tisis is convenient

because it is not necessary to solve for the explicit equilibrium trade pattern; it is sufficient
to solve for the simpler antarky equihibrinm. But for our purpose the approach has the
disadvantage that the results on tlse trade pattern are only in the form of correlations; tisere
are no specific results on particular assets.
       To get specific results, we instead adopt a "direct" approacis. That is, we solve
explicitly for the trade equilibrium and analyze the determinants of tlse aggregate capital


         That is, relative to antarky each country (in a two- country world) exports half of
its assets and imports half of the otiser country's assets. Still, capital movements and
correlations between key macro variables like investment, the current account, output, etc.,
can be studied, as in Stockman and Svensson (1987), hot any current and capital account
movements are due exclusively to revaluation of domestically i2a5l assets relative to foreign
based assets, isot to cisauges us the ownership of assets.
account, as well as its composition into trade in distinct nominal bonds. We do this in a

general equilibrium   where price levels, exchange rates, and asset returns are determined by

monetary policies. Most of tIme equilibria differ from the perfectly pooled equilibrium even

when countries have identical preferences. We also consider equilibria when COuntrieS

preferences differ, more precisely when attitudes to risk differ. Our approach relies to a
considerable   extent on a recent paper by Gordon and Varian (1987) which develops an
intertemporalCAPM model of trade in risky assets between barter economies.2
       A limitation of our analysis is that we postulate that international financial markets
are incomplete, without attempting to integrate any reason for that inconspleteness— such as
                                                                                      —




moral hazard,adverseselectionor costly state verification-- into the analysis. Instead we

simply assume that the only internationally traded assets are nominal bonds, denominated
in each currency, and indexed bonds. In spite of outputs being random, we rule out trade in
stocks and claims to national Outputs by assumption.3
        A new element in our paper is to apply, in the context of the internationaltrade in

assets, Selden's (1978) formulation of preferences. Selden's so called OCE (Ordinal
Certainty Equivalence) approach allows a distinction between intertemporalpreferences and
attitudes towards risk, a distinction that is blurred in the usualexpected utility framework.
Allowing for this distinction may be particularly important in an analysis of international
portfolio choice, since we want to know what capital flows arise from intertemporal

preferences and what ones arise from risk aversion. As far as we know, our paper is the first


2       Gordon and Varians (1986) focus is on the effect of taxes on prices of
internationallytraded assets. They demonstrate, among other things, a result similar to the
optimum— tariff one, nansely that asset terms—of— trade can be affected by taxation so as to
improve national welfare.
         Cole (1986) examines the effect of different kinds of assets (ex post securities,
Arrow- Debreu securities, Helpman- Razin equities) on variance and covariance of key real
variables, like Output, consumption, and trade balance.
         The restriction on trade in claims on national outputs is perhaps easier to defend
than the restriction on trade in stocks, since the former partly captures the difficulty in
trading claims to human capital. From the viewpoint of financial equilibrium, we thus have
a model where sonic risk is not directly marketable. This is not common in the finance
literature,but an early contribution is Mayers (1973) analysis of non- marketable risk in the
CAPM model.

the model and the general equilibrium. Section 3 presents the monetary aspects and the

2. The Real Economy

        The economyis a monetary economy with cash- in- advance constraints in goods
markets. However, from a presentational point of view, it is easier to postpone the
discussion of monetary issues. Accordingly, this section abstracts entirely from monetary
issues and deals only with the real economy, while money and monetary policy is introduced
in the next section.5
        We study a simple general equilibrium model of a world economy with two countries:
the home country and the foreign country. Foreign variables and parameters are indexed
with   an asterisk   .   There   are two time periods, 1 and 2. Period 1 and 2 variables and
parameters are indexed with superscripts. In each period there is one perishable and
internationally traded good, which is produced and consumed by both cOuntries. Period 1

outputs are exogenous and certain, with home and foreign output denoted by y1 and y*'•
Period 2 outputs, y2 and y*2, are also exogenous but uncertain. We call s = (y2,y*2) the


          Svensson (1988b) uses the OCE framework when applying the "indirect" approach
of the law of comparative advantage to trade in risky real assets.
5         The modelis similar to the ones of Helpman (1981) (except it Isas uncertainty and
only two periods), Helpman and Rasin (1982) (except it has no uncertainty in period 1),
Lucas (1982) (except it has possibly incomplete markets and only two periods), Persson
(1982, 1984) (except it has uncertainty and only two periods), and Stockman (1983) (except
it lsas cash in advance instead of money in the utility function).

state (of the world). The state s is assumed to be bivariate normal, with
                          and covariance
                                                                             means    and



         As discussed in the introduction, international asset marketsare assumed to be

incomplete. In addition to the national moneys, there are only three internationally traded
assets: one indexed bond, and nominal bonds denominated in home and foreign currency.
The inclusion of the indexed bond is for convenience: it greatly simplifies the solution of the

model.
         The indexed bond, denoted by subindex 0, has a state- dependent    home— currency


return of P2(s) or a state—dependent foreign currency return of P2(s); P2(s) and P*2(s)
being the home and foreign price level in state s. Its real return- the return in terms of the
                                                                    —




one good--is thus riskless and equal to unity in each state. The priceof an indexed bond (in

terms of the good) on the period 1 asset market is denoted by q0.7
       The nominal bonds are discount bonds paying one unit of currency in each state.
Their real returns are thus risky. The home (cnrrencv) bond has state- dependent real
return d(s) = 1/P2(s) and the foreign (currency) bond has real return d11 = 1/P*2(s). Iii
the remainder of this section, we shall refer to the home and foreign bonds as the risky
assets. \Ve let d(s) denote the return vector on the risky assets, that is d(s) =
(d11(s),d(s)). \Ve shall later on— in section 3—— make assunsptions that
                                     —                                   make d and d

jointly normally distributed. Further, we let denote the variance- covariance matrix of the
risky asset returns and        and       denote the covariance (vectors) of home and foreign

output with these returns. The asset prices of risky assets (in terms of the good) are denoted
by     and     and Q is the asset price vector (QQ).

         Let us now, after these preliminaries, look at the decision problem of the

representativeconsumer in the home country. There are no assets outstanding initially, so
his only source   of income in the first period is from home   output. The home consumer owns

 6         The assurnptioilof normality is, as usual, problematic, since it implies that OutpUts
 can be negative with positive probability.
 7         The assumptionof one consumption good implies that the same indexed l)OUd is
 riskless for all investors.

           The consumer's preferences are formulated as a special case of Selden (1978, 1979).

Following Selden's approach, we separate time preferences (intertemporal preferences) and
risk preferences (attitude towards risk) of the consumer in the following way. The firn
preferences are given     by the intertemporal and additively separable utility function
                                             U(c') + fiU(c2),                           (2.2a)
where fi is a discount factor, 0    c < 1, and where c2 denotes the certainty equivalent        of

whereE is the expectations operator.9 Further, we assume that there isconstant absolute
risk aversion,



S        Since outputs may be negative with positiveprobability by our assumption that
outputs are normally distributed, we have a possibility of bankruptcy if consumption is
constrained to be non- negative. We ignore this problem by letting consumption be negative
if necessary.
         Selden (1978, 1979) does not restrict the time preferences to be additivelyseparable.
When the time preferences are additiviy separable, and the risk prefereisces coincide with the
time preferences (us the sense that the functions U( ) and V(S) are identical), the
preferences are identical to expected- utility von Neunsann- hilergenstern preferences.

whereq is the vector of relative asset prices q = (qqj1)  (Q1/q0,Q11/q0). Repeating an
exactlyanalogous argument for the foreign country, leads to analogous first- orderconditions
                                                       =         and                 (2.5*)

         We can now study equilibrium prices and quantities in the first- period asset markets.
Equilibrium   in the markets for risky assets requires world imports of both assets to   be zero,

viz

                                             z+z*=0,                                 (2.7)
which together with the first order conditions (2.6) yields

                                         q = a - 7wC\Vd.                              (2.s)
Flere,     a 1/(1/7 +   1/)   is a measure of the world- wide absolute rate of risk aversion and

wd is the covariance (vector) between world output, w2 = 1,2 + y2, and the returns on
risky assets. The equilibrium (relative) prices on risky assets are thus determined in a very
simple way. Using the expression (2.8) together with the first— order conditions, we can solve
for the equilibrium import vector of risky assets (nominal bonds) as

                                          z= a            -                                   (2.9)
                                                    (aafd oahd),
where   as (1/7)/1/7) + (1/p)) and n                a (1/7*)/1/7)        + (1/p)) are normalized
measures of absolute risk tolerance (the reciprocal of risk aversiou). The equilibrium import
of risky assets thus depends on tlse attitudes towards risk in the two countries, on tlse risk

properties of the assets, and on the covariance betweee asset returns and outputs.
        it is slightly more complicated to represent equilibrium in the market            for riskiess
assets (indexed bonds). To do that, let us define "certainty equivalent risky period 2 income

(net of indexed bonds)" x2 by
                                                 x2 a c2 - z0.                                (2.10)
We can express x2 as

                                          x=y+d'z-7Ucc/2                      (2.lla)

                                                    q0(z0) is the demand price for riskless
assets given equilibrium in the markets for risky assets.            It is easy to show that the condition
for q0(•) to be downward sloping is

                                         U/Uc < q(z0 + q'z),                                  (2.13)
where       denotes          -           + q'z)),   etc. The left- hand side of the inequalityis
        U             Ujy'       q0(z0
proportional to the intertemporal substitutioneffect and the right-hand side is proportional
to the income or "terms- of- trade" effect. Thus, only a strongly positive income effect-- due
to a largetotalasset export- - can make      ) positivelysloped. The foreign demand price
                                                 q0(
for indexed bonds     q(z) is similarly defined.          Then,   q( ) is downward sloping under the
same coiiditioii that          is downward sloping, only that         the left— hand side is replaced by
                         (10
                          =                       + qz)), etc. We assume that condition (2.13) and its
UJtJ* with                     U(y*l -    q0(z0

foreign analog are fulfilled.
       Since     =   -        in equilibrium, the condition for equilibrium in the market for riskless
                         z0
assets can be written as
                                                        =                                         (2.14)
                                               q0(z0)       q(-z0).
This condition can be solved for the equilibrium home country import                  of indexed bonds.
Under the assumptions about the slopes of the demand price functions, the equilibrium is

unique.
       \Ve note that we can write the budget constraint (2.la) as

                                         (c1-y1)   + q0(z0 + q'z) = 0,                            (2.15)
and interpret it as a period       1   balance- of- payments- constraint. The first term is the current
account deficit and the second is the capital account deficit, consisting             of the value of
indexed bonds import q0z0 and of nominal bonds import q0qz = Q'z. In the two-period
framework the capital account is relative to autarky; it is not the change in overall holding

of foreign assets from period to period.


3. Money and Monetary Policy

       We introduce money by postulating cash- in- advance constraints in goods markets.
Our way of modeling these constraints follows closely the approach pioneered by Helpman

(19S1) and used in many subsequent papers in international finance. A similar formulation
to the one we will use here, also in the context            of   a two- period uncertainty model, has

recently been used by Svensson (l9SSa), and we refer the reader to that paper for a detailed
discussion on the institutionalsetting. The implications of money market equilibrium (with

binding liquidity constraints) and goods marketequilibrium is that the period 1 price levels
in the home and foreign countries obey the simple quantity- theory equations
                                               P1 = M1/y1,         and                            (3.1)
                                                  P = N'/y,                                       (3.1*)
                                                 10




where M' and   N' denotethe home and foreign period       1   money supply. The period       1


exchange rate follows from the law of one price,
                                          e' =   '/'
Similarly, the period 2 state- dependent price levels satisfy
                                                                    .                      (3.2)



                                    P2(s) = M2(s)/y2, and                                  (3.3)
                                              = N2(s)/y*2,                                 (3.3)
and the state- dependent period 2 exchange rate is given by

                                     e2(s) = P2(s)/P*2(s).                                 (3.4)
       The above simplistic formulation is obviously very restrictive. There is       no

uncertainty abont relative prices, and   PPP holds.   But     it is also very useful from a modeling
point of view and allows us to focus on how monetary policy affect real returns on nominal
assets. Since outputs are exogenous, monetary policy in the two countries will determine the

price levels and the exchange rate in each state. This means that once monetary policy is
formulated, the risk- returo properties of home and foreign currency bonds are also
determined and can be taken as given in the real equilibrium that we studied in the previous

section. The real returns on home and foreign bonds are by equations (3.3) simply given by

                               dm(5) = 1/P2(s)
                                                  = y2/M2(s) and                           (3.5)

                                dn(5) = 1/P*2(s)      y*2/N2(s).
The resulting recursivity of the model simplifies the analysis considerably. If, for instance,

money demand would depend on consumption instead of on output, the recursivity would
break down.

       Monetary policies in the home and foreign country determinethe period           1   and period

2 money supplies. In the subsequent      study of risk and asset trade, we shall distinguish a few
benchmark policy rules for period 2 monetary policies. The benchmark policy rules all have

the property that the target variable is stabilized in the sense of becoming
state- independent.

       The first policy rule is when the government pursues a monetary          or a nominal GDP
target. In our model, this requires that   the money supply is niade      state- independent. It
                                                        11




Follows from (3.3)       that under such a target, the home government sets
                                             M2(s)   = NI2,   for all s,                           (3.6)
vliere   Ni is    the target for nomnisal GDP. As can he         seen   from (3.3), this results in home

nominal GDP, P2(s)y2, being constant across states of the world. Analogously, foreign
nominal GDP targeting requires

                                             N2(s) = N2 for all s.                                 (3.6*)
         Under the second policy rule, the government PU5UCS an inflation                taret.    From

(3.3), this policy requires the home government to set the second- period money supply in a
state- dependent way, namely
                                       M2(s)   = (1+r)P'y2, for all s,                             (3.7)
where    r   is the chosen inflation target. Hence the implicit period 2 price level target is
P2(s) = 2 (l+ir)P1 for all s. (In our framework, an inflation target and a period 2 price
level target are equivalent.) A foreign inflation target implies
                               N2(s) = (1+g*)P*ly2, for all s.                    (37*)
       Finally, the governments may adopt exchange  rate                 we
                                                         targets. Here, must
distinguish whether  the two governments do or do not coordinate their policies. An

uncoordinated exchange rate target adopted by the home government, from (3.3) and (3.4)

requires it to set the money supply in the following, state- dependent way

                                      M2(s)   = N2(s)y2/y*2, for all s,                            (3.8)
where        is   the target value of the period 2 exchange rate. If instead the two governments
agree to coordinate their policies and adopt a coordinated exchange rate target                ,   they have
one remainingdegreeof freedom.The remaining degree of freedom is used to set the world

money Supply 112(s)           M2(s)   + N2(s), which is possibly state dependent.          From (3.3) and

(3.4),   it follows that, given the world money supply 112(5), the two individual money
supplies must        be set according to
                                   M2(s)     = JJ2(5)y2/yV2,
                                                           for all s, and                          (3.9)
                                       9         9   9-  w)
                                             = I.1(s)y*ey , for all s.
                                      N(s)                                                         (3.9*)
Each country's money supply has to be set in proportion to that country's share in world
                                                       12




output in state a. The coordinated exchange rate target can be associated with either a
world nominal GDP target or a world inflation target. A world nominal (IDP target implies

                                         112(5)   =   112   for all s,                   (3.10)
which results in a constant world nominal GDP, p2(5)yw2 = 112 for all s. A world inflation

j'et, with an implicit period 2 world price level target P2(s) = P2 = P1(1 +z) for all a,
implies
                                      H2(s) = p2w2 for all s.                            (3.11)
That is, world money supply        is set proportional      to world output.
       In this model it does not matter whether the governments undertake open market
operations or foreign exchange interventions to affect price levels and exchange rates. The

only thing that matters is the resulting effect on money supplies. There are two reasons for
this. First, there is is Ricardian equivalence, since consumers have rational expectations and
are as long- lived as the economy, and since lumpsum net transfers are available. Second,
the transactions structure is such that each country's representative consumer chooses to
begin period 2 with zero holdings of the other country's currency. Then any seignorage
collected by each government is a tax on their own citizens only. See Svensson (1988a) for
further discussion of this. The consequencefor our analysis is that we need only consider
monetary policies in terms of direct money supply rules.
          This completes    the specification of the different possible rules for monetary   policy.
As we shall see in the next section, the risk properties of the available nominal bonds hinge

crucially upon which combination of policy rules that the two countries adopt.


4. Asset Trade

          In this section   we shall examine the aggregate capital account and the underlying
trade pattern in nominal bonds and indexed bonds for the different stylized policy rules
mentioned in section 3. In particular, we shall compare the trade pattern in nomiual and
indexed bonds (zns, zn and z0) and the capital account deficit (q0(z0 + q'z)) in a situation

wisen the homeand foreign country pursues specified monetary policies, and in a situation
                                                 13




when the home country insteadadoptsan uncoordinatedexchangerate target. At the end

we shall also discuss what happens when the two countries adopt a coordinated exchange

rate target.


a) Uome Exchange Rate Tarct vs. hlonie Nominal (11)P target
with a Forcien Nominal GDP Target
        \Ve start with the situation when the home and foreign countries both have an

individual nominal GDP target, as given by equations (3.6). Substitution of equations (3.6)
into the real return expressions (3.5) reveals that with     these policy rules the expected return

vector d and the variance/covariance matrix           are given by
                                      -9
                               -
                               d=
                                      y
                                      _*9 and     =        a5 °hf      .                (4.1)
                                      y                    °if ff
In other words, home and foreign nominal bonds becomeequivalent to claims           to homeand
foreign Output, respectively. -We denote this circumstance by
                                           m=h and n=f.                                 (4.2)

In the interest of brevity, we shall somewhat imprecisely refer to claims to home and foreign

outputs as home and foreign stocks. Substitutionof (4.1) into (2.9) immediately gives tile
trade pattern in nominal bonds, namely
                                          -a<0
                                   z1 =          and       = a> 0.                      (4.3)

The home country exports home bonds and imports foreign bonds. Since home and foreign
bonds are equivalent to home and foreign stocks, the homeCountry diversifies its portfolio

by effectively trading homestocks for foreignstocks. In equilibrium the home country then
holds   a portfolio of both home and foreign stocks.
         Substitutionof (4.2) in (2.8) gives tile equilibrium prices (relative to indexed bonds)

of home and foreign bonds,
                         =         =2-           and q     =        = y2 - 7Wwf         (4.4)

Here, q11 and qf denote the (hypothetical) prices of home and foreign stocks and °',vli and

where                                           price (relative to the indexed bond) of claims to
world poriod 2 output. \Ve see that the home country effectively holds a share a of claims to
home output (the term            and that the aggregate trade in nominal bonds is the difference
                          oq),
between that portfolio and an endowment consisting of home stocks (the term q15). Tins          if
of course an example of a familiar mutual- fund resuk fu the CAPM model.
        Numerous asymmetries between countries can he examined. In order to restrict the
numberof cases we limit the differences between countries to period 2 outputs being

imperfectly correlated, and to attitudes towards risk. Let us therefore assume that the
countries have the same period 1 output, and that the marginal probability distribution of

their period 2 output is the same, but that their period 2 output may be less than perfectly
correlated. More specifically, unless otherwise stated, we now assume
                                      1
                             y1 =y , -2
                                             -
                                        y =y ,and abh= aff.                     (Al)
It follows directly from (Al) that hf' the covariance between home and foreign period 2
output, is bounded by - 9hh e)f         hh
        We shall also assume, unless otherwise stated, that the countries have the same time

preferences, that is the same subjective discount factor and intertemporalutility function,
                                   fl=       and       U(.)=U*(.).                      (A2)

        Finally, we shall assume either that the two countries have the same absolute risk
aversion,

                                 7 = 7* (that is,       a = a* = 1/2),                  (A3a)
or that the homecountry is more risk averse,

                          7> y (that is, a* > 1/2 > a).                                 (A3b)
        Underassumption(Al) we have   = qf aisd hence
                                  Z = (a -                                              (4.6)
                                                         a*)q.
        It follows directly from (4.6) and (4.3) that when the countries have tise same risk

aversion, (A3a), aggregate trade in nominal bonds is zero and the home country effectively
exports and imports exactly half of the home and foreign stocks,

                                Z=0andz=-z11-1/2.                                    (4.7)

This is of course the familiar perfectly pooled equilibrium.
         When the home country is more risk averse, (A3b), the home country in the

aggregate exports nominal bonds, imports less of foreign bonds, and exports more of home
bonds,
                            Z < 0. z1 <- 1/2, and U       < Zn < 1/2.                (4.8)
      Let us next examine the determinants of the trade in indexed bonds, z0.

Obviously, when the countries have the same risk aversion, there is zero trade in indexed

bonds,
                                                 = 0,                                (4.9)
since the countries are assumed to have the same intertemporal preferences.     It follows that
the capital account is balanced,
                                                 =
                                     q0(z0 + Z) 0.                              (4.10)
         When the home country is more risk averse, indexed bonds are imported by the home

Country,

                                            z0
                                                 > 0.                                (4.11)
         We can show (4.11) by comparing the home and foreign demand price for indexed
bonds when no indexed bonds are traded, that is.        (O) and (0), from (2.12) with
                                        coo
                                   = c(x2                         and                (4.12)
                                   = c*2c+0
where we have exploited (A2) and Z* = - Z. From the definitions of x2 and       x2 in (2.11), we
have x2 -   x2 = (cs. *)(,v2 _     7\V17wW/2)
                                                < 0, where       is the variance of world output.
Further, by (4.8) y   -
                         q0Z > y + q0Z. Since U(.) is decreasing, it follows that q0(0)       >
         which implies z0 > 0 by (2.13).

         Intuitively, the more risk averse home country has a lower certainty equivalent risky

period 2 income (x2 < xt2). Absent trade in indexed bonds, the home country has higher
                                                   16




aeriod   1   consumption, since it is a net exporter of risky assets. Interteniporal substitution
and equal time preferences then implies that the home country imports iidexed bonds to

increase period 2 consumption and ricerease period 1 cOnsumption.
       What can ve say about the capital account deficit q3(z0 + Z) when the home country

is more risk averse? Indexed bonds are imported, whereas nominal bonds are exported.

What is the net? It can actually be densunstrated (see the appendix) that there is a capital
account deficit,
                                                  + Z) > 0.                                    (4.13)
The import of indexed bonds dominates over the export of nominal bonds. The home

country's higher risk aversion leads it to save more than the foreign country, which
translatesinto positive net foreign investment.
         Let us next consider the situation when the foreign country still pursues           a nominal
GDP target, but the home countryinstead pursues an (uncoordinated) exchange rate target,
as specified     in (3.8). It follows from (3.5) that home nominal bonds then get the same risk
characteristics as foreign nominal bonds so that these two assets become perfect substitutes.

Foreign nominal bonds have, as before, risk characteristics equivalent to foreign stocks. In
addition to the indexed bonds, thereis now effectively only one risky asset, namely foreign
stocks. We denote this by
                                                m=   n   = f.                                   (4.14)
          Since home and foreign nominal bonds are perfect substitutes, only aggregate trade in

 themmatters, and the particular composition of aggregate trade into trade in Isome and
foreign bonds is irrelevant. In terms of the real model in Section 2, we must then regard tbe
trade vector of riskyassets z as one- dimensional. It           is straightforward   to verify, that all the
expressions in Section 2 still hold when the relevant vectors and matrices are reinterpreted
 as scalars, however. For example, expected dividends and the varianceof dividends on risky

 nominal bonds are given by the scalars
                                            =      and a =      Uff.                            (4.15)

 Using (4.15) in (2.8) and (2.9) we directly get
                                                        17




                            = zf = - Oaf/uff and i = = v -
                                    Cs
                                                    qf                                  7ef,          (4.16)
where z denotes aggregate trade a noininal bonds.

         Under assumption (A3a) equaliisk aversion, we have
                                             =   (1                        0,                         (4.17)
                                                      (T1fIffff)/2
where z is nonnegative by (Al); recall that           17hf
                                                             <
                                                                 Uff
                                                                       =        under   (Al). The home country
diversifies its portfolio by importing the single risky asset, nominal bonds.                  It follows, of
course, that aggregate trade in nominal bonds is nonnegative,
                                                  Z = qz 0.                                           (4.18)
         It is easy to show that the importof nominal bonds is financed by export of indexed
bonds,
                                                        < 0.                                          (4.19)
         What about the capital account? It can indeed be shown (see the appendix) that the
capital account   is balanced,
                                                    =
                                        q0(z0 + Z) 0.                               (4.20)
         If instead the home country is more risk averse, (A3b), we see from (4.16) that it is
no longer clear that the home country unambiguously imports nominal bonds. If Cs*o.f <
      we have z    <   0,   that is, the home country exports nominal bonds. The closer                     to
and the larger    a relative to    Cs,   the morelikely is z < 0. If this indeed happens, nominal

bonds (equivalent of foreign stocks) is a bad hedge for home output risk and it is better for
the homecountry to insure itselfby importing indexed bonds, which import is financed by

export of nominal bonds. \Vith regard to the aggregate capital account, it can be shown (see
the appendix) that

          sgn q0(z0 + Z) = sgn (7- 7*)[(1+z)_c/2                   + a*(ff+11f)z].                 (4.21)
We see that if z > 0, the capital account is definitely in deficit. But if z < 0-- because,as

explainedabove, ehf is positive and close to                 and           >> a--the capital   account may
instead be in surplus. In the latter case, a change from a nominal GDP target to an

exchange rate target thus causes the capital account to change sign.
         In summary, a change from a nominal GDP rule to an exchange rate rule, when the
                                                18




foreign country has a nominal ('.DP rule, clearly implies a different composition of the
capital account. If the two countries have the same risk aversion, the aggregate capital
account is unchanged at zero. But    if the home country is more risk averse,       the capital

account may change from deficit to surplus.


h) Ilonie Exchange Rate Target vs. Home TnflationTarget
with a Foreign Nominal GDP Target
       We next look at the case when the foreign country pursues a nominal GDP target,

but the home country has an ioflation target. Then home bonds are perfect substitutesfor
indexed bonds, whereas foreign bonds remain equivalent to foreign stocks,

                                          m=O,n=f.                                        (4.22)
       It follows that the effective availability   of assets is equivalent   to the case in (a) when
the home country follows an exchange rate rule. Assume now that the home country instead
shifts to an exchange rate target. That makes risky nominal home and foreign bonds perfect

substitutes,
                                           m=n=f.                                         (4.23)

Therefore, under our assumption that there are indexed bonds, the same array of assets is
effectively available, namely indexed bonds and risky nominal foreign bonds. It follows that
the equilibrium is effectively the same, as when the homecountry pursues an inflation

target, although the denomination of the traded assets may change.


c) Home Exchange Rate Target vs. Home Inflation Target
with a Foreign Inflation Target
        \Vhen the home and foreign countries initially pursueinflation targets, home and

foreign bonds are both equivalent to indexed bonds. There is effectively only one asset
traded, the indexed bond. In our notation
                                           m=n =       0.                                 (4.24)
        When the countries have the same risk aversion, it follows (since the two countries
                                                 19




arc equal in all other respects) that there is no trade and the capital account is balanced,
                                                 = 0.                                          (425)
       \Vlieu the home country is more risk averse, we have
                                 x2 -   x= (-     -
                                                      7*)/2 <0,                                (4.26)

(we have used (Al)). Absent trade in indexed bond, the certainty equivalent period 2
consumption is lower in the house country. It follows that the house country will import
indexed bonds,
                                                 > 0,                                          (4.27)

and there will be a capital account deficit.
       When each country pursues an inflation target, the exchange rate is constant. 1-lence
it makes no difference if the home country instead pursues an exchange rate target.


d) Home Exchange Bate Target vs. Tlorne Nominal (3DP Target
with a Foreign Inflation Target
       When the foreign country pursues      an inflation target and the home country pursues a
nominal GDP target, the situation is of course the mirror image of the one discussed under

b) above. That is,
                                           m=h,n=0.                                            (4.28)

The trade pattern in assets is determined by the same conditions as when the home country
has an exchange rate target under a).
        If the home country instead pursues an exchange rate target, we have
                                                = n = 0,                                       (4.29)

that is, the availability of assets is equivalent to the one discussed under c) above.
       If the two countries are equally risk averse, (A3a), the adoption of an exchange rate

target does not change net foreign investment: it follows from the results above that the
capital account stays at zero.    Flosvever, gross    trade in assets is different.   \Vhule   the home

country trades (exports or imports) nominal bonds for indexed bonds with an inflation rule,
gross trade is indetermisiate and may very well he zero with an exchange rate rule.
                                                  20



         If the home country is more risk averse, (A3b), the situation with an inflation rule is
not exactly the mirror image of h), since now the more risk averse home country can
effectively trade its own stocks (rather than the other country's stocks as in b)). The more
risk averse home country will always export its stocks, hence

                                    z=z1<OandZ=qz<0.                                      (4.30)

By syllunetry one can derive an analog to (4.21),

             sgn q0(z0   + Z) = sgn (- 7*)[(1 zll)2h/2 - 0(hll+hf)Zll].               (4.31)
It follows   from (4.30) and (4.31) that the capital account is in deficit,

                                    q0(z0 + Z) > 0.                         (4.32)
                                                               of
Thereis import of indexed bonds, and that dominates over export risky home nominal

bonds.
          With the exchange rate rule, there is   also   a capital account deficit, as under c) above.


e) Coordinated Exchanse Rate Tareets
          Let us finally consider two cases of coordinated exchange rate targets. The first one
istrivial, namely when both countries, in additionto the common exchange rate target,
pursues a world inflationtarget instead of individual inflation targets. It is easy to see that
the asset availability in this case is equivalent to the one under c) above when both countries
have individual inflation targets and the homecountryshifts to an individual exchange rate

target. As under c) asset trade is thus unaffected by the change to a common exchange rate

target.
          The other case is when the homeand foreign countries adopt a world norninai GDP

target in addition   to the common exchange rate target. Then home and foreign bonds are
perfect substitutesfor risky claims to world output,
                                             m = n = w,                                    (4.33)
with expected dividends and variance

                           w2 = 2      2 and             = Chll + _}f + ff.                (4.34)

Using this and (Al) in (2.9), we have
                                                21




                                                       = (a - n*)/2.
                         z=   z = (a - o*)a1/a                                     (4.35)

       When the countries have the same i'isk aversion, there is obviously no trade in either

risky nominal bonds or indexed bonds, and a balanced capital account:
                                         z = z0 = 0.                               (4.36)
It is natural to compare this outcome with the outcome when the two countries initially

pursue individual nominal GOP targets, w1iich is the first case analyzed under a). There the
capital account was also balanced, but there was gross trade in nominal bonds: the home
country exporting home bonds and importing foreign bonds.
       When the honie country is more risk averse, (A3b), the adoptionof a common

exchange rate target makes the home countryexport risky nominal bonds
                                            z   <0                                  (4.37)

(unless home and foreign Output are perfectly negatively correlated).
       What about trade in indexed bonds, and the sign of the capital account? We know
from the case discussed under heading c) that in the absence of trade in risky assets, there
would be import of indexed bonds, and a capital account deficit. Indeed, it can be shown

(see appendix) that indexed bonds are imported,

                                           z0
                                                > 0,                                (4.38)
and that indexed bonds import dominates over nominal bonds export so that that capital

account is in deficit,

                                      q0(z0 + Z)
                                                  > 0.                            (4.39)
In this case adopting an exchange rate target for monetary policies would not cause a

reversal of the capital account.


5. Conclusions
       \Ve have investigated how different monetary policies affect the risk- return

characteristics of nominal assets and how this in turn affects real decisions-- savings and

portfolio allocations-- in an incomplete markets setting. Our results indicate that one should
not hope for any unambigous answers to the main question: how less exchange rate
                                                 22



variability influences trade in assetsandnet foreign investment. Depending on tbe initial

policies   at borne awl abroad, a monetary policy aiming at reduced exchange rate variability
may imply very different effects on the trade pattern in assets. Net foreign investment
may- - on the one extreme- - not be affectedat all, or- - on the other extreme— - change sign:
from positive to negative, or from negative to positive.

           Nevertheless, we believe that the general question that we have addressed- - how real
trade is affected by monetary and exchange rate policy in an uncertain world with
incomplete markets- - is worth pursuing further. We can think of a number of extensions of
the simplistic framework in this paper. Withinthe context of our model, we assumed the
existence of indexed bonds throughout the analysis. Tius was mostly for analytical

convenience; the model becomes muchharderto solve if there are no indexed bonds.

Unfortunately,     the assumption that indexed bonds are traded is not innocuous; it does affect
the results   in several of the cases that we considered. But we do believe that an extension
without indexed bonds is feasible, however, and that such an extension is both well
motivatedand interesting. It      is well motivated because international   trade in indexed bonds
is not empirically significant. It is interesting because without indexed bonds savings and
portfolio decisions can not be separated   at all.
           The trade patterns and capital accounts discussed in our model are relative to
autarky. This means that the "capital account"        is somewhat   a misnomer. Discussions of
capital movements meaning changes in portfolios over time requires a framework with
several periods, which raises many well known technical difficulties.1S Also, the comparisons

between different policy regimes are of course comparisons of different equilibria with given

regimes, not analysis of changes over time in equilibria from changes over time in policy. A
proper analysis of the latter is also associated with well known difficulties.   It may be that
one can make some progress ems the effect of policy changes by analyzing our model witis

arbitrary (instead of zero) initial portfolios, and then letting the initial portfolios represent


15          See Dumas (1986) for a model where portfolio adjustment takes place over time.
                                                   23




the Steady— slate portfolios   ii   particular policy regimes.
       The niudel could he extended to include investment in physical capital, so as to make

possible a richer analysis of the link between exchange rate risk and foreign invcstment.11 Oie
could also include more   than one good and analyze the connection between exchange rate
risk and foreign (ateinporal) ti ade.1a It is sometimes argued that the main effect of nominal

exchange rate variabilityis to cause real exchange rate variability, that is, relative goods

price variability. For exchange rate risk to be associated with relative price risk one has to
incorporate predetermined or 'sticky' goods prices, however.
       The sources of uncemainty in the model is period 2 outputs and possibly period 2

money supplies. One may wonder what effect uncertainty in money demands would have.
It is not difficult to incorporate uncertain money demand velocity as a separatesource of

uncertainty. It is easy to see that the benchmark monetary policies of stabilizing nominal
GOP, stabilizing inflation/theprice level, and stabilizing nominal exchange rates have
exactly the same consequences as when velocity is certain. These policy rules have well
defined effects on the real returns on nominal bonds independently of what type of shocks
are present. 1-lowever, with uncertain velocity a passive policy rule of constant money

supply is no longer equivalent to stabilizing nominal GOP, and in that case nonainal bonds
are no longer equivalent to claims to output.

       Since the agents are optimizing and there are well- defined utility levels, it is

tempting to use the model to discuss the welfare consequences of monetary policies. This
should be done with great care, though. Our setup with incomplete markets has an inherent
bias against exchange rate stabilizing policy, since such policy generally reduces the number
of available assets and hence reduces the scope for risk- sharing. Of course, it should also he

remembered that our model does riot incorporate the informational frictions that make

       One may, of course, also criticize our positive analysis on the sanse grounds. Put

analysis for not including the reasons why markets are incomplete. Given the svell known
difficulties to conic up with   a satisfactory   explanation for the existence of nominal contracts,
we suspect that an attempt to derive the asset structure from first principles would violate
the starting point for our whole analysis, namely the absointe preponderance of oominal

contracts in international financial markets.

A I)DOfldix

        We     want to derive (4.13),      (4.20) and (4.21). Suppose temporarily that the capital

account is zero,    that is,
                                                         =-    Z.                              (Al)
Then we have
                                                               = Uc(x*2-
     q0(-Z)
            =
              U(x2 + Z)/tJ(y') and q0(Z)                                       Z)/U(y).         (A.2)

Under assumptions (Al) and (A2) it fohows that

        sign q0(z0 + Z)    =-              (x2 - Z)] = sign [2Z - (x2 - x*2)1. (A.3)
                                  sign [(x2 + Z) -
        First consider the case (4.2): m = n = f. Unrler assumption (Al), it follows from
                                                   11,



(4.4) and (4.5) that
                                      Z=   (         =    (     *)(2 7Wa)

                                            '
                                     *)q1                                                       (A.4)

Also, as discussed  immediately after (4.12),
                   2
                 x x =
                     - 2          *  w2    7
                                             w
                                                         eww! = (o
                                                                          *      -2 w
                                                                              )(2y - 7

(A.5)
where   the last equality follows since             =          + eff + 2ehf = 2(ehlI+f) =
Thus, we get
                                        2Z - (x2x*2) =         (*   w)7"eWh.                    (A.6)

Substituting (AG) into (A.3) proves (4.13).
         Next consider the case (4.14): m = n = f. From (4.15) and the definition (2.4), the

variances of consumption are
                                           =      + Zc1f + 2zehf              and               (A.7)
                                                  = iYff+ zaff       2ZJ1f.                     (A.7*)

 From (A.7) and the definitions of x2 and x*2, one can, after some manipulations, derive
        x2 -   x2 = 2z(2- 7Cf) -                    (l+z)2eff-                 (- ')2z.         (AS)

 The expression for qf = q in (4.16) and the definition of                allow us to rewrite (A.S) as

                               x2 -   x2 = 2Z -   (      7*)((l+z)2U/2 - u*zef).                (A.9)
 It follows that
                                                 26



                        2Z - (x2x*2) =     (   )((1+z)2eff/2
which together with (A.3) pi.oves (4.20) and (4.21).
                                                                -
                                                                    azcf),              (A.10)


       It is easy to verify that if the conditions in the text are fulfIlled, q0(z0 + Z) may well

be negative   in this case. To see this substitute the equilibrium value of z from    (4.16) into

(4.21). As an example let the critical parameter values be     7     2,       = and hf = 7Of/S.
                                                                                1



Straightforwardcalculationsshow that q0(z0 + Z) = - 1/8.
       Let us finally consider the case m = n = w and demonstrate(4.3S)and (4.39). Under

(Al) we have
     a = yV2 = 22, =              =                   and eliw = fw =                   (All)
                                      2(allll+ehf),                       hh+Jhi
It follows from (2.8) and (2.9) that

                               q=       = 2y2 - 2(%l5+hf) and                            (A.12)
                                       z=         (*)/9                                  (A.13)

This and somealgebra gives
              _9     _9,(
        2Z - (x - x*_) =          7)(°ll + %f)[Olth/2(o•l.ih+hf) - z].
                                                                          9
                                                                                     (A.14)
We have z2      1/4 by (A.13) (z2 <    1/4 for 7> 0 and 'K > 0), and we have
  1/4 by 1if     hh (cllIl/2(llh+elIf) > 1/4 for 1if < hh)          Hence, for either positive
absolute risk aversion or home and foreign output less than perfectly correlated, we get
                                        2Z- (x2- x*2) >0,                                (A.15)
and this together with (A.3) implies (4.3S) and (4.39).
