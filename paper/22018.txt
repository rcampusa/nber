Health Capacity to Work at Older Ages in Denmark

                                         ABSTRACT

Longevity is increasing and many people are spending a greater proportion of their lives reliant
on pensions to support consumption. In response to this, several countries have mandated delays
to age of first entitlement to pension benefits in order to reduce incentives to retire early.
However, it is unknown to what extent older individuals have the health capacity to sustain the
longer working lives that delayed pension benefits may encourage. We estimate the health
capacity to work longer in Denmark by comparing how much older individuals work today with
how much those with similar mortality rates worked in the past, and how much younger
individuals today with similar self-assessed health work. We find substantial health capacity for
longer working lives among those currently aged 55 and above. We also find significant
heterogeneity by education and gender. Those with a high school degree have the greatest
additional work capacity, women have more additional capacity than men, especially women
with a college degree.

                   Health capacity to work at older ages in Denmark


1 Introduction
Many countries are increasing the ages at which pension benefits are first available, and thereby
reducing incentives to retire early. Moreover, with increased life expectancy, the global move from
defined benefit towards defined contribution pension plans implies lower per period consumption,
all else equal, unless individuals work longer and retire later. Both of these changes push toward
delayed retirement, but it remains to be shown that individuals have the health capacity to sustain
extended working lives. Indeed, much of the work we have done in previous stages of the
International Social Security project (Wise, 2015), which relates to retirement age responsiveness to
pension incentives (Bingley, et.al., 2004), health (Bingley, et.al., 2012) and disability insurance
(Bingley, et.al., 2015), implicitly assumes that individuals have sufficient unused health capacity to
work at older ages. In this study we will estimate how much unused health capacity to work exists.


Amongst OECD countries, Denmark has relatively short life expectancy and late age of first
eligibility to old age pension. These combined to give Danes the lowest life expectancy after
pensionable age 1993-2002 (13.4 years for men and 16.6 years for women). Old age pension
benefits could first be received at age 67 until 2004, and this was reduced to age 65 by 2006 in 6
month steps. In 2011 it was announced that during 2019-22 the age of first eligibility will once
again be raised to 67 in 6 month steps. Life expectancy after pensionable age jumped by 3 years
during the 2000 decade, the largest increase of all countries, but after the 2019-22 reform is
implemented Danes will once again have the shortest expected retirements (OECD 2011).


Denmark was the first country to automatically link pensions to life expectancy in their retirement
income system (Whitehouse, 2007). From 2030, Denmark will link changes in age of first eligibility
to old age pension to changes in life expectancy from age 60. The aim is to maintain life expectancy
after pensionable age close to the 14.5 years observed in 2004-5, the two years before the automatic
linkage reform was announced (Ministry of Integration and Social Affairs, 2013). However, the rate
of increase due to automatic linkage with life expectancy is capped such that pensionable age can at
most increase by one year every fifth year. Projected life expectancy from age 60 in 2025 (minus
14.5 years) is rounded to the nearest half year to give the implied pensionable age in 2030. The
projection to 2025 uses life expectancy from age 60 during 2013-14 and assumes a trend which



                                                                                                      1
adds 0.6 years. These calculations imply a pensionable age in 2030 of 69.5 years, but since
pensionable age can only increase by at most one year, eligibility will be from age 68 in 2030.


In several countries, gains in longevity are expected to outpace announced future delays in
pensionable ages. Denmark has amongst the shortest life expectancies after pensionable age and has
a history of policy attention to the measure. This makes Denmark an excellent case for measuring
health capacity for extending the working life, since post retirement longevity itself, regardless of
health status, is a greater constraint in Denmark than anywhere else. Finding unused work capacity
in Denmark ought to be a greater challenge because of the high base of work capacity used already.


In this paper we ask to what extent older Danes have the health capacity to extend their working
lives. We do this by estimating health-employment relationships in the past, or for younger cohorts
today, and predicting how much work capacity there would be for older cohorts in similar health
today if those estimated relationships held for today's older cohorts. Ideally we would like to know
what the health-employment relationship might be in the absence of non-health-related social
security programs. We take two approaches to obtaining this counterfactual health-employment
relationship, by fitting the relationship historically before the introduction of early pension benefit
programs, or by fitting the relationship for younger cohorts today who have not yet reached pension
benefit eligibility age.


For the first approach following Milligan and Wise (2012), we look at the historical relationship
between mortality and employment rates and ask how much would older people work today, given
current mortality rates, if they were to work as much as they did at a similar mortality rate in the
past? Using published data from Statistics Denmark, we plot the mortality-employment relationship
for several years from 1977 to 2010 and find significant unused work capacity compared to today
for all baselines up until 2000. We only estimate mortality-employment relations for men for the
sake of better comparison with other countries, where increasing older female labor market
participation makes estimates for women difficult to interpret.


For the second approach, inspired by Cutler and coauthors (2012), we estimate the relationship
between self-assessed health (SAH) and employment for somewhat younger cohorts and ask how
much older cohorts, with similar SAH, would work if the same health-employment relationship



                                                                                                          2
held. We use micro data from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe for Denmark
(SHARE-Denmark) collected 2004-13 to estimate the relationship for those aged 50-54 and to
predict work capacity for ages 55-74. We find significant unused work capacity from age 60 and
older for both men and women. Estimated unused work capacity is remarkably similar for the group
that we consider using both methods - for men aged 55-69 - when we use a 1977 mortality-
employment relationship baseline. The Cutler method implies 4.8 years and the Milligan-Wise
method implies 4.6 years unused work capacity, compared to 7.6 years currently working. Women
are predicted to have slightly more unused work capacity than men using the Cutler method for ages
55-69 at 5.1, compared to 6.1 years currently working.


The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: As background, the next section describes
trends in labor force participation, health and mortality. In section 3 we estimate work capacity
using the historical mortality-employment relationship following Milligan and Wise (2012). In
section 4 we describe trends in SAH and in section 5 we estimate the SAH-employment relationship
for younger cohorts following Cutler and coauthors (2012). Finally we conclude with a discussion
of the implications of our findings.


2 Trends in Labor Force Participation and Health


This section summarizes the trends in labor force participation in Denmark over the last 50 years for
men and women aged 60-69. We split the discussion for those aged 60-64 and 65-69 because of
data availability and differences in eligibility to pension benefits between these two age groups.
Figure 1 presents the evolution of labor force participation for 60-64 year olds based on several
different sources.

Until the late 1990s, trends in labor force participation by gender are very different from each other,
with a 70 percentage point differential in 1960 declining to 18 percentage points by 2013. The
initial decline for men in the 1960s reflects structural change with a sectoral shift of employment
from agriculture, which was comprised largely of independent farmers, towards industry. The
dramatic decline in labor force participation for men in 1980 is the initial impact from introduction
of a non-health related pension benefit program - the Post Employment Wage (PEW - efterløn),
with eligibility ages 60-66, depending on sufficiently long membership of an Unemployment
Insurance fund. For women, the initial impact was much smaller because of lower baseline
participation and less PEW eligibility among working women due to insufficient history of
Unemployment Insurance fund membership.


The strong upswing in labor force participation rates from the late 1990s, also found in many other
OECD countries, see e.g. Larsen and Pedersen (2013), is the result of several interacting factors.


                                                                                                                            4
Since 1999 a number of policy changes have been made with the aim of discouraging early
retirement. Further, average education and health has improved strongly for this group with
retirement age having a positive gradient in both factors, cf. Larsen and Pedersen (2015). Actually,
60-64 year olds are the only age group to have experienced an increase in labor force participation
rate since the onset of the Great Recession in 2008. For all younger age groups, participation rates
have fallen since 2008, especially among the young. However, in spite of improvements in health to
which we return below, labor force participation for men aged 60-64 is still 20 percentage points
below the level of the late 1970s. Our aim is to estimate the potential work capacity of today’s older
cohorts in view of reductions in mortality and SAH improvements of recent years.


In Figure 2 we present the development of labor force participation for those aged 65-69. For men,
the initial level is about 30 percentage points lower than for the 60-64 year olds. We find the same
steep decline in labor force participation in the second half of the 1960s as found for the 60-64 year
olds, reflecting the same switch from independent farming. Following the introduction of PEW in
1979 labor force participation falls, although less steeply than for the 60-64 year olds because, of
this older group, only those aged 65-66 were eligible for PEW. The next visible change in labor
force participation rates occurs in the years immediately after 2000 which continues the increases in
labor force participation for 60-64 year olds in the preceding period. During 2004-2006 65-66 year
olds were no longer eligible for PEW as the age for first eligibility to Old Age Pension
(folkepension) was reduced from 67 to 65. The modest upward trends since 2000 is somewhat
diminished for men, reflecting this 2004-6 reform. Nevertheless, labor force participation for men in
2013 was half that of 1960. For women aged 65-69 we see a very small increase in labor force
participation after 2000. Overall, however, the level for women is stationary around 10-12 per cent
ever since 1960.

Summing up, for 60-69 year old men labor force participation over the last 30-35 years has declined
by about 20 percentage points. As longevity has increased along with level of education, there is
clearly scope for analyzing the health related factors behind the potential for reversing this decline
as part of accommodating demographic changes in the coming decades.


As an introduction to the analyses of health factors, Figure 3 collects evidence on the development
in mortality and self-assessed health for men aged 50-75 over the last 20 years. Data on self
assessed health are available also for other years, but 1994 and 2013 are the most recent years
where the same questions and response categories were used. The decrease in mortality is strong,
despite the period being fairly short, in contrast to the years before the mid-1990s where mortality
in Denmark was quite stationary at the same time as mortality was decreasing in most comparable

than in 1994 and the gradient with respect to age is more flat in the most recent year.

3. Work Capacity estimates based on historical mortality


We will use two different methods to assess the health related capacity to work at older ages. The
Cutler method is used in Section 5. In this section we present results from applying the methods in
Milligan and Wise (2012) to Danish data. The idea is to look at the relationship between mortality
and employment at given ages in some earlier year. Next, we look at the employment mortality
relationship in a current year. Comparing employment at given levels of mortality in the year back
in time and the current year gives an upper-bound estimate of potential extra work capacity in the
current year.


                                                                                                                                           7
A number of conditions and reservations should be emphasized. First, it is assumed that mortality
captures all health factors related to work capacity. One can argue that better measures than
mortality could summarize physical and mental capacity for continued work at older ages.
However, mortality has the clear advantage of being available over a very long period and being
comparable between countries.
Figure 4 plots the relationship between mortality and employment rate for men 55-69 years old in
1977 and 2010.

The procedure for calculating the upper bound of the additional capacity for work is based on the
lines in Figure 4. For each age, 55-69 years, in 2010 mortality and employment rates are plotted in
Figure 4. For instance, at age 60 in 2010 mortality was 1.0 percent and the employment rate was



                                                                                                                   8
67.4 percent. At that level of mortality, the employment rate in 1977 was 86 per cent. Consequently,
the upper bound of the additional work capacity in 2010 with 1977 as base year was 18.6 percent.
Running this procedure over all ages we find, not surprisingly comparing with Figure 1, that
additional work capacity has a steep gradient in age for people in the first half of their 60s.
The results from the exercise are presented in Table 1. In 2010, the total number of working years
for men 55-69 years old was 7.8. As a counterfactual, this would correspond to a situation where
men 55-63 years old had employment rates of 100 per cent and all retired when reaching age 64.
The accumulated additional employment capacity in 2010 with 1977 as base year is 4.7 years, i.e. a
sizeable 60 per cent of the actual number of years worked.

In Figure 5 the same analysis is made comparing 2010 with the much closer year 1995. While 1977
was two years before the introduction of the PEW program resulting in a steep decline in male
employment rates from age 60, 1995 was a low point in employment rates, cf. Figure 1. An obvious
consequence is that the two graphs in Figure 5 are much closer to each other than the corresponding
curves in Figure 4.


Table 2 summarizes in the same way as Table 1 employment rates and mortality at each age in 2010
along with the employment rate in 1995 at the same mortality rates. A main difference compared
with the case using 1977 as base year is the lack of additional employment capacity at ages 55-59.
At mortality rates above age 60 level in 2010, we find additional employment capacity, most
pronounced at ages 62 to 66. Overall, the additional employment capacity adds up to 1.6 years, or
about one third of the additional employment capacity found in Table 1, which uses a 1977
baseline.

Figure 6 is a summary of the trends in the development of the relationship between mortality and
employment rates by including average values for three five-year intervals, last half of the 1970s –
before the PEW program – first half of the 1990s when employment rates reached a minimum and
the second half of the 2000 decade. A clear illustration of the change over the period is found
looking at the pivotal age of 60. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s the employment rate drops
by 20 percentage points with only a slight decline in mortality. Next, from the early 1990s to the
late 2000s, employment goes up at age 60 along with declining mortality. From Figure 5 we know,
however, that employment for given levels of mortality is still lower in the late 2000s compared
with the early 1990s at age 60 and above.

Next, in Figure 7 we have used all the years between 1977 and 2009 as base years comparing with
the mortality employment relationship in 2010. As expected the estimated additional work capacity
becomes smaller as we move closer to 2010, i.e. differences in mortality rates become smaller and
changes in employment rates also become smaller. From about the turn of the century, additional
work capacity becomes stationary at a level close to zero as mortality declines faster at the same
time as employment rates increase, cf. Figures 1 and 2.

The additional work capacity found by using the Milligan-Wise method does not imply the
normative conclusion that older people should continue working in accordance with the increase in
employment capacity we find. Our finding should instead be seen as a contribution to the arguments
and analyses in the so called “healthy life debate”, i.e. to what extent does increasing longevity
result in more healthy years with a potential for a longer working life, or is most of the gain spent in
poor health and disability. There is a wide ranging literature on this topic of which only a few
contributions are mentioned here. Mathers et al. (2001) calculate healthy life expectancy for 191
countries in 1999 using the method of Sullivan (1971) which combines surveys of SAH with life
tables. They find that healthy life expectancy increases across countries at a faster rate than total life
expectancy. Christensen et al. (2009) present as a conditional projection that most children born in
Denmark since the turn of the century will survive until age 100 and older, but it remains to be
established whether age of onset of functional limitations and disability increases in a similar way.




                                                                                                                          13
Using Danish data for the year 2000, Brønnum-Hansen et al. (2004) considers life expectancy and
health expectancy by educational levels. They find a social gradient in both but the gradient in
health expectancy is greater than in life expectancy. Being a cross-section study, it contains only an
implicit contribution to answer the question about the development over time. An attempt at an
explicit answer is found in Brønnum-Hansen (2005) building on comprehensive Danish surveys
1987-2000, combined with life table data using the Sullivan (1971) method. Over the period,
Brønnum-Hansen (2005) finds disability-free life time increasing more than total life expectancy,
and more so for men than for women.


4. Self-Assessed Health and employment by age over time


An alternative to use of mortality as an overall health indicator is to rely on individuals´ own
evaluation and study SAH from surveys as an indicator for health related capacity for work.
Denmark does not have a time long series of comparable SAH measures. The National Institute of
Public Health conducted a number of surveys beginning in 1987. We have access to micro data
from the 1987 survey, cf. below. For other years data are available in a processed form and results
regarding SAH from two comparable surveys in 1994 and 2013 were included in Figure 3 above.
Besides the National Institute of Public Health surveys, we can use the European Community
Household Panel (ECHP), SHARE and other smaller surveys. For the purpose of the present study,
there are issues regarding lacks of comparability between surveys, coverage of only a short span of
time consistently within surveys, and small sample sizes.


Below we present SAH from these surveys and relate this to the age of eligibility to the major social
security programs. First, Figure 8 presents the relationship between labor force participation rates
and SAH based on a fairly small survey collected in 1977. This provides the only self-assessed
health measure before the introduction of PEW. Results from the survey are described and
discussed in Olsen (1977). SAH is measured on the horizontal axis as the share reporting their
health as fair for my age group to poor. The vertical axis measures average labor force participation
rate at each age. In 1977 Disability Insurance (DI) was the only early exit route from the labor
market before eligibility for old age pension at age 67. The expected negative slope is found in
Figure 8 and the impact of reaching eligibility for old age pension is seen as a decline in labor force




                                                                                                       14
participation of about 30 percentage points without any visible deterioration of SAH – if anything
health improves for a few years right after retirement age.

There is a 10-year gap until the next available SAH measure. Results from a survey conducted by
the National Institute of Public Health in 1987 are shown in Figure 9. The horizontal axis measures
the share of respondents at each age reporting health as fair-poor while the vertical axis measures
labor force participation rates. For smoothing results are shown as 2 year averages. In 1987 PEW
was fully phased in eligibility from ages 60 to 66 followed by OAP from age 67. The slope in
Figure 9 is clearly negative with a major deterioration of SAH from age 55 to the early 60s, Notice
the steep decline in labor force participation from the early 60s until eligibility to old age pension
followed by a moderate improvement of self-assessed health in the late 60s.

Data for Denmark from the ECHP collected in the years 1994-2001 over 8 waves makes it possible
to construct a relationship between SAH and employment rates based on more observations by
pooling over waves. The result is shown in Figure 10 for men ages 50-69. SAH deteriorates quite
rapidly during the 50s while the 60s until age 67 are characterized by a steep drop in employment
rates – more so in the PEW years than close to old age pension – at about the same level of SAH.
After reaching pensionable age, SAH deteriorates again while employment rates remain around 10
per cent.

In Figure 11 we show the relationship between SAH and employment rates based on SHARE data
from wave 4 collected in 2011. It appears that – after a transition from data points for single years to
working with moving 3 year age averages – we still have a “noisy” relationship. However, like in
Figure 10 we have a deterioration of health in the 50s followed by another phase of deterioration
from the mid 60s. In between, employment rates drop significantly, first reflecting PEW and at
higher age old age pension where the age of eligibility from 2004-6 has been 65 years.

Once again using Danish data from the ECHP averaged over the 8 waves between 1994 and 2001,
Figure 12 shows the relationship between SAH and employment, but now separately for the three
education levels classified as ISCED 0-2, ISCED 3 and ISCED 5-7. Lines for different education
levels are nearly completely separated. Employment rates are initially at the same level at 50. The
difference in employment rates has increased to 10 percentage points at age 55, increasing to a
difference of 25 percentage points at age 65.


In summary, the general pattern of reducing labour force participation rate and worsening SAH as
men age is clear throughout. However, given the infrequency with which SAH has been surveyed in
Denmark, and the lack of comparability of SAH between surveys it is not possible to speak about
trends over time. Nevertheless, the relationship is steepest (greatest falls in participation for modest
falls in SAH) during ages of eligibility to early pension benefits. There are striking SAH
differentials by education, with the SAH deterioration from age 50 to 70 within schooling level
(compulsory, high school and college) roughly equal to mean SAH differences between schooling

4. Work Capacity estimates based on Self-Assessed Health


In a second approach to estimating health capacity to work we ask how much would older cohorts
work today, if they had the same relationship between SAH and employment as younger cohorts
have today. This approach is inspired by Cutler and coauthors (2012) who use HRS data to estimate
the relationship between SAH, retirement and Disability Insurance receipt for the near elderly and
use estimates to simulate behavior of the elderly.


We use data from SHARE-Denmark which was collected in 2004, 2006, 2011 and 2013, that is
waves 1, 2, 4 and 5. SHARE-life was conducted as wave 3 and contained retrospective questions
about life histories, but not contemporaneous SAH, so we cannot use this wave for the current


                                                                                                                                  19
analysis. SHARE is a longitudinal survey that collects data across nineteen European countries on
individuals aged 50 or more and their spouses (Börsch-Supan et al., 2013). It has much in common
with HRS, Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) and English Longitudinal Study of
Ageing (ELSA), making it an ideal dataset for our study which should be as comparable as possible
with similar studies for other countries.

Descriptive statistics for SHARE-Denmark are presented in table 3 by age group and gender. Our
estimations and simulations will be conducted separately by gender and these age groupings. In
total we have 3273 observations of men and 3650 observations of women. Proportion working is
always higher for men than for women, is high and fairly stable before age 60 and then falls through
age 70, most of the reduction taking place in the late 60's for men, but evenly throughout the 60s for
women. Younger age groups have more schooling, especially at the college margin, and markedly
so for women. SAH worsens with age, but levels and profiles are quite similar by gender. Men are
much more likely to be overweight than women and there is a slight age gradient in obesity for men
with younger men being more obese than older. Women have more limitations than men both
physically and with regard to activities of daily living. Doctor visits are common for both men and
women, though somewhat less for men in their 50's. Men are more likely to have had a hospital stay
than women. Nursing home stays are very uncommon. Of the eight specific health conditions
considered, back problems are the most common for all ages. Arthritis doubles from the early 50's
to early 70's. Diabetes and hypertension are more common in women, and heart disease and stroke
are more common in men.


In order to estimate the relationship between SAH and employment we need to characterize health
in a way that allows for comparison with other countries. We calculate a single health index
following Poterba and coauthors (2013), who create an index that is a reasonable predictor of
mortality in HRS data. Using the health variables described in table 3, SAH, body mass index, types
of limitations, care usage and a set of specific health conditions, we calculate the first principal
component for both genders and all age groups pooled. This principal component is used to predict
a single health index and we normalize this index to percentiles, where by convention a higher
percentile indicates better health. For example (wo)men aged 50-54 have mean percentile 58 (54),
(wo)men 70-74 have mean percentile 44 (39).

OLS regression estimates for the dependent variable working are presented in table 4. The sample is
aged 50-54 and regressions are run separately for men and women. Better health is strongly and
positively associated with employment. A move of 10 percentiles up the health distribution is
associated with a 4.6 percentage point higher employment probability for women and 3.7
percentage point higher employment probability for men. High school and especially college is
associated with higher employment probability. Married individuals are more likely to be working.
Goodness-of-fit is somewhat better for women than for men.


Using the estimates from table 4 for the youngest of our age groups, we simulate work capacity by
predicting on the basis of health and demographic characteristics for older age groups. In doing this
we are assuming that the health-employment relationship is constant between age groups, so that we
can meaningfully combine coefficients estimated on the younger group together with observed
characteristics of the older groups for simulation. One threat to the stability of this relationship
might be differences in skills, occupations and industry affiliation by age group. Jobs differ in their
health demands and we need to assume the health-employment relationship is fixed across age
groups for whom different types of jobs might be relevant. Furthermore, while our health index
appears quite comprehensive, there may be health conditions we are unable to measure but which
are negatively correlated with ability to work. Such omitted health factors would bias our work
capacity estimates upward - we would be overstating the amount of unused work capacity.

Results from the simulation exercise are presented in table 5 by age group and gender. Predicted
work capacity changes only slightly with age, falling by 5 percent for men and 10 percent for
women from the late 50's through till the early 70's. In order to simulate unused work capacity we
calculate the difference between predicted work capacity and observed employment. When
combined with observed employment levels which are rapidly declining with age, we simulate little
unused work capacity in the late 50's, large unused capacity in the early 60's and very large unused
capacity from the late 60's. Women's unused work capacity exceeds men’s until the early 60's,
whereas men have more unused capacity from their 70's. Figures 13a and 13b graphically present
the simulation exercise from table 7.

In table 6 we extend our simulation exercise on the basis of the same set of estimates from table 4,
but now additionally splitting the simulation by level of schooling. Once again, similar information
to that contained in table 6 is also presented visually in figures 14a and 14b. Employment
differentials by schooling exceed differences in simulated work capacity across the age range, and
especially so for women. Despite the large differences in work capacity by schooling, simulated
unused work capacity is quite similar for the late 50's and early 60's. It is for the late 60's where
schooling differences in unused work capacity are most obvious, increasing by 12 percent from
primary to high school and 5 percent from high school to college for women, whereas it is
increasing by 10 percent from primary to high school but decreasing by 16 percent from high school
to college for men. Men in their late 60's with a college degree are much more likely to be
employed than men of the same age with a high school diploma, whereas health for the two groups
is quite similar, leading to a similar level of simulated work capacity.

A convenient summary measure of unused work capacity that can be computed for this approach
and for the previous approach is the total number of simulated years of unused work capacity over
the age range 55-69. In section 3, Figure 7 presented implied years of unused capacity for different
baselines. Our preferred baseline is 1977, which pre-dates the announcement of early pension
benefits through the PEW program in 1978. This gives an unused work capacity for men of 4.6
years, which is consistent between methods. In table 7 we present simulated years of unused work
capacity for our SAH based approach. For men this is quite close at 5.0 additional years. Women
have 6 more months unused work capacity than men. By level of schooling, women with primary or
high school have 3-4 months more unused work capacity than men, but at the college level women
have a year longer unused work capacity than men. Men and women with high school degrees have
3-5 months more unused work capacity than those with different schooling.

6. Conclusion


Already mandated changes to future pension benefits will reduce incentives to retire early with the
aim of extending the length of working lives. The implicit assumption is that older individuals
actually have the health capacity to work longer. We have tested this assumption for Denmark using
two methods. First, following Milligan and Wise (2012), we ask how much would older people
work today, given current mortality rates, if they were to work as much as people did at a similar
mortality rate in the past. Next, following Cutler and coauthors (2012), we ask how much would
older cohorts work given their SAH, if they were to work as much as younger cohorts today do with
similar SAH. Both are ways of estimating health-employment relationships that we then use for




                                                                                                     27
predicting how much work capacity there would be for older cohorts in similar health today if those
estimated relationships held for today's older cohorts.


With both methods we find substantial unused work capacity. For men we are able to compare
simulations between methods and findings are very similar when we consider a 1977 baseline for
the mortality-employment relationship, before introduction of an important early pension benefit
program. We simulate 4.6-5.0 additional years of health capacity to work for men between ages 55
and 69. This compares to baseline male employment of 7.6 years during 2004-13. For women we
simulate 5.5 additional years of work capacity between ages 55 and 69, compared to baseline
employment of 6.2 years. There are differences in additional work capacity by level of schooling.
Those with a high school degree have the most unused work capacity. Women have more unused
work capacity than men across the schooling distribution, especially at the college level where the
difference is one year.


There are several caveats that need to be applied to our simulations. Most importantly our unused
capacity numbers have no implications for how much older individuals should work. It is beyond
the scope of our study to discuss whether longer working lives are desirable for society. Health has
improved for the older population, whether measured by reduced mortality or better SAH, and this
suggests that some additional work capacity is available. Both of the approaches we have followed
assume that all health gains can be translated into longer working lives, but there are significant real
world constraints on this, such as labor demand, workplace discrimination and accommodation, and
household and family factors. Our additional work capacity simulations are quite large and these
caveats should moderate those somewhat. Nevertheless, our aim was to ask whether Danes have the
health capacity to extend working lives by three years over the next fifteen, as currently announced
policies assume. Our findings suggest that this additional health capacity to work does indeed exist.
