                     ISRAEL'S CRISIS AND ECONOMIC REFORM:
                           A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE


                                   ABSTRACT

     This article analyses the roots of the deep crisis that has afflicted the
Israeli economy since 1973 and the attempt at economic reform and recovery
since 1985. All of these are discussed against the background of the long-term
evolution in Israel's structure and growth process. At the center of the
analysis lie the implications of an oversized government and especially the
devastating effects on growth and inflation of the large and persistent public
sector deficit on top of the growing tax and public expenditure levels. The
norm of "living beyond one's means" at the public sector level has also
severely affected the norms of behavior of the private, household as well as
business, sectors.
     Since 1985 there have been signs of recovery originating from the
balancing of the budget and the relative stabilization of the currency. Labour
and capital markets are gradually becoming more flexible and real interest
rates are coming down. Even so, inflation rates are not yet down to
international levels, continued budget balance is not assured and excessive
wage increases have substantially diminished profit rates and investments in
the business sector. Structural problems, rooted in economic mismanagement of
the crisis years, are surfacing.
     Resumption of a sustained growth process requires persistent budget
balance and a substantial additional reduction in public expenditure and tax
levels. Structural reforms, only barely started, have to be persistently
followed in the labour and capital markets, in the fiscal system, and in the
further opening up of commodity and financial markets to competition from both
home and abroad.

     The Israeli economy, like Israeli society, has always provided a
fascinating area of esearch.      Although the state was burr in l748.
economic structure had been laid down at least 25 vears earlier.
Within just a few decades, a thriving, modern and diversifeu ecorcnv
crew up here on the basis of the first small economic oase which was
established by the N20s.        From the early twenties, the uisnuv. trim
country's Jewish population, rose from only 80,000 to 600,000 in 1948 a
7.5—fold increase), while the gross national product crew 25 times o.er
the same period.    In the first twenty five years since independence,1c48
to 1972, the country's population quadrupled, while its GNP increased
10—fold.    Thus, in the space of 50 years, the population grew 30 times,
while its economic activity increased by a factor of 250. truly

a The year 1922 can be taken as a reasonable starting point.     It was at
least, the first year for which we have properly defined economic
indicators, compiled and analyzed by the late Robert Szereszewski, who
fell in action during the Six Day War (the study appeared posthumousl.in
1968)
                                    -2—


orobably no other economy in the world where, in the course of half
acentury (from 1922 to 1972), per cpita GNP rose from just     15'!.   to one
half of the corresponding U.S. figure, and reached a level equivalent to
three quarters of the average prevailing in Western Europe.
       But 1973 was marked by an unprecedented crisis.     Economic growth
virtually came to a halt, the balance of payments deficit rose to
alarming proportions and, worst of all,       Israel began to eaer-1ence
nflatin on a scale which only the generation of our parents had known,
albeit more briefly and more intensively, in Europe during the l920s.
The Yom Kippur War of that year heralded a decade and mare of economic
stagnation.     This period, sometimes known as the lost decade, was a
time of deep economic and social crisis in every sense of the word,
affecting nt only the countrys economic structure, but also norms of
socio—economic behavior.
       fter 12 years, the stabilization plan of 1985, may be heralding the
beginning of a turning point. There have been considerable achievements
on the stabilization front.         However, with respect to structural
adjustment, the economy resembles a bruised and battered war veteran, on
the road to recovery, but still not quite rehabilitated.        Only after
another five or ten years (perhaps on the State's 50th anniversary) we
may be able to say if this was a real turning—point with regard to long
term growth.
       Bearing these facts in mind, we shall ask a series of questions
grouped around two sets of issues:
1.     What were the nature and causes of the economic crisis Israel had
experienced since 1973?        Was it mainly the result of international
developments or did   its   origins lie closer home?     This question has
already been the subject of considerable research.       Here I would refer
to a series of research papers written at the Maurice Falk Institute
during the height of the crisis, in 1982—84. Nonetheless, it would be
interesting to take a fresh look at the diagnose of the crisis from the


     See The Israeli Economy: Maturing Through Crises, edited by V. Ben—
Porath, Harvard University Press, 1986.        ll of the articles in this
publication, most of which will be mentioned subequently, are very
relevant to the present discussion.

vantage point of the first stages of recovery. In order to chart the road
to further recovery an in—depth understanding of the roots of the crisis
is required.
2.    In what sense, if at all, did the economy show signs of real recovery
during the past four years?         Economic developments since 1987 and
particularly during the States 40th anniversary year. 1988, were notable
for the extent of structural economic problems which have surfaced.        In
view of the more recent developments, what is the chance of achievina
steady economic growth within a reasonable period of time, while securing
increased price stability and at the same time adapting to the trends
towards greater integration especially in The New Europe of ic'927      What
economic reforms are necessary in order to achieve these targets?
       In the following pages we will try and answer these questions, using
past long—term and especially the more recent economic developments as a

background.


2 Growth, Productivity and Inflation over the years 1960—86
       We start by examining the development and composition   of business
sector GDP——the contributions of factors of production, capital and
labor, and the 'unexplained residual, total productivity, which captures
the effects of changes in factor quality and utilization, as well as any
other elements that might help explain why output should have grown
faster than factor input.     For this purpose, we will use the   analyt ical

framework which was first applied by Dr. . L. Gaathon' to the Israeli
economy.
       Figure 1 shows the average business sector GDP growth rate since
1950 by sub—periods.tm      (The height of the rectangle describes the
average rate of growth, while its width corresponds to the relative
length of the period ).       The    two periods, 1950—60 and 1961—72, are
characterized by a very fast rate of GDP growth. This growth is composed
of a significant labor force contribution deriving from successl.ve waves


     See A. L. Gaathon (1971); see ala 3. Metzer    (1986) and M. 5yrquin
(1986).
      The figures on which the rates of growth are based are contained in
Table 2 in the appendix.
                                           -4—


of immigrat ion, as well as the substantial capital investment which
accompanied the growth process and made it possible. Some 30 percent of

the growth in the GDP can be attributed to each of these two factors of
production. Overall productivity accounts for the 40 percent unexplained
residual.        The 25 years prior to the birth of the State were, by          and

large,     characterized by the same growth patterns. [see Syrkins figures
(1986)].

     Fig. 1 highlights the dramatic fall in the growth rate after 1973,
from some 10 percent to an average of 3—4 percent up till 19814 and 1.
percent in the years 19 82—84.            This drop is even sharper when the period
1961—67 (which includes the recession of 1965—67) is taken out of the
second rectangle in           Fig. 2.      Between the Six Day and Yom Kippur Wars,
1967—72. when the contr ibution of large—scale immigration to the labor
force was augmented           by an inflow of workers from the administered
territories, business sector GDP grew at an average annual rate of 12
percent     (   ),   before   declining     to just a quarter of this figure after
1973. The diagram also reveals several other notable features.
     Firstly, there was a very significant decline in the contribution of
labor to GDF growth after 1973.             The growth rate of the business sector
employment dropped from appr oximately 4 percent a year to only one
percent (see Table 1 in the app endix).            This phenomenon can only partly
be explained by the decline                in immigration after 1973.     No less
influential in reducing business sector employment was the increasingly
large entry of new members of the labor force into the public service
sector.         By the very nature of their employment, these workers make no
direct contribution to business sector GDP.
     Secondly, there was a              sharp drop in the residual productivity
element whose contribution fell from 4 percent in the years of rapid
growth to only 0.6 percent during the years 1973—81, while it fell even
more (to the point of negative productivity growth) in 1982—84.               These
reductions in productivity growth are all the more noticeable considering
that, surprisingly enough, capital stock continued to grow rapidly even
after 1973 (see the middle segment of the rectangles in Fig. 1).                The

growth in capital stock can be attributed to the unprecedented government
subsidization of investments,               whereby half of investment      finance
                                   —5


consisted of a government grant.t At least part of these investments
were made in unprofitable activities and led to the accumulation of
substantial, unutilized capital stock, financed at highly negative real
ir.terest rates.   The eventual need to replace this credit by more
realistically (and later, excessively) priced market credit resulted in
financial imbroglios from which the economy is still suffering today.
See, for example, a recent article on the moshav economy by Sussman,
Kislev and Lerman (1989)..    The continued large growth in capital stack
concurrent with progressively declining productivity shows that there was
a substantial waste of resources, illustrating only too well the argument
that large—scale subsidization of investment does not necessarily lead to
viable economic growth.
     Fig. I   also shows the rise in output after 1984.    During 1985—87,
business sector product grew by an annual average of nearly 6 percent,
more than half of which derived from increased productivity.            The

cumulative    productivity growth in these three years exceeded the
accumulated growth in productivity during the entire 12 years of the
recession, as can be roughly gauged by comparing the appropriate areas of
the rectangles in Fig. 2.        If we also consider the slow-down recorded
during 1988 and take an overall view of the four years 1985—88, this
recovery will appear less impressive, but no less exceptional.        It is

still too early to say whether this growth in economic activity was a
one—time achievement, which was to a large extent fueled by the continued
fast rise in private consumption, as we will see below, or if it
signalled the beginning of genuine renewed growth.    At a later stage, we
will discuss the conditions necessary for ensuring that the average
growth rate of 1985—87 will henceforth continue, and be accompanied by
renewed investment.    The direct contribution to the business sector GDP
of the capital stock in 1995—88 was marginal, as is shown in the figure,
reflecting the reduced rate of investment throughout the economy.      This

effect will also be discussed later.


   Mo st of it is ex—post subsidization derived from the availability of

huge, unlinked development loans at a time of rising inflation —        see
Litvi n and Meridor (1982).

      The year       1973, as we have noted, marked an unprecedented and
extremely grave juncture for the economy, which plunged into a long.
drawn—out crisis. Since that year also saw the world economy sink into a
recession, we should once again ask to what extent Israel's economic woes
can be attributed           to external factors, or whether they resulted from
policy which failed to properly respond to the international crisis and
adjust the structure of the economy to the new economic environment.

the QECD economies, while the right—hand one describes the semi—
industrialized economies.              In the absence of sequential data on the
latter for each period, a sample of ten was used for the years 1981-a?
[for further details see Bruno (1986)).                         For 1981—87, these are the
economies defined by the IMF as manufacturing exporters.                                    Korea,
Singapore and Yugoslavia appear in both groups, while the second group

partial comparison shows that the difference between the two groups in
terms      of    average       developments         over      time was not significant.
Accordingly, the right—hand rectangle can be regarded as a representative
point of comparison.

l9SOs, when GOP per employee fell and inflation rose sharply in Israel
while the latter was declining elsewhere.a
     After the implementation of the economic stabilization program in
1985, Israel's relative position, as regards inflation as well as its
GDP growth rate, improved considerably (inflation, however, remained
substantially higher than in the average of the           other     country

groupings).   Fig. 2 highlights the persistently high growth rate of the
semi—industrialized countries with which Israel had so proudly compared
itself in the l960s. It is still not certain whether Israel's 5.7
percent average growth rate indicated in the diagram will be maintained
in the years to come.   Two conclusions can thus be drawn from Fig. 2.
Firstly, Israel's economy deteriorated significantly more than other
countries during the years of the world crisis, particularly when the
industrialized countries had already begun to recover             from   the

recession." Secondly, even though      there     has   been   a     relative
improvement in recent years, Israel still lags behind these countries,
as regards bath inflation and the growth rate.
       A more detailed analysis of the performance of the industrial
economies indicates that while all of them suffered from continued
unemployment and inflation (stagflation) resulting from the oil and
other raw material price shocks, they managed to adjust, albeit to
varying degress of success, through appropriate policies. The most
successful country in this respect was Japan, which had and still has
very high fuel and raw material import requirements. Vet by conducting
proper fiscal and wage policies, Japan not only succeeded in extricating
 itself within a few years from the the severe recession it entered in
 1973—74, but also managed to revolutionize its industrial production
processes, ensure that failing industries were closed down and generally


 "    In
       this context it is important to point out that the semi—
 industrialized groups represerted here does not include the high—
 inflation Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico).
     A previous article (Bruno, 1986) provides a detailed study of the
 effects of the external shocks and Israel's failure, in comparison to
 other countries, to run a suitable structural adjustment policy.
                                    —8-

turned the situation to its own benefit. Smaller European countries such
as ustrIa and Finland are other positive examples. Israels failure to
extricate     itself    from the world recession, not to mention its
embroilment in an even worse crisis must, therefore, be attributed to
the lack of a suitably respo nsive economic policy, rather than to Pu rely
external factors. Israeis      situation was, of course. agcravated   b v   the

lam Kippur War and the resul ting heavy defense burden. Yet this       a lone

cannot exolain the depth as well as the duration of the crisis.
     There were two major manifestations of the failure to adapt to the
changing environment.     One was the under lying failure, mainly of the
government, but also in th e business and household sectors, to balance
incomes and outlays — a cons tant attempt to live beyond ones means. The
second element, which is not totally unrelated to the first, was the
payment of excessive real wages relative to labor productivity, which
led to a sharp progressive fall in the rate—of—return on capital in         the

business     sector.   We start by discussing the most important issue: the
evolvement of the public sectors income and expenditure system.


3. The cumulative damace resultinQ from an uncontrolled public service
   sector
     Fig. 3 presents the main data on public sector income                  and
expenditure as a percentage of the gross national product for the sub—
periods extending from 1960 to l988.' Expenditure has been divided
into four main groups (left—hand rectangle in each pair): 1. Civilian
consumption and transfers (including services, and transfers to non-
profit institutions and households).          2. Investment and subsidies
(including      subsidies on basic commodities>.       3. Interest on the
government debt. 4. Defense expenditures.
     Income (represented by the right—hand rectangle in each      pair)      is

divided into two sources domestic total gross tax revenues and direct

authorities, the .3ewish Agency and the Bank of Israel.   The data up to

appear in Appendix Table 3.
                                    —9—


transfers from abroad. The gap between the two rectangles in each pair
in Fig. 3 represents the public sector deficit as percentage of GNP.
       It is interesting to note the substantial rise in the size of the
overall public sector deficit even while the economy was still growing.
From a state of rear balance during the first half of the 1960s (as was
also the case in the 1950s), the economy went into a deficit equivalent
to 12.6 oercent of the GNP in the "Golden Age' between the Six Day and
Yom Kippur wars (1967—72>. During this period, there was a rise in
civilian     consumption, investment and subsidies and, particularly,
defense expenditures. At the time, the economy did not require any
significant increase in tax rates as rapid growth made easy borrowing
possible both domestically and abroad (see the subsequent discussion on
the development of the internal and external debt). The government was
also able to borrow substantial amounts from the Rank of Israel, and
thereby print money in an economy which was characterized by relative
stability and a growing demand for real balances.
       Thus, the first seeds of trouble were sown as far back as the boom
period between the two wars. This was an expansionary period dominatd by
a     'we can do anything psychological mood.       It was thus possible to
increase every sector of government spending and 'wave every flag" at
once —     the flags of defense, development and, in particular, of social
welfare.     Towards the late sixties and early seventies (when the War of
Attrition ended and a local version of a 'black panther movement became
prominent) welfare issues once again became the focus of economic policy
debate, at a time when there was no real balance of payments constraint
problem and the only gradually emerging sign of trouble was some
domestic imbalance in the economy (mainly showing in excess demand for
labor).       At this time an extensive national insurance transfer
system was introduced (mainly in the form of child allowances, as well


     The flag—waving analogy is taken from the controversy surrounding
the approach of the then Defense Minister, Moshe Dayan, who claimed that
    we cannot wave all the flags at once. In his view, top priority still
had to be given to defense, even when compared to pressing social
issues.
                                  - 10   -




as other welfare allocations), and increased health and education
budqets. The prevailing attitude among relevant circles, (with many
economists and present company included), was that with such a thriving
economy (business sector GDP grew in the inter—war years by an average
of 12 percent per annum), greatly incrpased exports and no real threat
to the balance of payments, the time was ripe for redistributing the
national cake for the benefit of the underprivileged sectors of soctety.
The impetus given to social expenditure should have been stopped after
the onset of the crisis but it was not.
     Table 3 in the appendix shows that the growth                 in   social

expenditure, so prominent in Fig. 3 —        derived   totally from an increase
in transfers from 5 percent of GNP in 1960—66 to 9 percent in 1967—72,
16 percent after the start of the recession in 1973 and even more in the

years 1995—88.     There was an even higher relative growth in the various
types of subsidies, mainly those allocated through cheap investment
finance, the significance of which we have already discussed. With the
concurrent growth in the interest rate on the excessive internal and
external debt, and the further growth in defense expenditures (which
were now financed by increased U.S. aid), government spending reached an
all time high of 76 percent average of )3NP in the years 1973_Bit. At the
same time, gross taxation grew by a substantial 9 percent to reach 48
percent of ShIP. [Net taxation, after allowing for transfers, grew at a
much lower rate.     However, it is gross taxation that affects negative
growth incentives.)   Despite increased foreign aid disbursements, the
overall public—sector deficit rose to an unprecedented 17.3 percent of
GNP during the recession. This average figure applied, with only minor
variations, for an entire 12—year period. While isolated attempts were
made to curtail the budget (in 1976 and 1979), the excessive public
expenditure, accompanied as it was by very low growth, can only be
described as short—sighted, irresponsible behavior on the part of
successive, over—indulgent governments.
     Fig 3 marks the sharp drop in the deficit from the crisis period
of 1973—84 to the post—stabilization period of 1985—88, whereby the
budget became almost balanced. (The average deficit during 1985—88 was
one percent, a level similar to that prevailing in the years 1960—66).

In 1988, it rose aga in, to between 3—14 percent, generating risks which
we will discuss below.       The fall in the deficit was marked by a sharp,
10 percentage point         drop   in expenditure (most of it was taken from
defense and subsidies, while interest expenditures continued to rise),
and a slight rise in taxation, which reached a record level of over 50
percent of GNP. Such a high tax rate does not, of course, stimulate
growth, as it discoura ges the incentive to work, save or invest.
      To conclude, the above—mentioned figures show that with the upsurge
of the 1970s crisi s, the government failed to change its order of
priorities in response to changing circumstances, whether these were
external (raw material price shocks and the ensuing world recession) or
internal      (heavily     increased    defense   expenditure, and a reduced
population and labor force growth rate).          The only part of the budget
which was cut after 1973, and which may well have caused long—term
damage, was direct government investment i n infrastructure (see Table 3
in the appendix).
      The harmful implications of the large deficit, and the very size of
the public sector, have manifested themselves in a number of areas,
which will be detailed below, and particularly in a rapid increase in
the external      and internal debt. The growth in the external debt led to
persistent bal ance—of—payments problems and to the need for price level
adjustments —      devaluations and Subsidy cuts — which, given the well—
lubricated   and accomodative wage—price—money supply mechanism, led to
sustained shi fts in inflation rates.         The growth in the internal debt
contributed to the      crowding—out of the private sector from the capital
market, and      discouraged private finance of investment and growth.      Pt
the same time,    the    increased internal debt limited the degrees of
freedom of     monetary     policy.    The expansionary   public   sector also
prevented the movement of the increasing labour force into         the private
sec tor.

      It is    also important to point out the nature of government
involvement in the income redistribution process.         In the course of the
crisis pen od, rather than support own human and tangible capital
formation,    government intervention increasingly took the form of direct
commodity    subsidization, extension of welfare and child allowances and
                                      — 12 —



other forms of support that are not conducive to self—relxance.             This
came as a political and social response to the demand to increase the
share of the national cake among the underprivileged, with no effort
being made to condition such support by incentives to work harder and
produce more.      It may be assumed that this factor also contributed to
the fall in the growth rate which we have already mentioned.            Finally,
irresponsible budgetary policy by the government also affected similar
behavior on part of the individual, both as producer and consumer. Thts
will be discussed further below
     We will now go into more detail on some of the topics already
mentioned. The first  of these concerns the contribution of the
cumulative high public deficit to the increasi ng external and internal
debt.     Fig. 4      highlights the growth of the external debt from a mere
20 percent of the GNP before 1967, to between 40 and 50 percent on the
eve of the crisis. At that time, the profitability of capital formation
justified its finance by foreign borrowing.            But the same argument no
longer applied to the doubling of the ratio between the external debt
and 1BhP during the subsequent decade (more on this below).           We have no
detailed figures on the internal debt before 1970, but its rise is even
more striking than that of the external debt. From 50 percent of GNP in
1970,     it increased to almost 140 percent at the height of the crisis.
before the implementation of the stabi     1 izati on   program (by which time
the combined external and internal debt amou nted to more than double the
1BhP!). Most of private savings of economic agents, both households and
companies,      was     thus   primarily   mob i   Ii zed   to finance a massive
accumulation of government bonds rather than direct capital formation.
        Among reasonably well—ordered economies public debt accumulation of
such magnitude is unprecedented. It is true that during World War II
Britain, f or examp le, accumulated an internal debt equivalent to 200 of
1BhP. But    it was not indexed (by contrast to the Israeli internal debt,
all of whi ch is i ndex—linked) and was eroded during the inflation of the
post—war      years. After     years of budget—balancing and even budget
surpluses,      the     British economy may reach zero debt within the
foreseeable future.
        Fig. 4 also illustrates the reversal of these trends that occurred
after 1995, as a direct result of the balancing of the budget and of the
                                    — 13 —



balance of payments respectively.' The progressive reduction of the
internal debt to GNP ratio projected to 1989-93 in Fig. 1 depends on a
renewed balancing of the budget from 1990. the necessary conditions for
which will discussed later. If these conditions hold and SNP once again
grows, at an annual rate of 5—6 percent, the external debt ratio will
fall by 1992 to its level at the end of the 196O, while the irternal
debt will take another 10-15 years to decline to 50 percent of GNP. An
ongcinq reduction in the internal government debt component is the main
prerequisite for the reforms which are necessary in the capital and
money markets.
      Apart from the size of the government deficit, which      affects    the
cle and cost of the debt, the mere size of government expenditure is a
very tgnficant factor. On the      one hand, such level of expenditure
requires a high level of taxation, whi ch hampers g rowth.     On the other
hand, government expenditure on factor inputs has a direct impact on the
amount of resources available to the pr ivate sector
      We will now examine the empi ovment aspect of the large expansion of
the public sector Fig. 5). The      lower    curve in Fig.5 describes the
unemployment rate as a percentage of the labor force since 1960. Apart
from the temporary sharp rise at the ti me of the 1966—67 recession, the
unemployment rate in Israel has been much lower than in Europe.           This
was particularly true during the 1970s (when it was 3—'+ percent compared
to 8—11 percent in Western Europe ). Oni y in the early 1980s did Israeli
unemployment start to rise to        between 5—6 percent.' As previously
mentioned, this low level cannot possibly be explained       by any higher


     Part of the external debt reduction relative to GNP, it should be
noted, is connected with the change from debt to grant financing of
defense purchases as well as the fall in the value of the dollar.
13   It   could be claimed that the level of the internal debt noted rere
represents a lower limit. This qualification is based on the risk that
the government may at some future stage be forced once again to turn a
private debt into a public debt             as the result, for example, of
actuarial deficits in private sector penson funds).
      The   slight   rise   only    in unemployment after the economic
stablizat ion program of 1985,       at a time when the budget deficit was

rate of employment in the business sector (in which, as stated, there
was a dramatic fall-off in new employment after 1973. as happened in
Europe at the same time).   The reason can be quite clearly found in
concurrent, substantial rise in public sector employment, from 20—22
percent of the total workforce in the early seventies, to 28-30 percent
by the end of that decade, as can be seen from the middle curve in
Fig.5. The upper curve15 combines the percentage of employees in the
pubiic sector and in the financial sector;         it also increased very
significantly as a direct by—product of high inflation, but declined
thereat ter.'   The gap between the upper curve and a 100 percent level
(not shown in the figure) represents the percentage of employees in the
non—financial business sector, which, as stated, fell substantially and
only began to rise again after 1983—84.


slashed, is proof that the restrained budget did not have any Keynesian
denand—reducing effect but, on the contrary, led to increased aggregate
supplyl On the other hand, the unemployment rate in 1988 and 1989 rose
quite substantially as a result of previous excessive rises in real
wages, an unusual increase in labour force participation rates, and as
part of the considerable restructuring and labour shedding that has been
underway in the business sector.
    The percentages of employees in the two upper curves of Fig.5 have
been calculated on the basis of total employment in the economy and not
the total labor force, as is the case with the unemployment rate curve.
This discrepancy only marginally affects any comparisons which are made
between relative employment and unemployment figures.
    See the figures in Table 5 of the appendix. These should be taken
as mimimum indicators of employment in public and financial services.
During the period in question, there were additional employees in the
business sector who were involved mainly in "public services" (such as
internal defense) or "financial management" instead of production, and
therefore these too should have been placed in separate employment
category. A highly important issue not         discussed   here   is   the

categorization of the relative contribution of that part of the business
sector involved in production for defense purposes. See Berglas (1986)
 and Halperin (1987).
                                       - 15   -


     The striking changes in the distribution          of employment are even
more poignant when incremental shares of the various sectors in
employment are calculated. Between 1958 and 1972, which were years of
normal growth, the non—financial business sector absorbed 73 percent of
the increase in the overall number of employees in the economy, with the
public and financial sector taking up the           remaining 27 percent. This
situation was almost completely reversed between 1973 and 1981, when the
share of the non—financial business sector fell by a third to 37 percent
(that is,      73   percent   of the total additi ons to the number of employees
was in the public and financial sector).'' Between 1985 and 1787 this
trend was once more dramatically rever sed and the business sector
absorbed 90 percent üf additional labor, while the public sector — which
',ardly grew at all —       took only 10 percent. But in 1988, public sector
employment began to rise again, concurrent with a growth in expenditure
and the deficit, it is to be hoped that             this was only a temporary
development.
     To conclude this chapter, we can see that every aspect of public
sector policy —      with   regard to high taxation, misallocation of the labor
force,   distorted          subsidization     of   investment     (while       reducing
governments own investment in infrastructure)            —
                                                              effectively      hampered
sound economic growth. Before we begin to discuss one of the worst
results of the over—grown public sector — inflation —   should be    it
stressed that the government's lack of restraint had                       a     direct

behavioural impact on the response of economic units in the p r                   ivate

sector. The effects were particularly noticeable in the excessive rise
in the standard         of living, which became quite            unconnected to the
dramatic downturn in the economy after 1973 • Throughout the ent ire
period of rapid         growth until the crisis of 1973, private consumpt ion
usually rose at a rate lower than the growth in per capita GNP. This was
particularly true for the time of rapid growth               between the tempor ary
recession of the mid—sixties and the onset of the 1973 crisis, that                 is,

the years 195—7E when per capita GNP grew at an annual rate of

+8 and 52 percent, respectively.

percent, while per   capita   private consumption rose at by an annual level
of 3.6 percent.la    Subsequently, from 1973 to          1982,    the standard of
living continued     to rise almost unabated, at an annual rate of 3.0
percent, while the average growth in per capita GNP fell to just 1.1
oercent. As will     be mentioned later, the manufacturing sector was also
characterized by     the penchant for "living             beyond one's        means".


4. Aspects of the high inflation process and its termination
     Much has been said about the nature of inflation during               the 1970s
and l9BOs, and about the various features of the July 1 985 economic
stabilization program. There is no point in repeating all of this here,
but we will      briefly review a few aspects of the inflationary process
which are relevant to our present discussion.''
      The main source of inflation was the cont inued government deficit
mentioned in the previous chapter.            This       "original sin" was the
essential condition for the outbreak of              i   nflation in the 1970s.
However,    the link between the budget deficit and inflation is not the
conventional text—book one,       Since there was no time series correlation
between the size of the deficit and the        rate of inflation (see the
articles mentioned in footnote 19).            The high level of the deficit
remained more or less stable for over 15 years, while inflation rose in


i8    The   difference between     these two figures in previous periods was
smaller. Between 1950-55, for example, per capita GNP                    rose by 4.6
percent and from       1955—65 by 5.8 percent, wh ile per capita consumption
increased by 4.2 and 5.2 percent respectively. These figures               appear in
Barkai (1988) and      Klinov (1986). The cant inued             rapid    growth   in

consumption after      1973 can be partly exp lamed by the slow-down in
immigration and the fall in demand for housing           which made       it possible
to divert private resources from investment to consumption
'    For    a detailed analysis of the high infla tion process in Israel see
the articles by Liv iatan and Piterman (1986), Bruno (1986                 and Bruno
and Fischer (1996)      all contained in V. Ben—Porath (ed., 1986). For an
analysis of the eomponents of the stabilization program,                   see Bruno
(1985)

steowise fashion (see Fig. 6).     Fart of the reason for this progressive
acceleration can be found in the connection between the budget deficit
and the balance of payments deficit, and the government response in the
form of devaluations and subsidy cuts.      The transformation of price
level shocks into accelerating rates of inflation has less to do with
"the original sin" than with "adaption to living with the sin itself".
We here refer to the accomodative monetary process and the exchanee
rate—prices—wage—money linkage system which were part of the economy's
attempt to protect itself from the cost of inflation.                But it is
precisely the linkage system and monetary acomodation which enhanced
rapid price increases. Eventually these factors eliminate the existence
of a stable monetary anchor within the economy and allow the inflation
orocess to diverge even while the budget deficit remains more or          less

stable.
       A classic example of so—called immunization against inflation is
the attempt to constantly adjust the exchange rate and devalue in line
with the prevailing rate of inflation.         This adjustment process was
perfected with the policy of creeping devaluation (crawling peg) adopted
in June 1975.      Apart from a short period of a freely floating exchange
rate (after the "economic turnaround"         of    October      1977),   this

characterized the exchange rate regime for the subsequent decade, until
July 1985. The advantage of this regime lies in its ability to maintain
a more or less stable real exchange rate for exports.         In the course of
time, this advantage became quite apparent. The export sector, in fact,
was protected as an isolated enclave throughout the whole period of the
crisis.     Thus, export revenues grew at an average annual rate of 12
percent during the two decades from 1965 to 1984.     Further evidence of
the effect of this protective exchange rate adjustment policy was the
growing     share of industrial exports as a percentage of overall
manufacturing output, from 20 percent in 1965 to 37 percent in 1975 and
52 percent in 1984.         (In 1986, this share stood at 56 percent L.a'


a'>   These estimates appear in the chapter on the manufacturing sector
in respective Bank of Israel Annual Reports and are based on input—
output analysis.
Nevertheless, the real cost of continuous exchange rate adjustment at a
time of a high budget deficit was the complete loss of a monetary anchor
which also led to huge cumulative aggregate output and product ivty
losses.
      Analysis of the inflationary process indicates there were two
important land marks in the loss of the monetary anchor and the upsurge
of inflationary expectations.     One was in June 1975. p,ihen the cra'dinq

peg   was introducec, [on the relevance of this date to the shift in the

expectation—formation    process, see Gottlieb, Melnick and Piterman
(1985)).    The second turning point was the introduction of the Patam
(foreign currency denominated) bank deposits as a close substitute for
regular domestic money at the time of the October 1971            economic
turnaround' [for more on this, see Bruno and Fischer (1986)). These two
events help to explain how 'the gene was helped out of the bottle' —
inflation   rates leapt up after 1979 and 1983 in response to the price
shocks caused by the devaluations of i977 and October 1983.     The 1tter
date was the time of the bank—share crisis and the failure of the
"5 percent-by—5 percent" attempt to reduce inflation by gradually
lowering the rate of devaluation. The first step-devaluation made by the
National Unity Government in September 19814 also led      to   a jump in
inflation (see the peak of the inflation curve in Fig.6).
      A two—pronged attack, on "the original sin" of the budget deficit
and "the adaption to living with the sin" formed the two pillars of the
July 1985 economic stabilization program. The success of the program lay
in a totally balanced budget and the synchronized sharp reduction,
within a social oonsensus agreement, of the rate of increase in prices,
wages, credit and the exchange rate. Stabilization of the exchange rate,
first against the dollar and then against a basket of trade—weighted
currencies (since August 1986) provided the main anchor for price
stability (conditional on wage stability — a weak point in the program
which will be discussed later).
      Looking back, there is no doubt about the program's success, both
in terms of internal stabilization of the currency and in renewed
external financial credibility. When inflation was slashed, however, it
was left at a level of 15—18 percent a year.       Although relatively low,
                                     - 19   -




this    rate is still very high compared to that prevailing amonq Israels
trading    partners. The   January      1987 devaluation, necessitated by
excessive wage rises, led to a temporary blip in the inflation curve
(see point 87:1 in Fig.6). The aggregate 13.5 percent devaluation of
December 1988 and January 1989 will have caused anotrier temporary blip
 not 5howfl here)     in the curve. These two devaluations were carried
cut in conjunction with a social contract between the government, the
Hitadrut and the employers. At the time of writing (mid—1989) it is
still too early to say whether the hopes for an additiorial drop in
triflation to a yearly level of 10—12 percent towards the end of 1989
will be realized.
       A prerequisite for sustained growth in Israel               is a further
reduction of inflation to the level prevailing among Israel's trading
partners.  The preconditions necessary for reducing inflation — a
balanced budget and maximum wage restraint — are               al so essential far

increasing the growth rate.    Failing to achieve either           of these two
conditions will threaten growth, the balance of payments, the ability of
industries to compete on export markets and overall economic stability.
What is more, it will be impossible to maintain stable macro—economic
policies and there will be need for recurrent anti—inflationary measures
of the type that dampen economic activity or else the need to boast
economic activity in a way that hampers price stability (i.e. stop—go
policies).     Reduced uncertainty and stable macro-economic policies are
themselves a precondition for achieving both stability and growth
objectives.


5. The path to renewed steady growth
       The previous section detailed the very rea1 progress that has been
made in the direction of greater                internal   and external   currency


       Consumer price indexes not included in the graph for the first
quarter of 1989 (compared to each previous month) were +.7, 1.7 and 0.5
percent for January, February and March respectively. The ability to
devalue in a manner which would raise the level of prices but not boost
the rate of inflation dependS, among other things, on a renewed cost-of-
living wage agreement.
                                     -20 -



stability   after 12 years of continuous turmoil, even though the comolete
stability target has not yet been achieved.             Reducing inflation
resembles the medical achievement of drastically reducing the patients
fever.      But the question remains as to whether the surgery itself has
been successful.       In other words, is the economy on the way to real
recovery?     Have the structural changes that are npcesary for putting
the economy on the road to steady arowth been made?      In this section we
will discuss a number of structural changes that have taken place.
bearing in mind that so far, these have been far less impressive thar
the effort made to reduce inflation.
     The period 1985—87 was marked by an upsurge in economic activity
and a substantial rise in productivity, but, as we will mention later,
since the middle of 1987 output has flattened off. There are increasing
signs that the 1986—7 boom may have been a temporary though favorable
output response to the lowered rate of inflation.      This was primarily
stimulated by a substantial increase in domestic demand caused by an
excessive rise in real net wage incomes and in private consumption.
while the basic structural problems of the economy remained unsolved.
   The resumption of sustainable growth in the business sector, as
distinct from a temporary boost to economic activity, depends on a
:ontinual release of resources from the public sector, in manpower
reserves becoming available, on keeping wage rises in line with
increasing productivity and on reducing the overall tax burden.          An
important indicator of sustainable growth is the level of new capital
formation taking place so as to ensure that capacity at least keeps pace
with output growth.    For some time, output can draw up on unutilized
capacity, but ultimately, the surest guarantee of renewed growth is a
suitable flow of investment spured by the producers             own profit
incentives and not by excessive                 government support, as was
the case in the 1970s.
     We will start by discussing savings and investment behavior over
time, and then examine the two main determinants of          the volume of
investment      —   the cost of capital and its profitability   Fig. 7 shows
that gross domestic jnvestment declined from 27—28 percent of GNP


     It     would be useful to divide gross investment and the growth in
                                    -21 —



during    1960—72 and the early years of the crisis (197'.—79) to 22
percent in l98O—8'. In the subsequent four years (1985—88), there has
been a further decline of some +   percentage points. Note that the ageing
of capital stock, part of which is now obsolete, indicates the existence
of an even more serious problem in terms of net investment (after
discards). This should be even more disturbing in .'iew of the fact that
technological innovation usually gets embodied in new tangible capital
formation. P rough estimate of the gross investment necessary for
capital stock to keep pace with a 5—6 percent growth in business sector
GDP suggests that within the space of a few years, investment must be
raised from its current level of 18.5 percent to at least 21—23 percent
of GNF.
     L.Jhat   is holding back increased investment today? In the past, it
could be argued that limitations on domestic saving and on foreign
borrowing were the effective limits on investment. The tip of the arrow
in the right—hand bar of each period described in Fig.7 indicates the
volume of total saving, divided up into private and public saving, as a
percentage of GNP.e4 The figure shows that from 1960 right through to


capital stock by their principal destinations —     dwellings   and producer
durables — something which is missing here. Nevertheless, the general
trend in gross domestic investment is a good illustration of the problem
beinq discussed. Nlayshar (1986) provides a detailed analysis of savings
and investment developments until 1983.
   Investment in the first six years after 1973 was promoted by
massive and      excessive public finance and, as will be seen, it was not
accompanied by any rise in profitability. During this period, the real
interest on development loans was negative, amounting to —17 percent!
[see Lityin—Meridor (1983)]. From 1979 onwards, most of the subsidy
embodied in unindexed loans loans was abolished. It can be assumed that
this change only became effective after          1981   because     of   the

administrative time—lag of preyiously approved projects in the pipeline.
    The length of the arrow represents the volume of public saving. Its
direction is first positive and subsequently negative, in the crisis
periods (1974—79, 1979—84).
                                   —22 -



198.     investment exceeded domestic saving, that is, part of the gross
investment was financed by imported capital. [Let us remember that by
national accounting definitions, the difference         between   domestic
investment and total saving is equivalent to the difference between
total imports and exports plus unilateral transfers from abroad (the
current account).] But since the stabilization program, total saving has
grown slightly (private saving declined, but so dtd government
dissaving), while gross investment fell to less than total saving that
is, there was a surplus on the current account). In other words, neither
the volume of total saving nor the availability of overseas finance were
effective limitations on investment. Let us, therefore, move on to
discuss the cost of finance and investment profitability.
       Figures on the real yield—to—maturity of government bonds can serve
as an indicator of long—term real interest rate developments. Fig. B
shows a marked increase in the yield after the 1983 bank shares crisis
and until the start of the stabilization program in      1985 (because   of

reduced public confidence in the government's abili ty to repay). Since
the start of the program, the yield has fallen sharoly, to the levels
prevailing in the mid—1970s. There was a similar fall in the issuing
cost of government bonds, from approximately 6 percent    to 3.5 percent
today. After the reform in the capital. market in early 1987, private
issues on the capital market increased. Concurrently, issuing costs fell
from some 8 percent, as of 1986,    to less than 6 percent today. The
figures for 1986—88 are contained in Table 8 of the appendix.et While
short term credit costs mainly affect working capital      inventories and
current production, it is sometimes asserted that the unlinked shekel
interest rate, particularly the rate on overdraft facilities, affects
demand for investments.m7 Fig. 9 also points to a significant fall in


' This     is a mirror image of the steep rise in private consumpt ion
 (which grew by an average of over 5 percent a year per capita), over and
above disposable income. The rise in consumption explains the large, if
temporary, increase in economic activity during 1985—87.

capital market can be found in A. Ben—Bassat (1989).

this    marginal rate (the highest charged). The distance between the
nominal interest curve in the graph and the inflation curve provides an
estimate of the real interest rate. During the first months of the
stabilization program, the latter grew enormously, to as much as 10
percent a month but subseqently dropped and, except fr a short period
in early 1987 (when it rose after the January 1987 devaluation),
continued     to fall, from 33—39 percent in 1986—87 to 19 percent in the
last quarter f 1988. Interest on fixed—term credit, however, and
particularly average interest on short—term credit (including both
directed and foreign—currency linked credit) fell to much lower levels,
to     10 and 6 percent respectively in the last quarter of 1988 (see the
figures in Table 9 of the appendix). During the first half of 1989 these
interest rates have fallen further.
       Even if it can be argued that certain interest rates are still
higher than is desirable for the long run, it is hard to argue that the
cost of capital could be an effective hindrance to the resumption of
capital formation.       We note, however, that it is the balanced budget
that allowed both long and short term interest to be cut. The budget
deficit increased in 1988 and there is a danger of it rising further in
1989. This would increase government borrowing and might bring about a
renewed rise in 1ong—trm Interest rates. Thus,             if   the   oresent

expansionary monetary policy is to be maintained and short—term interest
is to be cut, a ba lanced budget is essential.
       Let us now look at business sector profitability. This measure is
derived from the na tional accounts value added estimates by deducting
returns to labor       (including the imputed return to labor of the self-
employed); the residual is divided by the capital stock of the business
sector. The upper      part of Fig. 10 illustrates the share of labor as a
percentage of bus mess sector GDP.             In the rapid growth period of
1967—72, the share     of labor fell dramatically, but began to rise
gradually after      1 975,   and, apart from temporary falls in 1981—82 and
198L1—95, continued to do so until after 1988 (to a rate approximating 85
percent of GDP). The distributive share of labor also measures the ratio
of the wage rate to GDP per employed person. A significant growth in the
wage component of GDP usually indicates an excessive rise in wages       over

productivity. During the years of rising inflation l97579, this
                                  -2'. -




resulted   from the workers desire to over-insure themselves against the
effects of inflation. In the period since the stabilization orogram.
when business sector wages rose by 20 percent while productivity
increased by only 10 percent.    This resulted from a combtnation of wage
arrangements which had not been adjusted to the lower rate of inflation,
institutional constraints (the cost—of-living aqreement. the minimum
wage law, wage linkage between employees in both failing and profitable
enterprises), and producers' readiness to accede to wage demands in the
mistaken) hope that they would be bailed out by government policies
such as frequent devaluations.
     Dividing the product share of capi tal       (the comolement of     the

product share of labor) by the capital-output ratio (capital stock /GDP)
yields the gross rate of return on capital   as   can be seen,   it     fell

steeply along with the excessive rise in wage s. During the Golden Age'
of 1967—72, the latter stood at 15—19 percent, but subsequently fel 1     to

the lowest ever level of just 6 percent in 1988. The average level of
profitability should be taken as only a rough guide as it is an average
of both ailing and profitable industries. Note too that the denominator
of the rate—of—return, gross capital stock   may be upward biased, with
effective capital being smaller (because of unpro fitable investments
made in the l970s, that should be written off so that in some
industries, capacity may never may be fully utilized).      Actually what
matters    is   the   marginal   profitability expected    on incremental
investment, which may be considerably higher than actual average
profitability. A major cause for concern and certainly the main reason
for the paucity of investment even after the stabilizati on program lies
in the high share of labor and the low share of capita1 (the residual)
in the past few years. Immediately after the stabil ization program
began, the business sector's relative tax burden grew, leading to even
smaller net earnings. Demand for investment is also         liable to be
affected by uncertainty over future earnings, which in turn is governed
by numerous factors — such   as expectations regarding     the extent of
economic stability, future economic policy and the general political
climate.
     What is the chance that gross profitability will henceforth        rise

or, in other words, is there a chance that wages will at               least
                                    -25



temporarily rise more slowly than p roduct lvi ty, as happened on more thar
one occasion during the years of rapid growth ? In 1988 the increase in
real wages certainly began to level off, while the first quarter of 1989
saw a fall in real wages following the devaluation and its    s ter i Ii za t ion

from the cost—of—i iving agreement. There are also signs of a change
n the rules of t he cane in the labor mar ket: less importance is now
placed on nationwide wage agreements with      greater flex ibility being
shown at tne industr y and enterprise level; there is less insistence on
wage linkage (linkinq groups of workers in      the private    sector with
public sector wage agreements, for example       cost—of—liv ing agreements
have been moderated and adjusted to lower inf lation; and f inaily, there
have been striking      cases where nominal    wage rates     in trouble—hit
industries have been cut (Koor, for example). Particularly important too
is the willingness to dismiss workers in the course of res tructuring as
at Israel Aircraft      Industries, The Shipyar ds and Solel Boneh (a major
cont racting firm owned by the Histadruth).     Rising unemployment along
with    the other factors mentioned have recent ly helped to halt excessive
wage rises in the business sector.'
       Recent experience such as, for example, in the British economy,
shows that changes in the rules of the game in the labor market very
much depend on the government's determination to change conventional
attitudes, even at the price of higher unemployment. Successive Israeli
governments have always felt obliged to maintain full employment and
guarantee security of tenure. This is partly a result of the trauma of


       According to the new cost—of—living agreement which came into
effect on April 1st, 1999, no compensation will be given to wages for
monthly inflation rates below 0.5 percent, while increments amounting to
85 percent of any price rise in excess of 0.5 percent will be paid twice
a year.
       The moderating   effect1 however, can only be partial, sknce in a
period of structural change, there can be unemployment in one industry,
occupation or sector    concurrent with labor shortage elsewhere.       A wage
rise resulting from a shortage in one place is not usually balanced out
by a concurrent fall in wages somewhere else.

the 1965—66 recession, when unemployment rose above 10 percent. One of
the ootential threats to the July 1985 stabilization program was the
fear that unemployment would grow to above 8—9 oercent. If one is going
to persist in implementing structural chanqes in the economy, it may
become necessary to accept an unemployment rate of around 7-B percent
for some time ahead.
      The main danger of an excessive wage increase is tn the oubiic
sector, wnere the threat of large—scale dismissals is almost non-
existent. s public sector wages have lagged behind those n the
business sector since the stabilization proqram, there is a danger that
tnej may now pick up again. Should this happen, the effect of the
factors that have moderated wage rises in the business sector may also
be weakened. Here again the outcome hinges on the handling of public
sector policy. The imposition of riqid rules there will also have an
impact on the business sector.>


 .   What reforms are needed?
       So far, we have mentioned two prerequisites for resumed growth and
a further disinflation. These are a balanced budget, to be achieved by
trimming the relative size of the public sector, and moderation of wage
rises to a level below the growth in productivity. In the former area
there was some degree of success during the first three years after the
stabilization program, but the future of budgetary restraint is now at
risk. On the wage front and in the labor market we may now be observing
the first signs of progress. These two conditions are both necessary,
but are not sufficient. The main reason behind the crisis of the l970s.


       Considering   that   public    sec tor     wages    are relatively low,
particularly among senior ranks, and in view of           considerable disguised
unemployment, wage rises in the publIc sector should be coupled with a
parallel increase in efficiency, i.e. dismissi ng workers on the basis
of Clause B of the public sector wage agreement, a clause which has
scarcely been acted on till now. Recent reform proposals by the Sussnan
Commission (on public sector wages)             would adjust wage scales in the
right direction, but do not in themsel yes deal with the problem of
persistent excess employment in the pub lic sector.
                                     -27 -



as   we have seen, was the failure to adapt to the far—reaching external
changes, both on the government level and among individual producers and
consumers. Real economic recovery demands behavorial changes in both
sectors, including in the nature of their interdependence.           necessary
condition     for    renewed      economic     growth   is    the   consistent
implementation of structural reforms in the main areas of economic
activity where the government is heavily involved.'
.l. Government involvement; its extent and operation
      Iluch has been said about the importance of wiping out the budget
deficit. s stated, a balanced budget is not enough to bring about a
steady reduction in the governments relative weight in the economy,
which is among the highest in the world (over 50 percent of GNP, see
Fig. 3). The division of labor between the government and private
economic agents must be altered. Fundamental structural changes should
be initiated and government services greatly reduced wherever the
government has no clear advantage over the         private sector, and the
government service provided is not run according to economic principles.
Blatant examples f this situation can be found in health                    and

hospitalization insurance, but they are also             to    be   found    in

education.'     The government must concentrate only on areas in which
there may be market failures and where it has a natural economic
advantage, such as the development of physical infrastructure for
transport     services,   basic    research,     R8.D, higher education and
development areas. At the same time, the government should rid itself of


     Further details are contained in the program submitted to the
Government by the Bank of Israel in January, when new economic policy
measures were adopted. See A Plan for the Resumption of Growth and the
Lowering of Inflation, Bank of Israel, Jerusalem, December 1988,
Hebrew) (henceforth referred to as the Bank of Israel plan). Similar
proposals have been put forward by Neubach Sadka, and Razin (1988).
      In this respect, the recent decision not to charge a minimal fee
for visits to a doctor and not to charge high school education fees are
the exact opposite of reduced government support. part from this,
radical organizational changes are necessary in the health sector in
order to increase efficiency.

direct holdings in enterprises and from excessive interference in
business management. Only reduced government activity will make it
possible to decrease the overall tax burden, which runs counter to the
main incentives to growth — the desire to work, save and invest. With
respect to taxation, it is also necessary to implement reforms which may
not decrease the average tax burden, but which do reduce marginal tax
rates while increasing the tax base (Sheshinski Commission proposals).
    The government must also review its social welfare activities and
move from forms of asststance which do nothing to encourage personal
responsibility (such as subsidies, child allowances and unconditional
unemployment benefits) to helping those who help themselves. An example
is the     proposal to replace payments to parents of large families with
direct financial assistance to discharged soldiers in the formation of
physical and human capital (like the "Threshold Fund" suggested as far
back as the 1970s by this writer, as well as by others). The partial
government assistance provided to problem enterprises as part of a
recovery and debt rescheduling program also falls into the category of
 helping those who help themselves'. Such aid is conditional on a clear
proof that an enterprise or economic unit (Koor industries and the
kibbutz movement, for example)         has developed a plan based on strict
self—discipline and that it has the ability to recover fully within a
few years. Clearly, such government assistance can only be provided if
it does not transcend limits in the overall state budget, where avoiding
a deficit is, as stated, the main prerequisite for economic recovery.
     In Fig. 11, the forecast for 1989—92 presupposes an average drop of
approximately one percent a year in the ratio of expenditure and
taxation to GNP between 1989—92.
6.2. Reforms in the money and capital markets.
     Excessive government intervention in the money and capital markets
was one of the reasons for the lack of growth in the 1970s. Several of


'    For      the   budget   to   be     balanced   as   soon as 1990, a
substantial, immediate cut is necessary. Public sector consumption in
1989, except for defense imports, must remain constant, while in 1990—92
it can then grow at an annual rate of not more than 1.7 percent. See the
Bank of Israel Program, December 1988,
                                   — 29   -




the reforms initiated in   these markets during 1985—87 are now bearing
fruit.      But there is   still a need for the reduction of budgetary and
other involvement by the government.          The effectiveness of reform in
this area depends on a balanced budget, together w i               th   increased

competitition in the banking system in order to bring down the interest-
rate spread.     Selling government—held bank shares, after ensuring equal
voting rights, to business orqanizations and individuals w ill provide an
opportunity to     improve the structure of the banking            system.    The

subsidization of banking services to the government should be gradually
abolished, together with the direct subsidization of pension fund
interest rates.  The banks must be exposed to competition, both
externally (by capital imports) and internally (e.g. by            developing a
short—tern commercial bill market in the stock exchange)           These are but

a few examples from a long list of structural correct'.ons, including
changes in taxation, which will increase competition in          the money and
capital markets, reduce the interest rate spread and reestablish the
capital market as the main channel for financing caoital formation.
6.3. Improving the price mechanism and the opening up the economy
         Apart from wage flexibility, discussed in the previous section,
further measures are needed to moderate the rigid price mechanisms which
stand in the way of reducing inflation to Western levels. A whole range
of administrative restrictions which still either ban or curtail imports
must be abolished in order to further expose local production to greater
competition from abroad. Existing restrictions hinder competition              in

domestic markets, thereby lessening the effect of the exchange rate as a
means of stabilizing prices. Effective exchange rates should          be

completely unified towards full integration in the world market. There
 is also a need for more closely controlling domestic           monopolies which

do not face competition from imports.
         Another area requiring a more liberal            stance is the flow of
capital, providing that inflation actually does fall and control over
monetary policy can be maintained.     Greater flexibility in this field

 will help reduce interest rate spreads and          1   iberalize the commodity
 market, in view of the drastic changes which are expected in the world
 market during the next few years, with special reference to Europe by
 1992.

7. Concluding Remarks
     Fig. 12 gives an overall view of major economic developments in
terms of inflation, the civilian import surplus as a percentage of BNP,
and the growth rate of business sector SDP from 1965, through the years
of   crisis     and until the partial recovery from it since 1Q85.
Particularly striking is the sharp fall in the growth rate of business
sector SDP in 1988, only part of which was foreseen during the second
half of 1987 [point a. in the diagram indicates the 1988 National Budget
forecast made in September 1987]. Part of the fall — some             1.5—2

percentage points — can be attributed to the intifada, which began in
December 1987 [point b. in the diagram]. The remainder derived from
other factors connected with the government's reluctance to take major
policy decisions during an election year (devaluation and various
reforms were held back, for example) and with unexpected structural
difficulties. The forecast figures for A989 to 1992 are conditional on
the implementation of budgetary cuts and a suitable wage policy,
together with the previously mentioned reforms. Only if these conditions
are met is there likely to be a fall in inflation to the average level
prevailing in the West (5—8 percent a year), a drop in the civilian
import surplus to 6 percent of GNP -      to be covered by grants and other
unilateral transfers —      and   gradually increased business sector GDP
growth to the target rate of 6 percent a year.
     These forecasts are strictly conditional. All the reforms in the
areas mentioned (the budget, wages etc.) demand, first and foremost, a
fundamental rethinking of the role of government. They also recjuire a
radical change in the way the private sector operates. Lessons of the
past indicate the need to break away from the amorphous system of mutual
guarantees that has characterized relations between the government and
 the private sector, within the business sector and within large
conglomerates. Examples of the latter are to be found in the Kibbutz and
Moshav movements and in the F-1istadrut enterprises. The fundamental
weakness of a system of mutual reliance is its avoidance of clear—cut
 personal     and    corporate responsibility for sins of omission and
 commission by producers or consumers that are part of such larger
 economic systems.

       The   crisis and the ensuing recovery have made it necessary to
fresnly review the basis of Irael socto—economic system. There is
need to redefine the nature of societys responsibilities towards its
weaker sub-groups. Is there any contradiction between the increased
competition and efficiency which create greater wealth, and the concern
over a more equitable divison of this wealth? Heightened concern over
rair    shares   of the increased national wealth produced in the lOs. it
should be remembered, actually led to the contraction of growth since
then and impaired the efficiency with which output and wealth were
produced. This, in turn, has impaired the ability to further reallocate
significant slices of the national cake.
       To avoid repeating such mistakes, one needs to reCetermine the
minimum amount of infrastructure and health, education and welfare
services which the government should provide whether un        I ver sally   or

?ot) to various sectors of the population. Confinement to    this    minimum

will allow market forces to act more freely and provide mon e opp ortuni ti
for own—financing by the individual, ultimately leadi ng to greater
efficiency. In other words, it will increase the size of     the    national

cake, which shrunk so noteably during the years of the crisis.
     Which socio—economlc model is best—suited for Israel to aspire to?
Since 19B5, it has been lucky enough to excape the divisi ye and unstable
model that ha been observed in many Latin American countries. But is
there a tendency to follow the U.S. pattern, where maximum free
enterprise is the rule or of Britain during the past few    years, or of
semi—industrialized countries such as Singapore and South Korea? Dr are
Israelis more inclined to emulate European countries such as Sweden,
Finland or Austria, where free competition exists side by     side with a
considerably greater degree of worker participation and a clear concern
 for social objectives? In this respect, there is a lack      of any well
 thought cut new long—term strategy, and there is apparent ly no redefined
 national consensus on the long—term socio—economic goals. Although. as
                                                                  a 1950s
 in Europe, Israel has witnessed some retreat from the concept of
                                                                    and the
 and l9oOs-style welfare state, this withdrawal is only partial
 ensuing vacuum has not yet been filled
        Despite the lack of     a well—defined and accepted socio—econOmic
 model on which it could        be based, much of the 1985 stabilizatiOn

                                                    social consensus
program's success derived from the achievement of a
over such key issues as balancing the budget and changes in the cost—of—
living agreement. A similar consensus seems to exist on the general
direction of the necessary structural reforms. Even t      the long—term

goal
       is not clearly defined, only few would deny the need for a drastic
reduction in the current level of government intervention. Yet it  is


far from certain whether the government and the public at large fully
understand that sustained growth and internal economic stability depend

on   resolute, single—minded policy implementation, which may have it;
sacrifices in the short run and only bears fruit after a considerable
time. In this respect, the recently growing tendency, much encouraged by
major representatives of the business sector, to regard           "growth

incentives" as ad hoc, micro—economic measures offering short—term
benefits, gives cause for concern. Rather than constituting the   threads

of a new macro—economic fabric suited to the needs of the 1990s and the
21st century, these are really just a series of stop—gap measures, whose
cost is far from negligible, in the style of 1950s and 1960s government
micro— intervention. It is not so easy to explain to producers and the
public at large that real growth hinges on creation of the right macro-
economic environment, which may be easy to define but is hard to create,
as are the attempts to reduce taxation and interest rates (which are
 themselves ultimately dependent on a balanced budget). The same applies
 to macro—economic reforms manifested in such obvious "micro" forms as a
more flexible price and wage system. But if such conditions are actually
brought about, they will undoubtedly lead to economic growth, without
 the need for any other micro—economic incentives, which rather than
 ironing out structu ral distortions, usually only perpetuate them. There
 is no better proof of this than the sad experience of the 1970s and the
 early l9BOs.
       The government has done much to enhance its public credibility by
 the measures it has taken since July 1985. Now, it needs to continue
 along the same path unswervingly, even if the country has apparently
 extricated itself from the former dire economic straits (and apparently
 is the operative word). Only time will judge whether government policy
 since July 1985 has led to a genuine turnabout in the restructuring of
 the economy and the renewed opportunities for growth.
