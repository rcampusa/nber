                                             ABSTRACT

We investigate the relationship of "shared capitalist" compensation systems - profit/gainsharing, employee
ownership, and stock options - to the culture for innovation and employees' ability and willingness
to engage in innovative activity. Using a large dataset with over 25,000 employee surveys in over
200 worksites of a large multinational organization, we find that both shared capitalism compensation
and high performance work policies contribute to these innovation outcomes. Owning company stock
is the most consistently positive compensation variable in predicting both an innovation culture and
willingness to engage in innovative activity. We also find that shared capitalism and high performance
work policies have stronger effects in predicting an innovation culture when they are combined, and
that the effects of shared capitalism and high performance work policies are partially, but not wholly,
mediated through greater employee alignment with company strategy. The findings are consistent
with agency theories predicting that the principal agent problem can be addressed by a combination
of shared incentives and cooperative culture which encourages mutual monitoring and opportunities
to share information.

                                       INTRODUCTION

       Politicians are saying it: Michigan’s Governor, Jennifer Granholm, revealed her plan to

overhaul the world’s automotive center into the innovation capital of the United States, stating

“the power of creativity in propelling our economy is a fundamental building block of our state’s

transformation” (Michigan Governor Talks, 2006). Likewise, the President of China, Hu Jintao,

early in 2006, called for a transition from a manufacturing based economy to one based on

innovation, recognizing that innovation is a means for China to drive their developing economy

further up the value chain. Supporting this, China has announced plans to increase the percentage

of GDP dedicated to R&D spending from 1.2% to 2.5% by the year 2020 (Einhorn, 2006;

Something New, 2006).

       Organizations are enacting it: In 2005, P&G acquires Gillette stating, “Getting the

shopper to spend more comes down to innovation--the critical driver of consumer loyalty--and

productivity. By doing this acquisition, we'll have more products and more innovation…”

(Lafley & Sellers, 2005). Similarly, leaders at Ford Motor Company acknowledge that their

biggest challenge to succeeding in the current economy is restoring consumer’s sense of

confidence in the company, and say that innovation will be the means to achieve this.

Underlining this importance, Ford lists “Innovation is our mission” on its home page (Elliott,

Szczesny, 2006).

       Academics are researching it: Recognizing the importance of innovation for the

competitive advantage of organizations and larger economies, researchers are actively seeking to

better understand various environmental, organizational, and individual factors which influence

innovation outcomes. For example, Jaffe, Lerner, and Stern (2006) examine the role economic

policies play as drivers or inhibitors of innovation activities. Other organizational research aims



                                                 3
to understand the organizational factors and individual differences which impact employees’

willingness to adopt organizational innovations (Klein & Sorra, 1996).

       Finally, employees are listening: Media outlets such as CNN, Business Week, and The

USA Today report stories such as, “A Century of Innovation,” “The World’s Most Innovative

Companies,” “Champions of Innovation,” and “The Fabric of Creativity.”

       Whether it is due to globalization, expanding markets, low cost competition, or

demanding customers, the need for innovation has been heard echoing from Capital Hill, to Wall

Street, to the television sets of the average American. In the battle for continuous innovation,

organizations play a critical role in fueling the development and production of these products,

services, and processes.

       Unlike the traditional view of innovation as the activity performed by the lone R&D

scientist working in isolation, today’s organizations embrace the ideas and insights of employees

at all levels of the organization. For example, Whirlpool credits their successful product

innovations not to a couple of departments, such as engineering or marketing. Instead, they say

that they have harnessed the power of a 61,000-employee workforce, providing the means for all

levels and job functions to contribute and develop product, service, or processes innovations

(How Whirlpool Defines, 2006).

       Given the new organizational context for innovation, it is important to understand how

employees at all levels of the organization can be managed to direct and align their behaviors to

achieve innovative outcomes. For example, Annalee Saxenian, in her seminal work on

organizational innovation, contrasts two traditional innovation hubs of America: Silicon Valley

in California and Route 128 surrounding Boston. Her work indicates that two management

practices, organizational structures and rewards, were critical to accounting for differences in



                                                 4
innovation output. Silicon Valley spawned innovation through shared capitalism incentives and

the use of teams, while innovation in the Boston corridor was stymied by bureaucratic top-down

approaches to organizational structure and rewards.

       Likewise, in their book In the Company of Owners, Blasi, Kruse, & Bernstein (2003)

examined in detail one innovation sector, the 100 largest corporations that built, run, and sell on

the Internet. They highlight the major role that shared capitalism practices, such as employee

ownership, profit sharing, and broad based stock options, in combination with a participative

culture, can make in promoting organizational innovation.

       Recognizing the importance of innovation for today’s organizations, this study will

examine the role shared capitalism and high performance work policies play as a means to

achieve innovation outcomes. Additionally, we will examine a process mechanism, employee

alignment, as one way in which shared capitalism and high performance work policies impact

innovation outcomes.



                                    LITERATURE REVIEW

Can shared capitalism promote innovation?

       We broadly define shared capitalism as organizational incentive systems which seek to

align the interests of the employee with the owner by sharing the residual return. In this way,

self-interested employees will seek to increase their residual return by working to achieve

organizational objectives. Shared capitalism incentives may be at the group or team level

through gainsharing plans, or at the organizational level through profit sharing, employee

ownership, or broad-based stock option plans.




                                                 5
       An extensive body of knowledge has accumulated on the impact that different forms of

shared capitalism have on workplace outcomes. In general, the research indicates that shared

capitalism has a positive influence on workplace outcomes. For example, there is evidence for

the positive impact of shared capitalism on human resource outcomes such as turnover, loyalty,

and worker effort (Freeman, Blasi, and Kruse, 2007). In addition, research supports the

importance of shared capitalism for accounting- and market-based measures of performance (see

Kaarsemaker, 2006, and Kruse and Blasi, 1996, for reviews). While shared capitalism plans are

associated with somewhat better performance on average, there is substantial variation among

individual companies, and a number of studies show no evidence of impact on workplace

outcomes. One important reason for this variation appears to be differences in employment

cultures, employee participation, and workplace practices that may be complements to shared

capitalism in affecting workplace performance (Kruse et al., 2005).

       While this cumulative body of literature on shared capitalism has greatly enhanced our

understanding of the field, gaps in the research still remain. One such gap is the impact of shared

capitalism on innovation outcomes. A review of the prior research identified four articles which

discuss or examine the importance of shared capitalism in achieving product, service, or process

innovations.

       Gamble (2000) finds reduced R&D expenditures in firms where ESOPs own larger

blocks of stock and argues that this reflects management entrenchment and managerial risk

aversion; in contrast, Kruse (1996) finds that R&D expenditures are a strong predictor of the use

of a profit-sharing plan, and Sesil et al. (2002) find positive effects of broad-based stock options

in high technology knowledge-based industries, noting that ‘for firms, in which new product

development is crucial for success, such as in many knowledge-based industries, broad-based



                                                  6
stock options can reduce the agency problem, resulting in greater output’ (p. 276). Most recently,

and supporting Sesil et al’s perspective, Lerner & Wulf (2006), using a sample of 300 publicly

traded R&D centralized firms, found that the compensation of corporate R&D heads had

dramatically shifted in the 1990’s, with a heaver reliance on long-term incentives such as stock

options. They find long-term incentives are positively and significantly associated with number

of patent filings, patents perceived value (patent citations), and patent generality.

        While research that examines the role of shared capitalism as a means to achieve

innovation outcomes is in its infancy, social and behavior psychologists have actively examined

the impact of individual rewards on creative behavior (Amabile, 1983; Deci & Ryan, 1985;

Eisenberger and Selbst, 1994). Thus, we briefly present empirical evidence and theoretical

perspectives from the social and behavioral schools of psychology.

        Social-cognitive psychologists assert that creative behavior has defining characteristics

that make it distinguishable from other human behavior; in particular creative behavior is

dependent on employees’ intrinsic motivation (Amabile, 1983; Deci & Ryan, 1985). Thus, the

aim for social-cognitive psychologists is to uncover the conditions which enhance employee’s

intrinsic motivation. According to this line of reasoning, extrinsic rewards, such as shared

capitalism, will have a detrimental effect on employee’s intrinsic motivation and ultimately their

creative behavior by directing employee’s attention towards the reward itself over the task at

hand.

        In contrast, behavioral psychologists argue that the effort needed to complete activities is

an unpleasant sensation produced by repeated or intense performance of any behavior.

Reinforcements, such as rewards, are a means by which organizations can reduce this unpleasant

sensation. If an employee is rewarded for putting in a large amount of effort in an activity or



                                                  7
behavior (for example through shared capitalism) it reduces the adverse impact of such behaviors

and increases this behavior in the future. In effect, reinforcements work to control employee’s

creative behavior by decreasing the unpleasant sensations associated with the cognitive effort

needed to perform creativity.

        Empirically, an abundance of studies in the past 30 years have been conducted to

understand if and under what conditions rewards enhance or inhibit creative behavior, with

contradictory results and conclusions. Recognizing the conflicting evidence, five meta-analyses

aimed to bring cohesion to the divergent results (Rummel & Feinberg, 1988; Wiersma, 1993,

Tang & Hall, 1995; Cameron, & Pierce, 1994; Eisenberger & Cameron, 1996; Deci, Koesterner,

& Ryan, 1999). Of the five, the strongest support for the Cognitive Evolution Theory comes

from Deci, Koestner, & Ryan (1999) who combined 128 studies to find that all tangible and

intangible rewards undermined intrinsic motivation. However, conclusions from Eisenberger &

Cameron’s (1996) extensive review indicate that: (1) the detrimental effects of rewards tend to

occur in highly restricted, easily avoidable conditions, (2) mechanisms of instrumental and

classical conditions are basic for understanding incremental and detrimental effects of reward on

task motivation, and (3) the positive effects of rewards on performance are easily attainable

using procedures derived from behavioral theory.

        Taken together, past theory and empirical work on creativity and rewards has failed to

provide an understanding of how best, if at all, to reward employees to achieve creative behavior.

Additionally, the application of this research to organizational setting is restricted. First, the

majority of studies in this field have been conducted outside of organizations and relied heavily

on school children, making the generalizability of these finding limited. Second, organizations

are increasingly employing group/team or organizational incentives over individual incentives as



                                                   8
a means to encourage cooperation and alignment (Blasi et al., 2006). Thus, studies examining

individual incentives provide only a limited understanding of the full range of workplace

incentives. Third, the sample sizes of studies mentioned above are generally small. For example,

of the 128 studies examined in Deci, et al.’s (1999) meta-analysis the largest sample was 249,

with the majority of sample sizes well under 100. While significant effects can often be detected

with these sample sizes (depending on the study design), a contribution of this study to the

current literature is the large sample size obtained in an organizational setting (more than 25,000

employees in hundreds of work sites) with data on several types of workplace incentives.

Can employment practices promote innovation?

       In contrast to the limited research on organizational incentives, innovation management

scholars have actively researched individual human resource management policies which impact

innovation outcomes, including job design (Hackman & Oldham, 1980), selection (Woodman,

Sawyer, & Griffin, 1993; Iansiti, 1995), training (Wheatley, Anthony, & Maddox, 1991), and

performance management (Mehr & Schaver, 1996). Mumford (2000) reviews an extensive body

of literature examining specific human resource management policies that support innovation

and creativity. Building on this review, the following sections summarize the management

policies that are supportive of innovation and creativity in organizations.

       Selection. The consistent development of innovative products, services, and processes

requires a workforce with the necessary breadth and depth of technical skills (Amabile &

Gryskiewicz, 1987; Iansiti, 1995), in combination with a constant flow of new ideas and

experience (Bontis, Crossan, & Hulland, 2002; Jackson & Schuler, 2002). Staffing practices

work as a means to ensure a consistent flow of technical skills, by identifying and selecting

applicants who will add new ideas and experience to the organization. Researchers have



                                                 9
examined the employee characteristics supportive of innovation: divergent thinking (Guilford,

1950), technical expertise (Amabile & Gryskiewicz, 1987; Mumford, 2000), and certain

personality characteristics (Amabile, 1988; King, 1990).

       Training & Job Rotation. Maintaining employees’ current knowledge and skills, while

developing new knowledge and skills, is essential to innovative performance (Cohen &

Leventhal, 1990; Mumford, 2000). Two HR policies vital to maintaining and developing

employees to achieve innovative outcomes are training and development (Leonard-Barton,

1992). A firm’s potential to be innovative and creative is enhanced as the new knowledge and

abilities are incorporated into the organization (Jackson & Schuler, 2002; Cohen & Leventhal,

1990). Thus, past research has noted the importance of sabbaticals, subtracting assignments, self-

study programs, conferences, external courses, and job rotations as important mechanisms to

enhance an organization’s ability to innovate (Dougherty, 1992; Mumford, 2000; Christensen &

Raynor, 2003; Amabile, 1983).

       Performance Management. Performance evaluations have been both negatively and

positively associated with individual innovation and creativity (Amabile, 1979; Shalley, 1995).

For instance, Amabile (1979) found that individuals who expected their artistic task to be

externally evaluated had significantly lower levels of creativity on the task than individuals not

being externally evaluated. In contrast, Shalley (1995) conducted two studies with samples of

undergraduate students; the results of both studies indicate that expecting an evaluation is not

necessarily harmful to people's creativity. The variance in empirical evidence may be explained

by the type of performance evaluation. Performance appraisals should not have specific

performance objectives or difficult production outcomes (Mumford, 2000; Oldham, 2003).

Instead, appraisals are most conducive to creativity when they consist of broadly defined goals



                                                10
and objectives that allow employees flexibility as to what the final outcome will be (Mumford,

2000).

         Rewards (Recognition). As mentioned above, evidence for the impact of individual

rewards on creative behavior is mixed. However, for those researchers who support the role of

rewards or recognition (both intrinsic and extrinsic) for creativity, other questions remain such as

the skills, behaviors, or outcomes that should be rewarded. For instance, Henderson and

Cockburn (1994) in their investigation of the pharmaceutical industry suggest firms that promote

researchers according to their standing in the scientific community enjoyed higher productivity

levels. Additionally, rewards should not be withheld from employees who step out of

established roles or fail to achieve desired outcomes. Instead, a better approach is to reward

employees for their effort or progress toward an innovation/creative goal or objective (Mumford,

2000). Finally, Dougherty (1992), after extensive field research on product development,

suggests that rewards should be provided for the development of expertise, skills, and

competencies. Thus, beyond compensation, other forms or rewards and recognition can be used

to enhance creative behavior.

         Employee involvement. Empowering employees and utilizing teams are two mechanisms

through which employee participation can enhance organizational innovation (Mumford, 2000).

Christensen and Raynor (2001) argue that successful product innovation requires big decisions to

be driven down to the lowest level. They reason that decisions about products, services, and

processes innovations should be made on the spot, instead of waiting for a response from further

up in the organization. Additionally, Jelinek & Schoonhoven (1990) note employee involvement

helps employees to see their part in the innovation process while creating a shared responsibility

in the outcome. Supporting this, Leonard-Barton (1994), in her study of innovative projects



                                                11
groups, found that empowerment is most important for innovative capabilities. Those project

teams who were empowered felt ‘exhilarated by the challenges they had created’ (p. 117).

       Teamwork. The use of team-based work is a popular mechanism for enhancing

innovation. Innovations involve different types of tasks and processes, and thus are rarely the

creation of one individual or a single department. Team-based work has been argued to increase

the speed of product innovation (Hayes, Wheelwright, & Clark, 1988), the number of

innovations (Dougherty, 1992), and the value of the innovation (Ven de Ven, 1986). For

example, Clark and Fujimoto (1991) conducted a qualitative study where they found that the use

of cross-functional teams is central to the product development process. Additionally, effective

product development was not housed in solely specialized R&D activities; instead the most

effective product development came from creating linkages between various departments within

the organization. Thus, the use of teams enhances product innovation through the diversity of

knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990).

       Systems Perspective. While the above policies appear to be valuable for innovation,

recent work recognizes the importance of examining HRM policies as a bundle or system of

policies as opposed to individual policies in isolation (MacDuffie, 1995; Huselid, 1995;

Ichniowski et al., 1996; Blasi and Kruse 2006). A central tenet of the systems approach is that

organizations should create a high degree of internal consistency among their HRM policies

(Barid & Meshoulam, 1988). Systems of HRM policies which are designed to utilize the

knowledge and skills of the workforce have been labeled as “high performance,” “high

involvement,” “high commitment,” “HR sophistication,” and “HR investment.”

       Interestingly, there is wide disagreement on what policies constitute “high performance.”

A review by Lepak, Liao, Chung, and Harden (2006) highlights the disparate and at times



                                                12
conflicting policies making up high performance systems. While disagreement remains over the

policies represented in a “high performance” work system, it is generally agreed that a high

performance work system (HPWS) can impact various organizational outcomes. Collectively, 20

years of cumulative research has found HPWS are strongly associated with outcomes including

HRM outcomes (i.e., turnover, absenteeism, job satisfaction), organizational outcomes (i.e.,

productivity, quality, service), financial accounting outcomes (i.e., ROA, profitability), and

capital market outcomes (i.e., stock price, growth, returns) (Coombs, 2006; Becker & Huselid,

2006).1

          As noted above, employee knowledge and skills are critical to achieving innovation

outcomes. Thus, it is surprising that the systems approach has had limited application to

innovation outcomes. Studies of high performance workplace bundles have so far tended to

focus on operational or financial performance without measures of innovation. Given the limited

empirical evidence, our study seeks to fill this gap by examining the impact of HPWS on

innovation outcomes.

          Taken together, the limited empirical work examining the effects of shared capitalism

and HPWS on innovation outcomes represents a gap in the literature that needs to be addressed.

Our interest is to examine the relationship between shared capitalism, HPWS, and innovative

outcomes, in addition to the intervening mechanisms that uncover how these relationships occur.

The following theory and hypotheses development provides the rational for why we expect these

relationships to occur.




1
  Despite these positive performance outcomes, bundles of high performance workplace policies appear to have
very low incidence among firms (Blasi and Kruse 2006). See Ichniowski et al. (1995) regarding the barriers to
adoption of high performance policies.

                                                       13
                                  THEORY & HYPOTHESES

       Laffont and Martimort (2003) describe the principal-agent problem as a fundamental one

for the firm: “Indeed, for various reasons the owner of the firm must delegate several tasks to the

members of the firm. This necessity raises the problem of managing information flows within

the firm…The starting point of incentive theory corresponds to the problem of delegating a task

to an agent with private information” (2003: 2-3). For the purposes of this article, one can think

of the problem of innovation as how to get the members of the firm interested in working alone

or together to use their information to achieve innovation that will profit the owner of the firm.

They cite the early work of both Chester Barnard and Charles Babbage in defining the relevance

of shared capitalism for the agency problem. For example, Babbage wrote:

            The general principles on which the proposed system is founded, are: 1. That
            a considerable part of the wages received by each person should depend on
            the profits made by the establishment; and 2. That every person (our
            emphasis) connected with it should derive more advantage from applying any
            improvement he might discover than he could by any other course.” (Laffont
            and Martimort 2003: 11 quoting Babbage 1989:Vol 8: 177)

One can readily see that Babbage is specifically addressing both shared capitalism and

innovation (“any improvement”). Barnard’s views were more explicit and more extreme when

he wrote:

            An essential element of organizations is the willingness of persons to
            contribute their individual efforts to the cooperative system… Inadequate
            incentives mean dissolution, or changes in organizational purpose, or failure
            to cooperate. Hence in all sorts of organizations the affording of adequate
            incentives becomes the most definitely emphasized task in their existence. It is
            probably in this aspect of executive work that failure is most pronounced.
            (Laffont and Martimort 2003: 12 quoting Barnard 1938:139)

The research on the effect of individual incentives on innovation is mixed, as noted above, while

the research on teamwork generally shows it to be positively related to innovation efforts. One

of the purposes of shared capitalism plans is to enhance teamwork by creating greater

                                                 14
cooperation and information sharing among co-workers, and between workers and

supervisors/managers. Based on this our first hypothesis is:

       Hypothesis One: Shared capitalism incentives are associated with a workplace culture

       that is supportive of innovation efforts.

       Hypothesis Two: Shared capitalism incentives are associated with a greater

       willingness of employees to report innovative ideas.

In line with our interest in exploring the impact of employment culture, specifically high

performance work systems, on innovation, past theorists have given some thought to the role of

organization design as a complement to incentives.

       For example, Barnard virtually defined the high performance work system when he wrote

about what Laffont and Mortimort call “nonmonetary incentives” as including: “ personal

nonmaterial opportunities; ideal benefactions; . . associational attractiveness; adaptation of

conditions to habitual methods and attitudes; opportunity of enlarged participation; [and] the

condition of communion.” Barnard stressed that what we think of as financial incentives had to

be “reinforced by other incentives,” specifically referring to these organizational components

(Laffont and Martimort 2003: 12 quoting Barnard 1938:142).

       In a modern economy where workers are often not manipulating physical objects, much

of work itself is inside the mind of the worker and is about collecting, communicating, sharing,

manipulating, and combining information in novel and innovative ways. Physical monitoring by

supervisors as a solution to the agency problem is very hard in these environments. Many of the

features of high performance work systems that theorists like Huselid have defined are essential

to innovations are based on information. A number of these high performance policies can

create conditions that favor innovation: good wages and benefits can produce high commitment



                                                   15
and loyalty; selective recruitment can get the most informed and curious persons into an

organization; training can upgrade their informational and cooperative skills; teamwork and job

rotation can break down “rigid silos” between them; and employee involvement can bring them

closer to the information that both customers and management possess. This is not dissimilar

from the classic agency theory notion of the "revelation principle" in which societies have a

problem in how to get “informed agents (to) reveal private information to a planner who

recommends actions” (Laffont and Martimort 2003: 26-7). One can conceive of a high

performance work system as a workplace mechanism to make the revelation principle work.

       Based on the theory and research linking high performance work systems to

organizational performance, we expect that an HPWS will also contribute to an innovative

culture and activity, and will complement shared capitalism plans. Our next four hypotheses are:

       Hypothesis Three: High performance work systems are associated with a workplace

       culture that is supportive of innovation efforts.

       Hypothesis Four: High performance work systems are associated with a greater

       willingness of employees to report innovative ideas

       Hypothesis Five: Shared capitalism plans have a positive interaction with high

       performance work systems in predicting a workplace culture that is supportive of

       innovation efforts.

       Hypothesis Six: Shared capitalism plans have a positive interaction with high

       performance work systems in predicting willingness of employees to report innovative

       ideas.

       Finally, we expect that if the above effects exist, they operate in part through greater

alignment of employees with the company’s strategy. Our final two hypotheses are:



                                                 16
       Hypothesis Seven: Individual alignment with company strategy mediates the

       relationship of shared capitalism and high performance work systems to a workplace

       culture that is supportive of innovation efforts.

       Hypothesis Eight: Individual alignment with company strategy mediates the

       relationship of shared capitalism and high performance work systems to the willingness

       of employees to report innovative ideas.



                                    DATA AND METHODS

Data Set

       The NBER Shared Capitalism Research Project developed a dataset to better understand

how shared capitalism impact innovation outcomes. The data set includes employee surveys

from a single company with a broad profit sharing program and opportunities for employee

ownership. This company agreed to participate in a larger shared capitalism study that included

14 organizations, described in more detail in the companion paper by Kruse, Blasi, and Park

(2006). Unique to this company, the survey asked a series of questions about organizational

innovation. The survey was administered in 2006 via paper and web-based administration. A

total of 27,825 usable surveys were returned for a response rate of 67.3%. Missing data for one

or more of the variables reduced the sample to 25,014 respondents who had complete data for all

of the variables.

Measures

       Human Resource Management. The 5-P model (Schuler, 1992) identifies the various

ways in which HRM activities can be examined, as philosophies, policies, programs, practices,

or processes. This study will examine HRM policies and practices.



                                                 17
       Policies, as defined here, are the broadly defined HRM activities. For example,

performance-based pay is a broadly defined measure of a HRM activity, but it can be

implemented through a number of different practices. By assessing HRM policies, a researcher is

able to cast a wide net in understanding the HRM activities within the organization. However,

HRM policies limit the detailed information on what specific practices make up a policy.

       Alternatively, HRM practices are the specific HRM activities which are employed to

implement a HRM policy. For example, under the policy of pay-for-performance there are

different HRM practices that can be employed to achieve the pay-for-performance policy.

Assessing specific HRM practices provides a level of detail missed by HRM policies. In this

study, the primary interest is the impact of shared capitalism, and its various forms, as a means to

achieve innovation outcomes. Thus, we examine the individual shared capitalism practices and a

combined shared capitalism index that can be utilized to achieve innovation outcomes, discussed

in more detail below.

       We examine two systems of HRM policies. First, we analyze a high performance work

system (HPWS) which includes employee participation, training, job rotation or cross-training,

selection, job security, and information sharing. The majority of questions (listed in Appendix A)

ask the respondent to report if s/he is covered by this policy. Second, a high performance work

system measure was included which asked employees their perceptions of the effectiveness of

each high performance policy for their work area or team. This measure thus localizes and

focuses the estimation of the high performance practices within the group of workers

immediately surrounding the respondent. This is notable, since most HRM scholars do not bring

high performance work literature down to the lowest level of the organization (notable

exceptions include Allen, Shore, & Griffith, 2003 and Zacharatos, Barling, & Iverson, 2005). In



                                                18
particular, this index measures team effectiveness in the following areas: selection, performance

goals, training, sharing information, meeting with customers, and rewards. This human resource

policy index is referred to as high performance work system – team (HPWST).

       Shared Capitalism. As noted above, shared capitalism appears in a variety of forms. This

study examines profit/gainsharing, employee ownership, and stock options. Profit sharing and

gainsharing are combined here because this firm has one program combining elements of each:

bonus payments are based both on company-wide return on net assets, and on division

performance. In addition, we examine the effects of individual incentives. For each incentive

plan, the presence of the incentive (yes/no) and the extensiveness of the incentive (as a percent of

total fixed annual pay) are examined. Additionally, a thermometer-style index of shared

capitalism was constructed. The index, described in Appendix B, reflects both whether workers

have different shared capitalism programs and whether these programs represent a high

percentage of the worker's fixed annual pay.

       Workplace Outcomes. After consulting with the research literature, two comprehensive

measures of innovation were designed. The first is focused on measuring aspects of a firm’s

culture for innovation. According to organizational theory on creativity, employees’ innovative

behavior can be influenced by the environment or culture an employee encounters (Amabile,

1988). Thus, an important outcome to understand is a culture that supports innovative behavior.

An extensive review of the literature on cultures that support innovation revealed consistent

characteristics across cultures that support innovation. For example, companies can promote

innovation by fostering an environment that encourages employees to voice ideas or suggestions,

provides the resources to further develop ideas, and recognizes the efforts of employees who do

try to innovate (Scott & Bruce, 1994). Given the past literature, our study examines the



                                                19
characteristics listed above. The specific items for the culture of innovation scale are listed in

Appendix A.

       The second measure focuses on individual employee’s willingness to marshal their

innovative ideas and do something about it. Innovative behaviour is characterized by a

multistage process, with different activities or behaviours necessary at each stage (Scott &

Bruce, 1994). In this study, we examine an employee’s ability and willingness to generate ideas,

as opposed to their actual innovative behavior. Specific items developed to assess employee

willingness to innovate are listed in Appendix A.

       Finally, we examine the extent to which employees are aligned with the goals and

objectives of the organization (Huselid, Becker, & Beatty, 2005). Aligning employees with

organizational goals and objectives has become an increasingly important task; especially in

organizations where employees’ knowledge and skills play a critical role in achieving strategic

objectives, such as innovation. It is through alignment that employees are aware of how they can

contribute to achieving organizational objectives. Much of the work arguing for the importance

of aligning employees behind shared goals and objectives has been at a conceptual level (Wright

& McMahan, 1992; Boswell & Wright, 2002). Thus, this research contributes to the current

literature by going beyond the importance of aligning HRM policies to organizational strategy

(Huselid, 1995). It looks deeper into the organization for how employees, the individuals who

implement strategic objectives, recognize and agree with them. Our interest is to examine if and

to what extent shared capitalism and high performance work policies are effective means to align

a workforce behind organizational objectives. Our measure combines four items representing




                                                 20
employee understanding and agreement with the company strategy, and employee views of

whether the company provides the resources and culture necessary to implement that strategy.2



                                          EMPIRICAL RESULTS

Culture for Innovation

           Table 1 summarizes the empirical results on the relationship between shared capitalism,

high performance work policies and employees’ perception of a culture for innovation.

           Shared Capitalism. In Models 1, 3, and 5 we examine the impact of the shared capitalism

index on employees’ perception of a culture for innovation. The results reveal that the shared

capitalism index is positively related to employees’ perception of a culture for innovation (Model

1). The shared capitalism index remains positively related when HPWST is added to the

equation (Model 5), but not when HPWS is added (Model 3), so there is only partial support for

hypothesis 1.

           When the shared capitalism practices are broken out to examine their individual impact

on employees’ perceptions of a culture for innovation (Models 2, 4, and 6), two shared

capitalism practices are consistently related to employees’ perceptions of a culture for

innovation: the percentage of base pay going to profit/gainsharing, and owning company stock.

These results stay strong when adding in either the HPWS or HPWST measure, supporting

hypothesis 1 for these two pay practices.

           High Performance Work Policies. A very consistent result in Models 3-6 is the strong

positive association between human resource management policies and employees’ perceptions

of a culture for innovation. An examination of adjusted R-squared with and without the human



2
    We thank Mark Huselid for insightful comments and suggestions on developing the employee alignment scale.

                                                        21
resource practices indicates that these practices greatly increase our ability to account for what

might create a culture for innovation. These results support hypothesis 3 and underline the

important role high performance policies have in creating and supporting a culture for innovation

where employees are encouraged to innovate, are rewarded for this, and are provided the

resources to do so.

Innovative Ideas

       Table 2 summaries the empirical results on the relationship between shared capitalism,

high performance work policies, and employees’ willingness and ability to innovate.

       Shared Capitalism. In Models 1, 3, and 5 we report the impact of the shared capitalism

index on employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas to the organization.

The results, consistent with those reported for a culture for innovation, find that those employees

who reported higher levels of shared capitalism also reported higher willingness and ability to

contribute innovative ideas to the organization. These results remained significant after including

measures of high performance work policies, supporting hypothesis 2.

       When the shared capitalism policies are broken out in columns 2, 4, and 6, employee

ownership is again a significant positive predictor of employees’ willingness and ability to

contribute innovative ideas to the organization. Unlike the results for culture of innovation,

however, profit/gainsharing as a percent of pay is not a significant predictor, and in fact

profit/gainsharing eligibility is a negative predictor in two of the models. These latter results

contrast strikingly with the positive results for employee ownership, suggesting that profit

sharing may focus workers toward short-term outcomes and away from activities with a long-

term payoff, while employee ownership helps promote behavior like innovative activity that will




                                                 22
have a longer-term payoff.3 This is because profit sharing in the organization under study

specifically rewards employees for productivity and operational achievements (such as on-time

customer delivery) of delivering current goods and services which the organization sees as part

of its existing repertoire of offerings. Profit sharing is not, however, tied to ideas or prototypes

for future goods and services.

        High Performance Work Policies. The impact of high performance work policies on

employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas to the organization is reported

in Models 3-6. The results, across all models, reveal a consistent and significant positive

relationship between both high performance work policy indexes and employees’ willingness

and ability to contribute innovative ideas to the organization. Given these results, support was

provided for hypothesis 4. Taken together, these results can be interpreted to signify that the use

of high performance work policies is one way to increase employees’ willingness and ability to

contribute innovative ideas to an organization.

        An interesting note is that in comparison to the HPWS impact on a culture for innovation,

it appears that the HPWS impact is not as substantial for willingness and ability to contribute

innovative ideas. We speculate that an employee’s ability to contribute innovative ideas may be

accounted for by individual differences not captured in this study. For example, divergent

thinking (Guilford, 1950), openness to new experience (Feist, 1998), and internal locus of

control (Woodman & Schoenfeldt, 1989) have all been related to highly innovative or creative

individuals.



3
   This interpretation was supported by several company representatives at the conference where this paper was
initially presented. One person noted that ROI, which stands for return on investment, was sometimes referred to by
employees as “repression of innovation” because a focus on short-term profitability discourages investments in
innovative activities that have a longer-term payoff.


                                                        23
Complementarities between Human Resource Policies and Shared Capitalism

       An important proposition of the systems perspective is that organizational outcomes will

be enhanced to the extent that a firm’s human resource management activities fit with and

complement one another (Baird and Meshoulam, 1988). The underlying rationale is that the

more strongly human resources fit together, the more consistent are the signals communicated to

employees regarding the behaviors that are valued by the organization (Becker & Huselid, 1998).

While fit can be tested using various statistical techniques (Venkatraman, 1989), we employ a

fit-as-moderation hypothesis, testing whether the impacts of shared capitalism on innovation

outcomes are dependent on the level of high performance work policies. Stated differently, we

expect that the impact of shared capitalism on employees’ perceptions of a culture for innovation

vary across levels of high performance work policies. To examine this, an interaction term was

included in Table 3 (Models 1 and 2).

       The results indicate that shared capitalism does interact positively and significantly with

both HPWS and HPWST and provides support for hypothesis 5. The fit between shared

capitalism and HPWST was positively related to employees’ perception of a culture for

innovation. Likewise, the interaction between shared capitalism and HPWS was positive and

marginally significant. To further help with interpretation, the interaction results are portrayed in

Figure 1 (using Table 3, Model 2). As seen there, shared capitalism has the most positive

relationship to innovation culture when HPWST is at high levels, with a mild positive

relationship when HPWST is at average levels. The relationship is negative when HPWST are at

low levels, indicating that employees may perceive the innovation culture poorly when they are

given the incentives, but not the tools, to make a difference--in this case the shared capitalism

may be perceived as primarily a shifting of financial risk to employees.



                                                 24
       There are very different results, however. in predicting willingness or ability to innovate.

As reported in Table 3 (Models 3 and 4) we find that while the base effects are positive and

significant, the interaction between the shared capitalism index and high performance work

practices is negative and significant for both HPWS and HPWST. These results indicate that

when employees are covered by high performance work practices, the impact of shared

capitalism policies on their willingness and ability to innovate for the organization is reduced.

Put another way, the positive base effects and negative interaction indicates that these two

constructs may substitute for each other: the base effect shows that shared capitalism has a

positive effect on innovative activity for those who are not covered by HPWS, but shared

capitalism has a much smaller or neutral effect for those who are covered by HPWS. An HPWS

appears to provide a strong effect on its own, perhaps making unnecessary the addition of shared

capitalism incentives.

       To further help with interpretation, the interaction results are portrayed in Figure 2 (using

Table 3, Model 4). Shared capitalism has a strong positive association with innovative ideas for

workers with low values on HPWST, and only a mild positive association when HPWST is at

high levels. These illustrate the point made above: high performance work policies and shared

capitalist incentives may act somewhat as substitutes here, with shared capitalism providing the

strongest incentives for contributing ideas among those who have not been encouraged to

contribute ideas through high performance work policies.

Alignment

       Table 4 summaries the empirical results on the relationship between shared capitalism,

high performance work policies, and organizational alignment.




                                                 25
       Shared Capitalism. The results listed in Model 1, 3, and 4 indicate that shared capitalism

may play a significant and positive role in aligning employees behind the goals and objectives of

the organization. Even in the presence of high performance work policies, shared capitalism

continues to play a significant and positive role in employee alignment. There are different

results when interacting shared capitalism with the two HPWS measures: the base effect of

shared capitalism stays strong and the interaction is insignificant in Model 3, while the opposite

is true in Model 6. It is therefore unclear whether shared capitalism operates on its own or only

in combination with HPWS in affecting alignment. The results of specific shared capitalism

practices on employee alignment are also not consistent between the models controlling for

different measures of HPWS. Stock option holding and profit/gainsharing as a percent of pay are

predictors when controlling for HPWS, while profit/gainsharing eligibility and employee

ownership as a percent of pay are predictors when controlling for HPWST. It is noteworthy that

individual bonus eligibility (but not the bonus size) is a strong predictor of alignment, possibly

reflecting greater bonus eligibility among high-level managers (not fully captured in the

management level controls).

       High Performance Work Policies. Consistent with the results for a culture for innovation

and innovative ideas, high performance work policies continue to have a strong impact in

Models 1 to 6 of Table 4. An interesting finding is the relative impact of the HPWS vs. the

HPWST on alignment. The adjusted R-square for the models with HPWST accounts for a greater

amount of variance in the alignment of employees. This result could indicate that the greater

impact on employee alignment is not when employees experience high performance policies

(HPWS), but when they perceive these practices as effective (HPWST) in the context of their




                                                 26
immediate local work group or team. This finding suggests that the level of measurement of high

performance work practices is important.

         Complementarities between Human Resource Policies and Shared Capitalism. Once

again, using interaction terms we examined the impact of the complementary relationship

between human resource management policies and shared capitalism on employee alignment.

The only significant result is reported in Model 6. Here shared capitalism interacts with HPWST

and results in a positive effect on employee alignment. This result confirms the importance of

ensuring that human resource policies and shared capitalism complement each other in order to

achieve maximum benefits. Again, it is interesting to note that the interaction with shared

capitalism was only significant with HPWST, which indicates the importance of perceived

policy effectiveness in work groups over the mere presence of policies. It appears that such

practices need not only to be bundled together but need to be bundled together in a way that is

seen as effective within a local work group.

Mediating Role of Alignment

         Across the results, a consistent finding is that HRM policies and shared capitalism are

related to employees’ perception of a culture for innovation and employees’ willingness and

ability to contribute innovative ideas. However, it is not clear how HRM policies and shared

capitalism impact these outcomes (Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Ostroff & Bowen, 2000). For

instance, management scholars have argued that HRM policies impact organizational outcomes

through organizational culture (Ostroff & Bowen, 2000), organizational commitment (Allen,

Shore, & Griffeth, 2003), and employee skills, motivation, and opportunities (Lepak, et al.,

2006).




                                                 27
       While the intervening mechanisms listed above are plausible, our interest is the impact

HRM policies have in creating employee alignment. To test for mediation, three models are run

to test four conditions (Baron and Kenny, 1986). First, the independent variable (HRM policies

or shared capitalism index) must significantly impact innovation outcomes. Second, the

independent variable must significantly impact the mediator (alignment). Third, with the

independent variable in the equation, alignment must impact innovation outcomes. The fourth

necessary condition is a decrease in the coefficient between the independent variable and

innovation outcomes as alignment is added. Using this technique it is possible to assess if the

coefficient between the independent variable and the outcomes decreased with alignment in the

equation. The extent of reduction in the coefficient reveals how much of the relationship between

the independent variable and dependent is indirectly working through the mediator (alignment).

Finally, Sobel’s test is employed to ensure that the drop in the coefficient is significantly

different from zero (Sobel, 1982). Tables 5 and 6 reports the results of the test of mediation.

       Shared Capitalism. The results in Tables 5 and 6 reveal that alignment does partially

mediate the relationship between shared capitalism and employee’s perception of a culture for

innovation. This is indicated by the reduction in the shared capitalism coefficient from Model 4

to Model 6, and a significant value for Sobel’s test, in both tables. Combined, these results

suggest that one way in which shared capitalism impacts innovation outcomes is by aligning the

workforce behind the goals and strategic objectives of the organization. However, the shared

capitalism coefficient was not reduced to zero for either outcome, implying other mechanisms

are working between shared capitalism and innovation outcomes. These findings indicate that

the overall corporate culture that binds employees together (understanding and agreeing with

common goals, having the tools and involvement to advance those goals, and believing the



                                                 28
culture is right to achieve these goals) does play a key role in determining how shared capitalism

incentives relate to innovation but that there still exists an independent incentive effect from

shared capitalism. This is very similar to Barnard’s view above concerning the need for a

package of monetary and non-monetary incentives. The sense of common enterprise that results

from shared capitalism appears to impact the agency problem by reinforcing a common culture

among the members of the firm, yet the pure incentive effect of shared rewards themselves also

appears to focus the individual worker (similar to the findings in Freeman, Kruse, and Blasi,

2007).

         High Performance Work Policies. Also reported in Tables 5 and 6 is the mediating role of

alignment with high performance work policies. Specifically, the analysis reveals that alignment

partially mediates the relationship that HPWS (Models 1-3) and HPWST (Models4-6) have with

employees’ perception of a culture for innovation. A similar result is obtained in predicting and

employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas (Table 6). These results

indicate that part of the effect of high performance work policies on innovation outcomes is

through aligning the workforce behind shared goals and objectives. However, since the high

performance work system coefficients are not reduced to zero, high performance work policies

also impact the innovation outcomes through additional means.



                                         CONCLUSION

         The principal findings of this paper are that shared capitalism and high performance work

policies affect innovation outcomes through direct effects, interactions, and indirect effects. The

results of this study contribute to the current literature on shared capitalism and human resource

management literature in a number of ways. First, empirical research on the importance of



                                                 29
rewards and compensation practices as a means to achieve innovation outcomes is limited. This

study adds to and extends the literature by examining multiple forms of shared capitalism and

their impact on innovation outcomes. We demonstrate these effects in a population of adult

workers in a large sample of respondents in hundreds of work sites, which provides several

advantages in relation to past research. Additionally, we were able to identify a possible

mediating mechanism between shared capitalism and innovation outcomes. Second, taking a

systems perspective, we investigate the impact of two systems of high performance work policies

on innovation outcomes. While innovation management scholars have examined the impact of

individual human resource management practices on creativity or innovation, a systems approach

has, to our knowledge, never been published (Harden, 2006).

       Organizations seeking to develop a culture of innovation could look to this research as an

answer for how this occurs. Specifically, our results reveal that a culture for innovation can be

developed and supported through the use of shared capitalism and high performance work

practices. We found moderate support for the importance of pairing shared capitalism and high

performance work practices together to achieve the greatest impact on a culture for innovation.

Additionally, shared capitalism and high performance work practices work in part by aligning

employees around the goals and objectives of the organization.

       As organizations increasingly depend on all employees to contribute innovative ideas to

the organization, this research aims to address the role that shared capitalism and high

performance work policies play to achieve these ends. The results of this study indicate that a

means to promote employee willingness and ability to contribute innovation ideas is the use of

high performance work policies and shared capitalism, both of which had a strong positive

relationship with this outcome. However, an interesting finding of this study is that the impact of



                                                30
shared capitalism on innovative ideas varies by the level of high performance work policies the

employee experiences in his or her work group. And finally, the indirect effect of high

performance work practices and shared capitalism on innovative ideas indicates that an aligned

employee is more willing and able to contribute innovative ideas to the organization. Shared

capitalism and high performance work practices are one way to align an employee behind the

goals and objectives of the organization. This last point introduces a conundrum for the manager

looking for a practical application of the findings. A manager can implement shared capitalism

practices and high performance work practices, but how does a manager implement alignment?

Does the manager just presume that whatever alignment appears is “produced” by shared

capitalist and high performance work practices? The answer is no. This would be tantamount to

flying blind on what will probably be a critical measure of future innovation success for an

organization. The best response is to regularly measure the workforce’s alignment and use focus

groups and other methods to assess why alignment may be low and reconceive the practices and

the overall corporate culture accordingly (Huselid, Becker, & Beatty, 2005).

       To the extent that innovation can be conceived as a principal-agent problem, we have

demonstrated that a system of shared incentives and a shared high performance employment

culture at the lowest levels of organizations is important to create both an innovative

environment that is fertile ground for innovative ideas, and the willingness to work on innovative

ideas. Taken together, these findings indicate that the overall corporate culture that binds

employees together does play a key role in determining how shared capitalism incentives relate

to innovation, but there still exists an independent incentive effect from shared capitalism.

The sense of common enterprise that results from shared capitalism appears to impact the agency




                                                 31
problem by reinforcing a common culture among the members of the firm, yet the pure incentive

effect of shared rewards themselves also appears to focus the individual worker.

       In summary these findings confirm several of the main themes of agency theory: that the

principal-agent problem can be addressed by incentives, and that agency conflicts respond to a

cooperative culture between workers which encourages mutual monitoring and opportunities to

share information. The results of this study make two unique and nuanced contributions to this

perspective: first, that it is the combination of shared incentives, cooperative culture, and mutual

monitoring that works best, and second, that high performance workplace systems help resolve

agency problems when employees work in teams at the lowest level of the organization that are

rich with rigorous selection, training, information sharing, clear goals, and fair rewards.

                   APPENDIX B: The shared capitalist thermometer index

       As a first step in assessing the relation of shared capitalism to employee outcomes, we

constructed a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism. This index assigns one point each

when the worker was covered by any of the shared capitalist forms of compensation about which

the survey asked, with additional points for recent bonuses or grants, and for large bonuses or

stock holdings. For questions with a continuous numeric answer, we gave the item a value of 1

if the respondent had a value greater than the median value. Because there is no natural ordering

of shared capitalist systems in the sense that a firm first introduces profit-sharing, then adds

employee ownership, and then gain-sharing, the index is not a Guttman scale. It is a simple

summated rating (Bartholomew et al, 2002; Bartholomew, 1996), using dichotomous scoring.

       In the NBER data there are ten variables in the index, which gives one point each for:

profit sharing eligibility, gain sharing eligibility, owning any company stock, holding stock

options, receiving a profit sharing bonus in the past year, receiving a gain sharing bonus in the

past year, having an above-median profit- and gain sharing bonus as a percent of pay, having an

above-median company stock holding as a percent of pay, receiving a stock option grant in the

past year, and having above-median stock option holdings (including unvested options if they

could be exercised today) as a percent of pay.

       Indices of this style have both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, they

provide a quick and ready measure of the extent of shared capitalist arrangements that makes it

easy to compare results across surveys and to summarize the broad thrust of findings. Since our

firm surveys covered only firms with some shared capitalist arrangements, the index allows us to

differentiate workers with differing degrees of incentive to their firm’s programs. On the

negative side, the index treats different programs the same even though they potentially have



                                                 42
different effects on particular outcomes. It postulates a single scale with equal weights rather

than using factor analysis or other statistical modelling to obtain weights for given factors. To

deal with these problems, we also estimate the relationship of the outcomes to the different types

of shared capitalism, introduced as dummy or continuous variables in regressions.4 By

comparing the results with the shared capitalism index to the results with the disaggregated

measures, we can assess the loss of information due to the amalgamation of the measures into a

single index.

         Figure B1 shows the distribution of our shared capitalism index in the company analyzed

here. Close to three-fourths of employees (74%) have at least one form of shared capitalism

(score of 1 or more). The distribution is non-normal, with only 5% of workers having scores of 6

or greater. The mean score of the index is 2.47. For our purposes there is sufficient variation in

the index to differentiate the extent of the shared capitalist “treatment” on workers.




4
 There are statistical techniques to deal with the formation of latent variable indices from questions of the sort that
we are amalgamating into a single summated rating. See Bartholomew et al. (2002) and Spector (1992).
