                 Gains From Trade in Differentiated Products:
                           Japanese Compact Trucks




                                   ABSTRACT




     We present a methodology for estimating the welfare gains from a product

with new characteristics, and apply it to Japanese and American compact
trucks.   Our approach can be used on any products for which a hedonic
regression can be estimated.    For 1979—80 we find average welfare gains of

$500—600 per Japanese truck.    In later years the benefit to consumers is

reduced by the tariff on imports and the introduction of American compact

models.   American compacts have consumer gains which are much less than the

average for Japanese models, since for each American compact there is an

import with very similar characteristics.

 1. Introduction

      Recent literature on monopolistic competition and trade has stressed the

 welfare gains available through importing new varieties of a differentiated

 product [see Helpman (1981), Krugman (1980), Lancaster (1980) and Helpman and

 Krugman (1985)]. In models which incorporate a description of goods in terms

 of characteristics, following Lancaster (1979), the welfare gains are espe-

 cially large when the characteristics of the domestic and imported goods are

quite different.   In this paper we shall present a methodology for estimating

the welfare gains from a product with new characteristics, and apply it to

Japanese and American compact trucks. The application to Japanese compacts is

of particular interest since prior to 1982 similiar American models did not

exist.

     Under free trade, the consumer gains we estimate for Japanese compact

trucks are also social gains.     Since August 1980, however, Japanese trucks

have faced a tariff of 25%, up from 4% previously. With this trade barrier we

continue to measure consumer gains from the imports, and do not include the

tariff revenue as would be required in a social calculation.     For American

compacts, available in 1982 and later, we also measure the consumer gains from

having each model available. These benefits would need to be compared to the

research and development costs of compact models to determine the net social

gain or loss.

     In section 2 we outline the theory behind our welfare measure. The model

presented extends the analysis of Feenstra (1986) to discrete choice.      In

section 3 we discuss the recent history of the truck industry and present data

on Japanese and American vehicles.    Our empirical results are contained in

section 4, while conclusions are given in section 5.

    We can briefly mention other approaches to estimating the gains from
                                                   —2—

trade with differentiated products. Harris (1984) presents a general equili-

brium model of Canadian—U.S. trade, and simulates the effects of reducing

trade barriers.            He obtains large estimates of the gains from free inter-

national trade.            However, while product differentiation is present in some

versions of the model, the main source of welfare gain is increasing returns

to scale on the supply side. Bresnahan (1981) presents a model with monopo-

listic competition of the Lancaster type and applies it the U.S. automobile

industry.         Gains from new products could be estimated from this model, and

also from the discrete choice literature pioneered by McFadden (1976). The

main virtue of our own approach is its remarkable simplicity.                      This is

achieved by focusing directly on the consumer gains from a new product,

without estimating cross—sectional demand or modelling the supply side in

depth.



2. Model of Consumer Welfare

A. Continuous Choice

     We shall suppose that the consumer purchases zero or one unit of a

differentiated product, which we refer to as a truck, and any amount of a

homogeneous good. Utility from consuming truck services is U(q,O) where q =

(q1,...,q)           0 is a vector of physical characteristics (size, weight,

horsepower, etc.), and 0 =               °i'••'°n         0 is a vector of taste parameters

which differs across individuals. We shall adopt a specific functional form

for utility,


                            n
            ii(     Q\ —        .q.(A)    ,




where       qA) (q — 1)/A,                    0   A < 1

                     =lnq1, ifAO
                                             —3—

 (1) is a CES utility function defined over characteristics, where we permit

negative values of A.'           Reducing A corresponds to a more concave utility

function.

     Denoting the homogeneous good by x             0, the consumer chooses q and x to

solve the problem,



            max U(q,O) +   x                                                      (2)

            subject to p(q) +    x = y


where the budget constraint is instead x = y if no truck is purchased.              In

this problem y denotes total income available to the consumer, p(q) is the

price of a truck depending on its characteristics, and the homogeneous good is

used as numeraire. The additively seperable form of utility in (2) simplifies

the welfare analysis, and implies that the optimal choice of truck
characteristics q is independent of income.

     Several points concerning the "hedonic" price function p(q) should be

noted.     We suppose that this price function is exogenously presented to the

consumer from the supply side of the market. Under perfect competition p(q)

would correspond to long—run marginal costs of firms, reflecting technology

and factor prices. The competitive case has been throughly analysed by Rosen

(1974).     Under pure monopoly p(q) would be chosen by the firm to maximize

profits; this optimal control problem has been analysed by Mussa and Rosen

(1978) and Krishna (1985 ).         In   that case p(q) would depend on marginal costs

and the distribution and utility function of consumers

     We shall take p(q) as exogenous, and in this section assume that a truck

of        characteristics vector q        0 is available, corresponding to continuous

choice for consumers.          In section B below we specialize our results to the
                                                —4—

case of discrete choice.             We also assume in this section that domestically

produced and imported trucks have the same hedonic price function, and do not

even distinguish these sources of supply.                   In section C below we consider a

tariff on imported trucks, in which case the price functions will differ.

Finally, throughout our analysis we shall use a specific functional form for

p(q), which corresponds to that used in our empirical application:



            p(q) =    exp(a +   q)      ,                                                (3)


where a > 0 and             =                   > 0 are parameters, and all vectors are

treated as columns unless transposed using a prime.

       If the consumer decides to purchase a truck, the first—order conditions

for (1) are,



                       =   exp(a +          ,    i   =   1,...,n,                        (4)




where we use a tilde to denote the optimum.                     Thus, given any (unobserved)

taste parameters 0 we can use (4) to solve for the optimal truck choice                   for

that consumer. But turning this logic around, for any truck we can use (4)

to solve for the taste parameters 0 of the consumer who would optimally choose

that truck. We denote this relation by 0(q) =                   [O1(q),...,O(q)]   where from

(4),



                  =    exp(a +   ') iix                                                  (4)


This idea of solving for the taste parameters 0 of a consumer whose optimal

choice is      will play a central role in evaluating the welfare gain from new
                                         —5—

products. For now, we simpiy observe that we can rewrite utility U(q,O) as a

function of actual consumption q and a consumerTh optimal choice ,



             U[q,0()}   =
                            p().E1.qY
                                           '    ,                                (5)


using (1), (3) and (4).

        Next, we should check whether the consumer desires to purchase a truck at

all.     If A > 0 then when q = 0 the consumer receives the disutility of s/A,

where 0 =               Then the consumer wishes to purchase the optimal choice
             E10.   .


if and only if,



            U(,0) p() — 0/A        •
                                                                                (6)


Multiplying (4) by , subtracting O and summing, we find that U(,0) =            p()
        — U/A.   It follows that (6) will hold if and only if,



                                                                                (6)


If a consumers optimal choice of characteristics              is low, violating (6),

then the consumer prefers to not purchase the truck and receive disutility of

—s/A.     Otherwise, when (6) is satisfied the consumer obtains a higher level

of surplus by purchasing the optimal truck choice.             It can be shown that

raising O increases , so it is consumers with higher taste parameters 0
who actually purchase a truck.2

       Finally, if A    0 then q = 0 leads to disutility of negative infinity, so

in this case the optimal choice        is always purchased.

3. Discrete Choice

     Suppose that some exogenous set 2 =            (q}   of trucks is available to the

consumer at the prices p(q), given in (3). We include 0 c Q as the choice of

not purchasing a truck.       To maximize utility as in (2), each consumer will

solve the problem,



           max [U(q,O) —   p(q)]    •                                              (7)
           q cl



Let q* denote the solution to (7), where this optimal choice depends on the

taste parameters 0 and the set .

     Suppose now that a new truck model becomes available. To fix ideas, we

can let    denote the set of American trucks and the new model be a Japanese

compact truck.     We are interested in evaluating the welfare gain due to the

availability of the Japanese compact truck. Clearly, this gain depends on the

distribution of consumers who actually purchase the new model. Let us focus on

one individual of particular importance:              the consumer for whom the newly

available model would be the optimal choice in the continuous case where all

models q ) 0 exist. That is, let          denote the new Japanese truck and consider

the consumer with taste parameters 0(') given by (4). The utility function

for this consumer is given by (5).             The gain from having the compact truck

available is,



          Gain =   {u[,e()]   —    p()}   —   {U[q*,0()]   —   p(q*)}   .          (8)


Thus, the gain for this consumer is simply the difference between the surplus

received from the best American choice q* and the Japanese model j.

     Next, we wish to evaluate the total consumer gain from having the
                                          —7—

Japanese truck available, and here we rely on an approximation. (8) gives us

the welfare gain for the consumer who would optimally choose                 even if all

models q     0 existed. There will be other consumers who are just indifferent

between some American model q* and the Japanese model .                  These consumers

receive a welfare gain of zero from the new model. We evaluate the total gain

in welfare as the simple average between these two types of consumers, multip—

lied by the quantity of the Japanese model purchased:



           Total consumer gain       1/2 x Gain x Quantity   .                       (9)


     There are two approximations implicit in (9).               The first is that the

individual consumer gain from having the compact truck available declines as a

linear function of the quantity purchased, as we consider consumers whose

optimal (continuous) choice lies further away from .             In   other words, we are

assuming a linear demand curve for the Japanese model.3 This approximation is

analogous to that made in conventional measures of consumer surplus, and for

that reason, we do not regard it as unusual.

     However, a second approximation is that we are ignoring some consumers

who receive an individual welfare gain greater than (8). To see this, we can

evaluate how the extra utility received from the Japanese model changes with

taste parameters:


                      —   U(q*,O)]   =       — q*(A)

                                     <0ifq1<q ,                                     (10)

                                     >0ifq=0
                                          1  , A>O

Consider the case where the optimal choice of American truck q* is non—zero.
                                             —8—

Then since the Japanese compact truck has smaller characteristics than any

standard American model, a consumer with taste parameters smaller than O()

will receive a welfare gain from the Japanese truck which exceeds (8). If A >

0, this logic applies until we reach a consumer who would not wish to purchase

any American model, in which case the sign of (10) is reversed and lower

values of 8 reduce the welfare gain from the Japanese truck.4

     In our empirical analysis we shall not attempt to account for consumers

with a welfare gain greater than (8).            Accordingly, we regard the measure of

total gain given by (9) as an underestimate of the actual welfare gain.



C. Effects of a Tariff

     Consider the competitive case where the hedonic price function (3) is

given by long—run marginal costs. An ad valorem tariff on Japanese imports

corresponds to a rise in a, increasing all prices by the same percentage. We

then rewrite the hedonic price function as,5


                  exp(a1 +    rq)   for Japanese compact trucks
     p(q) =   {                                                                   (3)
                  exp(cx2 +   8q)   for American standard trucks


with i > 2 reflecting the tariff.                The effects of a tariff on consumer

choice in the continuous case have been analysed in Feenstra (1986). Here we

simply wish to see how (3) affects our measure of welfare gain from a

Japanese compact truck in the discrete case.

     Using (3) the formulae for consumer gain in (8) and (9) are not

affected. The empirical measure of gain is reduced since the price of any

Japanese truck has increased.            Indeed, for some values of A it is possible

that the consumer gain in (8) is negative.               This means that the surplus

received from the Japanese model ,            subject to the tariff, is less than the
                                       —9—

 surplus available from an American model.    It follows that the Japanese truck

 would not be purchased, which obviously contradicts the empirical evidence.

 We regard this situation as reflecting an incorrect choice of A in the utility

 function.   For lower values of A the utility function becomes more concave,

 and the difference in characteristics between a Japanese compact and American

 truck can more than compensate for the tariff, leading to positive consumer

gain in (8). This assertion is confirmed in our empirical analysis, where we

use the occurence of negative values for (8) as a guide to choosing
appropriate levels for A.



3. Japanese and American Trucks

     Through the 1960Th and 1970Th Japanese compact trucks were imported into

the United State, while similar small domestic models were not produced.

These trucks were imported by major Japanese producers as well as U.S.

companies buying from subsidiaries or independent firms in Japan. Examples of

the latter, known as "captive imports" are:     General Motors, which imported

the LUV pickup produced by Isuzu; Ford, which imported the Courier produced by

Toyo Kogyo; and Chrysler, which imported the Arrow and Dodge D—50 compact

trucks from Mitsubishi.     This situation was altered in August 1980 by the

imposition of a 25% tariff on Japanese truck imports, up from its former level

of 4%. The tariff increase led to the development of domestic compact trucks

by the major U.S. producers, which were sold beginning in 1982.6 At this time

all "captive imports" except the Dodge D—50 were discontinued.

     The imposition of the 25% tariff on Japanese trucks has an unusual

legislative history.      In 1980, Ford and the UAW applied to the U.S.
International Trade Commission (ITC) for import relief in both the the
passenger car and the truck markets.    Under Section 201 of the Trade Act of
                                    — 10 —



1974, a recommendation for relief can be given only if imports are the most
important cause of injury to the domestic industry. The ITC determined that

the recession in the U.S. was a greater cause of injury to the auto industry

than rising imports, so import relief was not granted.     Subsequent to this

decision the "voluntary" export restraint in cars was negotiated with Japan

(see Feenstra, 1984, 1985), while protection in trucks followed a different

route.

     At this time most Japanese trucks were imported as cab/chassis with some

final assembly needed.    In 1980 Congress asked the ITC to study the possible

reclassification of Japanese imports from "parts of trucks" as then applied to

"complete or unfinished trucks."     The former carried a tariff rate of 4Z,

whereas the latter had a duty of 25%. That unusually high rate was a result

of the "chicken war" between the United States and Europe in 1962—63, when

Germany joined the EEC which raised its tariff on poultry imports. The U.S.

retaliated by increasing the tariff on trucks (from Volkswagon) and other

products. In 1980 the U.S. Customs Service announced that effective August 21

imported lightweight cab/chassis would be reclassified as complete trucks.

This raised the tariff rate on nearly all Japanese trucks from 4 to 25%.

     In Table 1 we show the unit—values for new Japanese and American pickup

trucks over 1979—84.     These data summarize a sample collected from several

different sources (listed in Tables 1, 2).    Surprisingly, data reporting for

trucks has been comprehensive only in recent years.      The increase in the

number of Japanese models included in our sample in 1983—84, and the increase

in American models in 1984, reflects the greater availability of data.     In

earlier years the data included in our sample are only the base version of

each particular truck model. For example, in 1983 and earlier years the base

version of three standard pickups produced by GM (the C—b, C—20 and C—30) are
                                      — 11 —



 included   in our sample.   In 1984 a total of eleven versions of these three

 models are included. Utility vehicles and vans were omitted from the sample,

 since it was found that these observations did not fit the same hedonic

 regression as trucks.7

      The prices in our sample are manufacturerTh suggested retail.   Taking the

 weighted average of the prices, using current year sales as weights, yields
 the unit—values in Table 1.     The effect of the 25% tariff on Japanese trucks

 is evident in the unit—value increase of 28.5% from 1980 to 1981.8    The rise

 in the unit—value over 1982—83 should be interpreted with caution since, as

mentioned above, in the former year only the base version of each model in
included in our sample.      The unit—values for American compact trucks over

1982—84, and for American standard trucks over the entire sample period, are

also shown in Table 1.

     In addition to manufacturers suggested retail price, data were collected

on various characteristics of truck models: length, weight, horsepower, four—

wheel drive, type of transmission, and other specifications. In Table 2, this

information is compared for Japanese and American models in 1982. In weight

the average Japanese model is below the average American standard truck by

33%, and in horsepower it is less by 23%. We can also compare a large Japa-

nese model (the Nissan 720 Kingcab) with a small American standard (the Dodge

Ram D—50; similar models are produced by GM and Ford).        In this case the

Japanese compact is below the American standard in weight and slightly in

length, but not in horsepower.     Turning to American compact trucks, each of

these are comparable in their price and characteristics to some Japanese

model. In Table 2 we report the average values for American compacts, but do

not give a high—low range:     with only four observations, there is no model

which has significantly more or less of all three characteristics than the
                                      — 12   —




average shown.
     Data were also collected on the miles per gallon (MPG) of each truck
model.     It seems particularly important to include this specification in our

study, since it may be an important source of consumer gain when purchasing a

fuel—efficient Japanese model. To incorporate MPG into our analysis we follow

the method of Atkinson and Halvorsen (1984), Ohta and Griliches (1983) and

Daly and Mayor (1983). For each truck model we compute the "full price" as

follows:


                              T
           Full Price = R ÷       GM/MPG(1 + p)t                          (11)




where R is the manufacturers suggested retail price, G is the real price of

gasoline in year t, Mt is the number of miles driven in year t, p is the

discount rate, and T is the lifetime of the truck.       Thus, the full price

includes the retail price of the truck and the present discounted value of

gasoline costs.9

     Values for the discounted gasoline costs in 1982 are shown in Table 2.

These costs range between one—half and three—quarters of the retail price of a

truck.     We have chosen a discount rate of 7%, though it was found that the

estimates of the hedonic regressions reported below (and the implied welfare

calculations) were not sensitive to this choice. In the hedonic regressions we

use the "full price" as the dependent variable.



4. Empirical Results

A. Hedonic Regressions

    We estimate the hedonic price function (3) to obtain the coefficients

needed in our welfare calculations. We shall use the estimating form,
                                       — 13 —




             in tk =     +        + Ctk                                     (12)



where t denotes years, k denotes models and            is the "full price" of a
truck as in (11).      We also allow      to differ between compact and standard
models.      The use of hedonic regressions was proposed by Griliches (1971),

while recent applications are in Atkinson and Halvorsen (1984) and Ohta and

Griliches (1983). Feenstra (1984, 1985, 1986) uses this technique to measure

quality upgrading in Japanese cars imported to the U.S. under the trade
restraint.

        In the first column of Table 3 we report the hedonic regression for

Japanese models, while that for American models is given in the second and

third columns. Each estimated coefficient can be given a useful interpreta-

tion:     the addition of one foot in length, for example, raises price by an

estimated 1.4% for Japanese and 2.3% for American trucks, where the latter is

significant. Weight and horsepower are each highly significant in at least

one of the regressions. The dummy variable for transmission takes the value

of unity if the truck has a five—speed or automatic transmission and zero

otherwise, and similarly for four—wheel drive.'0

        In the lower portion of Table 3 we show the coefficients of dummy

variables for each year, relative to 1979.       These coefficients measure the

rise in nominal prices after correcting for changes in model characteristics:

the "quality—adjusted" price rise.      From 1979 to 1981 the quality—adjusted

price rise is 23% for Japanese models, and this coefficient is nearly the same

in the following years. Thus, after correcting for quality change the prices

of Japanese trucks are roughly constant over 1981—84. This pattern is also

seen for the quality—adjusted price rise in American compact trucks, which is
                                      — 14 —



29%   from 1979 to 1982 and similar in following years (second column, Table

3).      [n contrast, for American standard trucks we see a steady rise in

quality—adjusted prices over 1981—84 (third column).

        If the Japanese and American regressions are not significantly different,

then our data can be combined to improve the efficiency of the estimates. We

test this hypothesis by running the pooled regression shown in the fourth and

fifth columns of Table 3.        In this case the coefficients     are equal for

compact and standard trucks. We also impose equal value of at for Japanese

and American compact trucks.      For American standard trucks, the value of cz

differs from compact trucks for 1981, 1982 and 1984. Overall, we find that

the pooled regression is not statistically different from the seperate

regressions shown in Table 3. Using the sum of squared residuals (SSR) shown,

the F—statistic to test the various restrictions in the pooled regression is

[(0.333—0.299)I11}/(0.2991151) = 1.56 which compares with F095(11,151) =

1.85.     Thus, we can accept these restrictions.

        We also checked whether the quality coefficients of the pooled regression

in Table 3 were stable over time, by estimating the regression seperately for

each year. The resulting SSR was 0.282 with a total of 42 coefficients. The

F—statistic to test whether the quality coefficients are equal over time is

[(0.333—0.282)128]/(0.2821134) = 0.866 which compares with F095(28,134) =

1.55.    Thus, we accept the hypothesis of stable quality coefficients.

      We shall use the coefficients of the pooled regression in Table 3 for the

welfare calculations that follow.       We see that each of length, weight and

horsepower are highly significant. Since Japanese and American compact models

have the same values of a, these trucks are comparable in their prices.

American standard trucks have a lower value of at, or quality—adjusted price,

for the two years 1980—81 following the imposition of the 25% tariff on
                                      — 15 —



 imported   models.   However, in 1984 we find that quality—adjusted prices for

 American standard trucks have risen above those of compact models, with a

 higher value of



 B. Welfare Calculation

      Before computing the welfare gain from having compact trucks available,

we need to carefully explain how our theory of section 2 is applied to the

data. Note, that in section 2 each of the characteristics     were measured as

continuous variables. The theory developed there cannot be used for discrete

variables such as transmission or four—wheel drive.       Accordingly we shall

treat each truck model as not including either of these characteristics. To

achieve this, if a model does come equipped with a five—speed or automatic

transmission then we divide its price by exp(O.016) (using the coefficient

from Table 3, pooled regression), and we divide its price by exp(O.19) if

equipped with four—wheel drive.

     We must also deal with the residuals in our estimated hedonic regression,

that is, the difference between actual and predicted prices. There are two

approaches which can be taken. First, we could assume that the residual for

each model reflects unmeasured characteristics of that truck. An example of

this would be power steering, for which data was not available on American

models.1' In this case a low price (negative residual) would indicate some

undesirable specification of the truck, and would not lead to any rise in

consumer surplus. At the other extreme, we could assume that any difference

between actual and predicted prices is unrelated to model specifications, so a

negative residual would lead to a rise in consumer surplus by exactly that

dollar amount.

     It turns out that the latter assumption is inconsistent with our data.
                                       — 16 —



We   find one model in particular —   the C—10 standard pickup produced by General
Motors — which has negative residuals in the hedonic regression ranging from

—$300 to —$1,000 dollars in various years.        If this represents a source of

gain to consumers buying the truck, then it may be impossible to identify a

consumer who would wish to purchase a Japanese compact (which had much smaller

residuals).    Put differently, when the negative residual from the C—10 is

added to (8), the resulting consumer gain from having the compact truck

available would be negative. Accordingly, in our calculations below we rely

on the former assumption, that each residual reflects unmeasured character-

istics.     This means that we use the predicted price from the hedonic

regression as reflecting what people pay for the three characteristics we have

idntif led (length, weight, horsepower).        Thus, the predicted price corres-

ponds to p(q) in (3) or (3).

      We can now briefly review how our welfare calculation is performed.

Choose some value for A in the utility function (1), and let          denote the

characteristics of a Japanese model. Then we use (4) to solve for the taste

parameters of a consumer who would optimally choose this model. Let 2 denote

the set of American models (compact or standard). For this consumer we deter-

mine the best American choice q* in (7), and then compute the consumer gain as

in (8), (9). We repeat this calculation for each Japanese model           in each

year. In addition, we do the same calculation for each American compact model

over 1982—1984.    In that case       denotes an American compact, 2 the set of

Japanese models, and q* the best Japanese choice.

      In Table 4 we show the results of our welfare calculation for A = —8, —10

and —15.    The consumer gains shown are expressed in dollars per truck pur-

chased.    We first report a weighted average of the gains for individual

Japanese and American models, using current year sales as weights.         These
                                        — 17 —



figures     could be multiplied by the quantities in Table 1 to obtain the total

consumer gain (9).        We also report the range of welfare gains obtained over

individual Japanese and American models.

         Considering first the Japanese models, recall that these had a value of

     in the hedonic regression which exceeded American standard trucks for 1981

and 1982.         That is, due to the tariff the import prices exceeded those of

domestic standard trucks after correcting for quality differences. From our

discussion in section 2C, it is then possible that the welfare gains due to a

Japanese model may be negative for some values of A.         This means that the

consumer benefits due to having a truck with smaller characteristics available

are less than the tariff. Under these circumstances, we argued that A should

be reduced to allow for greater concavity of the utility function.

         With A     0 we found that all nine Japanese models had negative gain in

1981. This result continues for some negative values of A: for example, at A
=   —5   six Japanese models have negative gain in 1981. The first value at which

most Japanese models have positive welfare gain is A = —8, and these results

are shown in the first rows of Table 4•12 We regard these as minimum esti-

mates of the consumer gains (or actually underestimates, as argued in section

2B).      In 1979 and 1980 the average gains are $530 and $486 per truck, respec-

tively, which are 10% or more of the average retail price.          In 1981 the

consumer gain drops to $87 due to the tariff on Japanese compacts. After 1981

there are two opposing effects on the measure of gain: the price differential

between Japanese trucks and American standard models is reduced (and reversed

by 1984), while at the same time American compact trucks become available.

The first effect raises the welfare gain due to Japanese pickups while the

second effect lowers it.       For 1982—84 we see that the consumer gain remains

substantially less than its value before 1981, varying around $100 per truck.
                                    — 18 —



     In   the next rows of Table 4 the results for A = —10 and —15 are shown.

Considering A = —15, the average consumer gains for Japanese trucks in 1979

and 1980 are $628 and $582, respectively. These figures substantially exceed

10% of the retail price (unit—value) in Table 1. Moreover, the consumer who

would optimally choose each Japanese model under continuous choice receives a

gain which is twice as high (compare (8) and (9)), or over 20% of the retail

price. In later years the consumer gains fall due to the tariff on Japanese

trucks and the introduction of American compact models, varying around $200
                                     -
per truck over 1981=84.

     Turning to American compact models, we obtain estimates of consumer gains
due to these models which are surprisingly low. For example, with A = —15 the

gain is $23—32 per truck over 1982—84. The reason is that for each American

compact in our sample there is a Japanese truck with very similiar character-

istics. As a result, the gains to consumers from having either the American

or corresponding Japanese truck available, given that the other model already

exists, are small. From the ranges reported in Table 4 is is seen that the

low gains on American trucks also occur for some Japanese models. However, in

each year there are other Japanese models which are not that similar to an

American model.   As a result, the average consumer gains for Japanese trucks

over 1982—84 are much greater than for American compacts.



5. Conclusions

     In this paper we have presented a methodology for estimating the welfare

gains from a product with new characteristics, and applied it to Japanese and

American compact trucks. Our approach can be used on any products for which a

hedonic regression can be estimated.     The coefficients of this regression,

together with the parameter A indicating concavity of the utility function,
                                     — 19   —




are enough information to perform the welfare calculation. The application to

Japanese compact trucks is of particular interst since prior to 1982 similar

American models did not exist.

     For 1979—80 we found average welfare gains of $500—600 per Japanese
truck.      Multiplying these figures by the quantity of trucks purchased each

year gives the total consumer gains.    In later years the benefit to consumers

is reduced by the tariff on imports and the introduction of American compact

models.      For 1982—84 we found welfare gains of about $100—200 per Japanese

truck, though the range was considerably wider for individual models.         In

evaluating consumer benefits we have not included tariff revenue on Japanese

imports, as would be necessary in a social calculation.

     American compacts had consumer gains which were much less than the

average for Japanese models, since for each American compact there was an

import with very similar characteristics.       For American trucks the consumer

gains would need to be compared to research and development costs of compact

mopdels to determine the net social gain or loss.       If the average gains of

$15—30 we found per American compact are less the R&D costs, then the

additional diversity introduced by American models is not socially desirable.

However, we should note that the present study has not included vans and

utility vehicles.       There are many more compact vehicles of this type

introduced by American than by Japanese producers. Accordingly, some American

compact vans or utility vehicles would not have similar imported versions, and

we would expect larger consumer gains due to the availability of these

products.
