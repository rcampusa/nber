When faced with a run on a “systemically important” but insolvent bank in 1889, the Banque de France
pre-emptively organized a lifeboat to ensure that depositors were protected and an orderly liquidation
could proceed. To protect the Banque from losses on its lifeboat loan, a guarantee syndicate was formed,
penalizing those who had participated in the copper speculation that had caused the crisis bringing
the bank down. Creation of the syndicate and other actions were consistent with mitigating the moral
hazard from such an intervention. This episode contrasts the advice given by Bagehot to the Bank
of England to counter a panic by lending freely at a high rate on good collateral, allowing insolvent
institutions to fail.

   1. Introduction


       In this paper, we recover the history of the Crisis of 1889, when the Banque de France

(BdF) quickly intervened, ensuring that a run on the Comptoir d’Escompte (CdE), one of the

largest banks in France, did not turn into a general panic. The remedy for this banking crisis, the

most severe in late nineteenth century France, was not a pure British Bagehot-style lender of last

resort operation (LOLR) but a divisive and contested intervention, resembling more a modern

“lifeboat” or “bailout” operation, supplemented by additional liquidity for the market.         By

providing loans to the insolvent CdE, the BdF guaranteed that depositors would have continued

access to their accounts while the bank was liquidated in an orderly fashion and a new bank was

formed and capitalized. Similar modern interventions, such as the rescues of Long Term Capital

Management in 1998 or Bear Stearns in 2008, have led critics to complain that central banks that

deviate from Bagehot’s rule create moral hazard, inducing greater losses in subsequent crises.

Yet, in contrast to the modern experience with lifeboats the BdF and the Ministry of Finance,

backed by the contemporary French legal system, took prompt actions in 1889 that had the

potential to mitigate this problem. Banks, including their management and directors, that had

contributed to the debacle were quickly compelled to absorb losses arising from the collapse of

the CdE; many officials were purged; and other penalties imposed. This strong response may

have contributed to the absence of major crisis in France for the next quarter century.

       This type of central bank intervention would appear to be ruled out in the U.S. today. In

reaction to the Federal Reserve’s lending programs during the financial crisis of 2008, the Dodd-

Frank Act of 2010 altered Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act that had, since 1932, given

the Fed discretionary authority to lend to “any individual partnership, or corporation” in “unusual

and exigent circumstances.” The Fed used this authority beginning with the Great Depression

                                                 2
through the Crisis of 2008 (Fettig, 2008), though there were long-standing complaints that it had

been misused (Schwartz, 1992; Goodfriend, 2012). Emergency assistance in Section 13(3) now

requires that the Board of Governors consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, before

implementing a new lending program, which should provide liquidity to the financial system, not

aid an insolvent or failing firm and be collateralized sufficiently to protect taxpayers (U.S.

Senate, 2010; Office of Inspector General, 2010). While this policy shift implies that there is no

case to be made for pre-emptive intervention with insolvent firms, the French experience in 1889

may suggest otherwise.

       After reviewing the extant literature, we describe the origins of the crisis, arising from an

effort to control the world copper market and measure the damage inflicted on the CdE. In the

third section, we examine whether the run on the bank had begun to spread before the authorities

intervened and detail the debate at the BdF and Ministry of Finance over the plan to rescue the

CdE. Next, we show that the BdF’s intervention was primarily a lifeboat operation with modest

extra liquidity supplied to other banks and the markets. Fifthly, we analyze the determinants of

membership in and contributions to the guarantee syndicate, intended to absorb losses from the

lifeboat operation, finding that, in addition to capacity to pay, responsibility for the debacle was

an important factor. In the final section, we discuss the penalties imposed in the aftermath of the

crisis that may have minimized the moral hazard arising from the BdF’s actions.


   2. A Lost Episode


       Our article seeks fill an important gap in the literature of the evolution of the lender of

last resort (LOLR) function of central banks, drawing on archival materials at the BdF and other

primary sources. Often influential in contemporary policy debates, historical evidence on how a

central bank should operate as a LOLR is primarily informed by the classical view of the Bank

                                                 3
of England (BoE), first put forward by Henry Thornton (1802) and reaffirmed by Walter

Bagehot (1873). They ordained that a central bank should respond to a financial crisis by

lending freely at a high rate of interest on all good collateral, preventing illiquid but not insolvent

banks from failing. Summarizing this view, Humphrey (1975) and Bordo (1990) point out that it

was not the duty of the LOLR to prevent financial shocks but neutralize them once they had

occurred by preventing the spread of a panic from failing insolvent institutions to sound ones.

To be successful, a central bank must clearly state its policy in advance and follow through

consistently. .

       Recent research on the BoE has identified when and how it became a LOLR. Before the

Overend-Gurney Crisis of 1866, the Bank rationed credit, exacerbating panics. Afterwards, it set

the bank rate above the market rate, providing loans to all that had good collateral, as determined

by the Bank’s meticulous bookkeeping (Bignon, Flandreau, and Ugolini, 2012; Flandreau and

Ugolini, 2013). With more limited data, Bignon, Flandreau, and Ugolini (2013) also find that

after the 1850s, the BdF’s discount policy followed a similar evolution. But, central banks did

not simply follow Bagehot’s advice in the late nineteenth century. Unfortunately, the secondary

literature on the BoE has paid little attention to the lifeboat operation during the 1890 Barings

crisis. Clapham’s (1945) classic history provides the most detailed but still very limited account.

Calomiris (2011) correctly recognized its importance in a brief passage, with Giannini (2011)

suggesting that support for the CdE in 1889 was a model for the BoE’s action the following year.

In France, the first major lifeboat was launched to rescue the Paris Bourse in 1882 (White, 2007).




                                                  4
Contemporaries were aware of the dangers of such actions, and the 1889 lifeboat provoked an

intense debate by policy makers on the proper role for a LOLR.1

        Researchers curious about the BdF as a LOLR might reasonably turn to the studies of the

U.S. National Monetary Commission (1909-1912), prepared as the U.S. Congress considered the

establishment of the Fed. Two volumes treat the BdF; yet, the first (Liesse,1909) gives only a

cursory description of the 1889 rescue and the second (Patron, 1910) omits it entirely, which

may have led modern authorities on central banking (Goodhart, 1988; Grossman, 2010) to offer

only brief comments on the 1889 episode. Direct evidence on the BdF as a LOLR is found in the

Commission’s interview with the Governor of the BdF, Georges Pallain, conducted by Benjamin

Strong---later President of the New York Fed. Pallain was asked: “Does the amount and the

character of credit granted to other banks depend on the amount and the character of their

accounts at the Bank of France?” He answered, sounding very much like Bagehot:

        There is no fixed rule, and although the balance of the account is not a matter of
        indifference, it is more especially the quality of the paper presented which fixes
        the extent of the credit. In periods of crisis in 1830, 1848, in 1870 in 1889, the
        general council of the Bank did not hesitate to come to the assistance of
        establishments which were in difficulties, but which held assets of unquestioned
        character and value, by extending to them the largest possible credits (Aldrich,
        1910, p. 207).

The Governor may have been citing the BdF’s statutes, but they were not the rules the BdF

played by during the Crisis of 1889, as the CdE was deeply insolvent.

        The French literature is not much more illuminating. Published in an obscure mining

journal, the best study of the events leading to the collapse of the CdE is by Bertrand Gille

(1968). Yves Mollier (1991) provides further details, mixing facts and allegations; but neither he

nor Gille treat broader questions of monetary policy. The volumes published on the bicentenary

of the BdF (Feiertag and Margairaz, 2003) make only passing references to this crisis. The most

recent BdF history by Yves Leclercq (2010) devotes a scant nine pages to the management of

crises, and his coverage of the CdE skirts the LOLR issue.2

        The BdF’s very success at preventing the run on the CdE, which today would be termed a

“systemically important financial institution”—a “SIFI”—from creating a panic may be

responsible for its low historical profile.          We reconstruct this history from contemporary

records, most notably from the archives of the BdF and the other leading banks, and new data

from a variety of long-overlooked sources.


    3. A Scheme to Corner the Copper Market, Its Failure, and the Crisis


        In the 1880s, the French banking industry was split into two basic groups: (1) the large

limited liability banks that raised substantial funds from deposits and engaged in a wide range of

commercial and investment banking activities - Crédit Lyonnais, Société Générale, the CdE, and

the Banque de Paris et de Pays-Bas (BPPB), dominated this group; and (2) the private banks that

focused on merchant and investment banking, financed mostly by capital- the biggest private

banks were known as the haute banque, led by the Paris House of Rothschild. In this period,

there was no deposit insurance or implicit guarantees of banks, and rumors of a bank’s troubles

could cause a run. As the economy had been in the doldrums since the stock market crash of

1882 (Bouvier, 1960; White, 2007) with real GDP failing to reach its previous peak until 1888

(Lévy-Leboyer and Bourguignon, 1990), banks saw their profits squeezed and shareholders their

dividends shrink. The weakness of the economy was mirrored in the unsettled politics of the

with prompting the Banque de France to “avert a complete collapse.”

                                                      6
French Third Republic. The government hoped that the Universal Exposition of 1889, marking

the centennial of the French Revolution and scheduled to open on May 6, would showcase its

economic potential and political accomplishment.

       The Crisis of 1889 had its origins in the efforts of Pierre-Eugène Secrétan to forge a

worldwide monopoly of copper. Secrétan, an innovative engineer, was co-founder and CEO of

the Société Industrielle et Commerciale des Métaux (SdM), a leading industrial concern. His

acquisitions of existing copper stocks and purchases of contracts for future delivery from mines

were widely known and discussed in the press, even though the details of his machinations

remained obscure and the subject of rumors. In essence, the SdM became a highly leveraged

commodities company that used off-balance sheet derivatives to speculate in copper.

       Industrial and agricultural demand for copper had expanded rapidly during the 1880s.

New uses were found for copper, from cables for transmission of electricity to copper sulfate to

battle the scourge of phylloxera in the vineyards. World production increased from

approximately 20,000 tons per year in the middle of the century to 250,000 tons by 1888.

Although Chile and Australia had traditionally been the dominant suppliers, an increasing share

of production came from the U.S., where new mines were opened in the 1880s. In spite of an

increasing demand, these new supplies drove prices down from over £70 a ton in the early 1870s

to £40 a ton in 1886.

       In September 1887, Secrétan organized a syndicate composed primarily of members of

the haute banque to provide credit to purchase existing stocks of copper. Purchases drove up

prices from £40 per ton to over £80 by December 1887. As seen in Figure 1, British and French

copper stocks began to rise. If support for Secrétan’s scheme had remained within a circle of

metals companies, wealthy investors and private investment banks, there would have been large



                                               7
losses if the price crashed, but it is unlikely there would have been a banking crisis. However,

Secrétan began to draw upon the support of the commercial banks. Their aid was essential, as

the modest capital of the SdM did not provide a credible guarantee to buy the copper when the

futures contracts fell due; hence, guarantees from the banks were necessary.

        Normally, commercial banks would not have funded commodities speculation on a grand

scale, as their obligation to depositors mandated a lower tolerance for risk than the haute banque

had; but the overlapping management relationships between the SdM, private banks, commercial

banks, and the BdF created conflicts of interest. The opportunity to profit from the copper

                                                       8
scheme induced some of the conflicted parties to take advantage of the information asymmetries

vis-à-vis their boards, shareholders and the public and bring the resources of their institutions to

Secrétan’s assistance. Most notably, the CdE provided substantial on-balance sheet credits for

warehoused copper and vast off-balance sheet guarantees for the SdM’s forward contracts. The

bank was compromised because its president, Eugène Denfert-Rochereau, was seduced by

Secrétan with the connivance of the chairman of the board, Edouard Hentsch, of the haute

banque firm of Hentsch frères et Cie and other board-members involved in the copper scheme.

All stood to gain considerably as individuals, while the CdE pleased its shareholders by

maintaining its dividends even as other banks cut back. The next most seriously compromised

bank was the BPPB, where Edouard Joubert, member of the syndicate in his own account, was

vice-president.

         Although there were knowledgeable copper scheme insiders at the BdF, they failed to

inform all the members of the Council of Regents. The connections between the officials of the

banks and the regents of the BdF did not necessarily raise alarms because they could also be

viewed as beneficial, providing the central bank with important intelligence about the condition

of the banks. However, the temptation to profit hugely from the rise in copper prices seems to

have led some compromised regents and auditors to remain silent, buying shares in mining

companies and the SdM when it doubled its capital in 1888.

         BdF’s insiders could have revealed the increasingly dangerous condition of the CdE and

the SdM when they participated in the BdF’s quarterly examination of its major borrowers.3 In

the first report of the year, on February 23, 1888, the condition of the SdM was examined by

Alphonse de Rothschild who remarked that it was “a serious business conducted with

3
 Borrowers included banks and businesses. The results of this survey were inscribed as the minutes of the Conseil
Général. This report or vérification recorded the credits outstanding to each borrower, basic capital, a simple rating
and some comments. The Regents rotated surveillance, perhaps to improve monitoring.

                                                          9
intelligence.”4 In the next report on March 24, Rothschild commented favorably on the CdE. Left

uninformed by these examinations, the “outside” regents slowly gained a window on the copper

scheme through the BdF’s exposure to copper warrants---loans to the SdM collateralized by

warehoused copper that were guaranteed by the signature of a bank. These warrants were part of

the BdF’s regular lending; but it granted an exceptionally large request on May 18, 1888 after an

appeal by Georges Girod, a director of both the SdM and the CdE (Banque de France, Conseil

Générale, 18 mai 1888). Girod was no stranger to the Régents, as he was a partner of the regent

Alfred André in André, Girod et Cie. The SdM was offered a line of credit of 52 million francs

for 40,000 tons of copper, valued at 1300 francs per ton (65% of the market price) with the BdF

noting the unusual nature of the loan.

        In spite of Secrétan problems in obtaining additional finance to sustain the price of

copper, the market did not register any apprehension throughout the summer and fall of 1888.

As evident in Figure 2, the public did not perceive that there was any danger to the banks. All

bank stocks, even those of the CdE and the BPPB, remained essentially flat for the rest of the

year. The SdM reached a peak of 975 francs in September 1888 and drifted down towards 900 at

years end, reflecting the rising stocks of warehoused copper in Figure 1 that the market observed.

        Nevertheless, falling prices for the SdM’s stock made the BdF apprehensive, given its

large advances to the SdM, collateralized by copper warrants. As these fell due in late 1888,

some banks refused to renew their guarantee and the CdE stepped in to provide a signature. The

regents took note of the CdE’s growing disproportionate share of guarantees. Further alarms

were sounded when copper began to dip in February 1889 and Sécretan, desperate for more

                      On February 27, 1889 several regents asked the Governor, Pierre Magnin to interview

Joubert and Girod about the warrants. The following day, the Governor reported that quality of

these credits were declining; and Rothschild proposed to send telegrams to the American mines

to request a renegotiation of the forward contracts, announcing that he had lent the CdE 6 million


                                                          11
francs to meet rising withdrawals. Magnin promised to interview Denfert-Rochereau and obtain

answers to a detailed written questionnaire. On March 2, 1889, the Governor presented the

results of his meeting with Denfert-Rochereau, showing that the CdE had sustained huge losses.

It was a rude shock. The BdF was owed 78.8 million francs by the CdE. Then, on March 5,

1889, Denfert-Rochereau committed suicide; and a full-scale run hit his bank

       Table 1 presents estimates of the losses sustained by the CdE, using three sources. In

addition to Denfert-Rochereau’s March 1, 1889 declaration to the Governor of the BdF, two

other documents provide measures of the CdE’s problems: the April 13, 1889 balance sheet of

the SdM given to the Judicial Tribunal on March 21, 1889 by Secrétan for the bankruptcy

procedure and the April 29, 1889 estimate of the CdE’s liquidators, Moreau and Montchicour.

       Panel A of Table 1 gives an estimate based on the March 1 information.              Line 1

represents the credits of the CdE, largely discounts on copper warrants to the SdM. In addition,

the CdE was liable for the SdM’s copper warrants that were discounted at the BdF because it had

given a guaranteeing signature. This obligation is shown on line 2; so that the total obligation of

the SdM to the CdE was 96.2 million francs (the sum of lines 1 and 2). Line 3 shows the total

liabilities and capital of the SdM, 276.3 million. From this sum, the credits from the Compagnie

Auxiliare de Métaux in line 5 and the SdM’s equity capital in line 4 need to be subtracted. The

debt of the SdM to outside creditors was thus 224.6 million francs, as seen on line 6. The 96.2

million francs due to the CdE represented 43% of this total, shown on line 7. Against these

liabilities, the SdM had 154,900 tons of copper (line 8), which if valued at the March 1st price of

£40 per ton, represented assets of 156.1 million francs listed on line 9. If we suppose that the

CdE’s share of this collateral is the same as its share in SdM’s debts (an optimistic hypothesis),

the CdE’s share of these assets would be 66.9 million francs on line 10. Then the loss to the CdE

was 29.3 million francs. In addition to these direct losses, the CdE had also guaranteed payment

at approximately £70 per ton for the SdM of the delivery of large quantities of copper in 1889

and 1890 (lines 13 and 14), which if the copper were only worth £40 per ton when delivered

would cause a loss shown on line 15 of 115.9 million francs. The total potential loss for the CdE

was thus 145.2 million francs on line 16.

       Panel B estimates the losses of the CdE, based on the April 13 balance sheet provided by

Secrétan to the Judicial Tribunal. Total credits of the CdE to the SdM in lines 1 and 2 were

estimated to be higher, 116 million francs. Total liabilities of the SdM were now set at 300.4

million (line 6), which when the unsecured junior debt (line 4a) is subtracted, leaves the secured

debt of the SdM to outside creditors (line 6a) at 256.7 million francs. Line 7 reports the CdE’s

share, 45%. The copper holdings of the SdM in line 8, if valued at £43 ,the price on April 13th,

would give it assets of 136 million francs, shown on line 9. The CdE’s share of these assets

would be 61.5 million francs on line 10 (again assuming its credits are as well secured as the

average secured creditors), leaving a direct loss to the CdE of 54.5 million shown on line 11 of

Panel B, nearly double the direct loss in Panel A. If added to the indirect loss of 115.9 million

from line 15, the total loss would be 170.4 million francs on line 16 for Panel B.

       Both of these estimates of losses---145.2 million and 170.4 million francs---would have

easily wiped out the CdE’s 80 million francs of capital, but only if the mines’ contracts were not

restructured, something the French participants had been seeking unsuccessfully in the last

month before the collapse. On the other hand, both rely on data provided by interested parties—

Secrétan and Denfert-Rochereau—whose incentive was to minimize their losses. The picture

from the liquidateurs was much worse, as seen in Panel C. Credits of the CdE to the SdM were

higher on lines 1 and 2, 146.5 million francs. The collateral of the CdE credits, on line 9a,



                                                14
valued at £40 in line 9, implied a direct loss on line 11 of 78.7 million, to which another 2.9

million losses should be added (line 11a) for a total direct loss of 81.6 million (line 11b)---which

alone would wipe out the CdE’s 80 million francs of capital. If the guarantees from line 15 are

added, the total direct and indirect losses would reach 197.5 million francs on line 16 for Panel

C. The CdE’s credits to the SdM of this last panel seem to be in line with the estimates of the

auditor appointed by the court hearing lawsuits following the crisis. According to these

estimates, the CdE’s credits to the SdM on December 31, 1888 were 172.2 million francs.

Noting that the SdM’s position vis-à-vis the CdE did not change significantly in the first three

months of 1889, the auditor relied on the liquidators’ estimates5.

        Consequently, in most optimistic case, the CdE needed the guarantees to be abandoned in

order to survive; in the second one it had to be liquidated even if the guarantees were to be

abandoned; in the third and more likely case, it was deeply insolvent. Depositors rightly fled,

when knowledge of this situation become public. .


    4. The Creation of a Lifeboat


        On the evening of March 7, 1889 following two days of steady withdrawals of deposits

and a failed private attempt to raise support for the CdE, the Minister of Finance, Maurice

Rouvier, summoned the Governor and leading bankers to his office.6 Although there are no

records of this late night meeting, it was certainly tense, lasting from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. The

Minister was blunt: if the CdE did not receive 100 million francs before opening, the rising

number of withdrawals would force it to stop payments. The Minister expected the BdF to lend

100 million francs, with the CdE’s entire assets serving as a guarantee. This request was in

violation of the statutes of the BdF, which required that discounts only be provided for three

name paper or two name paper collateralized by the highest quality securities. To protect the

BdF against potential losses, the Minister required the formation of a syndicate of banks to

absorb any losses up to 20 million francs.

        At 9 a.m. the following morning, Friday, March 8, 1889, an hour before banks opened for

business, the Governor convened an extraordinary meeting of the regents7 He read a letter from

the Minister who insisted they act. An influential regent, Frédéric de Pillet-Will interrupted to

ask what collateral would be provided. The Governor responded that it would be notes issued by

Secrétan on the SdM and endorsed by the CdE, revealing it was dubious collateral not permitted

by the BdF’s statutes. To justify this extraordinary exception, Magnin argued that the bank’s

failure would be a terrible blow to the French economy. The minutes summarized his argument:

        There is no doubt that this imposes a heavy obligation on the Banque, but M. le
        Gouverneur hopes that the good faith shown to the Comptoir would ease that
        responsibility and that the Banque would be rewarded for its self-sacrifice and
        confidence. He chose the word good faith because a moral guarantee [underlined
        in the minutes] is, perhaps, what is required. A standard approach is not
        sufficient. If the Banque agrees to come to the aid of the Comptoir under these
        conditions, it will have rendered a great new service to the Parisian financial
        market, business in general, and the nation.8

Following this declaration to aid an insolvent institution, the Governor faced hostile questioning

rarely seen in the minutes of the Council.

        The industrialist Fernand Raoul-Duval observed that some of the guarantors for the BdF

loan were “notoriously involved in the copper syndicate” and asked whether there was reason to

fear that the collateral was inadequate. This question was inflammatory, given that some of the

signatories were regents’ banks. One target, André, responded simply that the guarantees were

                                                       16
sufficient. Next, Pillet-Will spoke of the great risk to which the BdF would be exposed by this

credit and pointed out that even if the CE’s assets were acceptable as collateral, their transfer to

the BdF might be contested by other creditors.               He estimated that a guarantee of 75 not 20

million francs was necessary. André countered that it was impossible to follow the rules; the key

was to stop the panic. Opponents of the Minister’s proposal demanded further assurances for the

BdF, but supporters argued that there was no time left. When the proposal was put to a vote,

eleven regents voted for and four against, barely reaching the required super majority for the

motion to pass. The defeated regents were enraged.                 Pillet-Will felt that he and the BdF had

been betrayed by the insiders---including Rothschild. In an act without precedence since the

founding the Banque, Pillet-Will resigned in protest: after three generations, his family;s bank

now no longer had a representative on the Council of Regents..

           The CdE quickly drew on its loan to meet the demands of depositors, taking 94 of the 100

million francs by March 15. 1889.9 Even though it was initially believed that the CdE had

sufficient good assets to cover any liabilities beyond the 100 million franc loan, it became

obvious there was a gaping hole in its balance sheet. On Saturday, March 16, 1888, the

Governor and representatives of the leading banks were again summoned to a meeting at the

Ministry of Finance. The bankers were informed that the Minister wanted the creation of a new

institution to replace the CdE and that a new 40 million francs loan from the BdF was required to

prevent the CdE bank from collapsing. For this credit, there would be a new guarantee syndicate

of banks to cover the first 20 million francs of losses.10 Another extraordinary meeting of the

regents was called the next day, Sunday, March 17, 1889. Bowing to the Minister, the Council

of Regents voted 13 to 2 to give an additional loan of 40 million francs.11 These funds were

immediately drawn upon by the CdE and the run abated, as the Ministry and the BdF signaled

their commitment to depositors. With threat of a panic having receded, an orderly liquidation of

the CdE could proceed without a fire sale of assets.

        The question whether the BdF’s quick intervention prevented a panic presents a difficult

counterfactual that runs would have been limited to the CdE because the public could determine

whether other banks were solvent.                But, to use an anachronistic term, the CdE was a

“systemically important financial institution” and neither the Minister of Finance nor most of the

Council wanted to chance a panic. Regents on opposite sides of the debate agreed that a panic

caused by the CdE would be severe. Rothschild wrote to his London cousin that such a crash

would “hit the commercial and financial center even harder than the collapse of Union

Générale;” while Pillet-Will told his fellow regents that “the fall of the Comptoir would be an

immense disaster, everyone agrees on that.”12 This concern reflected the fact that the CdE was

the second oldest chartered bank (after the BdF), the second largest bank of deposit in Paris, the

leading source of funding for French foreign trade, a supplier of credit to small and medium

Paris businesses, a major investment bank, providing credit to the stock market with substantial

off-balance sheet activities, and a manager of important financial operations for the French

government.13

        The potential threat to the financial system cannot be read in the behavior of interest

rates, as these typically do not jump until the panic begins. Responding to cuts in the discount

   It should be noted that there is no robust definition of a SIFI. Most definitions currently adopted simply measure
size though they wish to identify the institutions that are so highly interconnected that a failure could trigger a
financial collapse.

rates of the BdF and the BoE, French market rates were falling in the months immediately

preceding the crisis (See Figure 3). Similarly, when Baer Stearns was rescued from collapse in

March 2008, while its stock prices were tumbling from October 2007, interest rates did not

budge, as was the case for the CdE’s rescue; and they only rose with the announcement of

Lehman’s bankruptcy with the Fed’s abstention from action after six months of sharp decline in

the price of the bank’s stock.14

       Empirically it is difficult to measure even an incipient panic because daily deposit data

for this period are rare. However, following contemporary studies, bank stock prices can be used

to follow the bank run (Wall and Peterson, 1990; Goldsmith-Pinkham and Yorulmazer, 2010).

Stock prices in Figure 2 reveal how, in early March, the stock of the CdE and to a lesser degree

the BPPB were dumped and prices tumbled. Table 2 reports the daily returns for leading

Parisian banks during the crisis month of March. The returns are calculated using the first price

of the day so that the return for March 8 reflects all the news that the market received between

the opening of the market on March 7 and the opening on March 8. While the rest of the market

was relatively quiet, news of Denfert-Rochereau’s visit to the Governor on March 1 may have

leaked out and the CdE shares’ prices begin to tumble, with an 11.3% drop. His suicide on

March 5 brought a further decline. Extraordinary meetings at the Ministry on the night of March

7 and before the banks opened on March 8 saw drops of 29.1% for the CdE and 8.6% for the

PBBP. The 100 million francs lifeboat calmed the markets. The insufficiency of this credit then

led to drops for the CdE and smaller declines for the BPPB. The March 18th 40 million francs

loan seems to have steadied the market for bank stocks with the exception of the CdE, which

continued to fluctuate with news of its liabilities and plans to recapitalize the bank. While

certainly not conclusive evidence of a potential panic, these returns reveal why French officials

would have considered one imminent if drastic actions were not taken.


   5. The Lifeboat and the Provision of Additional Liquidity


       Although the BdF created a lifeboat to preserve the CdE, there may also have been a need

to make liquidity generally available to the market. However, it appears to have played a

supporting rather than a dominant role in halting a panic. Bignon, Flandreau and Ugolini (2012)

show that the hallmark of the BoE’s LOLR actions à la Bagehot were to keep the discount rate

                                               21
above the market rate, lending freely to all who had acceptable collateral.                  White (2007) also

provides graphical evidence that the BdF followed a similar discount policy.15 To measure the

1889 policy mix of lifeboat and additional liquidity requires a determination of the discounts that

exceeded any increase driven by interest rates, clearing and settlement on the Bourse, or other

factors.16

        The BdF’s and BoE’s discount rates and the Paris open market rates17 for 1887-1889 are

shown in Figure 3. The open market rate is believed to represent the rate for the best paper

bought by the big banks.18 Operating in the world’s dominant money and capital market, the

BoE’s discount rate was closely followed by BdF and other central banks; but the BdF with its

huge gold reserves did not feel it necessary to respond to every BoE discount rate change. When

the BoE raised its rate from 2.5 to 3% in July 1888 and then 4% in August, the BdF responded

with a lag, increasing its discount rate from 2.5 to 3.5% on September 13. Falling gold reserves

prompted the regents increase their rate to 4.5% on October 4 after the next BoE

announcement.19 These rates remained in force for the next three months. Rates began to drop

in early 1889. On January 10, 1889, the regents cut the discount rate to 4%, following the BoE’s

drop to 4%.20 Then in quick order, shadowing the London rate, the BdF lowered its rate to 3.5%



15
   The BdF conducted monetary policy by providing discounts and advances. During the years 1888 and 1889,
advances were almost steady at 130 million francs with a standard deviation of 4.5 million, whereas the mean and
standard deviation for discounts were 313 million and 89.5 million francs. .
16
   Data on the BdF’s balance sheets come from Babeau (n.d.).
17
   The Economist’s reported rates are for the end of each week (the magazine’s source is believed to have been
Crédit Lyonnais), whereas the Banque’s balance sheet data is mid-week. For example, the Banque’s balance sheet
is reported for January 24, 1889 while the date of the Economist’s rate is January 26, 1889. The rates for discounts
and advances are those prevailing that week or the new rate if there was a change. The rates are similar to monthly
rates reported in the National Bureau of Economic Research’s                            Macro History database,
http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/rectdata/13/m13017.dat. Crédit Lyonnais is quoted as source of the
U.S. National Monetary Commission’s rates.

on January 24 and 3% on February 7, 1889.21 This rate remained unchanged through the crisis

through to March 1890, and did not respond to the BoE’s discount rate cut during the first week

of April 1889 to 2.5%,22 keeping it above market rates and suggesting a Bagehot-style crisis rule.

           In addition to the cost of funds, the demand for discounts depended on the Paris Bourse.

Clearing and settlement of trades for the second largest securities market in Europe required

substantial funding. While most funding could be obtained from other intermediaries, the BdF

lent directly to market operators who had accounts at the bank. The largest segment of the

market was not spot trades but trading in forward contracts, often on borrowed funds (reports)

and entailing counterparty risk. A quick drop in securities prices could lead to a scramble for

liquidity, as happened spectacularly in 1882.23 There were two settlement periods (liquidations),

one mid-month and the second end-of-month. Spikes in the volume of discounts in Figures 4 are

often the first end-of-month settlement day. The biggest surge in discounts is, of course, the

discounts offered to the CdE, which reached a level of 133.2 million francs on March 20, 1889

and then began to decline in May when the liquidators began to sell off the CdE’s assets paying

off its creditors, including the BdF.

        To determine how much additional liquidity was provided to the Paris market over and

above the loans to the CE, the value of private (non-government) discounts outstanding will be

modeled as an AR(1) process with the change in log of the private discounts (ΔlnPD) depending

on the change in the interest rate differential between the BdF’s discount rate and the Paris

market rate (ΔIntDiff). To capture, the demand emanating from the Bourse, we have created a

matrix of dummy variables, one for each day of each settlement period, with the mid-month

settlement having five days and the end-of-month settlement having six days. The end-of-month

settlement was bigger as it handled all government bonds, the bonds of the City of Paris, and

shares of the BdF, Crédit Foncier, and all listed railways. It was believed that the biggest

demand for liquidity was on the first day when borrowing contracts (reports) were due. The

dummies for the five middle-of-the-month settlement days are M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 and the

six end-of month settlement days are E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6. Using the Bayesian Information



23
  The collapse of the Paris market after the failure of the Lyon bank Union Générale brought about the bankruptcy
of the Lyon Bourse and nearly caused the demise of the Paris Bourse, which was avoided by a lifeboat operation by
the BdF. See White (2007).

        Equation 1 is estimated using weekly data for two separate periods: (1) August 26, 1871

to December 27, 1888 and (2) June 1, 1882 until December 27, 1888. The shorter second period

was included to ensure that the disruptions caused by the post-Franco-Prussian War of 1870-

1871 reparations and stock market crash of early 1882 did not affect the estimation.     The last

observation, December 27, was selected to permit observation of any pre-emptive increases in

liquidity provided prior to the run on the CdE. The results are shown in Table 3.

        For both samples, the lagged dependent variable and the interest rates variables and

lagged values all have the expected signs. It is interesting to note that for the dummy variables

that are intended to capture the demand from the Bourse, the strongest effect is the first day of

the end-of-month settlement---the spikes seen in Figure 4. The estimates for the longer period

are used to predict the discounts given from January through May 1889. The predicted discounts

at week t are equal to the actual lagged discounts plus the predicted increase. The additional

“Bagehot” liquidity provided by the BdF is equal to the actual discounts less both the predicted

discounts and the credits to the CdE.

        During the months of January and February 1889, there was no anticipatory increase in

discounts, as the model over-predicts the volume of the discounts. Nevertheless, the model

under-predicts the increases in discounts for the crisis month of March 1889. There are four

weeks---March 14, 21, and 28 and April 4---when there might be considered additional

“Bagehot” liquidity being indicated by the model, raising the level of discounts by 49, 79, 44,

and 23 million francs. Given the models standard error of 31 million francs for a mean value of

330 million francs of discounts, these are not extraordinarily high values. However, it is notable

that the additional 79 million francs of discounts occurred in the same time frame as the second

40 million francs credit to the CdE. Additional liquidity given to the market would be consistent

with markets remaining jittery with some bank stock prices taking new hits, as seen in Table 2.

           This LOLR activity à la Bagehot appears to be an important complement to the lifeboat

operation but not the primary focus of policy. Its magnitude is best seen relative to Paris Bourse

demand on the most important settlement day. The average spike in discounts for this day is

calculated using this day’s regression coefficient, E1. For the full sample, the average E1 day

added discounts of 88 million francs, with a range of 74 to 103 million francs, using the 95

percent confidence interval.24 Viewed from this perspective, additional discounts were within

the normal augmented demand on the peak settlement day. Thus, it is not surprising that there

was no discussion of these discounts in the minutes of either the Council of Regents or other

committees. Their attention was riveted on halting the run on the CdE and organizing its

recapitalization as the Comptoir National d’Escompte (CNEP).


       6. The Design of the Guarantee Syndicate

           The significance of a key feature of the CdE’s lifeboat---the two 20 million francs

guarantee syndicates pushed by the angry Minister of Finance---has been wholly over looked in

previous literature. Their design strongly suggests that the intention was for those behind the

copper scheme to bear much of the cost CdE’s collapse, which could potentially mitigate the

moral hazard arising from aiding the insolvent bank. This action was certainly spurred by the

fact that it was widely known that members of the financial community had exploited for

personal gain conflicts of interest arising from holding positions at multiple institutions.

           Information on 20 million francs guarantee syndicate for the 100 million francs loan is

shown in Table 4.25 The names of the contributing banks are in bold face: their share capital,

their rank by the size of their capital relative to all banks in Paris, and their contributions are

given in the first four columns; also included are the largest banks that were not part of the

board of directors. Visual inspection of Table 4 reveals that there was no simple link between

the size of a contribution and a bank’s capital. Instead, the banks involved in the copper scheme

seem to have been assessed large contributions. These included small banks, far down the list in


                                                     28
terms of their rank size. Two joint-stock banks at the scheme’s center—the CdE and PBBP--

were hit with relatively big assessments, for their size. The deeply involved private bankers---

Hentsch, André, Girod et Cie. and the Rothschild are on the list.

        One way to view the intentions of the Minister of Finance for the design of the guarantee

syndicate is to consider what it might have looked like if allocations had been made only

according to ability to pay, as measured by a bank’s capital. Column 5 in Table 4 examines this

hypothetical alternative by selecting the largest 19 banks and apportioning contributions

according to their individual share of their aggregate capital. Several large banks that were left

out would have been forced to join and a number of smaller banks would have been omitted. For

banks remaining in the syndicate, the share allocation would have been significantly different.

This comparison suggests that inclusion in the syndicate and the size of contributions were

influenced by a bank’s participation in the copper scheme. To identify the conflicted participants

in the copper scheme and provide a measure of their involvement, we employ two approaches.

First, we examine the overlapping directorships and management, using network analysis to

measure the degree to which institutions were connected and implicitly conflicted. Secondly, to

identify conflicted participants, we employ the 1888 subscription list to the SdM’s stock and

bond issue, which provided the firm with the means to further the copper scheme.                        The

subscriptions to the SdM’s stock and bond issue are shown in Table 5.

        For the first approach, we have collected information on all the Paris banks, including

limited liability banks, partnerships and proprietorships.26 For the limited liability banks we have

identified their CEOs and vice-CEOs (directeurs and sous-directeurs), members of the boards of

directors, and their internal auditors (censeurs). For private banks, we identify the lead partners

or owners. We have also included the senior management for the SdM. As might be imagined,

these measures of involvement in the copper scheme are far from perfect. For example, while

most private bankers protected their investments in banks and companies by sitting on the board

of directors, the Rothschild did not. Alphonse de Rothschild was only a regent of the BdF and a

member of the board of the government-sponsored Caisse d’Epargne et Prevoyance de Paris; but

the House of Rothschild had a long history of large investments in mining and had, bought up

copper stocks, gaining controlling interest in Rio Tinto, a giant copper company (Avery, 1974;

López-Morell, 2013). On the other hand, there are the puzzling cases of the Veuve Kinen et Cie

and Heine et Cie. who joined the syndicate but appear absent from the copper scheme.

        Figure 5
        Overlapping Directorships and Management, 1888.




Note: Each line connecting a bank or the Société des Métaux represents one or more individuals who held positions
as senior managers or members of the board of directors in both institutions, indicating an opportunity to exploit a
conflict of interest during the scheme to corner the copper market. The larger size of a circle indicates a larger
number of connected individuals.




                                                        31
           Figure 5 depicts all overlapping directorships and management for all Parisian banks that

had at least one connection to either the CdE or the SdM, with the size of bank’s circle reflecting

the number of its connections. As is readily seen, there was tight network among a core of

institutions. Two measures of centrality or connectedness used in network analysis are deployed

here to measure the conflicts of interest---degree centrality and eigenvector centrality (Borgatti,

2005). Degree centrality it is the sum of all the edges (an edge is a line representing individuals

who hold two positions) that connect a vertex (a bank) to other vertices (banks). The number of

lines or individuals connecting two institutions is taken as a measure of the strength of the

conflicted relationship between the two institutions. Degree centrality here is the number of

managers or directors that a bank has in common with the CdE or the SdM. Eigenvector

centrality emphasizes that not all connections are equal. The idea behind this measure is that

connections to a vertex that are themselves influential or well-connected should give that vertex

more influence. Values for eigenvector centrality are calculated from the eigenvalues of the

adjacency matrix which is an n by n symmetric matrix (n = number of banks) and the elements

are the number of connections between ith and jth banks. Degree and eigenvector centrality are

calculated for connections with the CdE (DegreeCE and EVCE) and the SdM (DegreeSM and

EVSM) and thus focus on whether a direct connection for a bank to either institution created an

exploitable conflict of interest that may have used in the formation of the guarantee syndicate.

           For the second approach, we measure conflicts of interest by using participation in SdM’s

issue of shares and bonds that doubled its capital in 1888, facilitating its effort to drive up copper

prices.27 The goal was to raise 20 million francs, most of which was taken up by bankers who

claimed 15,201,240 francs.             As seen in Table 5, the largest subscriber was Rothschild frères

requesting (2,515,000 francs of bonds and 2,500,000 francs of shares).                           The next largest

contributor was PBBP, requesting 3.4 million francs of shares and bonds. The CdE asked for 2.1

million francs of securities. Measuring involvement by this list is tricky because purchases of

these securities were made largely by individuals who had multiple affiliations and yet the

assessment of contributions to the guarantee syndicate was by institution. Consequently, we use

this list to construct three measures of conflicts of interest shown in the columns: (2) the

purchases by the managers and directors of a bank and the bank itself, though this leads to some

double counting---TC2xSMK, (3) the purchases by a bank or by its managers and directors who

had the bank as their primary affiliation (e.g. they were the CEO rather than a member of the

board)---PC2xSMK, and (4) the total number of individuals at a bank who made purchases---

NS2xSMK.28

        To determine if the Minister of Finance sought to use the guarantee syndicate to

discipline banks in addition to assessing contributions according to capacity to pay, one could

regress the contributions on our measures of conflicts of interest and bank capital.29 In this

formulation, equation 2 for the contribution that banks made to the guarantee syndicate in

millions of francs (Gi) would be a function of both the capacity to pay (BCi) and the conflict of

interest measures, CIi. Other factors may have played a role. The number of directors and

managers who were members of the Legion d’Honneur, LHi was included as an explanatory

variable.30 Membership in the Légion, a high governmental honor, might influence selection into

the syndicate if it was believed that they ought to help out in this crisis or if they should or




28
   The BdF and the Caisse d’Epargne had many regents and directors investing in the scheme. Given that they were
quasi-government institutions, they will not be included in the analysis. It should be noted that the BdF was also
potentially penalized as it would have to absorb any losses in excess of the 20 million francs provided by both
guarantee syndicates.
29
   The guarantee syndicate appears have been required by the Ministry of Finance, though the BdF helped in the
negotiation of membership and contributions.

should not be punished for involvement. We include a dummy variable, LLi, to indicate if the

bank was a limited liability bank rather than a proprietorship or partnership.

(2)

OLS estimates with three measures of                    are shown in Table 6, displaying the coefficients and

the t-statistics.31 For the two reported centrality measures (degree centrality for the CdE in

column 1 and degree centrality for SdM in column 4), the estimates are very similar. From a

base contribution of approximately 500,000 francs (the constant), a bank capital of 100 million

francs added 400,000 francs and each connection to the CdE or for the SdM another 116,000 to

138,000 francs, with neither limited liability nor the Legion d’Honneur playing significant roles.

The OLS estimate (Column 7) that uses the conflict-of-interest’s measure drawn from the

subscription list (PC2xSMK) captures some relationships missed by the visible networks. Here,

the base contribution is nearly the same but the effect of bank capital is lowered, so that 100

million francs of capital only adds another 100,000 francs to a contribution while a one million

franc subscription adds 407,000 francs. Thus, the Rothschilds who bought 5 million francs of

the SdM issue, have 2 million of their 3 million francs contribution explained by this variable.

            However, the challenge in estimating this model is that selection into the syndicate was

not random. Although the syndicate was organized in haste, it may be reasonable to presume---

especially given hard negotiation in the late night meeting---that the Ministry first identified

banks that should be members of the syndicate (reflecting both capacity to pay and guilt) and

then determined their contributions (perhaps weighting guilt more heavily).                     The correct

approach to this problem is to pursue a two stage regression approach, where the first stage

estimates the determinants of being induced to join the syndicate and the second estimates the

       The first stage of analysis will be a probit regression, specified in equation 3, to examine

the determinants of membership. Membership of the ith bank in the guarantee syndicate, Mi is

(3)

       There are 98 observations to estimate the probit model but only 19 for equation 2. As is

well known, there are problems with the small sample properties for models that correct for

selection bias; however, the results are similar to the OLS estimates. There is one more

cautionary note; the potential explanatory variables are the same for both equations 2 and 3, so

that there are no obvious instruments to identify them. However, when we use LHi and LLi, to

identify the membership equation, LLi, appears to do the job while having no influence on the

OLS estimates. In spite of these problems, the combined equations predict the allocation of

contributions fairly well.

       In equation 3, the limited liability variable is negative and significant in all three

specifications (Columns 2, 5 and 8), with a marginal effect to the probability of 25%, implying

that the haute banque rather than the limited liability banks were considered to bear more

responsibility for undermining the CdE. Share capital has a significant effect and the unreported

average marginal effect ranges from 0.008 to 0.011, implying that an extra 1 million francs of

capital would increase the probability of selection by 0.8 to 1.1%. One additional overlapping

directorship or official with the CdE, increased the probability of selection into the guarantee

syndicate by 3.1%. The effect for the SdM variable was 3.8%. An additional subscription of 1

million francs increased the probability of selection by 3.6 percent. Taken all together, they

imply that, if a bank was a limited liability one, it would be only included in the syndicate if it

were very large, with a copper scheme association adding to the likelihood. For the haute

banque deep involvement in the copper scheme was the key factor. The columns 3, 6 and 9 of



                                                36
Table 6 reports the combined equations in a Heckman selection model using the same conflict-

of-interests’ measures as in the other columns. Once membership to the syndicate is accounted

for, the constant term is smaller and the effects of capital and all three conflict of interest

variables are similar to the contribution equation estimated by OLS.

           As the chosen subscription variable (PC2xSMK) appears to better capture some

important relationships, the model estimates from Columns 8 and 9 in Table 6 are used to

generate estimated contributions in Column 6 of Table 4.32                      Banks with modest capital have

predicted contributions equal to the constant of 1.05 million francs, which compares to the

median actual contribution of 1 million francs. The CdE, BPPB, and Hentsch frères have larger

estimated contributions of 1.81, 2.32, and 1.30 million francs, reflecting their role in the

narrative. The estimate of 2.92 million for the Rothschilds nearly matches their actual

contribution of 3 million francs.33 Given this evidence, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the

apportionment of potential losses from the collapse of the CdE was intended to fall heaviest upon

those deeply involved in the copper scheme.


       7. Aftermath and Cleanup: Setting Incentives


           The SdM filed for bankruptcy on March 21, 1889, under a new legal procedure

(liquidation judiciaire) that halted payments to creditors, while the firm continued in operation.

As for the CdE, its board resigned; and on March 23, 1889 the bank filed for a private

liquidation, under the authority of the Tribunal de Commerce, which appointed a liquidator on

March 30. However, liquidation became a long drawn-out process because several law suits and

the need to avoid dumping copper stocks on the market to ensure a maximum recovery. Most

importantly for the CdE, its guarantees for the forward contracts were ultimately annulled by

decisions in France, by the Cour de Paris on December 18, 1890, and in the United Kingdom, by

the High Court of Justice, on July 31, 1890 on the grounds that they were against the freedom of

trade (Art. 6 of the Civil Code) and incompatible with the bank’s statutes.34 These decisions

shifted losses to mine owners, although these may have been minimal if they had not started to

mine the copper. Although the dismissal of its off-balance guarantees could not have been

foreseen in March 1889, this development greatly improved the ability of the CdE to pay its

creditors with shortfalls covered by penalties and other assessments.

        In the meantime, the CdE owed the BdF 173 million francs (the two loans for 140 million

plus other credits of 33 million francs). As the price of copper was still very low when the 100

million loan fell due on June 8, 1889 and the 40 million loan on June 18, 1889, the BdF

negotiated a settlement with the CdE and SdM signed on July 26, 1889. The bottom line was

that the BdF would accept ownership of 53,000 tons of copper in exchange for a reduction of the

CdE’s debt of 65 million francs. Rising copper prices and successful sales of other assets

enabled the BdF to realize 162.3 million francs by December 29, 1890, leaving a debt of 10.7

million francs.35 Although the CdE still had its finances entangled with the SdM, which had to

resolve claims from the mines and other creditors, the BdF accepted a final payment for

settlement with the CdE, by cutting the interest payments it was due.36                     Thus, the guarantee

syndicates were not called upon to make the BdF whole, thanks primarily to the unexpected

recovery of copper prices. The BdF also cleaned its house of conflicted senior officials. Two

   To this debt was added 1.5 million francs that Sécretan owed the BdF.
36
  This favourable outcome was not anticipated by the BdF. At its 1889 General Assembly, the Governor announced
that while the 100 million francs would be repaid, it would necessary to establish a 4 million francs reserve against
potential losses on the remaining credits to the CdE.

internal auditors, P. Tessionnière and Ernest Baudelot, who had been on the board of the CdE

were dismissed (Banque de France, Assemblée Générale, 1889).

        To resurrect the CdE and minimize disruption to the Paris market, the Minister of Finance

and the BdF promoted a new Comptoir National d’Escompte de Paris (CNEP). The CdE’s head

office, branches and clientele were sold to this reincarnation in exchange for 40,000 founders’

shares in the CNEP that were distributed to the former shareholders of the CE for their

acquiescence. The CNEP was founded with a capital of 40 million francs, half of which was paid

in; and Louis Jules Ernest Denormandie, a former Governor of the BdF, assumed the office of

president. The capital was almost entirely subscribed by the former shareholders of the CdE.

Deposits flowed in, reaching 125 million francs in five months (Comptoir National d’Escompte

de Paris, 1889). On November 5, 1889 the CNEP’s General Assembly decided to raise the

bank’s capital to 80 million francs.

         Four principal figures in the copper scheme were sued by the liquidators of the SdM and

the CdE for their roles and prosecuted in criminal court for accaparement (seizing a market and

raising prices to consumers) and fictitious accounting. Secrétan and his close associate Joseph-

Emile Laveissière, member of the CdE’s board and President of the SdM’s board, were

sentenced to 6 and 3 months of prison. These sentences were commuted on appeal into 3 months

for Secrétan and no prison time for Laveissière, because the accaparement charge was

dropped37.       In Secrétan’s agreement with the SdM’s liquidators, he ceded almost all his

property, worth 5.7 million francs. The liquidators of the CdE and the SdM pursued the boards

of the companies. Faced with a law suit, the members of the CdE’s board settled with a payment

of 24 million francs; and the liquidators of the SdM extracted 50 million francs from its former

  Although the criminal courts dropped the accaparement, charge, the civil courts did not and use it to nullify the
forward contracts, appealing to Articles 6 and 1382 of the Civil Code.

board members. As CEO of the CdE, Hentsch was the subject of an additional law suit by the

liquidators because of his “special responsibility” which was settled by a payment of 1.6 million

francs (Le Figaro, January 3, 1891). Perhaps most serious, for all board members, were suits

arising from Article 1382 of the Civil Code that permitted current and former shareholders to

obtain damages when the companies were determined to have engaged in false accounting and

distribution of fictitious dividends. Payment was compelled, as failure could result in prison, and

some board members went bankrupt, while others like Secrétan and Hentsch were financially

ruined (Jannet, 1892).


   8. Lessons from History?


       Attempting to draw strong lessons from any historical episode is difficult given that

circumstances vary from crisis to crisis, but the events of 1888-1889 do offer valuable insights

into the conduct of a central bank that was able to pre-emptively limit the damage from the

collapse of a “systemically important financial institution.” However, one caveat should be

offered at the outset.   Financial crises in the nineteenth century, in France, the U.S. and

elsewhere, usually had their origins in the exploitation of conflicts of interest by one or few

institutions. Adopted in the mid- to late twentieth century, systemic incentives to take risk,

arising from deposit insurance, Too-Big-To-Fail and other policy-originated incentives have

magnified the shocks to the financial system, making the tasks of a LOLR more difficult.

       In spite of the different environment of the late nineteenth century, this pre-emptive

action by the BdF, prompted by the Minister of Finance, is notable. The central bank engineered

a lifeboat to rescue the CdE in 1889 so that it could be liquidated in an orderly fashion and a new

CNEP could be organized. Backed by a discount window that readily provided loans to a

troubled market, a general panic was prevented by this lifeboat operation.     The BdF---with no

                                                40
promise of any funds from the government---offered the insolvent CdE large loans collateralized

by questionable assets. The central bank was protected from losses by a guarantee syndicate of

bankers that was coerced to give guarantees of 40 million francs against losses the BdF might

sustain. Court decisions nullifying forward contracts and the subsequent rise in the price of

copper reduced losses to the CdE made the deployment of the guarantee syndicate unnecessary.

Judges imposed heavy payments of damages to CdE’s and SdM’s board members. As

contemporaries knew, the danger from this intervention was that it might encourage banks to

take bigger risks in the future in the knowledge that the BdF would come to their rescue. The

assignment of shares in the guarantee syndicate and the legal system’s punitive responses would

have mitigated the moral hazard, though the precise effects are hard to measure. While one

cannot easily run a counterfactual, these actions may have contributed to the absence of further

French financial crises in the pre-1914 era.
