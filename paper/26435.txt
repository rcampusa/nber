                                          ABSTRACT

Research finds strong links between credit booms and macroeconomic outcomes like financial
crises and output growth. Are impacts also seen in financial asset prices? We document this
robust and significant connection for the first time using a large sample of historical data for
many countries. Credit boom periods tend to be followed by unusually low returns to equities, in
absolute terms and relative to bonds. Return predictability due to this leverage factor is distinct
from that of established factors like momentum and value and generates trading strategies with
meaningful excess profits out-of-sample. These findings pose a challenge to conventional macro-
finance theories.

                                        1.    Introduction

The financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath served as a reminder that rapid credit growth conditions
can profoundly influence macroeconomic and financial outcomes. Since then, a wave of academic
research, often guided by macroeconomic history, has shown that periods of more rapid growth in
economywide leverage are more likely to be followed by slower growth, deeper recessions, and a
greater chance of financial crises (e.g., Mian and Sufi 2009; Gourinchas and Obstfeld 2012; Schularick
                     a, Schularick, and Taylor 2013; Mian, Rao, and Sufi 2013).1
and Taylor 2012; Jord`
    But if economywide leverage has strong predictive power for these macroeconomic outcomes,
shouldn't it also predict dramatic shifts in major asset markets? Until now this corollary has not
been formally tested, but we provide evidence that an economy's recent history of aggregate credit
growth may be a robust predictor of future asset returns, with implications for the development of
future models in macroeconomics and finance. Using long-run annual panel data for the advanced
economies we show that credit booms are a negative predictor for real GDP growth looking forward,
as has been noted (Mian, Sufi, and Verner 2017); but they are also a negative predictor for future
returns to the major asset classes, equities and bonds. Higher credit growth predicts lower returns
to equities in absolute terms, and for equities relative to bonds. In short, when a credit boom is
maturing, the investor exposed to equities would face a more likely drawdown, while the investor
exposed to bonds would not.
    Our findings on returns constitute an additional layer in the puzzle for macroeconomic theory:
Mian, Sufi, and Verner (2017) argue that the standard neoclassical model would normally associate
more borrowing today with better growth prospects in the future. We now find that after credit
booms the holders of equity claims also tend to do worse in the future, not better. If neither
aggregate additional flows of output, nor aggregate additional returns to equity, compensate the
agent-investor, the ex post outcome disappoints the ex ante desire to borrow. Our paper is thus
complementary with an emerging view that financial crisis events--which are themselves strongly
correlated with past credit growth--are also events that take the form of a re-pricing. See, for
example, Krishnamurthy and Muir (2017) on the losses triggered by shifts in credit spreads, and
Baron and Xiong (2017) on crashes in bank equity values. However, we emphasize the broader losses
sustained in the entire equity market, and the predictable losses that occur even in normal times,
not only financial crises. Even so, our results are consistent with proposed explanations based on
mis-pricings and corrections to distorted, over-optimistic, or extrapolated beliefs (e.g., Greenwood
and Hanson 2015; Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2018).
    Our findings also pose a puzzle for finance theory and asset pricing models. Since past credit
growth is in the information set of today's investors, one might think that, in an efficient market,
it should not predict future asset returns. Yet our findings indicate that it does. Is this predictive
power be too small to matter? We argue the contrary. In the second part of the paper we show
   1 Some works prior to the financial crisis also noted the warning signs in credit booms, a notable example
being Borio and Lowe (2002).


                                                     1
that credit growth may be able to improve portfolio performance via asset allocation, and that
the marginal value to an investor of our leverage factor (L) is as important as two widely-accepted
predictive factors, momentum (M) and value (V), when judged by a variety of fit, profitability, and
risk-reward metrics. In the context of the related literature, note that the leverage story we explore
here has two important features. First, it is a global aggregate phenomenon, in other eras (going
back to the 19th century) and other countries (not just recent U.S. experience), encompassing a wide
range of policy, instititional, and financial regimes. Second, our L factor is predictive, known ex ante
by the investor, and can be used to build portfolios, just like the M and V factors. Our findings are
thus distinct, but related to, empirical work on impact of U.S. broker dealer leverage (e.g., Adrian,
Moench, and Shin 2010) and they link to theoretical work on intermediaries, credit and asset pricing
(e.g., Longstaff and Wang 2012; He and Krishnamurthy 2013).
   The structure of the paper is summarized as follows, and the results are based on up to 150
years of asset return and credit data for a set of advanced economies provided by the annual panel
data in the newly-expanded Jord`
                               a-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database.
   Section 2 presents a simple nonparametric test, binning annual observations using a crude
binary high-low private credit growth indicator, based on a leverage factor (L) defined as the
three-year lagged change in the ratio of total bank loans to GDP, denoted D3CREDGDP. Differences
in future mean equity returns across the two bins are shown to be highly significant, statistically and
quantitatively. For bonds there is virtually no effect. This finding uses no formal parametric model,
so it avoids data-mining, but the concern arises that a lack of control might be biasing the result.
   Section 3 therefore develops a linear regression model with controls, using in-sample local
projections to predict future asset returns out to 3 years based on our leverage factor. The initial
findings are robust and higher levels of the leverage factor (L), D3CREDGDP, today are associated
with lower equity returns in the next 3 years, again with almost no effects for bonds. The result holds
with and without controls for other well-established predictors of asset returns, the momentum
factor (M) and the value factor (V), and also with macro controls. Thus the L factor is not simply
capturing what is already contained in the M or V factors.
   Section 4 explains that these forecasts may be able to generate a material improvement in terms
of both fit and profitability, based on out-of-sample (OOS) performance. Whether compared to
a null model, or models using M or V alone, or M and V together, the addition of the L factor
improves OOS fit measured by mean square error. The addition of the L factor also enhances
OOS profitability-weighted directional accuracy measured using weighted-AUC statistics, and the
differences are statistically significant. This naturally raises the question of whether the L factor
enhances investment performance in a meaningful way. We document that the OOS local projection
return forecasts, fed into the machinery of a standard textbook Markowitz portfolio problem, can
deliver meaningful gains in investment performance, as measured by increases in Jensen's  and
Sharpe ratio. Based on this historical evidence, when a credit boom is maturing an investor should
likely expect stocks to underperform bonds.
   Section 5 concludes.

                              2.    Simple Summary Statistics

We begin with a very basic in-sample test to keep assumptions to a minimum. In any given historical
sample of data, we divide every country-year observation into high and low levels of recent credit
growth at each point in time. We then ask whether that binary classification provides any statistically
robust guide to observed differences in countries' asset market outcomes going forward.
    Working at an annual frequency, we use the Jord`
                                                   a-Schularick-Taylor (JST) Jord`
                                                                                 a-Schularick-Taylor
Macrohistory Database (Jord`
                           a, Schularick, and Taylor 2017; Jord`
                                                               a, Knoll, Kuvshinov, Schularick,
and Taylor 2019).2 This data source runs over the period 1870­2015 for as many as 17 advanced
economies. It provides a private credit measure based on bank loans-to-GDP, and it now includes
total real returns to four major asset classes (equities, housing, government bonds, and government
bills). This study focuses mainly on post-1950 data, where data are believed to be of better quality,
and on a subset of 14 countries which includes long series on important variables from which we
later construct momentum and value factors as auxiliary controls.3 Even so, we shall see here that
the key findings also hold in a larger pooled sample that is expanded to include the late 19th century
era of liberalized financial markets from 1870 to 1913.
    For our empirical work, we need a suitable candidate credit boom signal. We use the change
in the credit (bank loans)-to-GDP ratio over three years, denoted as D3CREDGDPit in country i
at time t. Researchers have used a variety of lag structures, but a window of about three to five
years captures medium-term credit cycles and has already been shown to have a good predictive
performance for macroeconomic outcomes (see, e.g., Mian, Sufi, and Verner 2017; Jord`
                                                                                    a, Schularick,
and Taylor 2013).4 For comparability, and to avoid data mining and optimization based on asset
returns, we take this variable directly from these empirical macro settings and apply it here na¨
                                                                                                ively.
    We use a simple approach. We classify every country-year observation into a high or low credit
growth bin based on lagged credit growth, and then we see how asset performance after that year
differs across the two bins. For a simple cut, we pool all countries and years since 1950 and we
classify them based on whether D3CREDGDPit in the current year is above or below the full sample
median for all countries and years. We call these bins hi and lo.
    The outcome measures are the real total return for equities (the broad benchmark index) and
government bonds (approximately 10-year maturity) in the next year, where the return is in local-
currency terms deflated by local-currency CPI inflation. (Later in the paper, when we construct
portfolios, we shall switch to real returns in USD terms, but the findings here are robust to such a
change in the units of the outcome measure.)
   2 The database can be found at http://www.macrohistory.net/data/.
   3 Canada,  Portugal, and Switzerland were dropped due to missing dividend yield data in some years.
   4 The paper by Mian-Sufi-Verner uses the three-year change in total private-credit-to-GDP to study debt

and the business cycle, with a focus on predicting future real GDP outcomes. We can replicate here their
findings for GDP outcomes, so we adopt their 3-year change measure, except that our focus is on implications
for asset returns. The papers from Jord`
                                       a-Schularick-Taylor generally use five years of individual or averaged
lag changes in bank-loans-to- GDP, but the results are not highly sensitive to this choice.



                                                     3
   We ask: Are the credit bin indicators correlated with subsequent return performance? To assess
that, in Table 1 we display the average annual rate of real total returns for equities and bonds in
the next year. Look first at columns (1) and (2) for the postwar period 1950­2015. The first row
shows the unconditional mean for all years, from 1950 to 2015, and all 14 countries. The mean
real total return for equities (in local currency) is about 9%, and for government bonds is about
3%. The next two rows report mean returns for the hi and lo bins for each asset class. In column
(1), the differences are dramatic for equities. For observations where D3CREDGDPit is below its
historic median, equities return 11.5%. For observations where D3CREDGDPit is above its historic
median, equities return just 6.8%. The final row shows that the differences in mean returns of 4.7%
for equities is statistically significant. In column (2) the differences for bonds are much smaller, only
1.5%, and not statistically significant. Lastly, look at columns (3) and (4) which repeat the exercise
pooling the postwar period 1950­2015 with the late nineteenth century period 1870­1913. Note that
we exclude turbulent interwar sample, where inference is clouded by very volatile markets and a
small sample size. Even so, the historically enlarged sample supports broadly the same conclusions.
High versus low recent credit growth is associated with worse versus better equity return outcomes
going forward, but smaller differences in bond return outcomes.
   To sum up, our findings indicate that credit booms are followed by below-par returns to the two
asset classes, but the differences are more pronounced for equities than for bonds. Our next step is
to more rigorously test formal models of asset returns, and control for other factors to ensure the
result is robust, before moving on to investment implications.


                 3.    Regression Analysis of Predicted Returns

To investigate return forecasting ability, we apply the method of local projections (Jord`
                                                                                         a 2005). We
use panel OLS regressions to forecast real total returns to the two assets using lagged three-year
average credit growth D3CREDGDPit , which we term the leverage factor, L, and other controls. As
above, for now, we still measure real total return in local-currency terms deflated by local-currency
CPI inflation and we use only the post-WW2 sample from 1950 to 2015 from now on.
   Our exact model specification for the h-period cumulative total real return forecast is

               total real return indexi,t+h
                                            - 1 = ih + h D3CREDGDPit + h Xit + eit ,                    (1)
                total real return indexi,t

where the outcome variable refers to the return on equities or bonds in country i from year t, in
percent. Country fixed effects are denoted ih . The controls Xit include two established asset pricing
factors, momentum (defined as one-year lagged total return) and value (defined as equity dividend
yield or nominal bond yield); we refer to these factors as M and V, following convention.5
   5 On  using M and V factors for return forecasts, see, e.g., Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013). The
literature is huge. Seminal works on momentum include, e.g., Poterba and Summers (1988) and Jegadeesh
and Titman (1993); on value they include, e.g., Fama and French (1988), and Goyal and Welch (2003).

    The results are also robust to the inclusion of macro variables in the form of observed CPI
inflation and real GDP per capita growth in country i at year t, but these are not reported here.
    Given our focus on using credit to forecast future asset returns, the key coefficients of interest
are the impulse responses h on the lagged credit growth variable D3CREDGDPit . In the analysis,
we ensure all of the controls are centered and standardized, so coefficients can be interpreted as the
change in the forecast due to a +1 standard deviation (s.d.) shock in the corresponding regressor.
For reference, in the sample used here D3CREDGDPit has a mean of 3.65% and an s.d. of 8.46% .
    Figure 1 displays the impulse responses in graphical form, using the forecast model on the
post-1950 advanced economy panel. In these charts, the solid line shows the response out to a 3-year
horizon for a +1 s.d. shock to D3CREDGDPit , with confidence intervals of ± 1 and ± 2 s.e. shown
by dark and light shading, respectively.
    In panel (a) the local projection for cumulative real returns to equities and bonds omits all
controls, and in panel (c) it includes momentum and value controls as defined above. The choice
of outcome units is not crucial; similar results, not shown here, are obtained for equity and bond
returns expressed in U.S. dollars, and also as an excess over local 3-month T-bills or over 3-month
U.S. Treasury bills. As a consistency check, the chart in panel (b) based on real GDP per capita
growth, and no controls, shows that we can replicate on our data the main finding of Mian, Sufi,
and Verner (2017): higher D3CREDGDPit today is a strong predictor of slower real GDP per capita
growth in the future. But, as noted, our interest is whether similar patterns hold for asset returns
and so henceforth we set to one side discussion of GDP outcomes.
    The key test here is whether the local projection coefficients h on D3CREDGDPit are nonzero.
We are also interested in whether they have the expected sign. The null hypothesis is clearly rejected,
and the coefficient on D3CREDGDPit is statistically significant at all years for equities but not for
bonds. More importantly, the responses differ quantitatively by a large factor, and by an order of
magnitude at three years. Again, in a more formal test, and with or without controls, we find that
larger credit booms measured by D3CREDGDPit go hand in hand with depressed returns in equities
relative to bonds. Over three years, given a +1 s.d. change in D3CREDGDPit , forecast real total
equity returns drop by an average of 300 to 400 bps per year, but forecast real total bond returns are
virtually flat.
    These results provide further support for an approach to return prediction based on a leverage
factor like D3CREDGDP. In addition, since the results are robust to controls, we can be reassured
that this leverage factor (L) is not simply capturing, in a different form, established sources of
predictive ability already captured in well-known factors like momentum (M), or value (V).
    To sum up, we see that, from a forecasting perspective, the leverage factor contains distinct
predictive information on the margin, and in what follows we seek to find out how valuable that
information might be.

                                 4.    Trading on the Leverage Factor

The results so far suggest that returns to one major asset class, equities, can be forecast in absolute
terms and relative to bonds using lagged credit growth information. We view this as indicative of
the existence of a new ex ante asset pricing factor, the leverage factor, which we denote L. However,
this does not yet fully document how important or significant this new factor is as a driver of asset
returns, either on its own or as compared to other well established factors. Nor does it address the
natural question as to whether the information in the L factor would generate a significant excess
returns to an investor who used the information to suitably tailor their portfolio allocations.
   The purpose of this final section of the paper is to address these open questions. We proceed
using various empirical tests, and basing our work on a single, standard, global portfolio allocation
problem to equities and bonds. In the back of our mind we have a global equal-weight 60-40 as a
simple benchmark portfolio. Our forecasting results above suggest that investment performance
gains can be made relative to the benchmark by an asset allocation strategy that tilts away from
countries in high credit boom states and toward countries low credit boom states. The idea is to test
this empirically.
   We apply a model of asset returns like those above to set optimal portfolio allocation in each
country based the state of the credit cycle and other factors. We allow the allocation to equities
and bonds to vary over time and over countries, with an offsetting long or short position in each
country's three-month bills as necessary. All returns to all positions are now measured in USD on
an annual basis, and the portfolio is rebalanced each year based on rolling returns forecast in that
year using an expanding window of lagged information. That is, we apply a standard out-of-sample
recursive backtest using the model's annual return forecasts. We then solve a Markowitz stock/bond
allocation problem for each country.
   We use regression models as above to make rolling forecasts of a vector of excess returns for
each country and each year for equities and bonds relative to three-month bills. We focus on
forward-looking total returns at a holding period horizon of one year h = 1. In the model, we can
include as controls, as before, the three candidate factors: a momentum factor (M) measured by the
lagged USD return, a value factor (V) exactly as before, and the new leverage factor (L) which is still
defined as D3CREDGDPit .
   In detail, using the annual data from 1950 up to 1969 as a training sample, from 1970 on we make
a rolling one-step (h = 1) forecast of annual excess returns for the vector of the two assets, equities
and bonds, in 14 countries, using the fitted values from panel country fixed effect regressions for
each asset class at the one-year horizon, where each asset class forecast is given by the predicted
value

Combining the resulting equity and bond return predicted values as a vector, we denote the stacked
actual returns by rit , and the forecasts by r
                                             ^ it .
    We can implement this forecasting model in various ways; we can include all controls, but we
can also look at nested alternatives which use only some controls, or even a null model with no
controls. As the bracketed labels denote, when using no controls (apart from country fixed-effects)
we will refer to the forecast as the null model. When using leverage factor, we refer to the L model.
When using momentum factor, we refer to the M model. When using value factor, we refer to the
Vmodel. When using momentum and value factors, we refer to the MV model. When using all
three factors, we refer to the MVL model.
    We performed the rolling regressions with both unconstrained and constrained coefficients,
with similar results. In the more conservative constrained results shown below, the coefficients
on momentum and value in the rolling regressions were restricted to conventional positive values
and coefficient on credit was restricted to negative values. We did this to ensure that the signal
coefficients would not invert arbitrarily in some windows and create spurious support for the
assumed model or artificially enhance performance.
    For reference, Table 2 reports unconstrained in-sample panel OLS regression forecast results for
the maximal 1950 to 2015 window. The constraints would not be rejected here: V (+) and L (-)
have statistically significant coefficients of the correct sign, and the M coefficients are not statistically
different from zero. That said, M is usually a better signal at higher frequency than annual, and
it still makes a statistically significant contribution in some but not all sample windows in the
recursive estimation.
   Once we have the rolling forecasts using the out-of-sample constrained regressions, we take the
                                           ^ , again from the lagged expanding window of the raw
covariance matrix of pooled excess returns V
data, and we then compute the optimal tangent portfolio weights of the Markowitz problem, given
by wit = V^ -1 r
               ^ it . The weights wit are then used in each country i, in each year t, this portfolio is
             it
then used as the asset allocation rule.
    We then apply simple global weights so that in the overall allocation is always 1/N to each
country, but the model-based optimal weights for that country are used to set the stock-bond tilt
which attains a realized USD return it = wit r  ^ for that country. Under equal country weights, the
global portfolio's realized USD return is then given by   ¯ t = 1 iN
                                                                   =1 it . The performance of realized
                                                                  N
returns can then be analyzed and compared across different strategies--i.e., for different subsets of
signals used as control variables. Note that these portfolios are unconstrained, so both long and
short positions are permitted, in contrast to say a simple long-only strategy like 60-40 in equities
and bonds.
    We present four sets of diagnostics statistics to show that the L factor matters for asset pricing,
on its own terms, as well as in comparison to the more established M and V factors. Whenever the
L factor is added to a model it increases both the OOS fit of the model return forecasts and the OOS
performance of the Markowitz portfolios constructed with those forecasts. These contributions are
statistically and quantitatively significant, as we now show.

4.1.    MSE ratio statistics
Figure 2(a) begins by comparing the mean-squared error ( MSE) of each model's OOS forecasts to
the MSE of the null model, over all observations in the panel regression, for equities and bonds.
    We use this as a simple yardstick to gauge whether the leverage factor L adds any explanatory
power on its own, compared to that added by the well-established momentum and value factors,
M and V. We also want to know if, when L is added to the MV model, it also makes any further
distinct contribution to model performance. Thus, as in the case of other performance statistics
which follow, we take the null model and we compare it against the M, V, L, MV, and MVL models.
    Starting with equities, the MSE ratio statistics in the left panel of Figure 2(a) are persuasive. We
see that, as expected, the M factor on its own has little explanatory power at the annual frequency,
and reduces MSE by only 1.2% relative to the null (0.988). But the V factor on its own contributes
more to fit, and reduces MSE by 4.3% relative to the null (0.957). These are both established factors
is the asset pricing literature. Can the L factor achieve anything comparable? Yes it can. The L
factor on its own contributes to fit, and reduces MSE by 3.4% relative to the null (0.966). This fit
improvement is much more than that of the accepted M factor, and close to that of the equally
well-established V factor. But is the L factor merely picking up what the M and V factors already
detect? This possibility could be entertained. Perhaps the credit boom indicated by L factors is also
a time when M and V factors also shift and deliver essentially the same information? This is not the
case. Figure 1 also shows that although the MV factors jointly reduce MSE by 4.6% relative to the
null (0.954), adding the leverage factor allows the MVL model to achieve the maximal reduction of
MSE by 7.4% relative to the null (0.926), that is, by a further 2.8%
    Turning to bonds, the MSE ratio statistics in the right panel of Figure 2(a) are very similar in
terms of ranking and magnitudes. The M factor is here quite weak, but the V factor reduces MSE
by more here, by 4.9% relative to the null (0.951). The L factor on its own again contributes to fit,
and reduces MSE by 3.3% relative to the null (0.967). The MV factors jointly reduces MSE by 4.6%
relative to the null (0.954), adding the leverage factor allows the MVL model to achieve the maximal
reduction of v by 7.1% relative to the null (0.929), that is, by a further 2.5%
    Taken together these results give strong support to the idea that L factor matters for asset pricing.
When used to forecast asset returns, its contribution in terms of predictive ability is nontrivial, either
on its own or when in combination with M and V factors. It reduced the model's annual forecast
error by more than the M factor, and almost as much as the V factor. If these factors are broadly
accepted based on this kind yardstick, then the L factor might be taken seriously too.


4.2.    Weighted AUC  statistics
We now ask whether performance can be assessed by more than the standard measure of statistical
fit MSE, and judged by a more economically based criterion.

great fit most of the time when small profits and losses are at stake, but then makes rare but large
directional mistakes when big profits and losses are at stake. Jord`
                                                                   a and Taylor (2011) show how to
import into finance tools from binary classification theory and machine learning to better gauge the
investment performance of any strategy, specifically a statistic known as the area under the curve or
AUC, which comes from the ROC curve, or receiver operating characteristic curve and its variants.
   Jord`
       a and Taylor (2011) advocate that in finance applications, the classification of each instance
receive a weight wt proportional a gain or loss associated with that observation. This type of
weighting was proposed earlier by Fawcett (2006) and applied in Berge, Jord`
                                                                           a, and Taylor (2011) to
the analysis of FX returns. Here we consider the mean of the return as the "hurdle rate" and reward
the classifier with weight based on return relative to mean. The area under this weight-adjusted
curve or AUC , inherits all the same properties and methods of inference as the simple AUC statistic.
The weighted ROC curve traces out weighted true positives against weighted true negatives, It is
straightforward to show how these map into to the gain-loss statistics proposed by Bernardo and
Ledoit (2000), as explained by Jord`
                                   a and Taylor (2011), so this is a way to judge a strategy on it
upside-downside profit capture. See Appendix A for further details.
   We again implement the test using all observations in the panel regression, for equities and
bonds separately. On this metric, the statistics reported in Figure 2(b) are also persuasive. Looking
at equities, in the left panel, the null model achieves an AUC of 0.61. Adding any single factor
to the model improves AUC , and in a statistically significant way with V and L. M achieves 0.64,
V achieves 0.70, and L achieves 0.67. This is the same performance ordering seen with the MSE
ratios. However, judged by AUC , the MV model adds little. Its AUC is 0.70, the same as V alone.
In contrast, adding the leverage factor here, MVL has AUC equal to 0.74, and the change versus
MV is statistically significant.
   For bonds, in the right panel, similar findings appear. The null model achieves an AUC of 0.67.
Here, among single factor models, M is actually marginally worse than the null and achieves 0.66,
but V and L perform better than the null at 0.73 and 0.70, with the difference for V being statistically
significant. The MV model achieves only 0.72, but adding L the MVL model achieves 0.75, the best
of all the models shown, and the increment versus MV is close to statistically significant.
   Summing up, in the case of both stocks and bonds, adding the L factor to the null or to the MV
model again results in meaningful performance gain, now measured by the AUC statistic. The
leverage factor makes a difference.


4.3.    Jensen's  statistics
We now turn to investment performance of the models judged by the annual returns to the Markowitz
portfolios. A well-established gauge of whether any given method of portfolio construction leads to
improvement in performance is the measure known as Jensen's . This is given by the intercept in a
regression of the portfolio excess return on some benchmark excess return.


                                                  13
   In our application, we perform the following estimation on annual portfolio returns,

                                          m
                                         rit = m + m rit
                                                      B6040
                                                            ,                                        ( 3)

where m is one of the set of models considered here, {B6040, null, M, V, L, MV, MVL}, and where
we add in here as the benchmark (B6040) the static 60-40 global portfolio, which is a fixed-weight
allocation of 60% equity, 40% bonds, with each country equally-weighted.
   In our setting, the two key hypothesis tests are: do models deliver meaningful gains relative
to the benchmark, m > 0   B6040 ; and do they deliver meaningful gains relative to the null,
m > null .
   On this metric, the statistics reported in Figure 3(a) are again supportive. First, even the null
model outperforms the Benchmark 60-40. It uses no signals to make a forecast, but just computes a
Markowitz portfolio based on historical first and second moments of returns, but this on its own
delivers null that is positive and statistically significant, and equal to 188 bps.
   Adding the M, V, and L factors, increases performance even more with m rising as we move
through these signals, from 302 bps, to 368 bps, to 455 bps. Clearly, the established M and V signals
live up to their reputation as useful return predictors, but on this metric L on its own does even
better than either one of these traditional asset pricing factors. Finally, for multiple signals, the MV
model achieves 391 bps, but adding the L factor makes a big improvement, and delivers 585 bps.
   All told, looking at the confidence intervals for these estimates of m for all models, it is striking
that all beat the Benchmark 60-40 by a statistically significant margin, but only models including the
L factor beat the null by a statistically significant margin. The leverage factor again looks to be at
least as useful as its better known rivals.


4.4.   Sharpe ratio statistics
Our final test is based on the best known performance statistic of all, the Sharpe ratio. For any
                                                                 m ) divided by its standard deviation
portfolio m, this is defined as the mean of the excess return µ(rit
  m ), for all of the model portfolios m considered here, {B6040, null, M, V, L, MV, MVL}.
(rit
   On this metric, the statistics reported in Figure 3(b) are also favorable. The Benchmark 60-40
achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.45. This is substantially bettered even by the null model, which attains
0.62. Moving through the models with only one signal, M achieves 0.70, V achieves 0.82, and L
achieves 0.78. So among individual signals L performs quite well. The MV model achieves a Sharpe
ratio of 0.83, but adding the leverage factor to this the MVL model achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.94, a
nontrivial gain of +0.11 Sharpe units on the margin relative to the established MV signals.
   Again the leverage factor does well in this contest. It delivers meaningful performance gains as
measured by Sharpe ratio, when the three signals are compared individually, or when L is added to
an MV model.

We set out to explore whether leverage cycles leave a signature on asset returns and whether these
patterns have predictive value for investors. Already, a wave of research has shown that credit boom
and bust episodes deeply influence future macroeconomic outcomes, so it would be surprising if
the same were not true of financial markets.
   The evidence supports the hypothesis. Credit boom periods tend to be followed by equity return
underperformance in the near future. We find that credit growth signals can be a useful input for a
tactical asset allocation strategy, alongside such tried and tested signals as momentum and value.
   Further research is needed, but our findings suggest that accounting for the role of credit
booms and busts could be as important for asset pricing studies as it has become for mainstream
macroeconomics. The evidence also adds to the growing set of macro-finance puzzles which
standard models struggle to explain.

     A.     Binary classification methods with and without weights
This appendix note draws on Jord`
                                a and Taylor (2011) and Taylor (2015).

The unweighted AUC statistic To frame this for our application, suppose we have an asset
return time series rt and want to ask if a model forecast rt has profit potential. A na¨        ive binary
classification approach might be to ask if the forecast is informative as to whether the asset return
beats its average, in any given period. To assess that make an indicator that is 1 for yes, and 0 for no,
whenever the return minus its average rt - r  ¯ exceeds some threshold c, and find the true positives (a
subset of all positives TP ) and true negatives (a subset of all positives TN ) of the associated classifier
for each value of c:
                                            TN                                    TP
                            TN (c) =               I (r t - r
                                                            ¯ < c ),    TP(c) =    I (r t - r
                                                                                            ¯ > c ),           (4)
                                            j =1                                  i =1

    We define the Correct Classification Frontier or CCF as the plot of the true positive rate TP(c) against
the true negative rate TN (c), for all real thresholds c.
    If the threshold c gets large and negative, the classifier is very aggressive in making positive calls,
almost all signals are above the threshold, and ( TN , TP) converges to (0, 1) as c  -; conversely,
when c gets large and positive, the classifier is very conservative in making positive calls, almost
all signals are below the threshold, and ( TN , TP) converges to (1, 0) as c  +. In between these
extremes, an informative classifier should deliver a CCF curve above the simplex or the 45-degree
line of the null uninformative (or "coin toss") classifier, as shown in the accompanying Figure A1.
The CCF is a variant of the better known ROC or Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.

and between these values for a useful classifier. See text.




                                                                   18
    The area under the CCF, known as the area under the curve ( AUC) is 0.5 for the null uninfor-
mative classifier and 1 for a perfect classifier. Concerning inference, testing whether a classifier
is informative, or better than an alternative classifier, is simple with the AUC statistic since it is
asymptotically normally distributed with a variance that can be easily estimated. The test is also
independent of the operator's preferences. Such tests are available in most statistical packages.

The weighted AUC statistic The key idea in Jord`
                                               a and Taylor (2011), also in Fawcett (2006),
is to note that the basic AUC statistics value each correct or incorrect classification with an equal
weight. Instead, they propose that the classification of each instance receive a weight wt proportional
a gain or loss associated with that observation.
    Suppose we consider the mean of the return as the "hurdle rate" and reward the classifier with
weight based on return differential relative to mean: a positive "gain" if the differential is positive, a
negative "loss" if the differential is negative. For a market timer, a positive is better than the mean,
and is when one would want to go longer; a negative is worse than the mean, and is when one
would want to go shorter.
    The analysis is then shown to be a straightforward transform of the ordinary AUC setup, when
the weights for positives (negatives) are scaled by the sum of the maximum possible weights for
positives (negatives) that would arise from a perfect classifier.
    With those weights applied, a transformed CCF, called the CCF can be built from the trans-
formed TN and TP statistics given by
                                  TN                                  TP
                       TN (c) =    wt I (r t - r
                                               ¯ < c ),    TP (c) =    wt I (r t - r
                                                                                   ¯ > c ),            (5)
                                  j =1                                i =1


The area under this curve or AUC , inherits all the same properties and methods of inference as the
AUC statistic.
    Crucially, by dint of the weight design, AUC measures upside and downside capture: TP (c)
is the extent to which the strategy succeeds in making a (relative) profit from long positions (i.e.,
upside captured when returns exceed c). TN (c) is the extent to which the strategy avoids in making
a (relative) loss from short positions (i.e., downside avoided when returns are below c).
