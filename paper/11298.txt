                                           ABSTRACT

This paper shows that in the 2000s unions in the UK and US made innovative use of the Internet

to deliver union services and move toward open source unions better suited for the modern world

than traditional union structures. In contrast to analysts who see unions as being on an inexorable

path of decline, I argue that these innovations are changing unions from institutions of the Webbs

to institutions of the Web, which will improve their effectiveness and revive their role as the key

worker organization in capitalism.

       Can the Internet produce more effective and successful unions and help resuscitate the

labour movement in the UK and US?

        Some labour experts in the UK and US claim that the Internet will fundamentally alter

employee representation and the way unions operate (Shostak,1996; Diamond and Freeman,

2002, Darlington, 2000, Lee, 1996). Freeman and Rogers (2002a, 2002b), in particular, have

outlined the elements of a new “open source” union form designed to deliver union services and

connect activists over the Internet at low cost, regardless of management recognition. Some

readers will undoubtedly be sceptical about these claims or forecasts, and not only because they

originate with pointy headed intellectuals. A substantial minority of persons in both countries do

not use the Internet. In 2004 37% of US citizens and 44% of UK citizens were non-users and

many had no intention of going on-line.1 Internet hype fuelled the dot.com bubble of the late

1990s and led some to foresee rapid development of a referendum-style democracy. The

collapse of the bubble and gradual growth of e-democracy and e-government2 are reminders that

economic and social patterns change more gradually than innovations in computer speed and the

growth of Internet hosts.

       Still, it would be foolhardy to reject visionary claims out of hand. The e-economy has

grown steadily post the dot.com bust.3 The Internet propelled an obscure ex-governor of

Vermont to be Democratic party front runner in early 2004. Activists have created powerful

political sites independent of the standard political parties. And http://www.moveon.organ

increasing proportion of citizens in the UK and US use the Web to obtain government services.

Whether the Internet will have similar transforming effects on union activities is an empirical

question.

       To see how far unions have come in using Internet technologies to improve their services

to members and to reach unorganized workers, this essay examines the content of union web

sites in the UK and US and reviews eight significant union innovations in applying the new

technologies. The evidence shows that while visionary ideas of open source unions have yet to

be fulfilled, union progress using the Internet and related technologies has been sufficiently rapid

to suggest that unions are indeed in the process of morphing from institutions of the Webbs to

institutions of the Web (per my title). While by itself this may not resuscitate the labour

movement in the UK and US, it will greatly increase the chances of such a change in fortunes.

I. Union Presence in Cyberspace

       From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, unions in the UK, and in the rest of the advanced

world, developed a web presence. In 1995 the only UK union with a web site was UNISON. In

2001 there were 373 union web sites in the UK (Diamond and Freeman, 2002), based largely on



3
 See http://www.esa.doc.gov/DigitalEconomy2003.cfm
4
  The most notable political site in the US is www.moveon.org. UK government services on the
Internet are given at http://www.direct.gov.uk/Homepage/fs/en. For US use of the Internet for
government services see http://207.21.232.103/pdfs/PIP_E_Gov_Report_0504.pdf
                                                                                                  2
data in www.cyberpicketline.org.uk). In the US, all international federations and thousands of

local unions developed web sites. Worldwide, the number of union web sites has risen rapidly,

as many developing country unions have gone on-line, and as the global union federations and

International Confederation of Free Trade Unions have made the Internet integral to their

operations. In 2004 the global union federation, UNI-Union International Network, launched a

web-based help desk to assist union web workers in running or improving their web sites

(http://www.e_tradeunions.org).

       Many union leaders in the UK and US had come to view the Internet as part of their

strategy for the future. The TUC’s Internet strategy has produced a web site that provides

information largely to nonunion workers (www.worksmart.org.uk); another site that links union

representatives around the country (www.unionreps.org.uk); as well as a site reporting its

activities (www.tuc.org.uk). The general secretary for NAPO, the UK’s probation officers’

union, uses a blog to communicate with her members (www.napo.org.uk/napolog), and so too

does the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (www.billyhayes.co.uk). In the

US, the AFL-CIO has created an email list of approximately two million members and activists

to use in union campaigns (www.unionvoice.org/wfean/home.html). The president of the highly

successful Service Employees International Union uses a weekly blog on the union website to

converse with members (www.fightforthefuture.org/blog).

       For the visionary claims to come true, unions need high quality web sites that give them a

significant place in cyberspace. Analysing the content of UK union web sites in 2001-2002,

Ward and Lusoli concluded that the bulk of the sites were mediocre, at best. The vast majority of

UK unions had “signpost websites” that gave the name of the union and some minimal

information, together perhaps with a picture of the union president. This finding is consistent
                                                                                                    3
with what union workers said about their unions’ web sites on the 2001 British Workplace

Representation and Participation Survey. Only 20% of Internet active union members reported

having ever visited their unions’ web site; 22% didn’t know if their union had a web site, and 6%

claimed their union did not have a web site. Of those who used their union web site just 14%

reported that the site was excellent, while 14% reported it as poor (Diamond and Freeman, 2002,

table 7).

        But UK unions improved their web sites in the early 2000s. The development of

standardized commercial programs made it easier to produce user friendly and informative sites.

Technologically sophisticated web workers created professional expertise in many unions.

Innovative use of Internet technology by the Trades Union Congress and improved web sites

broadly set a standard to which many individual unions responded. Most important, as noted

above, many union leaders came to recognize the need for an effective web-based strategy to

carry out union functions.

        Because central federation web sites are the face of unionism to much of the world, I

begin my assessment of the UK union presence in cyberspace by comparing the content of the

TUC’s main web site to the content of web sites of the central union federations in the US,

Canada, and Australia. I use the methodology developed by Ward and Lusoli (2003) to analyse

individual British union web sites, supplemented by some additional information. This

methodology scores the content of union web sites along three dimensions: provision of

information, such as information about union history, policies, media releases, an FAQ, and so

on; options for participation, for instance an e-mail sign-up, member forum, on-line joining; and

provision of services, such as purchase of insurance, training, professional development. The

protocol codes 13 items relating to information as 1 for provision or 0 for absence of information.
                                                                                                     4
It codes 4 items from 0 to 3 on participation, depending on strength of the form of participation.

It codes 12 services as 1 for provision and 0 no provision. For ease of analysis, I scale the sum of

the scores in each areas from 1 to 100 and average them to obtain a summary measure of content

quality.5

        Figure 1 gives the content quality scores for the websites of the TUC and the other major

English-speaking union federations as of 2004. All of the websites score relatively highly on the

measures for information and services. In part, this reflects the importance that central

federations give to their web presence, since web sites are one of the few ways for a central

federation to reach union members and other workers. But most of the web sites score less on

participation. One reason for this is that unions have shied away from developing interactive

web sites that might encourage members or others to be critical of union leadership and policies.

Another reason is that central federations are cautious about interacting with the members of

their affiliates. Overall, the AFL-CIO obtains the highest score for its web site, achieving 95% of

the maximum possible score, while the TUC scores lowest of the federations, at 79%. One

reason for this, however, is that the TUC has three web sites – the main TUC site and the

worksmart site and the unionreps site -- which divide some of its information, services, and

participative features. A content analysis of all three treated as a single site gives a score of 90%

        To see whether individual UK unions had improved their sites since the Ward-Lusoli

study, I computed the content of the web sites of the same unions they had studied in 2004.

Because of union mergers and other changes, not all of the sites in their study were still

operating, but the majority were. Table 1 summarizes my results in terms of the average content



5
  In addition, the Ward-Lusoli content analysis examines numbers of links with other sites, which
I ignore in this paper.
                                                                                                 5
score across the three domains of participation, services, and information. The figures in column

1 give my rescaling of the scores for 30 unions in 2001-2002 reported by Ward and Lusoli,

overall and divided between large and smaller unions. The average for all UK unions in

2001/2002 is just 38% of the maximum possible score, with however considerable difference

between the larger and smaller unions. Column 2 shows that in 2004 the UK unions averaged

54% of the maximum score in the categories – a substantial improvement in a short period of

time. The table differentiates between larger and smaller unions. In both years larger unions had

better web sites than smaller unions. In addition, since 2001-2002, the larger unions improved

their web sites more rapidly than the smaller unions. As an example of the change in the quality

of web sites for large unions, consider the Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU). In

2001-2002 this was largely a signboard, with limited information and interactive features. It

scored 29 on the 0-100 scale. In 2004, the TGWU scored 58, which put it at the average for UK

unions.

          Because US unions went on the Web earlier than UK unions, US union sites are likely to

be more advanced than UK union sites. To compare the web sites of UK unions to those of US

unions, I paired unions in the two countries by sector or type of worker (for instance, comparing

the web sites of teaching unions, of communication workers and so on), and analyzed the content

of the US union web sites. I obtained 22 matches. Columns 3 and 4 of table 1 gives the results

of these calculations. In 2004, the content scores of US unions averaged 69% – 11 points above

the scores for their UK counterparts. But there was virtually no difference in the quality of UK

and US union websites among large unions. Indeed, the UK’s UNISON was tied with one other

union at the highest score of 90, above the 82 for its US peer, the Association of Federal, State,

County and Municipal employees. The reason for the lower average rating of UK websites is
                                                                                                      6
that smaller UK unions have fewer features on their sites than smaller US unions – possibly

because they have fewer members and thus less resources than their US pairs.

       In sum, UK union web sites have improved to the extent that the sites of large UK unions

have attained rough equivalency with the sites of large US unions. While smaller unions have a

ways to go to improve their web sites, and almost all unions could add more participative

features, UK union web sites are no longer the dredges of cyberspace that they were just a short

while ago.

II. Innovative Uses of the Internet

       Union development of a modern web presence is necessary but not sufficient to fulfill the

visionaries’ picture of the Internet strengthening trade unions. To fulfill the vision, unions must

use Internet technology to deliver services to workers and connect activists and develop some of

the attributes of the open source form. To determine how far unions moved in these directions, I

examine eight innovative uses of the web by unions and labour activists. I focus primarily on

innovations by British unions, with some attention however to US and Dutch union innovations.

(1) Providing information to workers: the TUC’s worksmart

       Before the Internet, it was difficult and expensive for unions to provide information to

workers outside the organized sector and to aid organized workers in small work places. The

Internet gives unions a low cost tool for informing workers in any locality about workplace

conditions and rights and for advising them how to deal with workplace problems. In a world that

obtains its information on-line, moreover, it is critical for unions to take advantage of this new

way of reaching workers. As Bibby has stressed, a union’s “website acts as the most prominent

public shop-window of the organisation, providing an opportunity to explain the services and

benefits which union membership can bring”(Bibby, 2004, p 4).
                                                                                                      7
       To see how important a strong web presence is for unions, consider a world where

nonunion web sites, such as commercial job boards or NGO sites or government sites or

employment law office sites, offered easier access, better information, and superior advice about

workplace problems than union web sites. Nonunion workers would see unions as irrelevant to

their needs. Union workers might wonder about the value of their subscriptions. By contrast, if

union web sites provide workers with the best information and advice about workplace problems,

workers will naturally see unions as a helpful institution. They will be more likely to join unions

and support union campaigns. The information-laden union web site advertises union expertise to

workers and shows how unions can help workers with specific problems, as well as directly

aiding those workers.

       In 2002 the Trades Union Congress developed www.worksmart.org.uk,“to be a one-stop

shop for everything to do with your working life”, particularly for non-union workers. The

worksmart sitehttp://www.worksmart.org.uk contains basic information about workplace

problems and worker rights and links to other sources of information and advice. Its union

parentage is presented discretely, with no reference to union campaigns or TUC events. Box 1

describes the site and gives some sense of how it is organized. In its first year the site reported

20,000 monthly visitors; in its second year, it reached 40,000 visitors in peak months.

http://Www.worksmart.org.uk

       The worksmart site is a work in progress. The site lacks a sophisticated artificial

intelligence program along the lines of www.askjeeves.org or medical advice sites, that would

allow an AI “workplace expert” to answer detailed questions about problems. It does not

provide labour market news nor career or salary information, a discussion forum, information on

particular employers that many workers report that they would find useful on a web site (see
                                                                                                  8
table 2). The site specializes in rights at work; a google search for “workplace rights, UK” places

the site 10th on the list of relevant sites. But at this writing worksmart is not well-linked to other

sites: in June 2004 it had just 157 other web site links compared to 2,440 links to the TUC web

site6. The TUC plans to increase the site’s visibility and reach by syndicating it to commercial

sites and search engines as the marquee site with workplace information. The Tiscali Internet

Service Provider (the fourth largest in the UK) made worksmart its site for workplace

information. In 2004, the TUC estimated that about 15% of users come from that source.7 In

2004, moreover, worksmart developed special projects on working proper hours and increasing

the number of bank holidays that drew national media coverage.

       The TUC effort to reach nonunion workers contrasts with that of the AFL-CIO, which has

shied away from developing a site targeted at largely nonunion workers. If you want to learn

about your pension rights in the US, the AFL-CIO’s own web site is useful, but if you are a

nonunion worker who does not readily think of the AFL-CIO as the place to go, you may be

unable to find the information readily. The AFL-CIO alternative has been the organization

Working America (described under 8), which provides considerable information to nonunion

workers on line but under a strong union label.

(2) Obtaining and publicizing wage information: the Dutch wage indicators survey

        The wage indicators web site (www.wageindicator.org/index.php?pag=home) developed

by the University of Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Labour Studies, working with FNV

(Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions), and Monsterboard (the Dutch Monster.com internet




6
 This count is for June 28, 2004. .
7
 As of 31st March 2004, Tiscali had 8 million active users of whom 1.2 million were broadband
customers.
                                                                                                9
                                                                               8
recruitment firm), gathers and delivers wage data through an Internet survey. Originally started

in 2001 to allow Dutch women to compare pay across jobs, the survey has expanded to cover

Dutch men, and to cover workers in several other countries. The survey asks users to fill out a

questionnaire about their salary, which it uses to obtain wage, salary or earnings data for

occupations, with which they can check their relative pay. Apart from questions about earnings,

the survey asks about working hours, work history, company, contract, attitudes toward work,

including preferences on working hours.

       Why did the Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions support this survey? In the Dutch

industrial relations system, unions bargain over wages for broad sectors, and thus establish what

amounts to minimum levels of pay in those areas. Union involvement in the wage indicators

survey was motivated by a desire to find the actual wages paid workers in different settings. This

would illuminate the impacts of collective bargaining and the extent of pay dispersion

independent of collective agreements. The wage indicators survey was sufficiently successful

that in July 2004, comparable surveys were launched in eight other EU countries, including the

UK, and in China.

(3) International union news: www.labourstart.org

       Eric Lee has argued that the Internet will create a more global trade union movement by

providing information on labour issues around the world and a mode for initiating and

conducting campaigns on those issues at low cost (Lee, 1996, 1998). The major web site



8
  As with other web-based surveys, the sample is non-representative of the population (Tijdens,
2004). This cannot be remedied simply by weighting responses by population demographics,
since the workers who fill out the survey may differ from others with the same demographics.
Still, the survey can provide correlations among variables that are likely to generalize to the
broader population (Freeman, 2004).
                                                                                                     10
connecting unionists around the world is Lee’s www.labourstart.org, which has become the

primary source of international labour news. The site lives on the volunteer activity of

correspondents, who upload labour stories from their local newspapers to the site. As of 2004

over 500 unions made the site their channel for helping members keep abreast of international

labour developments. In addition to providing news, the site uses its 15,000 or so email list to

engage readers in online campaigning on particular problems, and offers free web forums to any

union which wants one and links to other forums around the world. In 1999 the site sponsored a

“Labour Website of the Year” competition, in which users of the site voted by email for the best

site. Lee reports that dozens of votes were cast for some 25 sites. By 2003, the competition had

attracted nearly 6500 votes among 27 sites (Lee, 2004) Box 2 describes www.labourstart.org.

(4) Creating union campaigns: the AFL-CIO’s Working Families Network

       In 2002-2003 the AFL-CIO organized the development of what amounts to a massive

email list of union members and activists – the Working Families Network. Since member

unions feared that they would lose power by giving the central federation access to their email

directories, the AFL-CIO did not ask for such direct access. Instead, the affiliates kept control of

their own email lists and thus can accept or reject AFL-CIO sponsored email campaigns or those

of other organizations as it sees fit. If a union was e-mailing its list as part of a campaign and

feared that members would suffer from online campaign fatigue from AFL-CIO messages or if it

had a different view of a particular issue than the AFL-CIO, the union could veto the AFL-CIO

appeal. Organized in this way, the central federation was able to gain huge buy-in from affiliate

organizations and to encourage the affiliates to build their own activist lists. In summer 2004

the AFL-CIO had over 28 participating national unions, 84 geographically defined State

Federations and City Labor Councils, and over 400 local unions and other union organizations
                                                                                                   11
involved with its Family Network. There were more than 600 local administrators responsible

for particular lists. The overall network included over 2 million union “eActivists”. This large

number allowed the AFL-CIO to e-mail small proportions of the list and still engage large

numbers of persons, and to send localized appeals to particular areas. During the 2003 Safeway

strike in California, the AFL-CIO directly raised nearly $350,000 for the Safeway grocery

workers via two emails to 400,000 people on their main activist list.

       The large numbers also allows the AFL-CIO to link online appeal to offline activity in a

locality. To pressure management in the California Safeway strike, the AFL-CIO e-mailed

persons in the District of Columbia and asked them to join local teams to confront their local

Safeway stores, even though those stores were not on strike. Each person on the team was given

the email address and phone number of all the other people on their team, plus the local store

info. The success of this activity led the AFL-CIO to recruit volunteers from the eActivist list to

go door-to-door in targeted areas to talk to union members about the issues related to the 2004

national election – tapping a big network of activists who otherwise would not be involved in

local mobilization efforts.

       The AFL-CIO regards its email Working Families Network as a success. The former

director of Working Families wrote in July 2004 “The scope of this is overwhelming at times---I

checked this morning and there were 306 live online campaign sites in the system today, each

producing campaign messages by union activists, and also generating new list members through

tell-a-friend and related pages.” (Fox, 2004)

(5) Industrial disputes: the UK firefighters dispute web sites

       In November 2002, the UK Firefighters Brigade Union (FBU) struck over wages and

working conditions. The firefighters wanted a 40% pay increase to bring pay to £30,000 per year.
                                                                                                    12
The government offered much less and wanted productivity improvements through changes in

work conditions. The dispute continued through 2004, when the firefighters signed an agreement

for a smaller pay increase and disaffiliated from the Labour Party. Three union Web sites played

a role in the dispute: the FBU site, a TUC support site, and, a rank and file site set up by a

Manchester firefighter to allow members to discuss freely issues relating to the strike and union

policy.

          The FBU site, www.fbu.org.uk chronicled the dispute and efforts to negotiate its

resolution. It presented union policies and tactics to members but did not engage union members

in an interactive way. The TUC site http://www.tuc.org.uk/fp4f http://www.fire.org.uk was set up

to publicize a December demonstration in support of the firefighters. TUC officials reported that

the site received 40,000 visitors in the two weeks it operated and gave information to activists

around the country that helped make the demonstration a success. The site did not report any of

the misgivings that TUC leaders felt about the FBU’s strategy.

          The rank and file site, www.30KFirePay.org.uk (now defunct) provided space for

members to discuss the dispute without censoring views that might conflict with those of the

leadership. The site was put up rapidly at low cost and was of sufficiently high quality for labour

start users to vote it the 3rd best web site in 2002 in the annual labourstart poll of best labour web

sites.9 The militancy expressed on the rank and file site provided a more accurate view of the

feelings of firefighters about the dispute and the decisions made by their leadership and the

government than that given on the other union sites.10



9
  Labourstart.org runs an annual “beauty contest” in which users of the site vote on the best
labour web sites of the year. The number of participants voting in the contest has risen
substantially over time.
10
   Swedish unions have used the Internet to poll members during negotiations, while both the
                                                                                                 13
       These web sites did not produce victory for the firefighters in the dispute. Arguably, the

web sites had the opposite effect, feeding unrealistic expectations by members and reducing the

possibility of compromise at critical times. Still, the use of the Web to provide information to

union members and the general public during a strike and the rapid creation of the TUC and

rank-and-file temporary sites are likely to be imitated in future disputes.

6) Email Bulletins and Online Learning: TUC risk email bulletins.

       Beginning in 2002, the TUC sent a weekly e-bulletin, Risks: weekly health and safety

update, to union health and safety reps and others seeking information about occupational health

and safety issues. By 2004 some 8,000 people had signed up for the e-bulletin. Given the

success of the Risk e-bulletin, the TUC developed five other email bulletins for interested

representatives and workers.11 Taking web use a step further, the TUC’s education and training

division developed online training in health and safety to union representatives unable to

otherwise access classroom training, which it will launch in 2005 and follow with online courses

in other areas. In the pilot project that preceded the national launch, reps from smaller firms and

shift workers made up a disproportionate share of online course enrollees. Several individual

unions also offer online safety rep training for their members. Finally, the TUC also uses the

Internet to deliver training to union members (http://www.learningservices.org.uk).

III. Toward Open Source Unions

       “So I am asking you to authorize SEIU to create Purple Ocean, the world’s first “open
source,” virtual union -- with a goal of uniting one million more people who want to join our
campaigns for justice.” Andy Stern, President, Service Employees International Union, San


CWU and Connect have polled members regarding agreements with employers. See Bibby, p 7-
8
11
   These are: Changing Times News: Fortnightly work/life balance update; Education update: 3
times yearly newsletter; Equality news: monthly update; In ToUCh: the monthly TUC round-up;
International Development Matters; Organise!: bi-monthly update for union organisers
                                                                                                 14
Francisco California June 21, 2004 http://www.seiu2004.org/press/keynote.cfm

       The open source union form uses the Internet to provide information and services to

workers at low cost; makes the union web site a virtual union hall for supporters and activists to

exchange information and views; includes workers/supporters outside of collective bargaining as

union members; uses the interactive features of the Internet to increase union democracy; and

combines online Internet communities with offline activities in local areas to create a social

movement.

       The principal UK innovation in the open source direction has been the third of the TUC’s

sites mentioned earlier, www.unionreps.org.uk – a web site linking union representatives. The

principal US innovation have been a set of competing open source union forms for workers

outside of collective bargaining, of which the SEIU “purpleocean” site is the most recent.

(7) Strengthening union representatives: www.unionreps.org.uk

       In July 2003 the TUC established www.unionreps.org.uk to help union representatives

carry out their jobs around the country (TUC, 31 June 2003). The site contains bulletin boards,

email news for reps, a directory of online resources, a calendar of key events and training courses

for reps, and other features. The site is limited to union representatives from UK unions and the

TUC. While representatives are the face of unions in most workplaces, they are not union

officials but rather workers usually elected by their peers to help resolve workplace problems and

make collective agreements and unionism succeed. Some reps are health and safety specialists,

some are learning specialists, some specialise in defending workers against ill treatment by

management, and so on. Many representatives conduct union business on company time but

many work outside normal working hours. In 2004 there were approximately 230,000 union
                                                                                                   15
                           12
representatives in the UK.      The site reached 5,000 unique visitors in August 2004, so that it was

being used by approximately 5% of all reps and 10% of those likely to use the Internet.

       To see how union reps use the new site and the Internet more broadly in their work,

Freeman and Rehavi surveyed some 900 union representatives who underwent TUC training in

2003-2004 (regular reps) and some 400 users of the unionreps.org site. The sample of reps who

underwent classroom training are essentially a random group of local reps with respect to

Internet use. The majority of these reps reported that they used the Internet frequently, making it

clear that access and familiarity with the Web is no barrier to an open source form.13 By

construction, the users of the unionreps site are all Internet users and can be viewed as the union

reps of the potential open source future.

       Table 3A summarizes the survey responses regarding use of the Internet for

representative duties. The largest proportion of regular reps report that they used materials from

their representative training courses for their training, but a substantial proportion report using

the Internet as well. Representatives from the unionreps.org sample differ in one important way

from other union representatives: they make more extensive use of the Internet for their work.

Sixty-six percent of the unionreps.org users reported using the Internet “often” compared to 31%

of the other representatives. Modestly fewer unionreps.org representatives said that they relied

“often” on union officials and senior workers for information than the other representatives,

which implies that the Internet adds a source of information to a greater extent than it substitutes

for existing sources.

12
   Data from the 1998 WERS survey suggests that there were about 250,000 union reps in that
year. The TUC estimates 230,000 in 2004.
13
   Forty percent of the union reps said that they used the web daily, 20 percent reported using it 2-
3 times a week, whereas just 20 percent said that they either never used it or used it at most once
                                                                                                      16
        Item 2 in Table 3A compares representatives use of the Internet for their representative

work with their use of the Internet on their regular jobs and on other union activity. The regular

reps use the Internet approximately as much for representative work as for their other work or

union related activities. The users of the unionreps.org site use the Internet more widely for all

activities, but the difference is largest for their representative duties, which suggests that the site

again increases use of the Internet for that specific function.

        Which web sites did union reps visit often and how useful did they find those web sites?

Item 3 in Table 3A shows the responses to a question about how often per week users went to

their own union’s site, the TUC site, and the unionreps.org site. It shows that regular reps went

most frequently to their own union web site, fewer went to the TUC web site; and the fewest

went to the newly launched www.unionreps.org site. By contrast, 19% of the unionreps.org

users visited their own union site more than three times a week, but almost as many said they

went to the unionreps.org site. In terms of usefulness of the web sites, item 1 of Table 3B shows

that the regular reps scored the TUC as the most useful site and scored the new unionreps.org

site, with which most were barely acquainted, the lowest.14 By contrast, the unionreps.org

sample rated that site as the most useful to them, with the TUC site rated second and their own

union’s site rated third. Still, these unionreps.org users viewed all of the Internet sites as more

valuable than did the regular reps.

        For which issues do union reps use the Internet in their work?

        The survey question here allowed for multiple answers and item 2 in Table 3B shows that



a month.
14
   In fact, this sample was selected as a “before” sample for assessing the impact of the new site;
the regular reps were introduced to unionreps.org as part of their training. A follow-up survey
will assess their usage after training.
                                                                                                  17
most representatives use the Internet for more than one purpose. Among regular reps, the

average number of items cited was 4. Among unionreps.org users, the average number of items

cited (exclusive of the last item, which we asked only of those respondents) was 5.2. Among

both groups the most cited use was finding out about worker rights and employment legislation,

while the least cited uses of the Web were for keeping in touch with other unions and finding out

about pay and conditions elsewhere. The biggest gap in usage between the regular

representatives and the unionreps.org users was in the items about keeping in touch/exchanging

information with other union reps and with other unions/worker organizations. To the extent that

advice from a group of knowledgeable persons improves decisions (Surowiecki, 2004), the site

has the potential for harnessing the collective wisdom inherent in union organizations and thus

improving the ability of reps to provide union services at their workplace. Eighty percent of the

unionreps.org users said that the bulletin board, where they could interact with other reps or

follow discussions, was the most appealing feature.

        Finally, the last line in Table 3B gives what was the most surprising finding for us: that

69% of unionreps.org users used the Internet to communicate with the workers they represent.

On the (possibly mistaken belief) that very few regular reps were using the Internet to

communicate with the workers they represented, we did not ask that question in that sample.

However, the 1998 WERS survey did ask it: among the reps in the WERS in 1998 14% reported

using the Internet to communicate with the workers they represent.

(8) Open source union designs

       In 2001 three US unions had open source forms: www.alliance@ibm.org, an affiliate of

the communication workers union organized as a minority union at IBM; www.washtech.org/wt,

another communications workers affiliate based on IT workers in Northern California and
                                                                                            18
Washington; and the National Writers Union, an affiliate of the United Automobile Workers that

organizes free lance writers around the country (Diamond and Freeman 2002). Since then the

open source notion has expanded in the US (Box 4) and in other countries15 , though not yet in

the UK. I review US initiatives in two categories: jurisdictional-based organizations, in which

particular unions have sought to use open source designs to enroll workers outside of collective

bargaining; and national organizations, which seek to enroll members from almost any group,

just as the Knights of Labor did in the 1880s.

          The box highlights three jurisdiction-specific developments. First is the CWA’s

establishing www.techsunite.org as a national site for connecting IT workers. This extends the

CWA’s Washtech experience16 from the Washington state area to Oregon, and five other

geographic centers of IT work. That the union has chosen a geographic form rather than the

company based open source structure of www.alliance@IBM suggests that specific precipitating

events may be needed to create company based open source unions (the event at IBM was the

company’s change in its pension fund, which greatly reduced benefits for some workers).

Second, in November 2003, the Machinists established Cyberlodge (www.cyberlodge.org,) an

Internet based union for IT workers. The IAM (International Association of Machinists)

describes the organization as having a guild-like structure where workers retain their traditional

employee-employer relationship while enjoying benefits normally reserved for employees with

collective bargaining agreements. The box shows that the union offers personal benefits for a

    Bibby (2004) reports on French and Italian unions that have set up internet based
organizations to attract freelance and professional workers and on the creation of a Norwegian
form for self-employed workers, www.rom.no . Australian unions have formed www.itworkers-
alliance.org for IT workers.
16
     While initially developed without collective contracts, Washtech established collective
                                                                                                  19
$120 per year membership fee, but makes its main selling point the potential clout the workers

will have by associating with a relatively powerful union of skilled workers. Third, in 2004, the

Steelworkers also initiated a “new form of individual membership – open to anyone regardless of

employment” that gave services at modest dues and encouraged online enrollment, but the

Steelworkers have not yet developed a separate web site for this group of workers.

       The two national open source designs are a greater break with the tradition of organizing

by occupation or industry. In 2003 the AFL-CIO developed a “community affiliate” Working

America (www.workingamerica.org). Working America began by organizing members in local

neighborhoods, with a focus on community and national issues as opposed to problems at

workplaces (which affiliate unions might view as encroaching on their territory). Most of the

initial organizing was done via door-to-door canvassing. In Summer 2004, Working America

had offices in 10 cities in five states, and 400 staff people knocking on doors daily.17 It had

signed up some 500,000 members and anticipates having one million members by 2005. In

contrast to the associate membership scheme that the AFL-CIO encouraged affiliates to try with

minimal success prior to the Internet, Working America stress participation in a social

movement rather than savings by purchasing with a large group.

       But while the organization started through community organizing, it has put considerable

effort into email collection and online campaigns, centered around its web site. Working

America has been adopting many of the techniques that proved effective with the Working

Families Network and has used http://www.workingamerica.org/ online initiatives to build

membership. Its intent is to combine Internet communication with the door-to-door effort:


bargaining arrangements with a handful of very small IT firms through 2004.

                                                                                                      20
indeed it promises members that they will help determine policy through online ballots. In

summer 2004, when the Bush administration changed the administrative rules governing

overtime, WorkingAmerica added the “Is Your Overtime Pay at Risk?”page to its web site (see

Box 5), in which a lawyer responded to questions about the new regulations, and where the site

posted questions and responses from various workers and an FAQ.

       Finally, indicative of the future development of national unions, who have focused almost

exclusively on collective bargaining since the demise of the Knights of Labor in the early 1900s ,

the Service Employees International Union announced in summer 2004 an explicitly open source

design, www.purpleocean.org with the goal of enlisting 1 million members in the near future.18

Since SEIU is the most successful and innovative union in the US, increasing membership in the

1980s-1990s through smart organizing campaigns, its decision to develop an open source form

could have immense spillover effects on the entire US labour movement.

       There are unresolved design issues in open source unionism. The AFL-CIO started its

organization with off-line organizing. SEIU has started on-line. Which will work better?

Alliance at IBM is firm-based. Washtech is occupation based. Which will work better? But

arguably the most important design issue is how to link online and offline activities. As a

collective group, unions need members’ trust and commitment, which presumably requires that

members get together at least sometimes in the real world. The website www.meetup.com

organizes local gatherings of people brought together by a common interest on the web under

the slogan ”Real world, face-to-face, maybe over coffee or a beer”. At this writing, none of the




discusses the AFL-CIO effort.

open source unions uses the meetup structure for taking online linkages to the real world. Given

the cost of meetings, it is critical for open source unions to determine how many face to face

meetings suffice to create the personal links necessary for a viable open source organization.

Conclusion

       When I began this essay, I expected to conclude by explaining why unions were slow

adaptors to the Internet. It was because they were democratic organizations that operated

according to median member principles; were risk averse with members’ money; operated in a

market with low entry and exit; and were run by conservative bureaucracies, per the Robert

Michels’ 1915 analysis of oligarchic tendencies in organisations.

       The preceding review of union responses to the Internet as of the mid 2000s has forced

me to scrap this conclusion. Unions may have adapted less rapidly than firms to the Internet, but

even so unions are innovating and experimenting with the Internet at unparalleled rates. The

TUC and major UK unions are experimenting with diverse ways to strengthen unionism through

the Internet. Having discovered that organizing through normal channels has not delivered the

renascence of unionism that they had hoped, the AFL-CIO and major US unions are probing the

open source design to see if it can produce greater support and membership. These efforts will

expand in breadth and depth. In the UK the formation of works councils will induce the TUC and

member unions to provide online services to councils, many of whom may be majority nonunion.

In both countries unions will continue to improve the content of their web sites; construct email

lists of members, find ways to link online and offline activity; create more options for workers to

join on-line; and personalize services to members. Activists will connect on the Web

  Union activists use the meetup site to organize some meetings, such as an international union
organizers meeting on July 21, 2004 (http://unionorganizers.meetup.com).

independently of union officials and develop web sites to press for more democratic and

transparent procedures.

       These changes will profoundly affect union membership and density. Historically,

unionism has never developed smoothly. In virtually all advanced economies, growth in

membership has occurred in great spurts, with new union forms and new groups of workers

leading the way (Freeman, 1996). The opportunity to deliver union services to workers through

the Internet and other new technologies combined with the necessity of finding new forms and

modes of operation has spurred the kind of creativity and experimentation necessary to produce a

new spurt. From this experimentation, some open source form may find the “killer application”

service to workers and mix of on-line and off-line activities for the next union spurt.

Box 2: About LabourStart: “Where trade unionists start their day on the net”.
LabourStart is an online news service maintained by a global network of volunteers which aims
to serve the international trade union movement by collecting and disseminating information -- and
by assisting unions in campaigning and other ways.
Its features include daily labour news links in 11 languages and a news syndication service used
by more than 500 trade union websites. News is collected from mainstream, trade union, and
alternative news sources by a network of over 230 volunteer correspondents based on every
continent.
LabourStart has been involved in online campaigning for several years but moved up a gear with
the launch in July 2002 of the ActNOW campaigning system. Tens of thousands of trade
unionists have participated in its various online campaigns and more than 15,000 are currently
subscribed to its mailing list. They receive weekly mailings, usually on Thursdays.

Box 3: The AFL-CIO Working Families Network: Campaign for Overtime pay, 2003


        The Working Families Network is an AFL-CIO created email list of 2 million union
activists and supporters that the union movement uses to generate community support in important
labor disputes and to press. In winter 2003, the Federation was campaigning to prevent Congress
from weakening overtime legislation and remove overtime pay, particularly for white collar
workers. The Families Network sent an email to their eActivist list asking people to carry out a
complicated series of steps: click on a link in an email; which goes to a web page; where they
would download a pdf petition form related to overtime; which they then printed on their home
printer; then carried the petition to their workplace; where they were asked to sign up co-workers;
and finally to fax the completed petition form to the AFL-CIO office in DC (a long distance fax).
       The administrator of the program wrote that “We figured that no one would really do this
because it was so many steps and required many things (printer, Adobe acrobat reader, fax
machine, etc). Somewhat incredibly, we received petition forms in our office with over 180,000
names and addresses, including more than 50,000 new email addresses. We probably had more
come in, but our fax machines ran continuously for an entire week and were often blocked. My
phone rings one day and there' s this guy with a heavy Southern accent on the line calling to ask if I
was part of the Working Families Network. He was an union member who worked in a nuclear
power plant in Tennessee, and he had signed up 250 of his co-workers onto the petitions, but
couldn't get through on the fax machine. Amazing! “

Box 4: Newest Open Source Union Experiments


Jurisdictional based experiments
Communications Workers Union Techs Unite (www.techsunite.org) Following on its
experience with washtech (www.washtech.org), the CWA developed techsunite as a national site
for IT workers around the country, with organizing groups in 7 different geographic areas. Oregon
IT workers set up their own organization, www.ortech.org, with $24/year dues payable through the
CWA Local 7901 Associate Member program. Each organizing committee is geographically
centered, rather than company centered.

International Association of Machinists CyberLodge: An Open Source Union Project
(www.cyberlodge.org). Organized over web: a guild-like structure where workers retain their
traditional employee-employer relationship while enjoying benefits normally reserved for
employees with collective bargaining agreements”. One-year charter membership of $120 gives
access to portable health insurance free web hosting, and other benefits “But the most important
benefit is power - the ability to influence the movers and shakers who affect our working lives.”

United Steel Workers: (www.uswa.org/am) – New Form of Associate Membership
“A new form of individual membership in our union – open to anyone regardless of where they
work or even if they have a job! We hope this program will revolutionize the American union
movement and fundamentally alter how the American people think about unions and belonging to
them”. Membership at $40 per year; online recruitment “ get access to union-only benefits like
confidential workplace assistance, health care savings, job training and educational opportunities”

of 2004


SEIU – Purple Ocean open source union www.purpleocean.org Formed 2004 Goal is to
enroll 1 million members into non-collective bargaining organization. “PurpleOcean.org is the
latest wave of the American labor movement. Through actions, both online and offline, we seek to
ensure fundamental human rights in the workplace and ensure that workers here and abroad are
treated with dignity. By building a powerful grassroots network dedicated to social justice,
PurpleOcean.org members will “spotlight” employers and politicians who respect workers and
“hotlight” those who don’t. In addition to direct action, PurpleOcean.org will be a place for fun
discussions and education, where workers and their allies can debate and discuss today’s
paramount issues——from outsourcing and offshoring to health care and pensions.”
