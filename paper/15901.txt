This chapter assesses how models with search frictions have shaped our understanding of aggregate
labor market outcomes in two contexts: business cycle fluctuations and long-run (trend) changes. We
first consolidate data on aggregate labor market outcomes for a large set of OECD countries. We then
ask how models with search improve our understanding of these data. Our results are mixed. Search
models are useful for interpreting the behavior of some additional data series, but search frictions per
se do not seem to improve our understanding of movements in total hours at either business cycle frequencies
or in the long-run. Still, models with search seem promising as a framework for understanding how
different wage setting processes affect aggregate labor market outcomes.

   In the last two decades, macroeconomists have increasingly used search theory to model
the labor market. The macro-search literature is now sufficiently developed to make it
meaningful to assess how integrating search theory into otherwise standard aggregate models
affects the analysis of macroeconomic outcomes.1 Although search models have been used to
address a wide variety of macroeconomic issues, we focus on two: short-run (business cycle)
and long-run (trend) changes in aggregate labor market outcomes.
   There is a hierarchy of ways in which search may be important for macroeconomic models:

   1. New data: Search models draw our attention to empirical regularities and new data
       sets that we would typically ignore in a model without search frictions. One example
       is unemployment. In a search model, we can define unemployment in a manner that
       conforms with statistical agencies’ usage: a worker is unemployed if she is not working,
       available for work, and actively seeking work. Models without search can at best hope
       to distinguish employment from non-employment, but are silent on the distinction be-
       tween unemployed and inactivity (out of the labor force). A second example is worker
       flows. Search models make predictions about the movement of workers between em-
       ployment, unemployment, and inactivity, and between employers. They can therefore
       be used to understand the great variety of empirical facts about job and worker flows
       that economists have developed during the last two decades.2

   2. Search behavior: Search itself may play a special role in understanding the behavior
      of some aspects of the economy that are routinely studied in models without search,
       including total hours, employment, and wages. For example, employment may be low
       in some circumstances because employed workers are losing their jobs at a high rate.
       Alternatively, it may be low because unemployed workers are either not searching very
       intensively or are adopting very high reservation wages. Neither of these possibilities
       is easily explored in a model without search frictions. Search may also lead to new
       shocks, act to somehow amplify the effect of a given set of shocks to the economy, or,
       because of the slow adjustment of employment, propagate shocks through time.

   3. Match-specific rents: Search models naturally give rise to match-specific rents.3 This
       in turn implies that, even if workers and firms exploit all the bilateral gains from

      We do not intend this chapter to be a comprehensive survey, but rather a critical assessment of the state
of the literature. The standard treatment of search models remains Pissarides (2000). See also Mortensen
and Pissarides (1999a,b) and Rogerson, Shimer and Wright (2005) for recent surveys of the labor-search
literature.

      trade, wages are not uniquely determined by competitive forces. This richer set of
      possibilities for wage setting may be important in accounting for the behavior of total
      hours, employment, and wages. Although search is not the only source of match-specific
      rents, there is something distinctive about search: rents exist at the initial meeting
      of the worker and the firm, and so cannot be contracted away. Other mechanisms
      that generate match-specific rents, such as match-specific human capital and private
      information, only produce rents after the match has been formed.

In this chapter, we first consolidate a variety of evidence on both short run and long changes
in labor market aggregates and labor market flows in the United States and other OECD
countries. We then assess the ability of search models to explain this evidence. In both
contexts, it is clear that search models are useful for understanding empirical regularities in
unemployment and labor market flows. Beyond this, our assessment is mixed.
    In the business cycle context, we argue that the existence of search frictions does not
directly improve our understanding of how labor markets function. Three long-standing
issues in business cycle research concern the amplitude, persistence, and source of fluctuations
in hours and employment. Consider first the question of why employment is so volatile.
Search seems a promising avenue for answering this because, at least in the United States,
most of the fluctuations in employment at business cycle frequencies come from workers
moving between employment and unemployment. Indeed, an increase in unemployment
is often seen as the hallmark of a recession, while cyclical movements in and out of the
labor force are comparatively small. But we find that, relative to a frictionless version of
the real business cycle model with indivisible labor (Hansen, 1985), the presence of search
frictions actually moderates the optimal extent of fluctuations in employment. Intuitively,
search frictions act like an adjustment cost on labor and so firms fire fewer workers during
downturns to avoid costly rehiring during the subsequent boom. Because search acts as
an adjustment cost, it is intuitive that it serves to increase persistence. However, we find
this increase to be quantitatively unimportant. Regarding the issue of what shocks cause
business cycles, search models naturally give rise to an additional source of shocks relative to
frictionless models: shocks to match separation probabilities. In this view, recessions might
result from shocks that cause lots of existing matches to break up. Nonetheless, we find little
scope for these types of shocks to account for a large share of employment fluctuations, at
least in the United States.
  On the other hand, recent research suggests that there is substantial scope for search
models to improve our understanding of business cycle fluctuations by providing a framework
for the analysis of alternative wage determination processes. Whereas the solution to a
social planner’s problem in a search framework does not seem to resolve any issues regarding

                                               2
business cycle fluctuations in the labor market, decentralized search models with different
wage setting rules can improve upon their frictionless counterparts. We conclude that in
the business cycle context, the main substantive contribution of search models relies on the
presence of match specific rents and the opportunity for a richer set of wage setting processes.
   Our analysis of long-run changes in labor market outcomes similarly leads to mixed
conclusions. First, while there are substantial trend changes in relative unemployment levels
across countries over time, they are still small compared with the long run decrease in hours
per worker and the increase in labor force participation. From this we conclude that search
frictions are unlikely to be of first-order importance in understanding long-run changes in
total hours of work.
   However, even if changes in unemployment are not a dominant source of differences in
total hours, search theory may still help us understand these changes. A key feature of
the data is that countries exhibit very different flows into and out of unemployment, even
when unemployment rates are the same. Search theory is useful for assessing the role of
various factors that account for these differences and how they assist us in understanding
why unemployment rates have changed over time.
    The direct role of search in this context remains somewhat unclear. Some research
attributes an important role to how workers change their search intensity and reservation
wage in response to various changes in the economic environment. But similar to recent
work on business cycle fluctuations, other research attributes the most important role to
how wages respond to changes in the economic environment. In these models the key role of
search is to give rise to match specific rents and permit a richer set of wage responses.
   An outline of the chapter follows. Section 1 focuses on business cycle fluctuations. It
begins by summarizing key business cycle facts regarding total hours, employment, unem-
ployment, and worker flows. While the emphasis is on data for the United States, we also
report comparable statistics for a range of OECD economies where available. We then
present a benchmark business cycle model with search frictions and assess the ability of this
model to account for the key facts relative to the frictionless equivalent. To make the models
comparable, in both cases we focus on a social planner’s solution, which can be decentralized
through a particular assumption on wage setting. We show that search frictions per se do
not improve the fit between model and data. The section closes by describing recent work
which considers alternative wage-setting assumptions and has been better able to account
for the business cycle facts.
   Section 2 focuses on long-run changes in labor market outcomes. It begins by document-
ing trend changes in unemployment for a large set of OECD economies. It then compares
these evolutions with evolutions for total hours, participation, hours per worker, and worker


                                               3
flows. We then summarize the literature that has developed to help explain the variation in
long-run unemployment changes across countries, and describe in detail two recent models
that feature search and provide explanations for these evolutions.
   Section 3 concludes by summarizing our key findings and describing what we see as some
open questions surrounding the role of search in macroeconomics. We also briefly mention
more microeconomic issues in the labor market, such as the evolution of individual workers’
wages and employment, where search has proven fruitful.


1     Cyclical Fluctuations
This section explores the ability of search models to explain the behavior of labor markets
at business cycle frequencies. We break our analysis into three parts, mirroring the three
ways that search may be important for macroeconomic models. First we update and extend
labor market facts in an earlier volume of this Handbook (Lilien and Hall, 1986), highlighting
the connection between those facts and the structure of search-and-matching models. We
argue that search models offer a useful framework for understanding data sets that we would
typically ignore in a model without frictions. We then introduce a model that integrates
search theory and standard business cycle theory. To keep the comparison clean, we first
focus on the solution to a social planner’s problem, and so initially abstract from alternative
assumptions on wage setting. We find that search itself does not resolve important puzzles
in business cycle analysis, including the nature of shocks and their amplification and propa-
gation. The final part of this section summarizes recent developments that emphasize wage
rigidities in search models, a possibility that naturally arises due to the match-specific rents.
It appears that such models may be important for accounting for the standard business cycle
puzzles.


1.1    Facts
We begin our analysis by confirming that in the United States and most other OECD
countries, most cyclical fluctuations in hours worked are accounted for by changes in the
employment-population ratio. Moreover, especially in the United States, the labor force
participation rate is nearly constant, so that cyclical decreases in employment are associated
with roughly equal increases in unemployment. We then consider the gross inflow and out-
flow of workers from unemployment, showing that recessions are characterized by a sharp
spike in the inflow rate and a larger and much more persistent decline in the outflow rate.
We also show that the fraction of employed workers switching jobs is countercyclical, so re-


                                               4
cessions, and the initial recovery from them, are characterized by an economic environment
in which it is hard to find a job. This is consistent with an aggregate matching function,
where the probability that a worker finds a new job is increasing in the aggregate vacancy-
unemployment ratio. Finally, we document the existence and countercyclicality of the labor
wedge, a wedge between the marginal rate of substitution of consumption and leisure and
the marginal product of labor. All of this evidence suggests that recessions and the early
stages of recoveries are periods when workers’ labor supply is constrained by the difficulty
of finding a job. Search theory offers a natural framework for understanding why this may
happen.

1.1.1     Hours, Employment, and Unemployment

Lilien and Hall (1986) decompose fluctuations in total hours worked into changes in employ-
ment and changes in hours worked per employed worker. They dismissed the relevance of
search theory for explaining fluctuations in employment in the United States in part because
“it has nothing to say about the shift of labor resources from employment to non-market
activities that is an important part of the cycle.” (Lilien and Hall, 1986, p. 1032) We up-
date their study using data from 1976Q3 to 2009Q3 for and a more comprehensive measure
of hours. In contrast to the earlier chapter, we find that movements in and out of the labor
force are relatively unimportant at business cycle frequencies in the United States. But in
some other OECD countries, we find that fluctuations in hours per worker and movements
in and out of the labor force play are an important part of changes in total hours at business
cycle frequencies.
   For the United States, we use a quarterly series for hours worked per person aged 16 to
64 (hereafter total hours) and for the fraction of people at work, constructed following the
procedure described in Cociuba, Prescott and Ueberfeldt (2009).4 To focus on cyclical fluc-
tuations, we detrend the data using a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with the usual smoothing
parameter 1600; the second part of this chapter looks at trends. Cociuba et al. extend these
series back to 1959 using data that are not available online. Since the rest of our data series
   4
     The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) constructs the underlying data series from the Current Population
Survey (CPS). We first construct a monthly series for total hours, defined as the number of people at work
(CPS series LNU02005053) times average hours per person at work (LNU02005054) divided by the population
aged 16–64 (difference between LNU00000000 and LNU00000097), all available online since 1976Q3. We
construct the monthly series for the fraction of people at work analogously. We seasonally adjust the
monthly data using the Census X11 algorithm and then take quarterly averages. Following Cociuba et al., if
in one month the measure of total hours is less than 96 percent of that quarter’s average, we drop the month
and average the remaining two months. We need this correction because the CPS measures hours worked
during a reference week, the week including the 12th day of the month. As a result, measured hours worked
are low in September during years when the Labor Day holiday falls on Monday, September 7: 1981, 1987,
1992, 1998, and 2009.

are not available before 1976, we restrict attention to this shorter time period here.
   The solid and dashed lines in Figure 1 show the strong comovement between detrended
hours and employment. The standard deviation of detrended total hours is 1.5 percent, while
the standard deviation of the fraction of people at work is 1.0 percent and the correlation
between the two series is 0.96. We thus conclude that, as was the case in the earlier period,
“the biggest component of the variation in hours is fluctuations in the level of employment.”
(Lilien and Hall, 1986, p. 1006)
    On the other hand, there is little change in the size of the labor force at business cycle
frequencies, as shown by the dotted line in Figure 1.5 The standard deviation of the de-
trended labor force participation rate is 0.3 percent and the correlation with total hours is
0.67. For example, during the worst year of the 2008–2009 recession, from August 2008 until
August 2009, total hours fell by 7.5 log points, the fraction of the population at work fell
by 4.9 log points, while the size of the labor force fell by only 0.9 log points.6 Most of the
   5
     We measure the labor force participation rate as the number of employed people (LNU02000000) plus
unemployed people (LNU03000000) divided by the population aged 16–64. We seasonally adjust and detrend
the data in the same way.
   6
     Recall from footnote 4 that hours data from September 2009 are low because of the timing of the


                                                  6
decline in total hours thus came from a decrease in employment, which was associated with
a roughly equal increase in the unemployment rate. In contrast to the conclusions of Lilien
and Hall (1986), recent data show that the size of the labor force is a secondary factor at
business cycle frequencies in the United States.
   Although the first part of this chapter is mainly focused on United States business cycle
facts, we comment briefly on the extent to which these facts carry over to other advanced
economies. Using OECD data on employment, unemployment, hours, and population in 17
countries from 1965 to 2008, we construct annual measures of total hours, hours per worker,
the employment-population ratio, and the labor force participation rate.7 We detrend these
series using an HP filter with parameter 100, analogous to the 1600 we use elsewhere for
quarterly data.
   We start by looking at the standard deviation of the cyclical component of total hours. In
the United States, this is 0.018 using annual data from 1965 to 2008, while the average across
17 OECD countries is slightly larger, 0.020. Figure 2 shows that there is some variation in
this measure of volatility; in particular, Finland (FI), Portugal (PT), and Spain (ES) are
substantially more volatile than the United States.
   Figure 3 decomposes fluctuations in total hours by showing the relative standard de-
viation of hours per worker and the employment-population ratio. The United States is
fairly typical, with a relative standard deviation 0.6, so employment accounts for most of the
volatility in total hours.8 The average across the 17 countries in our sample is even lower,
0.54, although this masks a significant amount of heterogeneity. For example, in France
(FR) and Japan (JP), hours are more volatile than the employment-population ratio, and
so ignoring the hours margin would seem to be a more serious omission for those countries.
    Digging a bit deeper, Figure 4 plots the correlation between total hours and each of its
two components, the employment-population ratio and hours per worker. The correlation
Labor Day holiday. From September 2008 to September 2009, measured total hours fell by 13.2 log points,
employment fell by 5.5 log points, and labor force participation by 1.2 log points.
    7
      Data for civilian employment, population aged 15-64, unemployment, and unemployment durations all
come from the OECD Database. Data for annual hours per worker in employment are from the Groningen
Growth and Development Centre (GGDC). The countries (and country codes) we use in this paper are
Australia (AU), Belgium (BE, 1965–2007), Canada (CA), Denmark (DK), Finland (FI), France (FR, 1965–
2007), Germany (DE), Ireland (IE), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Norway (NO), Portugal (PT, 1970–2008), Spain
(ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), United Kingdom (UK), and United States (US). German data are
for West Germany prior to 1991 and for all of Germany starting in 1991. The sample is dictated by data
availability in the OECD Database for (most of) the period since 1965.

      Note that the United States numbers we report here are not identical to the numbers we reported earlier.
The time periods are different, the frequency of the data is different, and the underlying data sources are
different.

between total hours and the employment-population ratio is 0.95 in the United States, and
the correlation between total hours and hours per worker is 0.86. This same pattern does not
hold in all OECD countries. While the employment-population ratio is strongly correlated
with total hours everywhere, with a correlation of 0.87 on average, hours per worker is
not, with an average correlation 0.48. Moreover, the correlation between the employment-
population ratio and hours per worker is 0.66 in the United States, while the OECD average
correlation is nearly zero, 0.05. This reinforces our earlier conclusion that fluctuations in
hours per worker are not a dominant source of fluctuations in total hours at business cycle
frequencies in most countries.
    As previously noted, France and Japan are two prominent outliers. Not only are hours per
worker more volatile than the employment-population ratio, the correlation between hours
per worker and total hours is higher than the correlation between the employment-population
ratio and total hours. Whether this reflects institutional features of these countries, such as
legislated changes in the length of the workweek in France, remains an open question.
    Finally, Figure 5 examines the cyclical component of labor force participation. Here the
United States is somewhat atypical. In the United States, the correlation between labor force
participation and the employment-population ratio is 0.68 and the standard deviation of la-
bor force participation is 0.38 times the standard deviation of the employment-population

ratio. The relative standard deviation is higher in every other country except Spain. An
extreme example is Switzerland (CH), where there is essentially no diference between the
standard deviation of total hours (1.80 log points), the employment-population ratio (1.84),
and the labor force participation rate (1.74). Moreover, the pairwise correlation between
the employment-population ratio and labor force participation rate is almost perfect. For
Switzerland, most of the cyclical movement in total hours is accounted for by movements
between nonparticipation and employment at a fixed number of hours per worker, and so a
sharp focus only on movements between unemployment and employment would be inappro-
priate.

1.1.2   Unemployment Inflows and Outflows

Starting with Blanchard and Diamond (1990), a large literature has documented distinct
cyclical patterns in the gross flow of workers between employment and unemployment. We
show here that recessions are typically characterized by a sharp, short-lived increase in the
inflow rate of workers from employment into unemployment and a large, prolonged decline in
the outflow rate of workers from unemployment into employment. Search models are useful
for making sense of these empirical regularities.


                                             10
    We divide our analysis of gross worker flows into several pieces. To start, we focus on the
flow of workers between unemployment and employment, deferring our analysis of inactivity
(out of the labor force) until the next subsetion. This abstraction enables us to construct
measures of worker flows directly from publicly-available unemployment duration data. We
later show that the main insights we develop here carry over to a framework that accounts
for the large gross flows in and out of the labor force.
    The motivation for our measurement of gross flows comes from search theory. The sim-
plest version of the Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) search-and-matching model has a fixed
labor force and a recursive structure in which the rate at which an unemployed worker finds a
job, f (t), depends on preferences, technology, and the state of the economy, but not directly
on current unemployment u(t) or employment e(t). Unemployment and employment then
evolve in continuous time according to

                               u̇(t) = x(t)e(t) − f (t)u(t) = −ė(t),

where x(t) is the (often exogenous) rate at which a worker exits employment for unemploy-
ment.
    Our procedure for measuring the unemployment inflow rate x(t) and outflow rate f (t)
follows Shimer (2007). Since actual data are available at discrete time intervals, once a
month in the United States, we define the job finding probability Ft as the probability that
a worker who starts month t unemployed finds a job within the month. Let u<1     t+1 be the
number unemployed with duration less than one month. Then the job finding probability is

                                                  ut+1 − u<1
                                                          t+1
                                       Ft = 1 −               .                                   (1)
                                                       ut

The term ut+1 −u<1 t+1 is the number unemployed for over one month in month t+1. Dividing by
ut gives the fraction of the workers who failed to find a job during month t, 1 − Ft . Assuming
that the job finding rate f (t) is constant during the month, Shimer (2007) proves that
Ft ≡ 1 − e−f (t) , giving us the probability in the continuous time model that an unemployed
worker finds at least one job during the month. Similarly, one can compute Xt ≡ 1 − e−x(t) ,
the probability that an employed worker loses at least one job during the month.
   Using publicly available data, we can construct these series since 1948 in the United
States.9 The solid line in the top panel of Figure 6 shows our series for the job finding
  9
    The BLS constructs the underlying data series from the CPS and seasonally adjusts it using the X12
algorithm. We use data on employment (LNS12000000), unemployment (LNS13000000), and unemployment
with duration 0 to 4 weeks (LNS13008396), where the latter is our proxy for the number unemployed
with duration less than one month. The redesign of the CPS instrument in 1994 significantly altered



                                                  11
probability, i.e., the outflow rate from unemployment.10 The cyclical patterns are clear: this
series rises during expansions and falls sharply during recessions. For example, during the
2008–2009 recession the job finding probability fell from 41 percent to 21 percent per month.
The solid line in the bottom panel shows the employment exit probability, i.e., the inflow rate
into unemployment. Here one sees a sharp, short-lived spike during most recessions. During
the 2008–2009 recession, it initially rose from 2.7 to 4.3 percent per month but has since
fallen back to its baseline level. The general picture is one where spikes in the unemployment
inflow rate drive part of the initial increase in unemployment during most downturns, but
a persistently low job finding probability explains why unemployment remains high during
the subsequent recovery (Fujita and Ramey, 2009).
   Elsby, Hobijn and Şahin (2008) extend this methodology to construct measures of Ft
and Xt for fourteen OECD countries. They verify that the job finding probability accounts
for most of the volatility in the unemployment rate in most Anglo-Saxon countries (the
United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), but find an equally important role
for the employment exit probability in most other OECD countries, including the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. Like Fujita and Ramey (2009), they also stress that
the employment exit probability is contemporaneous with the unemployment rate, while the
job finding probability lags the cycle slightly.

1.1.3    Three-State Model

There are interesting patterns in the flow of workers in and out of the labor force as well.
During recessions, unemployed workers are not only less likely to find a job, but also less
likely to drop out of the labor force. Employed workers are not only more likely to become
unemployed, they are also less likely to drop out of the labor force. Similarly, inactive workers
are more likely to become unemployed and less likely to find a job.
   To show this, we measure gross worker flows in the United States using the monthly
microeconomic data from the CPS.11 The survey is constructed as a rotating panel, with
the measurement of unemployment duration (Abraham and Shimer, 2001). Prior to 1994, workers were
asked their unemployment duration whenever they were unemployed. After the redesign, the unemployment
duration of workers who are unemployed in consecutive months is incremented by the length of the intervening
time interval. To obtain a consistent series, we use the underlying microeconomic data to construct a series
for short-term unemployment for workers in the “incoming rotation groups,” i.e., workers who are asked
about unemployment duration directly because they were not in the survey in the previous month. We
seasonally adjust this data using the X11 algorithm and splice it with the official series that is available
before 1994.

     Note that because the trends are small, we show Figures 6–10 in levels rather than detrended.

individuals in it for four consecutive months. This means that it is theoretically possible
to match up to three-quarters of the respondents between consecutive surveys, although in
practice, coding errors modestly reduce the matching rate.12 We then measure gross worker
flows between labor market states A and B in month t as the number of individuals with
employment status A in month t − 1 and B in month t. This yields an updated version of
the gross flows data that Blanchard and Diamond (1990) analyzed.
   We manipulate this data in two ways. First, consistent with our earlier analysis, we
focus on the probability that a worker switches states in a given month, rather than the
total number of workers switching states—i.e., transition probabilities, rather than gross
worker flows. Second we adjust the data to account for time-aggregation (Shimer, 2007).
To understand why this adjustment may be important, suppose an inactive worker becomes
unemployed and finds a new job within a month. We would record this as an IE transition,
rather than an IU and a UI transition. Similarly, a worker may reverse an EU transition
within the month, and so the job loss may disappear from the gross flows entirely. Both of
these events are more likely when unemployment duration is shorter.13
    To proceed, let λAB
                     t   denote the Poisson arrival rate of a shock that moves a worker from
state A ∈ {E, U, I} to state B 6= A during month t, assumed to be constant within the
month. Also let nABt (τ ) denote the fraction of workers who were in state A at the start of
month t and are in state B at time t + τ for τ ∈ [0, 1]. Since λAB
                                                                t  is constant during the
month, this satisfies an ordinary differential equation

      We do not adjust the data for classification error and missing observations. Abowd and Zellner (1985)
and Poterba and Summers (1986) show that misclassification in one survey creates a significant number of
spurious flows. For example, Poterba and Summers (1986) show that only 74 percent of individuals who
are reported as unemployed during the survey reference week in an initial interview are still counted as
unemployed when they are asked in a followup interview about their employment status during the original
survey reference week; 10 percent are measured as employed and 16 percent are inactive. In their pioneering
study of gross worker flows, Blanchard and Diamond (1990) used Abowd and Zellner’s (1985) corrected data,
based on an effort by the BLS to reconcile the initial and followup interviews. Regrettably it is impossible to
update this approach to the present because the BLS no longer reconciles these interviews (Frazis, Robison,
Evans and Duff, 2005). Still, some corrections are possible. For example, the change in employment between
months t and t + 1 should in theory be equal to the difference between the flow into and out of employment.
Fujita and Ramey (2009) adjust the raw gross worker flow data so as to minimize this discrepancy, as
discussed in the unpublished working version of their paper. This does not substantially change the results
we emphasize here.
   13
      Our analysis of the two-state model also implicitly accounted for time-aggregation. This is because u<1
                                                                                                            t+1
measures the share of unemployed workers with current duration less than one month, not the share of
unemployed workers who were employed in the previous month. No such measure is available in the gross
flows data.

we invert this mapping numerically.14
    The dashed line in the top of Figure 6 compares the resulting three-state UE transition
probability with the two-state job finding probability. The cyclical behavior of the two series
is remarkably similar during the overlapping time periods, even though their levels are off by
about 50 percent. The bottom panel shows that the EU transition probability likewise tracks
the employment exit probability Xt , although the former is noticeably more volatile than
the latter. This validates the abstraction to a two-state model for the purposes of studying
United States business cycles.
   Figure 7 shows transitions between all three states. Our discussion focuses on the 2008–
2009 recession, although similar patterns appear in most previous recessions. The top left
panel again shows the EU transition probability. From the end of 2007 to the first quarter of
2009, it rose from 1.6 to 2.3 percent per month and subsequently fell back to 2.1 percent by
the third quarter of 2009. On the other hand, the top right panel indicates that employed
workers were less likely to drop out of the labor force during the recession; the probability
declined from 2.8 to 2.4 percent per month by the end of the sample, so the overall probability
of exiting employment scarcely changed. The second row shows the probability of exiting
unemployment. In this case, the decline in the UE transition probability, from 30.7 percent
to 18.8 percent during the 2008–2009 recession, was reinforced by a decline in the probability
of dropping out of the labor force, which fell fell from 28.5 to 22.1 percent. Similarly, the
figure shows that inactive workers were less likely to move directly into employment and more
likely to move into unemployment during the recession, further increasing the unemployment
rate.
   There are few comparable measures of gross worker flows in other developed economies.
This appears to be a data limitation. For example, Burda and Wyplosz (1994) construct a
measure of flows into and out of unemployment for France, Germany, Spain, and the United
Kingdom. They use data on new registrations at unemployment offices in the first three

    If the eigenvalues of the discrete time Markov transition matrix are all positive, real, and distinct, the
instantaneous transition rates are uniquely determined. In practice, this is the case in the United States.

countries and the Labor Force Survey in the United Kingdom. Thus only the last series is
comparable with the methodology we describe here. They uncover significant volatility in
the number of workers entering and exiting unemployment in the United Kingdom, although
the movements are uncorrelated with their preferred cyclical indicator, capacity utilization.
Ponomareva and Sheen (2009) develop a four-state model for Australia by distinguishing
between part-time and full-time employment. Using data since 1981, they confirm that
the job finding probability falls sharply during recessions but also find sharp and persis-
tent increases in the full-time employment to unemployment transition probability during
recessions, particularly for men.

1.1.4   Employer-to-Employer Transitions

Although most job search models assume that only unemployed workers can find jobs, some
newer models recognize that many workers move from employer-to-employer (EE) without
experiencing an unemployment spell. Most of these papers focus on individual wage dy-
namics (e.g., Burdett and Mortensen, 1998; Postel-Vinay and Robin, 2002), with only a few
papers examining whether EE transitions are important for understanding business cycle
fluctuations (Nagypál, 2007; Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2008; Menzio and Shi, 2009).
    Here we simply update a measure of the EE transition rate pioneered by Fallick and
Fleischman (2004). Since the 1994 redesign of the CPS, respondents who are employed in
consecutive months are asked “Last month, it was reported that you worked for x. Do you
still work for x (at your main job)?” We use the fraction of employed workers who answer
this question negatively, weighted by the CPS final weights, to compute the empirical EE
transition rate. A potential shortcoming of this method is that no individual is permitted to
experience multiple EE movements within a month, a possibility that may be non-negligible
when the job finding rate is high. A more significant issue is that the short sample period
limits any analysis of the cyclical behavior of this time series.
   With these caveats, Figure 8 shows this measure of the EE transition probability. Most
noticeable is the secular decline in the rate, which is in part explained by the aging of the
United States labor force (Shimer, 2007). When it was first constructed, about 3.5 percent of
workers reported switching jobs within the month, significantly higher than the EU transition
probability. That number fell to 2.5 percent during the expansion from 2002 to 2007 and fell
further during the subsequent recession, reaching 1.8 percent in the third quarter of 2009,
somewhat below the EU transition probability. The figure suggests that the secular decline
in the EE transition probability accelerates during downturns, so employed workers are less
likely to switch jobs in an adverse labor market. Again, this is consistent with the evidence

from gross worker flows that it is hard to find a job during downturns.
   Mazumder (2007) uses data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
to construct a longer time series for the employer-to-employer transition probability, from
1983 to 2003. He finds a sharp increase in the series as the United States economy emerged
from the 1982–1983 recession and a trough around the 1991 and 2001 recessions. This affirms
that workers switch jobs at a higher rate during booms.
   We are unaware of any good time series measure of the employer-to-employer transition
probability outside of the United States. Fallick and Fleischman (2004, footnote 9) discuss
existing studies of the extent of employer-to-employer transitions using data from other
OECD countries; however, none of these papers constructs a consistent time series.

1.1.5       Matching Function

We have argued that unemployment rises during recessions both because employed workers
are more likely to lose their job and unemployed workers are less likely to find a job. Al-
though an exact decomposition remains controversial, many studies suggest that the decline
in the job finding probability is more important than the increase in the employment exit
probability (Shimer, 2007; Elsby, Michaels and Solon, 2009). In any case, regardless of the


                                            18
empirical evidence, search and matching models have to a large extent focused on fluctua-
tions in the probability of finding a job. Recessions in this view are times when unemployed
workers stay unemployed longer. The question is, “Why?”
    Search and matching models explain fluctuations in the job finding probability through
the matching function (Pissarides, 1985). The number of new matches created in month t,
mt , is a function of unemployment ut and job vacancies vt , say mt = m(ut , vt ). This implies
that the job finding probability for the average unemployed worker is Ft = m(ut , vt )/ut .
A common assumption is that the matching function has constant returns to scale,15 so
the probability that an unemployed worker finds a job is a function only of the vacancy-
unemployment ratio, Ft = f (θt ), where θt ≡ vt /ut is often called “market tightness.”
   At one level, we know the matching function is an incomplete description of the job
finding probability because unemployed workers are not the only ones who find jobs. We have
already shown that some inactive workers move directly into unemployment and that some
employed workers switch jobs without an intervening unemployment spell. It is therefore
remarkable that this simple theoretical structure describes the comovement of the job finding
probability and market tightness very well.
   To show this, we use data on job vacancies from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover
Survey (JOLTS), a monthly survey of 16,000 business establishments.16 According to the
survey form, a job opening must satisfy three conditions: “A specific position exists; work
could start within 30 days; and [the employer is] actively seeking workers from outside this
location to fill the position.” The survey started in December 2000, at the peak of a business
cycle, and has since followed a modest expansion and strong recession. Figure 9 shows the
strong negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the vacancy rate, defined
as vacancies divided by vacancies plus employment.17 This stable relationship is called the
Beveridge curve.
    Since unemployment is strongly negatively correlated with vacancies and with measures
of the job finding probability, market tightness is strongly positively correlated with the job
finding probability. Figure 10 shows the close link between a three month moving average of
market tightness, θt = vt /ut , and the quarterly series for the job finding probability. Clearly
  15
     Diamond (1982) showed how increasing returns to scale in the matching process can create multiple
equilibria. The subsequent literature has found scant evidence for increasing returns, however; see the
survey by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001).
  16
     We use BLS series JTS00000000JOL, total non-farm job openings.
  17
     Davis, Faberman, Haltiwanger and Rucker (2008) argue that there are significant measurement problems
in the JOLTS. These mostly show up in labor turnover statistics, but they find that job openings are
unreported by about eight percent, with little cyclical variation in measurement error. The BLS has since
modified the reported JOLTS data to address these concerns, but in any case, this type of error would not
substantially change our conclusions.

market tightness is more volatile than the job finding probability. To quantify this, suppose
that the matching function is Cobb-Douglas, mt = m̄vtη u1−ηt   for some constants m̄ and η.
Then the job finding probability should be a constant elasticity function of market tightness,
Ft = mt /ut = m̄θtη . We assume that there is multiplicative noise, e.g., measurement error,
that disturbs this equation. Using the underlying monthly data, we then use OLS to estimate
η = 0.42 with a standard error of 0.02.
   An obvious shortcoming of the JOLTS is its brevity. Prior to 2001, the best available
measure of job vacancies came from the Conference Board help-wanted advertising index.
Abraham (1987) discusses this measure in detail, showing that it tracks job vacancies in
regions where both series are available. Using data from 1951 to 2003, Shimer (2005b)
estimates an elasticity of η = 0.28, somewhat smaller than the number we obtain from the
shorter JOLTS data. Whether this reflects the peculiarities of help-wanted advertising, of
the JOLTS data, or of the last decade remains an open question.
  The survey by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) discusses many earlier estimates of the
matching function from the United States and a variety of European countries. Most papers
are interested in whether the matching function exhibits constant returns to scale and so
do not constrain the coefficients on unemployment and vacancies to sum to 1. Typically
they find that the coefficient on vacancies is larger than the coefficient on unemployment,

in contrast to the evidence from JOLTS and the help-wanted index, although the exact
estimates differ significantly across countries. And typically they cannot reject constant
returns. In any case, all of these papers establish a robust, but heterogeneous, link between
unemployment, job vacancies, and the probability of finding a job. This is consistent with
one of the key building blocks of search models.

1.1.6                          Labor Wedge

A final fact that supports the empirical relevance of search theoretic models of the labor
market is evidence that workers are constrained in their ability to supply labor during re-
cessions. One way to express this concretely is to note that, from the perspective of a
labor-market-clearing model, recessions appear to be times when there is an increase in the
tax on labor. A large literature has observed this fact in United States data, noted that it
is hard to observe any real movements in tax rates at these frequencies, and instead called
the tax a “labor wedge” (see, for example, Parkin, 1988; Rotemberg and Woodford, 1991,
1999; Hall, 1997; Mulligan, 2002; Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan, 2007; Shimer, 2010). The
existence of a counter-cyclical labor wedge is a more nuanced assertion than the other facts
we document in this chapter, since it depends on some assumptions about preferences and
technology. Still, it accords with many economists’ intuition that workers are not always on
their labor supply curve.

                                                                            21
    We assume that a representative worker has time-separable preferences, with period
utility function u(c, h) defined over consumption c and hours h. We impose two restrictions
on the period utility function: it must be consistent with balanced growth, so the income
and substitution effects in labor supply cancel; and it must have a constant Frisch elasticity
of labor supply ε > 0. Shimer (2010) and Trabandt and Uhlig (2009) show that these
restrictions together impose the functional form

                                                   γ(σ−1)ε 1+ε σ
                                        c1−σ 1 +    σ(1+ε)
                                                           h ε      −1
                            u(c, h) =                                    ,
                                                    1−σ

where σ > 0 is a measure of the complementarity between hours worked and consumption
and γ > 0 is the disutility of labor supply. The restriction to balanced growth preferences is
quantitatively important for our results, and so we discuss it further below. In contrast, the
assumption that the labor supply elasticity ε is constant is less important for our analysis.
It is useful because, as we show below, ε is a key parameter for determining the magnitude
of fluctuations in the labor wedge. Note that if the complementarity parameter is fixed at
σ = 1, preferences reduce to

                                                      γε 1+ε
                                 u(c, h) = log c −       h ε ,
                                                     1+ε

additively separable between consumption and leisure. If σ > 1, the marginal utility of con-
sumption is increasing in hours worked, creating a tendency towards a positive co-movement
between consumption and labor supply.
   The worker faces a period budget constraint

                                 bt = at + (1 − τt )wt ht − ct .

She enters a period with some initial financial wealth at , earns a pre-tax wage wt per hour
of work ht , pays a proportional labor tax τt , and consumes ct , leaving her with financial
wealth bt , which is then invested in any available assets. We include time subscripts on
consumption, hours, and the wage to stress that these are likely time-varying. We also
include a time subscript on the labor tax because our methodology will uncover cyclical
fluctuations in it. We stress that this formulation is consistent with either complete or
incomplete asset markets.
    The key assumption is that a worker is free to increase or decrease both her consumption
and labor supply. This means she can always finance an extra (1−τt )wt units of consumption
by working for an additional hour or she can reduce her consumption by this amount by
working one hour less. In particular, a worker who maximizes lifetime utility subject to a

                                               22

Equation (3) gives a necessary condition from the worker’s optimization problem in a variety
of economic environments.
    We also assume that a representative firm has access to a Cobb-Douglas production
technology which uses capital k and labor h to produce output. The firm chooses its inputs
to maximize its period profits

                                      At ktα h1−α
                                              t   − rt kt − wt ht ,

where At is total factor productivity, α is the capital share of income, and rt is the rental
rate on capital. Letting yt = At ktα h1−α
                                      t    denote total output, the first order condition for the
choice of labor is
                                        (1 − α)yt /ht = wt ,                                  (4)

which equates the marginal product of labor to the wage. Again we include time subscripts
on output, hours, and the wage. Note that this holds as long as the firm is free to vary its
labor at a constant wage rate wt .
   Now eliminate the wage between equations (3) and (4). Since the hours choice of the
representative household and the representative firm are equal in equilibrium, we can write
this as                                                             1+ε

The left hand side is the proportion of labor income left after taxes. The right hand side
includes several different objects: the consumption-output ratio ct /yt , hours worked ht raised
to an exponent (1 + ε)/ε ≥ 1, and some constants. The constants include preference pa-
rameters (σ, γ, and ε) and a technology parameter (α). Treating the constants as, in fact,
constant at business cycle frequencies, the labor-market-clearing model predicts some co-
movement between the consumption-output ratio and hours worked in response to a shock
to any variable not in this equation, such as productivity or government spending.
    To explore whether this relationship is a good description of the data, we use empirical
measures of the consumption-output ratio and hours worked in the United States,18 fix

the capital share at a conventional value of α = 1/3, and consider different values for the
complementarity parameter σ, the elasticity of labor supply ε, and the disutility of work γ.
In all cases, we set parameters so that the average labor tax is τ = 0.4.19
   To start, we set the complementarity parameter at σ = 1, so preferences are additively
separable between consumption and leisure. This case is particularly convenient because the
percent deviation of 1 − τt from trend does not depend on the choice of the parameters γ and
α. Rather, the consumption-output ratio is supposed to be inversely proportional to hours
worked raised to the power (1 + ε)/ε. In the data, we find that, while there is a negative
correlation between the consumption-output ratio and hours worked, hours are more volatile
than c/y. This is inconsistent with equation (5) for any value of the labor supply elasticity
ε. Instead, recessions look like times when workers would like to supply more labor at a
wage equal to the marginal product of labor, implying that it is as if the tax on labor has
increased.
    Figure 11 quantifies these statements. We show three different values for the Frisch labor
from the National Income and Product Accounts, Table 1.1.5.. Our measure of hours worked is unchanged
from Section 1.1.1.

      In a more complete model, this represents a combination of income taxes, payroll taxes, and consumption
taxes. This is a reasonable value for the average marginal tax rate in the United States; see Prescott (2004).

supply elasticity, ε = 21 , 1, and ∞, corresponding to (1 + ε)/ε = 3, 2, and 1. In all cases, the
implied value of 1 − τt falls sharply during recessions, i.e., the labor wedge is countercyclical.
The 2008–2009 recession stands out. Even with an infinite labor supply elasticity, 1−τt stood
about 3 log points above trend at the beginning of 2008 and fell to 3 log points below trend
in the latest available data, in the third quarter or 2009. Smaller labor supply elasticities
exacerbate this issue.
   Figure 12 examines the role of consumption-hours complementarity σ. We fix ε = 1
and consider three different values, σ = 1, σ = 2, and σ = ∞. Higher complementarity
implies that the denominator in equation (5) is more sensitive to hours. In particular, when
σ > 1, a decline in hours lowers the denominator and so raises 1 − τt , improving the fit of
the model and data. But Figure 12 shows that the improved fit is modest, even in the limit
with maximum curvature.
   Since the labor wedge only requires data on the consumption-output ratio and hours,
it is straightforward to construct a time-series measure of it in other countries. We use
data on the consumption-output ratio from the Penn World Tables and on total hours from
Section 1.1.1. We assume consumption and leisure are separable, σ = 1, which ensures that
the disutility of work γ and the capital share α do not affect the volatility of 1 − τt . Finally,

   Figure 13 compares the relative standard deviation of 1 − τt and total hours with the
correlation between these two series for 17 OECD countries using annual data from 1965
to 2004. Although the correlation is higher in the United States than in any other country
except the United Kingdom, at 0.98, it exceeds 0.5 in every country and is below 0.75 only
in Japan. Moreover, the relative volatility of the labor wedge is smaller in the United States
than in most other countries. The results are reasonably robust to higher values of the labor
supply elasticity. Even with ε = ∞, we find that the correlation between 1 − τt and ht
remains above 0.5 in every country except Japan, where it falls virtually to 0.
   The bottom line is that, with these functional forms for preferences and technology,
recessions look like times when the labor income tax rises. One possible interpretation is
that workers are constrained from working as much as they would like during recessions,
perhaps because search frictions prevent them from finding a job. Although we will explore
this possibility further in the theoretical portion of this chapter, it is worth noting that with
  20
    The NBER working paper version of Ohanian, Raffo and Rogerson (2008) measures both the trend and
the cyclical component of the labor wedge in 21 OECD countries. They assume preferences consistent with
a constant Frisch elasticity of leisure (rather than labor supply) and set this equal to −1. Their findings are
broadly similar to the ones we develop here.

other preferences, the puzzle would disappear.21 For example, suppose

                                                         γε 1+ε
                                      u(c, h) = c −         h ε .
                                                        1+ε

In this case, the labor wedge equation (5) becomes

                                                     γ

                                                         yt

Since output is somewhat more volatile than hours and the two outcomes are strongly pos-
itively correlated, the labor wedge is not particularly cyclical when ε is sufficiently large.
But we view these preferences, in particular the absence of income effects in labor supply, as
implausible. They imply that at a point in time, high wage workers should supply far more
labor than low wage workers. Similarly, they imply that over time, there should be a strong
increasing trend in hours worked. Neither of these patterns is in the data. On the contrary,
Figure 21 suggests that hours worked may be falling in the long-run. As we discuss in the
second section of this chapter, part of that may be a response to rising labor and consump-
tion taxes, but to the extent this reflects a deviation from balanced-growth preferences, it
suggests that income effects are stronger than substitution effects. In this case, the results
we have reported here understate the cyclicality of the labor wedge.


1.2     Theory
This section uses an explicit dynamic stochastic equilibrium search and matching model to
explore whether search frictions are useful for explaining this set of business cycle facts.
Our treatment here follows Shimer (2010), which in turn builds on the canonical model
in Pissarides (1985) and early efforts to integrate that model into the real business cycle
framework (Merz, 1995; Andolfatto, 1996).

1.2.1    Model Setup

The model examines the interaction between a representative firm and a representative
household in a closed economy. The firm uses a standard production technology combining
capital and labor to create a single final good, which is used both for consumption and
investment. It also uses labor to recruit more workers. At the firm level, the recruiting
technology is constant returns to scale, but the efficiency of recruiting is decreasing in the
  21
   Alternatively, considering richer heterogeneous agent models may be useful in accounting for the labor
wedge (Chang and Kim, 2007).



                                                   27
aggregate recruiter-unemployment ratio.
   The household has preferences over consumption and leisure that are additively separable
over time and between consumption and leisure. It has many members and so can insure
individuals against idiosyncratic risk, a standard device for finding a complete markets allo-
cation. The household inelastically supplies workers to the market, although not all of them
are always employed due to the search frictions.
   We focus on a planner’s problem, where the planner chooses consumption, investment,
and the allocation of workers to production and recruiting to maximize the household’s
utility subject to the economy’s resource constraint and the search frictions. By looking at
the planner’s problem, we can understand how search frictions per se affect the behavior
of aggregate labor market outcomes. Section 1.3 discusses the importance of wage setting,
emphasizing that “rigid wages” may arise due to match-specific rents and can significantly
affect labor market outcomes.
   Finally, note that our formulation abstracts from distortionary taxes, and so the labor
wedge is non-zero only because search frictions create a gap between the marginal product
of labor and the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure.22

Time and States We study a discrete time model with an infinite horizon. Denote time by
t = 0, 1, 2, . . . and the state of the economy at time t by st . Let st = {s0 , s1 , . . . , st } denote the
history of the economy and Π(st ) denote the time-0 belief about the probability of observing
an arbitrary history st through time t.23 Aggregate productivity and the probability of
exiting employment are both exogenous functions of history st .

Households A representative household has preferences over consumption c(st ) and labor
supply n(st ) in history st , ordered by
                                  ∞ X
                                  X
                                             β t Π(st ) log c(st ) − γn(st ) ,
                                                                            
                                                                                                            (6)
                                  t=0   st


Note that labor is indivisible and each individual suffers a utility loss γ when employed. Thus
the household effectively has an infinite Frisch elasticity of labor supply. Indivisible labor
implies n(st ) is the employment rate and, normalizing the size of the household, 1 − n(st ) is
the unemployment rate.
  22
     It is straightforward to introduce a distortionary labor tax with the proceeds rebated lump-sum to
households. If the planner does not internalize the tax rebate, the distortionary tax creates an additional
labor wedge. This does not affect the model’s cyclical properties.
  23
     One might instead call the probability Πt (st ) to clarify that the length of the vector st depends on t.
With a slight abuse of notation we simply call this Π(st ), and similarly for other history-dependent functions.


                                                       28
Recruiting Let θ(st ) denote the aggregate ratio of recruiters to unemployed workers in
history st . Employment evolves as

                         n(st+1 ) = (1 − x(st ))n(st ) + f (θ(st ))(1 − n(st ))                       (7)

where st+1 ≡ {st , st+1 } is a continuation history of st . A fraction x(st ) of the employed
workers lose their job and become unemployed, while the remainder stay employed. A
fraction f (θ(st )) of the 1 − n(st ) unemployed workers find a job. We assume that the job
finding probability f is increasing in the recruiter-unemployment ratio. Conversely, each
recruiter attracts µ(θ(st )) workers to the firm, where µ(θ) ≡ f (θ)/θ; this is a decreasing
function. Thus at the firm level, the recruiting technology has constant returns to scale.
This formulation is inspired by the empirical evidence supporting the existence of a matching
function, although we model the inputs into the matching function as unemployed workers
and recruiters, rather than unemployment and vacancies.24

Production Firms have access to a standard Cobb-Douglas production technology. Total

                y(st ) = k(st )α z(st )(n(st ) − θ(st )(1 − n(st )))      ,

where k(st ) is the capital stock, z(st ) is labor-augmenting productivity, and θ(st )(1−n(st )) is
the number of recruiters (the recruiter-unemployment ratio times unemployment), so n(st )−
θ(st )(1 − n(st )) is the number of workers used in production, i.e., producers. Thus the
economy faces a resource constraint
                                                                   1−α
          k(st+1 ) = k(st )α z(st )(n(st ) − θ(st )(1 − n(st )))          + (1 − δ)k(st ) − c(st ),   (8)

where δ is the fraction of capital that depreciates in production.

1.2.2    Planner’s Problem

The planner starts history st with capital k and employment n. He chooses how much each
individual consumes and the recruiter-unemployment ratio. Next period’s employment then
follows equation (7), while next period’s capital stock satisfies the resource constraint (8).
Let V (k, n, st ) denote the expected utility of the representative household when the aggregate
capital stock is k, aggregate employment is n, and the history is st . Expressing the planner’s

the matching function.

where our notation assumes st+1 is a continuation history of st . The planner recognizes that
next period’s employment satisfies

                                        n′ = (1 − x(st ))n + f (θ)(1 − n)

and next period’s capital stock satisfies

                              k ′ = k α (z(st )(n − θ(1 − n)))1−α + (1 − δ)k − c.

   To solve this, substitute the laws of motion for employment and capital into the value
function and then take the first order condition for consumption:

                                1        X Π(st+1 )
                                     = β              Vk (k(st+1 ), n(st+1 ), st+1 ).                                  (9)

The left hand side is the marginal utility of consumption, while the right hand side is the
expected discounted marginal value of investment. Next take the first order condition for
recruiting:

is the equilibrium capital-labor ratio in the production sector. The left hand side of equa-
tion (10) is the marginal product of labor, multiplied by the value of the capital lost by a
small increase in the recruiter-unemployment ratio. The right hand side is the increase in
employment from the shift in the ratio, multiplied by the marginal value of employment.

The marginal value of employment is the disutility of work, plus the value of the increase
in next period’s capital stock that comes from the additional output, plus the value of the
increase in next period’s employment that comes having an additional worker this period.
    Eliminate the expected marginal value of capital and employment from equations (12)
and (13) using equations (9) and (10). This gives expressions for the current marginal value
of capital and employment:

These equations contain the model’s main implications. Equation (14) states that the
marginal cost of capital, one unit of consumption today, is equal to the expected marginal
product of capital next period plus the value of the undepreciated portion of the capital, dis-
counted using the appropriate stochastic discount factor. Equation (15) expresses the trade-
off between recruiting and producing. An additional producer generates (1 − α)z(st )κ(st )α
units of output in the current period. An additional recruiter yields f ′ (θ(st )) additional
workers next period. Each unit of labor supplied reduces utility by −γc(st ) when measured
in units of consumption. In addition, each new recruit permits the planner to put some
additional workers into production, each of whom generates (1 − α)z(st+1 )κ(st+1 )α units of
output. The term on the last line is the number of workers who can be placed into produc-
tion in period t + 1 while allowing the firm to maintain its baseline size in period t + 2. This
includes the recruit, some recruiters who can be shifted into production while maintaining
the same recruiter-unemployment ratio t + 1, and a reduction in the recruiter-unemployment
ratio at t + 1 enabled by the continued presence of the new recruit in period t + 2.
    In summary, the solution to the planner’s problem is a set of stochastic processes for
consumption, capital, the recruiter-unemployment ratio, and employment that satisfies the
law of motion for employment in equation (7), the resource constraint (8) and the two
optimality conditions for investment in physical capital, equation (14), and the allocation of
labor, equation (15).

1.2.3   Decentralization

It is straightforward to decentralize the planner’s problem as a search equilibrium with
complete markets. A representative household chooses consumption and the purchase of
Arrow securities to maximize utility subject to a lifetime budget constraint and a law of
motion for employment. A representative firm purchases capital and allocates labor to
production and recruiting in order to maximize the present value of profits, discounted using
the intertemporal price that clears the asset market. Wages are set by Nash bargaining,
where workers’ bargaining power is φ and the threat point in bargaining is the dissolution of
the match. In equilibrium, the goods and asset markets clear and the aggregate recruiter-
unemployment ratio is consistent with each firm’s labor allocation decision.
   Shimer (2010) shows that the conditions that define the equilibrium are nearly unchanged
from the social planner’s problem. Employment still satisfies the law of motion in equa-
tion (7) and capital satisfies the resource constraint (8). The first order condition for capital
in equation (14) also must hold in equilibrium. But the optimality condition for recruiting




                                               32

           s   |s


where w(st+1 ) is the equilibrium wage and µ(θ) = f (θ)/θ is the number of hires per recruiter.
Under Nash bargaining, the wage satisfies

                    w(st ) = φ(1 − α)z(st )κ(st )α (1 + θ(st )) + (1 − φ)γc(st ).          (17)

The first term on the right hand side is workers’ bargaining power times a measure of
the marginal product of labor. This accounts both for the output the worker produces
(1 − α)z(st )κ(st )α , and for the fact that, if bargaining fails, unemployment increases and
the firm must place θ(st ) additional workers into recruiting in order to maintain the same
recruiter-unemployment ratio. The second term is the firms’ bargaining power times the
marginal rate of substitution.
   One can verify that if the Mortensen (1982)–Hosios (1990) condition holds,

                                                   θf ′ (θ)
                                         1−φ =              ,
                                                    f (θ)

then equations (16) and (17) reduce to the optimality condition for recruiting, equation (15).
This is possible only if f (θ) = µ̄θ1−φ and so µ(θ) = µ̄θ−φ for some µ̄ > 0 and φ ∈ [0, 1].
Under these conditions, workers’ bargaining power is equal to the elasticity of the number
of matches with respect to unemployment, and similarly for firms. This ensures that each
firm correctly internalizes the impact of its search on the matching possibility of other firms.
Otherwise the equilibrium does not decentralize the planner’s problem. In what follows, we
refer to wages that decentralize the social planner’s solution as “flexible.”

1.2.4   Calibration

We cannot solve the model explicitly, and so instead proceed numerically. We calibrate the
model using facts about the United States economy, linearize it in a neighborhood of the
steady state, and then describe its behavior when hit by shocks. For comparability with
much of the existing business cycle literature, we focus on aggregate productivity shocks as
the driving force of business cycles, but we also discuss the possible role of other shocks in
this framework.


                                                 33
    Many of the parameters are standard in the real business cycle literature, but some are
specific to the matching model. We start with the more familiar parameters. We think
of a time period as one month so to be able to capture the typical short duration of an
unemployment spell. The discount factor is β = 0.996, just under five percent annually.
   We fix α = 0.33 to match the capital share of income in the National Income and Product
Accounts. We then set set δ = 0.0028 per month, which pins down the capital-output ratio
at 3.2 along a balanced growth path. This is the average capital-output ratio in the United
States since 1948.25
   We assume productivity has a deterministic trend, log z(st ) = s̄t + st , where s̄ is mean
productivity growth and st follows a first-order autoregressive process,

                                          st+1 = ρst + ςυt+1 ,                                        (18)

where υt+1 is a white noise innovation with mean zero and standard deviation 1. Mean
productivity growth is s̄ = 0.0018, about 2.2 percent per year, consistent with the annual
measures of multifactor productivity growth in the private business sector constructed by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.26 We set the autocorrelation of productivity growth to ρ = 0.98
and the standard deviation to ς = 0.008. These values are similar to standard calibrations
of total factor productivity (Cooley and Prescott, 1995), with an adjustment to account for
the fact that time periods are one month long.
   We turn next to the parameters that determine flows between employment and un-
employment. Shimer (2005b) measures the average exit probability from employment to
unemployment in the United States at x = 0.034 per month, and we stick with that number
here. Initially we assume that it is constant, but we also develop a version of the model with
shocks to the employment exit probability.
   Although there are many estimates of the matching function f in the literature (see
the survey by Petrongolo and Pissarides, 2001), most papers assume that firms create job
vacancies in order to attract unemployed workers and so estimate matching functions using
data on unemployment and vacancies. The technology in this paper is slightly different,
with firms using workers to recruit workers. Unfortunately we are unaware of any time
series showing the number of workers (or hours of work) devoted to recruiting, and so the
choice of f is somewhat arbitrary. Still, following much of the search and matching literature,
  25
     More precisely, we use the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s Fixed Asset Table 1.1, line 1 to measure the
current cost net stock of fixed assets and consumer durable goods. We use National Income and Product
Accounts Table 1.1.5, line 1 to measure nominal Gross Domestic Product.
  26
     See ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/opt/mp/prod3.mfptablehis.zip, Table 4. Between
1948 and 2007, productivity grew by 0.818 log points, or approximately 0.014 log points per year. Our model
assumes labor-augmenting technical progress, and so we must multiply s̄ by 1 − α to obtain TFP growth.


                                                    34
we focus on an isoelastic function, f (θ) = µ̄θη , and look at the symmetric case, η = 0.5. We
discuss below the importance of this parameter. To pin down the efficiency parameter in the
matching function µ̄, we build on evidence in Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) and Silva and
Toledo (2009). Those papers argue that recruiting a worker uses approximately 4 percent of
one worker’s quarterly wage, i.e., a recruiter can attract approximately 25 new workers in a
quarter, or 8.33 in a month. We use this fact and data on the average unemployment rate
to determine µ̄. We proceed in several steps. First, from (7), the steady state employment
rate satisfies
                                             f (θ)
                                      n=             .
                                           x + f (θ)
Setting n = 0.95, the average share of the labor force employed during the post-war period,
and x = 0.034, this implies f (θ) = 0.646 in steady state. Second, the functional form
f (θ) = µ̄θη implies
                                      f (θ)
                                  µ̄ = η = f (θ)1−η µ(θ)η ,
                                       θ
where the second equation follows because µ(θ) ≡ f (θ)/θ. From this equation, we set
µ̄ = 2.32, consistent with f (θ) = 0.646, µ(θ) = 8.33, and η = 1/2. Note that this implies
that the recruiter-unemployment ratio is θ = f (θ)/µ(θ) ≈ 0.078. It follows that the share of
recruiters in employment is θ(1 − n)/n ≈ 0.004, with 99.6 percent of employees devoted to
production. Thus in this calibration, the implicit hiring costs are small, at least on average.
   Finally, we set the parameter governing the taste for leisure to obtain a five percent un-
employment rate along the balanced growth path; this implies γ ≈ 0.785. When we consider
alternative calibrations, we vary γ to ensure that the unemployment rate is unchanged.

1.2.5   Results

The search model is useful for developing a notion of unemployment and a theory of worker
flows between employment and unemployment. But this section asks whether the model
helps to explain other shortcomings of standard business cycle models. What shocks hit the
economy? How are they amplified and propagated through time? Why do they create a
countercyclical labor wedge?

Shocks We focus in this section on two sources of shocks. One is completely standard
in the real business cycle literature (Kydland and Prescott, 1982), the productivity shock
introduced above. The other is special to frictional markets, a shock to the probability of
exiting employment. This arguably resembles a “sectoral shift,” with many workers losing
their job and enduring an unemployment spell before moving elsewhere (Lilien, 1982). Fol-
lowing Blanchard and Diamond (1989), we label the first shock “aggregate” and the second

                                              35
“reallocational,” but obviously the names are only suggestive. One important question is
whether quantitatively reasonable reallocation shocks are important for the dynamics of em-
ployment. We could symmetrically consider a shock to the matching function. In our view,
it is implausible to argue that unemployment falls during an expansion because the matching
process has exogenously improved, and so we take these shocks off the table.
   In principle, one could introduce other shocks to the model. For example, it is straight-
forward to modify the government budget constraint and resource constraint to introduce
stochastic government spending. Trigari (2009) develops a version of a search and matching
model with nominal rigidities; in such a framework, monetary policy shocks can also have
real effects on output. Of course, one could study both of these shocks in a model without
search frictions, and our intuition is that our results comparing models with and without
search frictions carry over to these shocks.

Amplification One of our main results is that search frictions dampen the effect of pro-
ductivity shocks.27 That is, we compare the volatility of employment and output in a model
with search frictions to one without search frictions, i.e., where firms can costlessly adjust
employment and wages clear the labor market. We maintain the assumption that leisure
is indivisible and so preferences are given by equation (6). This is therefore essentially the
Hansen (1985) model. The first row in Table 1 considers this frictionless model. The first
three columns show the theoretical, infinite sample standard deviation of output, employ-
ment, and the consumption-output ratio. The last three columns show a measure more
comparable to empirical estimates of these objects. We simulate 402 months of data from
our model, compute quarterly averages and then detrend using an HP filter with smoothing
parameter 1600. We show the average results from 1000 such simulations of the model. In
both cases output is about 2.2 times as volatile as total factor productivity, while employ-
ment and the consumption-output ratio are slightly less volatile than output.28 Note that
in each case the standard deviation of employment and the consumption-output ratio is the
same. Indeed, we know from equation (5) that, since ε = ∞ and σ = 1, employment and
the consumption-output ratio mirror each other.
   The second row shows our baseline search model. We feed the same shock into the model
and affirm that search frictions dampen the response. The standard deviation of detrended
  27
     Merz (1995) and Andolfatto (1996) assume that recruiting costs are in units of goods rather than labor.
In that case, search frictions do not substantially dampen the response to productivity shocks. We view a
time-intensive model of recruiting as more plausible.
  28
     Employment and the consumption-output ratio are less persistent than productivity, while output is
about equally persistent. Therefore detrending boosts the volatility of n and c/y relative to productivity
but does not much affect the volatility of y relative to productivity.

output falls by 51 percent, the standard deviation of the detrended consumption-output ratio
by 54 percent, and the standard deviation of detrended employment falls most of all, by 90
percent. The theoretical standard deviations fall by a similar magnitude. To the extent that
one hoped search frictions would amplify productivity shocks, the results are disappointing.
Intuitively, increasing the recruiter-unemployment ratio in response to a positive productivity
shock is costly because doing so reduces the effectiveness of each recruiter. This naturally
dampens the volatility of employment and hence output. Shimer (2010) verifies that if search
frictions are more severe, so each recruiter attracts fewer workers per month, the dampening
effect of frictions is even more extreme.
    We next introduce the reallocation shock. We assume log x(st ) = log x̄ + sx,t , where
x̄ = 0.034 and sx,t follows a linear process,

                                       sx,t+1 = ρx sx,t + ςx υx,t+1 .

We assume the innovation to reallocation, υx,t+1 , is white noise with mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. We fix ρx = 0.83 and ςx = 0.034 so as to match the autocorrelation of the
employment exit probability and its unconditional standard deviation, as measured in Shimer
(2007). For simplicity, we assume that the productivity shock and the employment exit
probability shock are uncorrelated, so

                                        sz,t+1 = ρz sz,t + ςz υz,t+1,

where υz,t+1 is independent white noise with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. We then
leave ρz = 0.98 and ςz = 0.008, as in the model without search frictions.29 The third row
  29
    We can also introduce correlation between the shocks, for example by making productivity sz,t+1 a func-
tion of both the productivity shock υz,t+1 and the reallocation shock υx,t+1 . One way to set the correlation

in Table 1 shows that introducing these shocks barely affects the volatility of output or the
consumption-output ratio. It raises the theoretical standard deviation of employment by 20
percent and the standard deviation of detrended employment by 50 percent. Nevertheless,
employment remains far less volatile than in the frictionless model.
  Our calibration strategy tightly pins down most of the important model parameters.
The one exception is the elasticity of the matching function, η. Recall that increasing the
recruiter-unemployment ratio in response to a positive productivity shock is costly because
doing so reduces the effectiveness of each recruiter. The parameter η governs how quickly
recruiters’ effectiveness falls. When we recalibrate the model with a lower elasticity η,
corresponding to the case where unemployed workers are a more important part of the
search process, the volatility of each of the three outcomes is significantly dampened. At
the extreme case of η = 0, f (θ) = µ̄ and so the job finding probability is constant. Absent
fluctuations in the fraction of employed workers who become unemployed, x, employment is
constant as well, n = µ̄/(x + µ̄). The search model is equivalent to real business cycle model
with inelastic labor supply.
   Conversely, when we raise η, volatility increases. An extreme case is η = 1, so f (θ) = µ̄θ.
This implies that a firm must shift 1/µ̄ workers away from production in order to hire one
new employee. It may be natural to interpret this parameterization of the model as a training
cost, rather than a recruiting cost, since the cost depends only on the number of workers
hired and not on the availability of unemployed workers. The last row in Table 1 shows
that the model with training costs generates almost the same volatility as the frictionless
model. Indeed, the volatility of detrended output and the detrended consumption-output
ratio actually increase.30 This result accords with the finding in Mortensen and Nagypál
(2007), that a model with training costs generates more volatility than a model with search
frictions (see also Pissarides, 2009). Still, the point remains that training costs slightly reduce
the volatility of employment compared to a frictionless model, and so in this sense they are
a step in the wrong direction.
    Finally, it seems worth comparing the predictions of this model with the Lucas and
Prescott (1974) search model (see also Alvarez and Veracierto, 1999, 2001). That model
focuses on the time-consuming reallocation of workers across labor markets that are con-
tinually hit with idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Moving to a new labor market takes
between the shocks is to match the correlation between the job finding probability and the employment exit
probability, −0.43 in the data. This requires that an increase in reallocation reduce productivity. Doing this
does not substantially change our results.
  30
     These results appear to be a consequence of time aggregation. When we work directly in a model with
a quarterly time period, the standard deviation of all three detrended variables is slightly smaller in the
training cost model than in the frictionless model. In any case, the difference in volatility between the two
models is small.


                                                     38
one period. This is equivalent to assuming that only unemployed workers are useful in the
matching process, f (θ) = µ̄, and so our analysis here would suggest a dampened response
to productivity shocks. Indeed, employment changes in that model only to the extent that
the inflow rate into unemployment changes, which we have seen empirically accounts for
only a minority of aggregate unemployment fluctuations.31 Veracierto (2008) attempts to
address this by allowing workers to drop out of the labor force, but when he does this, he
finds that labor force participation becomes so strongly procyclical in the model that the
unemployment rate is weakly procyclical.

Propagation Although search frictions do not amplify shocks, they do affect how they are
propagated through time by slowing down the adjustment of employment. To see this, we
focus on the first and second order autocorrelation of output growth and employment growth.
In United States data, such growth rates are all positively serially correlated: the first and
second order autocorrelation of detrended quarterly output growth are 0.23 and 0.08, while
the corresponding numbers for detrended quarterly employment growth are 0.19 and 0.17.32
This recalls the findings of Cogley and Nason (1995), who emphasize the importance of
autocorrelations for model evaluation.
   Table 2 therefore shows corresponding numbers for the model. The first column shows
the theoretical correlation between the growth rate of output from month t to t + 3 and its
growth rate from t + 3 to t + 6. The second column shows similar numbers for employment.
We see that in the frictionless model, both of these correlations are negative. This reflects
the fact that shocks are mean reverting and so output and employment also tend to revert
to trend. Adding search frictions boosts this correlation, particularly for employment. On
the other hand, reallocation shocks lower the autocorrelation of employment by buffeting
it with relatively transitory shocks. Curiously, the training cost model, where matching
depends only on recruiters, significantly raises the the theoretical autocorrelation of output.
These columns suggest that search frictions, particularly the training cost variant, raise the
persistence of output and employment.
   A direct comparison of the data with the numbers in the first two columns is diffi-
cult, both because the data are detrended from a finite sample and because the data are
time-aggregated. The third and fourth columns in Table 2 therefore show the first order au-
  31
      Strictly speaking, this is not correct. In the original Lucas and Prescott (1974) model, search is directed,
but it takes one period to arrive in the desired labor market. During that period, labor market conditions
may worsen substantially, inducing the worker to refuse the job. In practice, this event is rare and so in
most cases unemployment lasts for one period.
   32
      The output numbers are for real GDP from the National Income and Product Accounts, Table 1.1.6,
from 1976Q3 to 2009Q3. The employment numbers are for the fraction of the population who is at work.

tocorrelation from similarly time-aggregated model-generated data. Our first result is that,
even in the frictionless model, output and employment growth are both positively autocor-
relation (0.11). This turns out to be due entirely to time-aggregation. Indeed, even though
productivity is mean reverting, the first order autocorrelation of productivity growth is also
0.11. This is because time aggregation raises the first order autocorrelation of the growth
rate of an autoregressive process; see, for example, Working (1960) for the case of a ran-
dom walk. This suggests it may be difficult to compare the model with data. Nevertheless,
model versus model comparisons are instructive. We again see in the remaining entries in
the third and fourth columns that search frictions boost the first order autocorrelation of
output and employment growth, particularly in the training cost model, while reallocation
shocks moderate the autocorrelation of employment.
   Finally, the last two columns in Table 2 look at second order autocorrelations. For a
time-aggregated random walk, the first order autocorrelation of growth rates is positive, but
the second order autocorrelation is always zero. Therefore we expect that looking at the
second order autocorrelation will moderate any issues related to time aggregation. Indeed,
we find that the second order autocorrelation of output and employment growth is consis-
tently negative and is basically unaffected by the presence of search costs. None of these
search models can therefore generate the persistent positive autocorrelation of output and
employment growth that we observe in United States data.

Labor Wedge Finally, we turn to the labor wedge. We imagine an economist who under-
stands that the labor supply elasticity is ε = ∞ and the consumption-hours complementarity
is σ = 1. He measures the labor wedge τ using equation (5). Table 3 shows the standard

deviation of measured 1 − τ and its comovement with output and employment.33
   In the frictionless model, the labor wedge is always equal to 0, while in the search model
it is volatile, and more volatile in the baseline model than the one with training costs. The
problem is that 1 − τ is negatively correlated with output and employment in the model,
the opposite of the data. This is intuitive. The labor wedge ignores the existence of search
frictions, which act as an adjustment cost. Relative to a frictionless model, the adjustment
cost dampens fluctuations in employment (Table 1). To rationalize this in a frictionless
model, we need to assume that the tax on labor rises during every expansion. But this
is exactly the opposite of what we observe in the data. Again, the negative correlation
between the labor wedge and output or employment is smaller in the training cost version
of the model, but the counterfactual implication remains highly significant.

Other Moments One can examine other moments in the model, for example the behavior
of consumption and investment. Doing so reaffirms earlier work emphasizing that the pres-
ence of search frictions does not substantially modify the behavior of a business cycle model
(Merz, 1995; Andolfatto, 1996). The main effect of search frictions is instead to dampen the
response of the economy, and especially the labor market, to aggregate shocks. While this
is disappointing, it is worth stressing that the model has some advantages over the baseline
business cycle model, namely the introduction of unemployment and aggregate worker flows.
  33
     Note that the choice of the disutility of work γ does not affect the statistical properties of 1 − τ , although
it determines its average level.

1.3     Rigid Wages
The concern that search models do not generate substantial fluctuations in unemployment
was first voiced in Shimer (2005b), albeit in a model with linear utility and no capital; see
also Costain and Reiter (2008). The body of Shimer’s paper focused on a model with Nash
bargaining that satisfied the Mortensen-Hosios condition, i.e., what we have defined as a flex-
ible wage model with outcomes equivalent to the social planner’s problem. While wages that
decentralize the social planner’s solution may be a useful benchmark, the assumption is not
obviously more plausible than a myriad of possible alternatives.34 In his conclusion, Shimer
argued that wage rigidities—wages that are less procyclical than those which decentralize
the social planner’s solution—may help to resolve the “unemployment volatility puzzle.”35
This section starts by reviewing the subsequent theoretical literature on wage rigidities, then
discusses papers that attempt to measure whether wages are rigid in reality, and concludes
by considering whether one needs a model with search frictions to analyze wage rigidities.

1.3.1    Theory

Hall (2005) was the first paper to quantify the possibility of wage rigidities creating volatile
unemployment in a search model. He replaced the Nash bargaining assumption, analogous
to equation (17) here, with a restriction that wages do not move in response to aggregate
productivity shocks. A temporary increase in productivity therefore raises the revenue from
hiring workers without raising the cost. This induces firms to recruit more workers, which
in turn lowers the unemployment rate. Hall (2005) established that this is indeed a powerful
amplification mechanism.
   An important insight of Hall (2005) was that the wage negotiation between a matched
worker and firm is a zero-sum game. The marginal rate of substitution between consumption
and leisure is strictly less than the marginal product of labor in a search equilibrium, with
the difference representing a match-specific rent due to the existence of the search friction.
   34
      A number of papers assume that firms post wages offers and workers can direct their search towards
their preferred offer, as in the competitive search literature (Montgomery, 1991; Peters, 1991; Moen, 1997;
Shimer, 1996; Acemoglu and Shimer, 1999; Burdett, Shi and Wright, 2001; Mortensen and Wright, 2002).
The equilibrium of that model coincides with the social planner’s solution, and so wages are flexible. Models
of wage rigidities therefore typically assume either that firms cannot commit to wages or that workers cannot
direct their search.
   35
      This recognition of the central role of wage determination in search models is not new. In his review
of the first edition of Pissarides (2000), Mortensen (1992, p. 166) noted that “the fact that alternative
rules of wage determination may have different implications is an important neglected topic.. . . Unlike the
Walrasian theory, there is no unique concept of equilibrium price inherent in the theory of markets with
transactions costs. Wages must be determined by some form of bargaining and the implications of the model
are generally sensitive to which bargaining solution is imposed.” Caballero and Hammour (1996) also stress
that how match-specific rents are appropriated may be important for business cycle fluctuations.


                                                     42
It follows that there is a range of wages that a worker is willing to accept and a firm is
willing to pay. This has two implications. First, search models with rigid wages do not
suffer from the Barro (1977) critique of unemployment in the implicit contracts literature
(e.g. Baily, 1974; Gordon, 1974; Azariadis, 1975), that inefficient layoffs arise only because
matched workers and firms fail to exploit some of the bilateral gains from trade.36 Second,
wage rigidities in existing employment relationships are inconsequential, so long as they do
not lead to inefficient separations (Shimer, 2004).37 Instead, the recent search literature has
focused on how wage rigidities affect firms’ incentive to create job vacancies and to recruit
new employees, leading to fluctuations in the job finding probability. Given the empirical
evidence that the job finding probability declines sharply and remains low long after the
initial recessionary shock, this emphasis seems reasonable.
    The subsequent theoretical literature on wage rigidities in search models can largely be
divided along two dimensions. First, some papers attempt to provide a deep foundation for
the rigidity, while others pursue a more ad hoc approach. Second, in some papers the wage
rigidity is intrinsically static, while in others it introduces an additional state variable.38
   The simplest wage rigidity models are ad hoc and static. One example is Hall (2005),
who assumed wages are fixed forever. Hall presents a simple bargaining game in which any
wage between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal product of labor is an
equilibrium. He then argues that “a constant wage rule may be interpreted as a wage norm
or social consensus.” (p. 56) Blanchard and Galı́ (2008) also impose an ad hoc, static wage
rule. Generalizing Hall (2005), they assume that the wage is proportional to productivity,
but the constant of proportionality is smaller than 1. Thus when productivity is high, the
gap between the marginal product of labor and the wage is large, again encouraging firms
to hire. The free proportionality parameter affects the extent of wage rigidity and hence
the volatility of unemployment. It is worth stressing that even with this free parameter, the
model is testable. For example, Hall (2009) examines the implications of a rigid wage model
for the behavior of hours per worker, under the assumption that workers and firms negotiate
hours efficiently, even if total compensation is rigid. He finds the model can eliminate the
cyclicality of the labor wedge.
  36
     With two-sided asymmetric information, inefficient separations may be a necessary feature of equilibrium.
See Ramey and Watson (1997) for an example where layoffs arise in a search model because of endogenous
limits on contracting.
  37
     With incomplete markets, wage rigidities in existing employment relationships matter because they affect
the value of the relationship and so affect job creation; however, Rudanko (2009) finds that this effect is
quantitatively small.
  38
     There may also be institutional reasons, such as unions, why wages are rigid. We do not know of
any recent attempts to understand whether wage rigidities at business cycle frequencies are consistent with
unions’ objective function.



                                                     43
   Other authors present more sophisticated arguments for why wages are rigid. An early
example is Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008), although it is worth noting that the authors do
not interpret their paper as one with wage rigidities. They calibrate the Nash bargaining
parameter using information that wages move less than one-for-one with productivity, which
gives them a small value for the workers’ bargaining power φ in (17). This significantly
amplifies productivity shocks relative to the baseline search model. To understand why,
recall that if φ = 1 − η, so that the Mortensen (1982)–Hosios (1990) condition is satisfied,
the equilibrium is equivalent to the solution to the social planner’s problem. Also recall that
we also found that when η = 1, i.e., the training cost model, search frictions do not much
dampen productivity shocks. It turns out that when φ = 0 but η < 1, the results are similar
although not quite as strong; search frictions still dampen productivity shocks, but not as
much as in the baseline search model. For example, if φ = 0 and η = 0.5, the standard
deviation of detrended employment is 1.3 times the size of the productivity shock, far more
than in the baseline search model but somewhat less than the value of 1.7 in the training
cost model. The autocorrelation of output and employment growth are also essentially the
same as in the training cost model and the procyclical labor wedge is unaffected as well.
   Another approach to static wage rigidities comes from reexamining the threat point
when bargaining. In equation (17), we assumed that a breakdown in bargaining led to the
dissolution of a match. Hall and Milgrom (2008) argue that a worker and firm are likely to
continue bargaining even if agreement is not immediate. Therefore the threat point when
bargaining is delay, not breakdown. This small change has a big effect on the equilibrium,
since the value of delay—say the worker’s time and the firm’s foregone production—is less
cyclical than the value of dissolution. Such a model can potentially generate more volatility
than the frictionless benchmark and a countercyclical labor wedge.
   A third approach to static wage rigidities is based on asymmetric information. Kennan
(2010) explores what happens if workers are unable to observe the productivity of their
match. He shows that under some conditions the information rent accruing to firms is pro-
cyclical, effectively generating rigid wages and amplifying the impact of productivity shocks.
Other information frictions, such as the need to pay a high wage that keeps workers from
shirking (Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984; MacLeod and Malcomson, 1989) may also be important
for wage setting; see Costain and Jansen (2009) for recent work integrating efficiency wages
into a search model.
    These static stories amplify shocks but typically do not propagate them. Models where
wages are backward looking can do both. Again, the simplest models are ad hoc. In Blan-
chard and Galı́ (2007), the current wage is a weighted average of the previous period’s wage
and the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure. In Shimer (2010,


                                              44
Chapter 4), it is a weighted average of the previous wage and the current wage that would
prevail if there were Nash bargaining, which significantly propagates shocks without much
affecting the comovement of wages and labor productivity.
   Gertler and Trigari (2009) provide a deeper theory for why wages may be backward
looking. They assume that workers and firms only periodically negotiate, bargaining so as
to satisfy the Nash solution and fixing the wage until the next opportunity to renegotiate.
Crucially the negotiated wage applies not only to the firm’s existing workers, but also to any
new workers it might hire. Thus firms that last negotiated their wage prior to an adverse
productivity shock will have little incentive to recruit new workers following the shock. They
again show that this amplifies the effect of shocks on the labor market with little consequence
for other macroeconomic outcomes.

1.3.2    Evidence

This theoretical literature points to an obvious empirical question: are wages in reality rigid?
Some recent papers have in fact argued that wages in new matches are flexible, as evidenced
by the fact that they are as volatile as labor productivity (Pissarides, 2009; Haefke, Sonntag
and van Rens, 2008); however, this evidence is also consistent with a rigid wage model. To
understand why, it is useful to step back and think about an otherwise frictionless model
where, for some reason, wages are above the market-clearing level. In this case, firms set the
level of employment so that the marginal product of labor is equal to the wage. With a Cobb-
Douglas production function, it follows that labor productivity, i.e., the average product of
labor, is proportional to the wage; see equation (4).39 This is true regardless of the source of
shocks, and indeed regardless of whether wages are rigid. That is, in the absence of search
frictions, the observation that wages are as volatile as labor productivity is uninformative
about whether wages are rigid. This argument does not exactly carry over to a model with
search frictions, but quantitatively it is not far off. Shimer (2010, Chapter 4) reports that
the labor share, wt ht /yt , is nearly constant in a model where wages are extremely backward
looking. Devising appropriate tests for whether wages are rigid remains an important issue
for future research.
  39
    For evidence in support of this theory, see Galı́, Gertler and López-Salido (2007), who attribute all
the volatility in the labor wedge to the “wage markup,” the ratio of the real wage to the marginal rate of
substitution in equation (3). They find almost no volatility in the “price markup,” the ratio of the marginal
product of labor to the real wage in equation (4).

1.3.3      Why Search?

A final issue is whether search models are the right framework for thinking about wage
rigidities. It is clear that search frictions provide one possible explanation for why wages are
rigid: there is a gap between the wage that workers will accept and firms will pay, and any
wage between those bounds is in some sense reasonable. But anything that creates match-
specific rents, such as training costs, match-specific capital, labor unions, and collusion
among employers, also creates rents.40
  A natural question is therefore whether there is any reason to prefer search over other
models of rents. An important feature of search models is that it is impossible for a worker
and a firm to contract on the division of rents before the rents are created, since they have
not yet met. In contrast, it is in principle possible to write contracts that divide the ex
post rents from training costs, match-specific capital accumulation, or private information.
Of course, there may be limits to that contracting. For example, limits on workers’ ability
to commit to stay in an employment relationship may mean that a firm will only invest in
a worker’s human capital if the worker can post a bond; and borrowing constraints may
prevent bond-posting. Alternatively, employees’ morale may constrain the firm and prevent
it from cutting wages during downturns (Bewley, 2002). Still, search offers a potentially
important explanation for why match-specific rents are not divided efficiently.
   Finally, one might think about wage rigidities in a model without any match-specific rents.
At a crude level, one could impose a wage above the market-clearing level in an otherwise
competitive framework. The aggregate implications for employment, unemployment, and the
labor wedge would be very similar to what comes out of a search model. But this approach
seems unsatisfactory to us, since the wage rigidity would necessarily have to be ad hoc, and
hence potentially not robust to different policy interventions. To develop a deep theory of
wage rigidities, one needs a model that sheds light on the forces that prevent wages from
adjusting to clear the labor market. The trading frictions inherent in search models seem a
promising way of understanding these forces. To the extent that substantial heterogeneity
across workers and jobs makes search frictions more pronounced in the labor market than
in most other markets, this may help us to understand why rigidities are more important in
the labor market as well.

2                       Trends
We now shift our attention from cyclical fluctuations to long-run trends. The persistent,
widespread, but unequal increase in unemployment across OECD countries in the 1970s and
1980s motivated a substantial body of research that sought to understand why different
countries experienced different outcomes. This section reviews some of the key features of
the low-frequency data and then examines how search theory has been used to understand
these trend changes in labor market outcomes.


2.1                     Facts
2.1.1                    Unemployment Rate

We start by presenting two key features of trend changes in unemployment across the OECD
since 1965.41 First, almost all countries experienced a single peak in trend unemployment
during this period. Second, there was substantial heterogeneity in the extent of the increase
in trend unemployment and the timing of the peak.
  41
   Layard, Nickell and Jackman (2005) and Blanchard (2006) are recent contributions that also summarize
some facts about unemployment evolutions in the OECD.



                                                             47
   Figure 14 displays the average trend unemployment rate for 17 OECD countries from
1965 until 2007, where the trend is defined as an HP filter with smoothing parameter 100.42
As the picture shows, trend unemployment increased steadily from the beginning of the
sample until the mid 1990s, ultimately rising by a factor of six. This increase was far larger
than the changes associated with business cycle fluctuations.
   The subsequent decline in trend unemployment was equally important, although even in
2007 the level is more than three times higher than it was in the mid 1960s. Researchers
studying unemployment through the mid 1990s took as a starting point that one needed to
understand the factors that caused a permanent increase in unemployment. But Figure 14
suggests that the key fact to explain is not a permanent increase in unemployment but rather
a long-lived temporary increase.
    A particularly striking feature of the data is the heterogeneity in unemployment evo-
lutions across countries. Figure 15 plots the distribution of unemployment rates at five
year intervals starting in 1965. An interesting feature of this figure is that as mean un-
employment increased from 1965 to 1995, there was a marked increase in the dispersion of
unemployment rates as well. The subsequent decrease in unemployment was accompanied
by a corresponding decrease in dispersion. In fact, as shown in Figure 16, the standard
deviation of unemployment rates in 2007 is roughly the same as it was in 1965 despite the
fact that mean unemployment is higher.
    Next we look at trend unemployment in each of the individual countries. We note upfront
that these figures show two striking feature. First, in almost every country the evolution
of trend unemployment followed a single peaked shape, similar to that found for the cross-
country average. Second, although the qualitative shape of trend unemployment is the same
for all countries, the extent of the increase from initial level to peak level and the timing of
the peak varied significantly across countries.
   We begin by displaying in Figure 17 the evolution of trend unemployment in France,
Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. This figure illustrates these two
general features. While each country followed the same single peaked shape, the magnitude
of the increase from initial level to peak level was four percent in the United States but more
than nine percent in the other countries. And while the United States reached its peak in
the early 1980s and then rose again modestly at the end of the sample, the United Kingdom
peaked in the mid 1980s, followed by France in the mid 1990s, and Germany near the end of
the sample. Note that there is no strong relationship between the timing of the peak and the
  42

data source and countries, see footnote 7.

extent of the initial increase. For example, France and the United Kingdom had roughly the
same increase up to the peak, but the United Kingdom reaches its peak roughly ten years
earlier.
   Some of our subsequent analysis will focus on these four economies due to their size and
importance in various debates about unemployment. But first it is interesting to note that
the features observed for these four countries also hold for every other country in our sample
except Portugal. Figures 18–20 show the evolution of trend unemployment for thirteen
OECD economies.
    To quickly summarize, while in all of the figures we basically see dynamics that follow
a single peaked profile, the timing of the peak and the extent of the increase prior to the
peak differ quite dramatically across countries. Similarly, the change in unemployment from
the beginning to the end of the period was very different across countries. Given that the
dynamics of unemployment appear to be persistent but not permanent, it is difficult to say
at this point whether these differences will continue to change in the future. For example, in
countries such as the United States and Ireland, unemployment is basically the same at the

beginning and the end of the period. In contrast, in countries such as France and Germany,
unemployment is substantially higher at the end of the period. But given that France and
Germany reached their peak unemployment levels much later than the United States, it is
unclear whether trend unemployment in these countries will continue to decline.

2.1.2                Total Hours

The large but divergent evolution of the unemployment rate across countries invites an anal-
ysis of the sources of these differences. But before we discuss this, we place these trend
unemployment changes in a broader context. In our discussion of United States cyclical
fluctuations, we concluded that changes in hours per worker account for about a third of the
overall volatility in total hours and that the labor force participation rate is comparatively
acyclic. This means that changes in unemployment over the business cycle capture a great
deal of the change in total hours worked over the business cycle, and so to a first approx-
imation, understanding cyclical fluctuations in total hours amounts to understanding the
movement of workers between employment and unemployment. To the extent that search
theory informs us how workers move between unemployment and employment, search the-
ory could potentially play a key role in understanding movements in aggregate labor market


                                                 52
outcomes at business cycle frequencies.
   We have already established that there are large low frequency changes in unemployment
over time, and so now we examine whether these are the dominant source of low frequency
changes in aggregate labor market outcomes. We show that low-frequency changes in unem-
ployment account for a relatively small share of the movement in total hours for the period
from 1965 to 1995. They have become relatively more important since 1995, because the
magnitude of movements in total hours has diminished. Additionally, cross-sectional differ-
ences in unemployment currently account for a very small fraction of the overall dispersion
in total hours. This suggests that, although search theory has the potential to shed light on
the forces that shape the large low frequency movement in unemployment over time, it is
not likely to be of first order importance in understanding changes in total hours.
   We start by looking at the evolution of the cross-country average of trend total hours for
the 17 countries in our sample. Figure 21 shows a dramatic decline in total hours between
1965 and 1995. The magnitude of the drop exceeds 15 percent, which is again much larger
than the decline in total hours associated with business cycle fluctuations. There is a striking
similarity between the time series data for average unemployment and average total hours.
Whereas unemployment increased until the mid 1990s and declined thereafter, total hours
decreased until the mid 1990s and increased thereafter. And while unemployment displays a
net increase over the entire period, total hours displays a net decrease. Based on a cursory
look at the patterns, one might be tempted to conclude that the changes in total hours and
changes in unemployment are just two ways of describing the same phenomenon. However, a
somewhat closer look reveals some important differences. For example, whereas the decrease
in total hours was almost complete as of 1985, the unemployment rate continued to increase
sharply after 1985.
   A simple decomposition allows a more quantitative assessment of the importance of
unemployment rate changes. Our measure of total hours (H) is the product of hours per
worker (h) and the employment-population ratio (E/P ). And the employment-population
ratio can itself be expressed as the product of the participation rate (P R) and one minus
the unemployment rate (1 − UR). To see this note that if we let the stock of employed,
unemployed and total population be denoted by E, U, and P respectively, then P R =
(E + U)/P and 1 − UR = E/(E + U). Total hours can then be expressed as the product of
three terms:
                                    H = h · P R · (1 − UR)

The contribution of changes in unemployment to changes in total hours is accounted for by
the third term. Figure 22 plots the time series for the trend components of the cross-country

averages for each of these three series, with each value expressed relative to its 1965 value
in order to facilitate comparisons. By examining the relative change in each of these three
terms over time we can assess the importance of each component.
    The figure shows that over the entire period, the increase in the unemployment rate
reduced total hours by about four percent. At its peak, in the mid 1990s, the contribution
was around seven percent. While this is large relative to changes at business cycle frequencies,
it is much smaller than any of the other trend changes that took place in the labor market
over this same time period. For example, the increase in labor force participation raised
total hours by almost 15 percent, while the decrease in hours per employed worker lowered
total hours by 20 percent.
    The large trend changes in participation and hours per worker are probably not asso-
ciated with search frictions. The increase in participation is due entirely to the increased
participation of women, and it seems unlikely that search is a key factor in understanding
the widespread increase in female participation.43 And the decrease in hours per worker is

Attanasio, Low and Sanchez-Marcos (2008), and none even mentions search as an important element to
consider.

                accounted for by increases in vacation days and statutory holidays, decreases in the length
                of the full-time work week, and increases in part-time work. Once again, search frictions
                do not seem to be a key element in explaining these trends. We conclude that search is
                probably not a key element of the explanation for the dramatic decline in hours worked over
                the entire period since 1965.44
                   To pursue this a bit further, we focus on four individual countries—France, Germany,
                the United Kingdom and the United States. We begin in Figure 23 by displaying the series
                for total hours. All three European countries experienced a very significant drop in total
                hours over this period, ranging between 25 and 35 percent. In contrast, the change in total
                hours for the United States between 1965 and 2007 was relatively modest.
                   There are again some qualitative similarities between between the evolution of total hours
                and unemployment rates for these four economies. The United States had relatively little
                change in both its unemployment rate and total hours from 1965 to 2007, though in each
                case there are some low frequency movements between the two endpoints. And for each
                of the three other countries, there was a net increase in the unemployment rate and a net
                decrease in total hours over the period.

        Once again, these qualitative comparisons at the individual country level might lead
one to suspect that changes in total hours were dominated by changes in unemployment.
Figures 24–27 decompose low frequency movements in total hours for each of these four
countries. While the exact numbers vary a little across countries, these figures confirm the
earlier conclusion reached on the basis of cross-country averages—the participation and hours
per worker margins were collectively much more important than the unemployment margin
in accounting for changes in total hours. In particular, whereas total hours fell between 25
and 35 percent for the three European economies, the decrease accounted for by changes in
the unemployment rate was only between four and nine percent.
   A related but distinct calculation is to ask how important cross-sectional differences in
unemployment are in accounting for cross-sectional differences in total hours. More precisely,
we ask what would total hours be in a country relative to the United States if we were
to move individuals between employment and unemployment so as to give all countries
the same unemployment rate as the United States, but leave hours per worker and labor
force participation unchanged. Figure 28 reports the results of such an exercise based on

the 2005 cross-section. Consistent with the earlier calculations, we see that differences in
unemployment account for differences in total hours on the order of five percent or less. While
differences of this magnitude are quantitatively important from a business cycle perspective,
they are relatively small in the context of understanding the cross-sectional dispersion in
total hours across countries.

2.1.3   Unemployment Inflows and Outflows

One key feature of search models is that they make predictions about flows into and out
of unemployment. In our earlier analysis of business cycle fluctuations, we argued that
recessions are characterized by a short, sharp spike in the inflow rate into unemployment
and a persistent decline in the outflow rate. We are interested in knowing whether a persistent
decline in the unemployment outflow rate also accounted for the substantial increase in the
unemployment rate from 1965 to 1995 and the subsequent reversal. Unfortunately, data
availability limits the extent to which one can readily carry out such an analysis for a large
set of countries over a long time period. Nonetheless, there are data that can shed some light
on this issue, and recent work has made some headway in producing estimates for several
countries. In this section we summarize this evidence.
   The evidence that we present here supports the following three conclusions. First, there


                                                        59
are large differences in unemployment inflow and outflow probabilities across countries that
are not related to differences in unemployment rates. Second, in terms of accounting for
low frequency changes in unemployment, changes in both inflow and outflow probabilities
played a significant role. Third, there does not appear to be a systematic pattern regarding
the importance of changes in inflows and outflows that holds across countries. Moreover, for
some countries the relative importance of these two flows changes over time.
   Our main source of worker flow data is the OECD, which publishes the distribution
of unemployment duration for the current stock of unemployed workers. The coverage is
incomplete, starting at 1976 in some countries but not until 1983 for many other countries.
For the most part, therefore, these results apply to the post 1980 period. We emphasize that
many factors can influence unemployment duration distributions, including the prevalence of
switches between unemployment and inactivity, the role of temporary layoffs and temporary
jobs, the demographic and industrial composition of the workforce, etc.. The development of
high quality, comparable time series measures of worker flows which controls for variations
in these factors is an important issue for future work.
   We use data on employment, unemployment, and the fraction of workers who have been
unemployed for less than one month to make some inferences about the inflow and outflow
probabilities over time for a cross-section of OECD countries. A more thorough analysis
can be found in Elsby, Hobijn and Şahin (2008), and we refer the reader to that paper for
a detailed discussion of some key issues. To construct the unemployment outflow (or job
finding) probability, we use a version of equation (1), but impose steady state, ut = ut+1 and
u<1
 t  = u<1                                                             <1
       t+1 . Thus the unemployment outflow probability is just Ft = ut /ut , the fraction
of unemployed workers with duration less than one month. Intuitively, in steady state the
outflow of new workers balances the inflow, and so the fraction of workers unemployed for
less than a month is equal to the unemployment outflow. We use a similar approach to
construct the unemployment inflow probability. After correcting for time-aggregation, this
gives Xt = 1 − (1 − Ft )ut /et .45 Elsby, Hobijn and Şahin (2008) show how one can relax the
steady state assumptions by using additional information on the stock of unemployed by
duration. In the United States case, imposing steady state scarcely affects the behavior of
these two time series. More generally, for the points we emphasize here, the steady state
assumption is unimportant, and so we present simple estimates that use that assumption.
   We focus on data for four countries that illustrate our key points, France, Sweden, the
United Kingdom and the United States. Figure 29 presents a scatter plot of the trend unem-
ployment rate against the trend unemployment outflow probability for these four countries.
Two features are apparent. First, with the exception of the United States, there is negative

correlation between trend changes in the unemployment rate and trend changes in the un-
employment outflow probability. We will consider this in more detail later on in this section.
Second, even at a given level of trend unemployment, there are dramatic differences in the
unemployment outflow probability across countries. For example, all countries in this group
experienced a trend unemployment rate of six percent at some point during the sample pe-
riod. But at this level of trend unemployment, the trend unemployment outflow probability
varied from around five percent in France to around forty percent in the United States. Even
if we focus on the three European countries, the differences were still enormous, with the
probability for the United Kingdom three times as high as the probability in France, and
Sweden 1.5 times as large again.
   Figure 30 compares the trend unemployment rate with the trend unemployment inflow
probability for the same group of countries. Once again, two features are apparent. First,
for all countries except the United Kingdom, there is a positive relationship between changes
in the trend unemployment rate and changes in the trend unemployment inflow probability.
Second, even at a given unemployment rate, there were very large differences in unemploy-
ment inflow probabilities. At an unemployment rate of six percent, the unemployment inflow

probability varied by more than a factor of four.
    We next consider the issue of how changes in trend unemployment can be decomposed
into changes in inflow and outflow probabilities. Elsby, Hobijn and Şahin (2008) argue that
for this purpose one should focus on the log of the inflow and outflow probabilities and we
follow this practice. Figures 31 and 32 provide scatter plots for unemployment rates and
the log of inflow and outflow probabilities for the United States and the United Kingdom.
These two figures are of particular interest because they follow very different patterns. In
the United States, increases in trend unemployment were associated with effectively no
change in the unemployment outflow probability and an increase in the unemployment inflow
probability. That is, changes in trend unemployment were entirely accounted for by changes
in unemployment inflows. In contrast, the exact opposite is found in the United Kingdom.
Here there was effectively no change in the unemployment inflow probability, implying that
changes in trend unemployment were accounted for by changes in unemployment outflow
probabilities.
    Next we consider the dynamics for Sweden, presented in Figure 33. In this case, increases
in trend unemployment were accounted for by an increase in the unemployment inflow prob-

                              ability and decrease in the outflow probability that were almost equal in magnitude. Recall
                              that the trend unemployment rate followed a single peaked shape, so that there is an interval
                              of unemployment rates that occurred both during the upswing and during the downswing.
                              It is interesting to note that the relationship between the flows and unemployment appears
                              to have been fairly stable over time within Sweden, in the sense that the flow probabilities
                              associated with a given unemployment rate were independent of whether the unemployment
                              rate was increasing or decreasing.
                                 Finally, we consider France in Figure 34. Similar to the case of Sweden, we see that
                              increases in trend unemployment were accounted for both by a decrease in the outflow
                              probability and an increase in the inflow probability. However, here there was a marked
                              asymmetry between the pattern during the upswing and downswing in (trend) unemploy-
                              ment. Although the points are not labeled by year, the lower portion of the scatter plots
                              for unemployment rates higher than eight percent correspond to the post-1995 period, when
                              trend unemployment was falling. During the pre-1995 period, both factors contributed to the
                              increase in the unemployment rate, although the contribution of the change in the outflow
                              probability was somewhat greater. Indeed, looking more closely, we see that the unem-
                              ployment inflow probability stopped increasing when unemployment hit approximately eight
                              percent. The subsequent increase in the unemployment rate was accounted for entirely by

                             a decrease in the outflow probability. After 1995, trend unemployment started to fall. This
                             was entirely accounted for by a decrease in the unemployment inflow probability, with no
                             change in the outflow probability.
                                 In summary, and in contrast to business cycle frequencies, there are no strong empirical
                             regularities on worker flows that hold across all OECD countries. There were large differences
                             in worker flows across countries even when unemployment rates were the same. And in some
                             countries inflow probabilities explained most of the trend movements in unemployment, in
                             other countries outflow probabilities were more important, and in still other countries the
                             importance of the two factors varied over time.

                             2.1.4                Labor Wedge

                             In Section 1.1.6, we analyzed the cyclical properties of the labor wedge and argued that, from
                             the perspective of a standard representative household model, recessions are times when it
                             looks like the tax on labor is high. Prescott (2004) uses the same approach to analyze the
                             trend change in hours worked in the G-7 countries between the early 1970s and early 1990s.
                             He verified that variation in hours worked over time and across countries is associated with
                             variation in the labor wedge, but also argued that the wedge was largely accounted for by


                                                                                            65
measured labor and consumption taxes.
   Ohanian, Raffo and Rogerson (2008) extends this analysis to more countries and a longer
time period. While they found that changes in labor and consumption taxes account for a
large share of the change in the labor wedge for many countries, there are movements in the
labor wedge beyond those that can be explained by measured taxes. In some cases the wedge
that remained after accounting for labor taxes was positive, suggesting that individuals are
not able to work as much as they would like, while in others it was negative, suggesting that
individuals were working more than they would like to. Subsequent work has tried to account
for these cases as well. Rogerson (2008) and McDaniel (2009) argue that incorporating trend
movements from home production to market work (Aguiar and Hurst, 2007; Ramey and
Francis, 2009) helps to decrease the absolute size of the labor wedge in countries such as
the United States. And Ragan (2004) and Rogerson (2007) argue that modeling detailed
features of government spending in Scandinavia, such as child care subsidies, helps to explain
the relatively small labor wedge in those countries.
   More generally, the fact that changes in labor and consumption taxes account for a large
share of the changes in labor wedge is consistent with a model where individuals are on
their labor supply curves, after taking taxes into account. This supports our argument that
frictions are not a key part of the story behind the large trend changes in hours work.46


2.2     Theory
This section reviews two very distinct ways that search theory has been used to understand
the hump-shaped pattern in trend unemployment and the large differences in worker flows.
First, some papers have argued that workers’ search decisions play a quantitatively impor-
tant role in understanding both cross-country differences in worker flows and the different
evolutions of aggregate unemployment. For example, if workers choose to look less inten-
sively for jobs and become more selective about which jobs to accept, then holding all else
constant, unemployment durations will be longer. Second, other papers have taken advan-
tage of the fact that search creates a tractable framework with match specific rents in order
to explore whether wage determination is important in accounting for cross-country unem-
ployment patterns. For example, different labor market policies can influence the manner in
which match specific rents are shared and so change the profitability of job creation. This
affects unemployment flows and potentially also changes how trend unemployment responds
to shocks.
    We begin our discussion with a bit of background and context. The initial large and
  46
     Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson and Şahin (2009) show that adding empirically plausible search frictions
has virtually no impact on the relationship between taxes and total hours.

persistent increase in unemployment in some major European countries generated a nascent
literature seeking to explain the phenomenon; see Blanchard (2006) for a recent review. Here
we sketch a few details. From the outset, theories included two key components: shocks (or
driving forces) and propagation mechanisms. Simply put, something must have changed to
increase the unemployment rate, and the increase in unemployment reflected the process
through which these changes were propagated through the economy. An important early
contribution, summarized in Bruno and Sachs (1985), argued that shocks to oil prices and
the slowdown in productivity growth were the key driving forces, and that the failure of real
wages to adjust was the key propagation channel. Search theory played very little role in
this analysis.
   A related research effort, which culminated in the first edition of Layard, Nickell and
Jackman (2005), further developed a framework for analyzing how the interaction of shocks
and institutions influenced unemployment. Although this analysis did attribute some role
to the search behavior of workers, it did not involve any formal modeling of the search and
matching process.47
    As high unemployment persisted long after the oil shocks had dissipated and beyond the
initial decline in productivity growth, researchers looked for other driving forces. Krugman
(1994) emphasized broad-based technological change as the shock. The starting point for
Krugman’s theory was the observed increase in wage dispersion in the United States, par-
ticularly between low and high skill workers.48 Following many others, Krugman attributed
this increased dispersion to skill-biased technological change. He posited that this shock
should be present in all advanced economies. In the face of this common shock, labor mar-
ket responses differed across countries because of differences in labor market institutions.
Consistent with the earlier literature, Krugman also emphasized wage setting institutions.
But whereas the earlier literature had focused on how wage setting institutions affected the
change in the overall wage level, Krugman focused on how institutions affected the change in
wage dispersion. In the United States, he argued that wages were largely set in competitive
markets, so that skill-biased technical change increased wage dispersion but left unemploy-
ment relatively unchanged. In contrast, he argued that in many European economies, wage
setting institutions did not allow wages to become more spread out. Instead, unemploy-
ment increased for less-skilled workers. Again, this explanation did not attribute any role to
search.
   Although Krugman’s theory was intuitively appealing, subsequent work by Card, Kra-
  47
     Some of this work is summarized in the earlier contributions to this handbook by Johnson and Layard
(1986) and Nickell and Layard (1999).

marz and Lemieux (1999) found little support for the key mechanism in their study of
Canada, France and the United States. Still, the dominant approach remains the “shocks-
and-institutions hypothesis”: different unemployment evolutions are accounted for by a com-
mon shock that is propagated differently across countries because of institutional differences
(Blanchard and Wolfers, 2000).49 Numerous studies document differences in a variety of
labor market institutions, including labor taxes, employment protection, minimum wages,
unemployment benefits, and the nature of wage setting. The dramatic differences in unem-
ployment flows across countries even at the same unemployment rate suggests that these
institutions affect labor market outcomes; see Nickell and Layard (1999). A different pos-
sibility is that unemployment is changing over time across countries because institutions
are changing across countries. But Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) found that this was not
supported by panel measures of several labor market institutions. In particular, while they
argued that there has been some change in institutions over time, these changes account for
very little of observed changes in unemployment. On the other hand, they argued that the
data does support the view that unemployment changes could be accounted for by common
shocks which are propagated differently because of differences in institutions.
   While Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) pointed researchers in a particular direction, the
paper identified neither the common shock nor the key economic propagation mechanisms.
Recent work has sought to isolate the quantitatively important shocks and propagation
mechanisms, and in particular the institutional features that impact the propagation of
these key shocks. Not surprisingly, since search models have become the dominant models
for analyses of unemployment, most of the recent work in this literature has taken place
in theoretical models that feature search. Prominent examples include Bertola and Ichino
(1995), Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998, 2004, 2007), Marimon and Zilibotti (1999), Mortensen
and Pissarides (1999c); Pissarides (2007), and Hornstein, Krusell and Violante (2007). Each
of the above papers is also implicitly a theory of cross-country differences in unemployment
flows. Several other papers have used search theory to explore unemployment flows without
necessarily addressing the issue of how unemployment has evolved over time; see Bertola and
Rogerson (1997), Garibaldi (1998), Blanchard and Portugal (2001), Kugler and Saint-Paul
(2004), and Pries and Rogerson (2005).
   It is beyond the scope of this chapter to review this large literature. Instead, we focus
on two examples which illustrate the two roles that search theory has played. Ljungqvist
and Sargent (1998, hereafter referred to as LS) focus on the role of worker choices regarding
  49
     A notable exception is Daveri and Tabellini (2000), who emphasize cross-country differences both in
driving forces and institutions. More recently Nickell, Nunziata and Ochel (2005) have also argued that
differences in driving forces are important.



                                                  68
search. Hornstein, Krusell and Violante (2007, hereafter HKV) focus on how wage determi-
nation affects the profitability of job creation. A closely related point, also of interest in a
broader sense, is that the two papers propose fundamentally different views of the underlying
economic forces that have led to higher unemployment. While LS focus on the role of worker
choices, with firms playing a passive role, HKV focus on the choices of firms, with workers
playing a passive role.

2.2.1    Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998)

LS quantify a reasonable version of the shocks-and-institutions hypothesis. Their common
shock is an increase in “turbulence.” In their language, when a worker is laid off from her
job in a turbulent economy, her human capital often becomes less valuable or depreciates. A
simple example serves to illustrate what they have in mind. In one scenario, a worker in an
auto assembly plant loses her job due to lower demand for the particular model produced
by that plant, but then finds employment at a different auto assembly plant that is hiring
workers because of increased demand for its particular model. Although the worker may
suffer a spell of unemployment, she suffers no long term wage loss. In a second scenario,
there is a permanent decrease in employment in all domestic auto assembly plants, perhaps
because of labor-saving technological change or competition from lower-cost assemblers in
other countries. In this case, the laid-off worker not only loses her job and experiences a
spell of unemployment, but also suffers a drop in expected future wages since the demand
for her skills has fallen. LS argue that this second scenario became more prevalent in all
OECD countries starting some time in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   LS interact this common shock with differences across countries in social insurance
schemes for dealing with workers who suffer job losses. Although they label the policies
“unemployment insurance,” they interpret them broadly to include other programs for dis-
placed workers, such as disability and early retirement.50 In their analysis, LS focus on
two different institutional regimes. In one, which they label laissez-faire, there is no social
insurance at all. In the other, which they label the welfare state, a worker who loses her
job can collect a transfer payment equal to 70 percent of her pre-layoff wage as long as she
remains jobless, subject only to the proviso that she cannot reject a job that offers at least
as high as a wage as she earned before the layoff.

Frictionless Model Our goal is to assess whether search frictions per se improve our un-
derstanding of low frequency changes in labor market outcomes, and so we compare frictional
  50
    One issue in terms of connecting this analysis with the data is that individuals in these programs will
typically not be classified as unemployed.

and frictionless version of the LS model. We start with the simpler frictionless model. There
is a unit mass of workers, each of whom seeks to maximize a utility function of the form:
                                       ∞
                                       X
                                              (β(1 − α))t yt ,
                                        t=0


where β is the discount factor, α is the probability of death (assumed constant), and yt
is after-tax income in period t. When an individual dies, she is replaced by a newborn
individual. Note that individuals do not value leisure. This means that, even though the
analysis emphasizes the importance of labor supply responses, these responses are not based
on substitution between leisure and consumption.
   The key feature of the LS model is learning-by-doing when working and skill depreciation
when not working. Let h denote the human capital or skill level of a worker. A newborn
worker starts with some minimal level of human capital, which we normalize to 1. Subse-
quently, there are three transition functions that describe how human capital evolves. Let
µe (h, h′ ) be the probability that a worker who remains employed goes from human capital h
to human capital h′ . Similarly, let µn (h, h′ ) be the probability that a worker who is currently
not employed goes from human capital h to human capital h′ . Finally, to capture turbulence
as defined above, let µl (h, h′ ) be the probability that an employed worker who gets laid off
goes from human capital h to human capital h′ . In the economy without turbulence, there
is no loss in human capital upon layoff.
   LS assume a finite set of levels of human capital and parameterize the stochastic human
capital accumulation process as follows: when employed, human capital either stays the
same or improves by one level. When not employed, human capital either stays the same or
deteriorates by one level. It follows that human capital for a continuously employed (non-
employed) individual is weakly increasing (decreasing). Finally, when a worker with human
capital h is laid off in the turbulent economy, there is some probability that her human
capital remains unchanged, but with the remaining probability the worker receives a draw
from a distribution with support on [1, h].
   There is an unlimited supply of identical jobs, each of which offers a wage w per unit of
human capital. That is, a worker with human capital h earns wh if she works. We introduce
the base wage w to ease the comparison with the search theoretic version of LS, but it plays
no role in the frictionless model. When a worker is laid off, she can immediately move to
a new job if she wants. This means that, while layoffs can have a negative consequence for
human capital, they do not affect the opportunity to work.
   The final feature of the economic environment is a balanced-budget unemployment in-
surance system, financed by a proportional tax on income. The laissez-faire economy has no

                                                  70
unemployment insurance, while the welfare state economy pays a laid-off worker 70 percent
of her pre-layoff earnings until the worker opts to return to work.
    LS study four steady state outcomes: the laissez-faire and welfare state, each with and
without turbulence. First consider the laissez-faire economy without turbulence, so human
capital is unchanged following a layoff. In equilibrium, all individuals work until they die.
This follows immediately from the fact that individuals do not value leisure and always have
access to a job that offers positive earnings. The equilibrium of the welfare state without
turbulence is the same. Although in this economy a laid-off individual has access to life-long
unemployment benefits equal to 70 percent of her pre-layoff earnings, she can always find a
job that offers 100 percent. Since she does not value leisure, it is optimal to work. The basic
message is that, in some environments, large differences in unemployment insurance do not
affect equilibrium employment.
    Next we repeat this analysis when there is turbulence in the economy. The equilibrium
employment decisions in the laissez-faire economy are unchanged. Even though a laid off
worker may experience a large negative shock to her human capital, and thereby face lower
earnings prospects, it is still optimal for her to work, since leisure has no value. But the
equilibrium outcome in the welfare state economy is potentially affected. If a worker expe-
riences more than a 30 percent reduction in her human capital, then the one period return
to working is now lower than the one period return to collecting unemployment insurance.
Of course, working allows the individual to accumulate human capital, and so it may still
be optimal for her to work. But in general, a laid-off worker will stop working if the shock
is sufficiently bad. If she does not work in the period following the layoff, then her human
capital starts to depreciate. Since unemployment benefits last forever, she will never find it
optimal to return to work.
   This discussion highlights two key points. First, the impact of unemployment insurance,
and other social insurance programs more generally, on aggregate employment depends on
the underlying economic environment. In the absence of turbulence, even very generous
programs need not affect aggregate employment. Second, the LS model offers an example
in which a common shock to economies that have different labor market institutions can be
propagated very differently, with very different effects on aggregate employment. This holds
even in the absence of frictions.

Model With Search Frictions We now extend the model to allow for search frictions in
the spirit of Lippman and McCall (1976), as in the original LS article. A worker without a
job makes a decision regarding search intensity (s) that influences the probability of receiving
a wage offer w draw from the cumulative distribution function F with bounded support. The


                                              71
probability that a worker receives an offer is an increasing function π(s), while the utility
cost of searching while unemployed is an increasing function c(s). There is no on-the-job
search. Note that a worker’s income is the product of her wage and human capital, wh. The
wage stays constant on the job, but her human capital may increase. In the welfare state,
unemployment benefits are tied to past income.
    Search frictions affect model outcomes both through search intensity and through the
reservation wage. To understand how, note that in a standard worker search problem without
human capital, unemployment insurance reduces search intensity and raises the reservation
wage, both of which lead to longer unemployment durations and hence higher unemployment.
These forces are present even in this more complicated environment.
   This observation has two implications. First, it implies that even in the absence of tur-
bulence, the welfare state economy has higher unemployment than the laissez-faire economy
and that this higher unemployment is driven by differences in duration, although the effects
are quantitatively modest.
   Second, the behavioral response through search intensity and reservation wages amplifies
the effect of turbulence. Recall that in the frictionless model, a worker who experiences a
sufficiently large shock when laid off becomes non-employed forever. With search frictions
and skill depreciation while nonemployed, human capital continues to fall after the initial
layoff. This means that, even if the initial shock did not leave the worker preferring nonem-
ployment to working, she may slip into this absorbing state during a long unemployment
spell. Indeed, if she approaches a point at which she prefers unemployment to work at any
wage, her search intensity falls and reservation wage rises, so the job finding probability falls
smoothly to zero.
    The discussion so far has been entirely qualitative. A key contribution of LS is to assess
the quantitative importance of these factors. To do this, LS compute the steady state equi-
libria for each of the two UI regimes both with and without turbulence. The no-turbulence
laissez-faire economy is parameterized so as to match several features of the United States
economy in the 1970s. LS assume that all economies share the same preferences and tech-
nologies, and that the only difference is the unemployment insurance system.
   In the absence of turbulence LS find that both economies have similar steady state unem-
ployment rates, although long duration unemployment is more prevalent in the welfare state
economy with the UI system. This comparison is important, since as we noted previously,
unemployment duration was higher in France and Sweden than in the United States, even
when unemployment rates were similar.51 But when they introduce turbulence, they find
  51
    In fact, unemployment was actually lower in Europe than in the United States in 1970. Ljungqvist and
Sargent (2008) show how to modify their analysis to capture this feature.



                                                  72
that the welfare state moves to a steady state with much higher unemployment, whereas
unemployment in the laissez-faire economy changes relatively little. In addition, all of the
increase in unemployment is accounted for by increased duration of unemployment. Based
on these findings, LS conclude that an increase in turbulence combined with different un-
employment insurance systems is quantitatively important in accounting for the variation in
unemployment rate evolutions across countries.
   As we noted before, the higher unemployment that appears in the welfare state in tur-
bulent times is purely the result of worker choices. Indeed, there are no firms in the model.
In later work, Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004) extend the framework to an environment with
endogenous job creation and show that their results are basically unchanged. For our pur-
poses, the most important observation is that one can in principal obtain similar results even
without search frictions.

2.2.2    Hornstein, Krusell and Violante (2007)

HKV propose an alternative version of the shocks-and-institutions hypothesis. In this case,
the shock is an acceleration in capital embodied technological change, consistent with the
acceleration of the decline in equipment prices from the 1960s to the 1990s documented by
Gordon (1990) and Cummins and Violante (2002).52 As in LS, HKV examine the effect of
different unemployment benefit systems, but also broaden the set of relevant institutions to
include labor income and firing taxes. They find that the effect of an increase in the pace of
technological change depends on how wages behave, which in turns depends on the amount
of rents in the initial equilibrium, itself a function of these institutions.

Frictionless Model We again start with a version of the model that does not include
search so as to better understand what role search plays in the HKV’s analysis. There is a
unit mass of identical workers, each with preferences
                                      Z     ∞
                                                e−ρt (c(t) − γn(t))dt,
                                        0


where c(t) is consumption at time t, n(t) ∈ {0, 1} is labor supply at time t, and ρ is the dis-
count rate. The unit of production is a matched worker-machine pair, so the microeconomic
production technology is Leontief in machines and labor. Machines are indexed by age and
a matched worker-machine pair with age of machine a produces output e−ga . Output of a
new machine is normalized to one. The parameter g embodies two forces: depreciation and
  52
    Earlier work on technological change in the context of search models includes Aghion and Howitt (1994)
and Mortensen and Pissarides (1999c).


                                                       73
capital embodied technological change. Relative to the newest vintage, both of these forces
imply a negative effect of age on productivity. A new machine costs I units of output. There
is an unbounded set of potential entrants. A key assumption is that machines cannot be
upgraded. The scrap value of a machine is normalized to zero.
   Consider the steady state competitive equilibrium in this economy. There are two mar-
kets, one for output and one for labor. Let output be the numeraire and let w denote
the wage.53 Because this model features linear technology and preferences, equilibrium will
generically entail either everyone working or no one working. The only interesting case is
the one in which everyone works, so in what follows we will assume that parameters are such
that this is true in equilibrium.
   The only real decision in this economy is the age at which a machine gets scrapped. Given
a wage of w, a machine is scrapped at the age a solving w = e−ga , since this is the point at
which it is no longer profitable to operate the machine. Given that there is an unbounded
set of potential entrants, the equilibrium w is the one at which the present discounted value
of profit from entering is zero. This implies
                                     Z       − logg w
                                                        e−ρa (e−ga − w)da = I,
                                         0


so the present value of profits during the productive life of the machine just covers the initial
cost of the machine. This equation uniquely determines w.
   Now consider what happens to the steady state equilibrium of this economy if there is
an increase in the rate of obsolescence, i.e., an increase in g. Implicitly differentiating the
above expression shows that w must fall. The basic intuition is that if a machine becomes
obsolete more rapidly then it will be used for a shorter period of time, implying that wages
must decrease in order to maintain the profitability of investment. It also follows that the
scrapping age will decrease. The same must be true if there is an increase in the rate of
technological change: the wage relative to the productivity of the frontier technology must
fall, and the scrapping age decreases as well. In the economy without search frictions, this has
no consequences for unemployment or employment. Workers move directly from a machine
that is being scrapped to a new machine. There will, however, be more reallocation of
workers when g is larger. But the key point is that in order to maintain equilibrium in the
labor market, increases in the pace of technological change necessitate a decrease in wages
relative to the productivity of the frontier technology.
  53
    We follow HKV in measuring everything relative to the frontier technology so as to make the economy
stationary. This means that in our exposition, the wage is constant relative to the frontier, and so is actually
growing over time if there is capital embodied technological change.



                                                             74
Model With Search Frictions Now we return to the full HKV model with search fric-
tions. Similar to the model in Section 1.2, frictions are modeled through the use of a constant
returns to scale matching function, but here the inputs are unmatched workers and machines.
There are no search costs, only the upfront cost of a new machine. Workers separate from
matches for exogenous reasons at rate x. The machine still exists after a separation of this
sort and will look for a new worker.
    Wage determination is the key to HKV’s analysis. The presence of search frictions gives
rise to match specific rents and there are many ways that these can be divided. Following the
approach pioneered by Pissarides (1985) and Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), HKV assume
that wages satisfy the Nash bargaining solution. This gives rise to a wage function w(a).
In particular, and in contrast to the frictionless model, workers who work with machines of
different vintages are paid different amounts, since the rents associated with a given match
depend on the age of the machine.
   As before, free entry ensures that in equilibrium firms earn zero expected profits from
the purchase of a new machine. But two endogenous factors now influence profits: the
wage function and the fraction of time that the machine will be idle. Increased idleness and
higher wages both reduce profits. Zero profit can be achieved either with low idleness and
high wages or high idleness and low wages, or combinations in between. Note that, with a
constant returns to scale matching function m(u, v), a decrease in the idleness of machines
can occur only if unemployed workers find vacant machines at a lower rate, thereby increasing
unemployment duration. Thus equilibrium requires either higher unemployment and higher
wages or lower unemployment and lower wages. What happens depends on the wage function
w(a).
   With Nash bargaining, the response of wages to an increase in the rate of skill-biased
technical change g is influenced by various labor market policies. Intuitively, wages can
be thought of as having two components, one associated with the worker’s outside option
and the other with the worker’s share of the match specific rents. As the match specific
rents become smaller, rent-sharing represents a smaller fraction of the total wage. As a
result, the total wage responds less to g and frictions respond more. Labor income taxes
and unemployment benefits tend to reduce the surplus. To the extent that these policies are
more prevalent in Europe than the United States, there is less wage adjustment in Europe
and so more adjustment in the amount of time that workers spend idle.
   Once again, a key issue is the quantitative importance of this mechanism. HKV calibrate
the model to match features of the United States economy in the early 1970s. They then solve
for the steady state that corresponds to policy settings that represent a “typical” European
economy, assuming that Europe is identical to the United States in all non-policy factors


                                              75
except x, the rate at which workers separate from jobs for exogenous reasons.54 They then
increase the pace of technological change to the rate observed in the 1990s and solve for the
steady state equilibrium for both the United States and European economies. Their key
finding is that unemployment is much more responsive to the pace of technological change
in Europe than in the United States. The outflow from unemployment falls, due to the
decrease in investment in new machines, and the inflow rate increases, due to the reduction
in the scrapping age. Quantitatively, HKV find that the reduction in outflows accounts for
most of the increase in unemployment.
  As noted earlier, and in contrast to the analysis in LS, increased unemployment in this
model is attributed entirely to firms’ actions. Workers are completely passive, accepting any
job that they are offered. Unemployment increases primarily because firms create fewer new
machines and so post fewer vacancies. But the main role played by search is that it gives
rise to match-specific rents. Differences in how these rents are divided are important for the
behavior of aggregate unemployment.

2.2.3    Discussion

The main goal of this section has been to highlight how search theory has been used to
understand cross-country differences in labor market outcomes. Although we discussed two
papers in more detail, we view these as representative of a larger literature that has sought
to flesh out the shocks-and-institutions hypothesis. In closing, we discuss how well these
papers account for the key features of the data that we have previously described. We focus
on four dimensions.
   First, both models look only at the movement of workers between employment and unem-
ployment; neither has a participation margin or an hours margin. We previously documented
that the unemployment margin accounts for a relatively small fraction of the overall changes
in total hours, which raises the issue of whether it is appropriate to start with a framework
that abstracts from the quantitatively more important margins. More generally, given that
something must be generating these large changes in hours and participation, it is unclear
if it is reasonable to ignore these changes when thinking about unemployment.
     Second, both models solve for two steady state equilibria, one that corresponds to the
“earlier” period and the other that corresponds to the “later” period. But as we documented
previously, it does not look like Europe moved from a low unemployment steady state to a
high unemployment steady state. Instead, it seems more promising to think of a shock that
  54
     As noted above in the discussion of the LS model, a key fact is that unemployment in Europe was not
always higher than in the United States, despite the fact that European institutions have remained relatively
constant. The lower value of x in Europe is critical in allowing for the HKV model to be consistent with
this fact.

                                                     76
led to a long-lived but at least partially temporary increase in unemployment. One possibility
is that the shocks themselves are long-lived but temporary, but at a minimum this points
to the need for better measurement of the key forcing processes. For example, LS provide
indirect evidence on the increase in turbulence, based on work by Gottschalk and Moffitt
(1994) that decomposes earnings in the 1970s and 1980s into transitory and permanent
components. LS show that their calibrated model can replicate the key features of the
change in the decomposition in the United States. While this decomposition provides some
useful information, Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) do not directly measure the wage losses
associated with layoffs. Nor has anyone checked whether the changes in the decomposition
were reversed after 1995, when unemployment started to fall throughout the OECD. Finally,
both LS and HKV impose that the shocks are the same across countries, without offering
direct evidence on this point. That is, they do not directly test the shocks-and-institutions
hypothesis.
    Third, both models contrast outcomes in two economies, the United States and a “typ-
ical” European economy. But a key feature of our earlier data analysis is that there is a
large amount of heterogeneity in unemployment dynamics even across European economies,
both in terms of the magnitude of the increase and in terms of the timing of the peak. It
is also well known that there is substantial heterogeneity in institutions and policies across
economies. Accounting for the heterogeneity in outcomes across countries is an important
test for any theory of unemployment dynamics.
    Fourth, both papers focus entirely on aggregate outcomes. There is potentially a lot
of useful information in the disaggregated data that may help to distinguish competing
theories. Although we have not presented any detailed information about the patterns of
labor market outcomes in disaggregated data, we note two findings here: unemployment
differences are particularly pronounced among younger workers, while employment differ-
ences are particularly pronounced both for younger and older (but not prime-aged) workers.
More generally, incorporating differences in age, gender, and skill level may be useful for
distinguishing theories of labor market outcomes.55
    Finally, we want to address the role of search in these two papers. While LS emphasize
workers’ choices about search intensity and reservation wages, they do not show that search
frictions are important for propagating turbulence. To our knowledge, this question remains
unanswered. More generally, whether search intensity amplifies or mutes the response of the
economy to shocks may depend on the nature of the shock. For example, the unemployment
consequences of shocks that require reallocating workers across sectors may be muted by the
possibility of searching more intensively.
 55
      Kitao, Ljungqvist and Sargent (2009) is a recent example that moves in this direction.


                                                     77
    The analysis of HKV raises several interesting questions. First, we have emphasized that
differences in rent-sharing is a key mechanism in their model. While search models represent
a tractable framework that gives rise to match specific rents, we previously noted that other
mechanisms may also give rise to match-specific rents. We know of no attempt to measure
whether search frictions are an important source of match-specific rents, nor of any work
that has examined whether the source of rents is important for labor market outcomes.
   Second, note that HKV shares a common feature with Bruno and Sachs (1985) and
Krugman (1994), in that all three papers emphasize that unemployment increases when
wage setting institutions prevent wages from responding sufficiently following a particular
shock. A key difference is that HKV assume that wage setting institutions are fundamentally
the same across economies and over time, represented by a Nash bargaining solution with the
same bargaining weights in each country and at each point in time. Wage outcomes differ
because of the interaction between the wage setting institution and other labor market poli-
cies. Two interesting and open questions are the extent to which different economies in fact
have different wage setting processes and, if they do, how to model those differences. This
is of course not inconsistent with search theory. Indeed, one nice feature of the Mortensen
and Pissarides (1994) framework is that it can easily accommodate a wide variety of specifi-
cations for wage setting.56 Nonetheless, little work has sought to assess the extent to which
different countries should be modeled as having different wage setting processes. Recent
work that leads in this direction includes Mortensen (2003), who asks which of two wage
setting specifications better fits Danish microeconomic data, and Hall and Krueger (2008),
who use survey evidence to assess the relevance of different wage setting procedures in the
United States economy.


3      Conclusion
Our objective in this chapter has been to explore how the explicit introduction of search
frictions into otherwise standard macroeconomic models affects our understanding of aggre-
gate labor market outcomes in two different contexts. In our analysis of business cycles, we
found that the search framework is useful for interpreting facts about unemployment and
labor market flows. But we also found that search frictions tend to dampen fluctuations
in output and employment without significantly increasing their persistence. Moreover, by
dampening employment fluctuations, search frictions cause a counterfactual procyclical la-
bor wedge. In addition, using search theory did not lead us to introduce any important new
  56
   See the handbook chapter by Mortensen and Pissarides (1999c) for details on how different models of
wage determination can be embedded in search-theoretic models of the labor market.


                                                 78
shocks into the neoclassical growth model. On all of these counts, search behavior itself
does not seem intrinsically important for business cycle analysis. On the other hand, search
provides a promising environment for studying the implications of alternative wage setting
mechanisms, which many authors have argued are important at business cycle frequencies.
We remain hopeful that search will be an important component in understanding business
cycle fluctuations. In particular, we think that the ability of search models to connect with
data on job and worker flows will help to discriminate between alternative theories of wage
setting behavior.
    We also found some striking low-frequency patterns in unemployment and labor market
flows. For example, trend unemployment initially rose across the OECD but has since
fallen in almost every country. And there is substantial heterogeneity in the relationship
between unemployment and worker flows across countries and over time. Search is useful
for interpreting these facts. But unlike in the business cycle analysis, changes in trend
unemployment are typically much smaller than changes in hours per worker and labor force
participation. To the extent that search models lead one to focus only on unemployment,
we feel that the emphasis is misplaced. Still, many recent explorations of the shocks-and-
institutions hypothesis have taken place in models that feature search. While the role of
search frictions per se in these models is unclear, we are also hopeful that these models will
prove useful for understanding the extent to which differences in wage setting institutions as
well as other labor market institutions and policies are an important cause of differences in
labor market outcomes across countries.
   In interpreting our conclusions it is important to emphasize that we have focused through-
out on the role of search in macroeconomic models of the labor market. But we would be
remiss not to mention at least briefly the important role that search frictions play in four
distinct branches of the microeconomic literature on labor market outcomes.57
    First, search theory has served as the foundation for the analysis of optimal unemploy-
ment insurance. Shavell and Weiss (1979) explored the optimal provision of unemployment
insurance to a worker who must both choose how intensively to search and what wages to
accept. Most of the subsequent literature has focused on the search intensity margin (e.g.,
Hopenhayn and Nicolini, 1997; Chetty, 2008), although a few papers have looked at how
unemployment insurance affects reservation wages (Hansen and İmrohoroğlu, 1992; Shimer
and Werning, 2008). Search is fundamental to these papers, since each needs a model with
unemployment and a moral hazard problem in an environment with idiosyncratic risk. More
generally, models that feature search have been used to analyze many labor market policies.
  57
    Search frictions have also been used to model monetary exchange, housing, marriage, and over-the-
counter asset markets, among other topics.



                                                 79
Ljungqvist (2002), for example, shows that a model with search frictions has distinctive
implications for the effects of employment protection on aggregate employment.
   Second, search models have been useful in accounting for worker flows. There is a long
tradition of using single agent search theory to account for individual level data on unem-
ployment spells and wages.58 Search behavior plays an essential role in this literature. More
recently, equilibrium search models have been used to study data on turnover and wage dy-
namics. Many are based on the Burdett and Mortensen (1998) model of on-the-job search;
prominent examples include Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), Mortensen (2005), and Cahuc,
Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006). These papers take advantage of the availability of large
administrative matched worker-firm panel data sets to estimate the structural parameters
of the model and use the data to test alternative theories of wage determination. See Lentz
and Mortensen (2010) for a recent survey of this literature.
    Third, a number of authors have argued that search frictions may play an important role
in understanding the evolution of wage inequality. For example, Acemoglu (1999) presents a
model where an increase in the supply of skilled workers may change the composition of jobs
from a “pooling” equilibrium, in which firms facing search frictions create jobs suitable for
all workers, to a “separating” equilibrium, in which firms create different types of jobs for
different workers, leading to an increase in between-group wage inequality. Other authors
have explored the extent to which search models, by permitting violations of the law-of-one-
price, can generate within-group wage inequality. Hornstein, Krusell and Violante (2009)
argue that within a broad class of search models, the possibility of an economically signifi-
cant amount of within-group inequality is limited by the possibility of waiting for better job
opportunities. On the other hand, Marimon and Zilibotti (1999) show how the interaction be-
tween search frictions and unemployment benefits can generate substantial inequality across
ex ante identical workers. Shimer and Smith (2000), Shi (2002), and Shimer (2005a) develop
theoretical search models with heterogeneous workers and firms that make predictions for
both within- and between-group inequality. These models have been explored empirically,
for example by Abowd, Kramarz, Lengermann and Pérez-Duarte (2004) and Lopes de Melo
(2009).
   Finally, a few papers have used search frictions to address existing issues in the labor
contracting literature. In particular, building on Gale (1996) and Inderst and Wambach
(2001, 2002), Guerrieri, Shimer and Wright (2009) show that search can naturally resolve
problems related to the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in adverse selection models.
Their applications include a labor market rat race, where high productivity workers agree

   Early examples include Flinn and Heckman (1982) and Wolpin (1987). See also the discussions in
Mortensen (1987) and Eckstein and Van den Berg (2007) and the references contained therein.

to an inefficiently high level of hours and employment in order to separate themselves from
less productive workers, and the absence of private insurance against the risk of a layoff,
where high productivity workers are willing to work without insurance in order to indicate
that they are not concerned with this eventuality. More generally, one might expect search
frictions to interact with standard issues that arise in labor contracting.
   In concluding, it is useful to return to our discussion in the introduction regarding the
three different ways that search might matter in macroeconomic models. At this point,
we do not see much evidence that search behavior per se is of first order importance in
understanding aggregate outcomes in either of the contexts that we considered. However,
adding search to otherwise standard macroeconomic models definitely expands the ability of
these models to connect with various pieces of empirical evidence. And models that feature
search do create a useful framework in which to consider various wage setting mechanisms.
Further clarifying the role of search in assessing substantive issues involving the aggregate
labor market is an important task for future research.
