Private and Social Incentives for Fertility: Israeli Puzzles
Charles F. Manski and Joram Mayshar
NBER Working Paper No. 8984
June 2002
JEL No. J1, H2



                                               ABSTRACT

        Whereas most of the world has experienced decreasing fertility during the past half century, Israel
has experienced a puzzling mix of trends. Completed fertility has decreased sharply in some
ethnic-religious groups (Mizrahi Jews and non-Bedouin Arabs) and increased moderately in other groups
(non-ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi and Israeli-born Jews). In a phenomenon that can only be described as
a reverse fertility transition, fertility has increased substantially (from about 3 to 6 children per women)
among ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi and Israeli-born Jews. This paper explores how private and social
incentives for fertility may have combined to produce the complex pattern of fertility in Israel. Theoretical
analysis of the social dynamics of fertility shows that this pattern could have been generated by the joint
effects of (a) private preferences for childbearing, (b) preferences for conformity to group fertility norms,
and (c) the major child-allowance program introduced by the Israeli government in the 1970s.
Econometric analysis of fertility decisions shows that fundamental identification problems make it
difficult to infer the actual Israeli fertility process from data on completed fertility. Hence we are able to
conjecture meaningfully on what may have happened, but we cannot definitively resolve the Israeli
fertility puzzles.

1. Introduction



        Demographers have long wavered between two perspectives on fertility behavior: Homo

Economicus, who chooses an optimal family size, and Homo Sociologicus, who conforms to social

norms (see Hammel 1990). These two perspectives dominate the ongoing debate on the underlying

sources of the fertility transition - the recent historic sharp decline in fertility toward rates that are

below replacement. Summaries of this debate by Cleland and Wilson (1987) and by Bongaarts and

Watkins (1996) find fault with the “economic approach” for failing to explain why the fertility

transition has occurred in different places under rather different economic conditions, and why the

initial stage of the transition is so rapid, relative to the more gradual pace of economic change. Both

articles cite a general need to incorporate “sociological” elements into economic models of fertility,

and a particular need to understand how social norms affect fertility and evolve.

        Although discussions of fertility sometimes give the impression that economics and

sociology offer competing models of fertility, the two approaches are compatible with one another.

Women may choose family size to maximize utility functions that recognize both private and social

incentives for fertility, and social incentives may themselves evolve as an outcome of these

childbearing decisions. Indeed a rapidly growing literature on the economics of social interactions

has sought to understand how such processes operate in education, residential choice, labor markets,

and many other environments [see Becker and Murphy (2000), Manski (2000), and the references

therein]. Kohler (2001) presents a recent attempt to formally incorporate social interactions into the

analysis of fertility choice.

        This paper explores how private and social incentives for fertility may have combined to

produce the rather complex fertility pattern observed in Israel in the past half-century. Table 1

summarizes random sample data on completed fertility (lifetime number of children) among Israeli

women alive and married in 1995, who married either before 1955 or in the period 1970-80. The

table is based on a special file that merged information from the 1983 Census and the 1995 national

fertility in Israel displays considerable variation both over time and across major ethnic/religious

sub-groups of the population.

       Comparing women married prior to 1955 with those married 1970-80, the table shows that

completed fertility declined among Jewish women of Mizrahi origin (whose father was born in Asia

or North Africa) and among non-Bedouin Arab women, in accords with trends worldwide. Yet

childbearing increased in all other sub-groups of the population. It increased slightly (from 3.06 to

3.12) among non-ultra-orthodox Jewish women whose parents were born in Israel, and moderately

(from 2.29 to 2.88) among non-ultra-orthodox women of Ashkenazi origin (whose father was born in

Europe or America). In a phenomenon that can only be described as a reverse fertility transition,

fertility increased rapidly and substantially (from 3.03 to 5.91, and from 2.76 to 5.88) among ultra-

orthodox women of these origins.

       What explains the dissimilar levels and trends in completed fertility among different groups

of Israeli women? It is easy to suggest a set of private and social forces that may have combined to
                                                              4

yield the complex pattern of fertility depicted in Table 1. The potentially relevant sources of time-

series and cross-sectional variation in fertility include these:1



The fertility transition: Standard economic and social-cultural explanations of the fertility transition

can readily rationalize the substantial declines in fertility among Israeli Arabs and among Jews of

Mizrahi origin. In both groups, women married prior to 1955 largely lived in traditional societies

characterized by low income and high child mortality, but women married in 1970-1980 lived in the

western-oriented society of modern Israel, characterized by relatively high income and low child

mortality.



Religiosity: Ultra orthodox Jewish women follow the directives of their rabbis, who encourage high

fertility and discourage the use of contraceptives. Other Jewish women may hold varying preferences

for family size and are not subject to strong religious strictures against contraception.



Social Interactions: The various ethnic and religious sub-populations of Israeli have interacted to

different degrees over the past half-century, and so may have been subject to different social norms

for childbearing. Adoption of the fertility norms of Ashkenazi Jews by the Mizrahi Jews, most of

who migrated to Israel in the 1950s, may partly explain the fertility decline in the latter group.

Increased integration between these two groups may partly explain the increased fertility among the

former. Yet, throughout the past half-century, the Jewish ultra-orthodox, the Jewish non-ultra-

orthodox, and the Arab sub-populations of Israel have largely resided, been schooled, and worked in

separate, almost isolated communities.



Recent history: The traumatic decimation of European Jewry in the Holocaust may have affected

fertility in the period following World War II. Thus, it is sometimes argued that the Holocaust

1

                                                   5

reduced the fecundity of the women who were directly affected, but increased the desire to have

children among survivors and the kin of non-survivors. It has also been suggested that the relatively

high death rates experienced or expected by some sub-groups of Israelis in repeated wars may have

increased the desired number of children, as a form of insurance.


Child allowances and related public welfare programs. Changes in public policy have generated

time-series variation in private incentives for fertility. In 1970-75, the Israeli government introduced

a universal (non income-tested) child allowance program that ranks among the most generous in the

world. Modest monthly payments are made to families with one or two children under age 18, but

the payments for each child from the fourth up are substantial. The 1960s and early 1970s also saw

the introduction of other major welfare programs that reduced the private cost of childbearing and

childcare. On the whole, women married prior to 1955 bore their children before the introduction of

the child allowance and other welfare programs, while women who married after 1970 were subject

to them throughout their childbearing years.

          Juxtaposition of the child allowance program and the Israeli fertility patterns in Table 1

suggests that enactment of the allowance program in 1970-75 may explain some of the trends shown,

particularly the reverse fertility transition among the ultra-orthodox of Ashkenazi origin. However,

the same allowance program applied to other segments of the Jewish population, who experienced a

variety of different fertility trends.



          These and perhaps other disparate forces have somehow combined to determine fertility in

Israel.    The puzzle, or set of puzzles, is how to disentangle these forces and identify the

socioeconomic process at work. From a public policy perspective, there is particular interest in

learning how the child allowance and other welfare programs have affected, and continue to affect,

fertility. From a social science perspective, there is a general interest in learning how private and

social incentives interact to determine childbearing. This paper addresses the puzzles posed by
                                                            6

Israeli fertility patterns and makes some, albeit incomplete, progress towards its resolution.

         We begin with the public policy question, focusing on the child allowance program. Section

2, which draws on Mayshar and Manski (2001), describes the history of the program, compares it

with similar ones in Europe, and recalls Malthus’ hypothesis on the fertility effects of child

allowances. We also present in this section a more complete picture of how Israeli fertility evolved

over time for different social groups.

         The empirical associations that we find between the child allowance program and the time-

series variation in fertility are intriguing but necessarily inconclusive. The challenge is to dig

beneath these associations to learn how private and social incentives may have combined to

determine fertility. Section 3 poses a model of family-size decisions that flexibly represents some

aspects of decision making while abstracting from others. The model assumes that, at some point

after marriage, a woman chooses a family size that is optimal, given the information available at the

time.2 The woman’s valuation of bearing a given number of children depends on her private

preference for family-size, her preference for conformity to social norms in childbearing, and the

child allowance that the mother would receive. Perhaps the main respect in which the model

abstracts from actual childbearing behavior is its neglect of the dynamics of birth timing, a subject

that has been a focus of some recent economic research (see Hotz and Miller, 1988, Walker 1995).

Abstracting from timing issues enables us to determine how optimal family size varies with fertility

preferences, social norms, and child allowances.

         Our model of family-size decisions, although simple in many respects, is still too complex in

its general formulation to permit much in the way of theoretical analysis. After making further

simplifying assumptions, we are able to characterize the social dynamics of fertility with

considerable clarity. Given these assumptions, we find that a proportional allowance formula, in

  We follow the long tradition in demography of attributing fertility decisions to women rather than to couples. This
attribution is merely semantic in the large majority of cases in Israel, which has been characterized by low rates of non-
marital childbearing and divorce.
                                                            7

which the magnitude of the benefit is proportional to the number of children, generates a simple

dynamic in which the distribution of family size converges to a unique steady state. In this case, the

value of steady-state mean family size varies linearly with the magnitude of the allowance; it is

however independent of the magnitude of preferences for conformity to social fertility norms and of

the dispersion of the distribution of private fertility preferences.

         A piecewise linear allowance formula of the type enacted in Israel is then shown to generate

rather different dynamics. It continues to be the case that the distribution of family size converges to

a steady state. However, steady-state mean family size now does depend on preferences for

conformity to social norms and on the shape of the distribution of private fertility preferences.

Moreover, some configurations generate multiple steady states, some being locally stable and others

not. Performing numerical calculations in particular cases, we are able to demonstrate that small

changes in the magnitude of allowances or in private fertility preferences can, in principle, yield

rather large changes in mean fertility; on the order of the changes observed in Israel between 1950

and 1980.3

         Section 4 describes our efforts to use the fertility model developed in Section 3 to interpret

the actual decisions made by Israeli women. The goal was to estimate a version of the model that

could be applied to examine how Israeli child allowance policy has affected family-size decisions.

Unfortunately, we were not able to credibly separate the effects on decision making of child

allowances, private fertility preferences, and preferences for conformity. Our attempts to fit

reasonably flexible versions of the model yielded unstable, unreliable estimates. A qualitatively

‘sensible’ estimate of the effect of child allowances on fertility emerged only when we maintained

assumptions that we feel are too strong to be believable.

         The main contribution of Section 4 is to explain the identification problem that we faced

3
  Previous research on endogenous social interactions, wherein each decision-maker is influenced by the decisions of
others, has shown that such interactions can produce social multipliers that magnify the individualistic effects of policy
interventions (see Manski, 1993). Previous research has also shown that endogenous interactions can generate complex
                                                           8

when attempting to estimate the fertility model. The basic problem, common to all econometric

analysis of choice behavior, is that observation of a woman’s chosen family size only partly reveals

her preferences; hence the fertility preferences of Israeli women cannot be learned in an entirely

empirical manner. A specific problem in our analysis is that the information about preferences

revealed by data on completed fertility depends qualitatively on the shape of the child allowance

formula that women face; revealed preference analysis is more difficult when the benefit is

proportional to family size than when it is nonlinear. The Israeli allowance has, to varying degrees

over the years, been nonlinear in family size. However, we found in practice that nonlinearity of the

formula provides an insubstantial foundation for empirical analysis.

         Viewing our work in toto, we see a clear empirical contribution in our description of the

complex time-series and cross-sectional pattern of Israeli fertility (Section 2). Our theoretical

analysis of the joint determination of fertility dynamics by private preferences, preferences for

conformity, and child allowances helps to understand how such a complex pattern of fertility may

have come to be (Section 3). However, our structural empirical analysis of fertility decisions does

not persuasively disentangle the forces at work (Section 4). This being so, we can at best conjecture

on the processes that have generated Israeli fertility. Section 5 presents our concluding thoughts.

dynamics with potentially multiple steady states (see Brock and Durlauf, 2001). Our findings are based on an interaction
model that differs in some respects from those studied earlier.

2.1. The Israeli Child Allowance Program



           The Israeli welfare state has subsidized childbearing and childcare through a number of

mechanisms, including provision of free education and health insurance, generous maternity grants,

tax benefits for working mothers, and housing benefits that depend on the number of children.4 In the

major tax reform of 1975, Israel instituted a generous child allowance program that quadrupled the

allowances granted up to 1969.5 Since 1975, the National Insurance Institute (NII) has annually

allocated more than 1.6 percent of GDP to this program. A notable feature of the program is that the

size of the allowance varies substantially with the birth order of the child, with the first two children

under age 18 receiving minimal benefits, and each child from the fourth on receiving a large benefit.

           Enactment of the child allowance program was in part a response to growing ethnic

discontent among Mizrahi Jews who had immigrated to Israel from Arab countries after 1948 or

from North Africa in the early 1960s. These Jews were often poor and had large families. A

universal child allowance was thought at the time to be an effective way to reduce their poverty,

without creating the work disincentives thought to be characteristic of income-tested benefits.6 In

fact, enactment of the child allowance program appears to have had a dramatic short run impact in




4
    See Doron and Kramer (1991) for background on the development of Israel’s welfare system.
5
 The child allowance program enacted under the 1975 tax reform replaced a complex system of benefits for children that
included tax credits, small mandatory child payments by private employers, minor allowances by the NII to large
families, and a more substantial allowance to children of army veterans that had been enacted in 1971.
6
 The report of the national commission that recommended the 1975 tax reform (State of Israel, 1975) indicates that the
possible impact of child allowances on fertility was not an important consideration at the time. Moreover, an earlier
commission of demographers (State of Israel, 1966), set up to study pro-natalist policies, had concluded in 1966 that: “it
would not be appropriate to recommend monthly grants for families as an incentive to have children for the following
reasons: small grants do not have any impact on increased fertility… if the grant ...would be ...large, then considerable
sums of money will flow to large families, for whom it would not provide a birth incentive, because they do not practice
birth control anyway, but it could turn out to be a factor that discourages bread-winners from working.”
                                                           10

reducing the incidence of poverty among Israeli children in the mid-1970s. Since then, however, the

percentage of Israeli children living below the poverty line has steadily increased.7

         The child allowance program uses a credit point system under which mothers receive a

monthly, tax-exempt allowance from the NII, the allowance equaling the number of credit points to

which her children are entitled, multiplied by the cash value of a credit point. The number of credit

points depends on the number of children in the family who are below the age of 18; prior to 1997, it

also depended on whether the family had the status of ‘army veterans.’8 Appendix Table A-1

presents the credit point formula in effect from 1975 through 2000. Figure 1 shows how the New

Israel Shekel (NIS) value of Israeli child allowance benefits has evolved over the longer period 1965-

1999.

         As Figure 1 and Table A-1 indicate, various adjustments have been made in the child

allowance program since 1975. The real value of credit points eroded initially due to inflation, but

has been fully linked to the CPI since 1987. In addition, repeated changes have been made in the

credit point formula, with the number of credit points for children of high birth-order gradually

increasing over time. In 1983, the number of credit points allocated to families with veteran status

and four or more children increased by fifty percent.9 In 1994 and 2000, the credit points for

children from the fourth up were raised further.



7
  According to NII annual reports, the incidence of child poverty rose from 9.6% to 13.9% between 1979 and 1984.
Using somewhat different definitions, between 1987 and 1997, the incidence of child poverty rose from 9.5% to 11.8%
among families of wage earners, and from 20.5% to 21.8% in the population at large. The increase in the overall
incidence of child poverty, despite the significant decline of family size among the relatively poorer two main sub-groups
of the population, Arabs and Mizrahi Jews, can be explained by the increased weight of these two groups in the
population, and, in addition, by the increased family size and population weight of ultra-Orthodox Jews.
8
 The conditions for obtaining veteran status prior to 1993 were such that almost all Jews received it, including the ultra-
Orthodox who by and large did not serve in the army. Almost all Arabs, for whom army service is voluntary, did not
receive it. Beginning in 1993, the dependence of the allowance on veteran status was gradually phased out over four
years. From 1997 on, all children receive the full allowance.
9
 Between 1985 and 1992, fiscal concerns led to suspension of the allowance for the first child to families with fewer than
four children and with income above a certain low threshold; in 1991-2 this suspension was extended to the second child.
This created some work disincentives and administrative confusion due to the income threshold, and also implied that the
                                                                 11

        As Table A-1 shows, the marginal allowance granted for children from the fourth up fully

covers the marginal cost of caring for these children in a manner that averts poverty, as calculated

using Israel’s official poverty line for families of different sizes. To give a sense of the magnitude of

the allowances, consider families with six children under age 18. In 1999, such families received a

monthly tax-exempt allowance of NIS 2,566, equivalent to about $640 per month, and to 39 percent

of the income level officially defined to mark the poverty line for families of that size.

2.2. European Child allowances and the Malthusian Hypothesis


        Allowances for children are not new. Already in the second century AD, an extensive

alimenta system of public subsistence payments to children was in force in Rome. According to

Duncan-Jones (1974, 295), this system was “evidently intended to encourage a rise in the birth-rate.”


marginal allowance for the fourth child whose total allowances were kept intact (for families with income above the
income threshold) increased from 3.75 to 4.75 and then to 5.75 credit points.
                                                         12

The motivation apparently was the shortage of Romans to run the empire, but other historians

emphasize other motives.

         The English Poor Laws, initiated during the reign of Elizabeth I, were clearly motivated by

welfare considerations rather than by a pro-natalist sentiment. As is well known, it was a proposal by

William Pitt to increase family benefits for the poor that prompted Thomas Malthus’ 1798 Essay on

the Principle of Population. In the fifth chapter, Malthus contended that providing financial support

for poor families as a function of family size would not contribute toward alleviating poverty; to the

contrary, in the long run it would exacerbate poverty by encouraging poor families to have more

children or to work less. According to Malthus, well-intended allowances for families in need may

thus become a trap that could contribute toward perpetuating poverty in general, and among children

in particular.10 The empirical validity of Malthus’ hypothesis on the fertility effects of the English

Poor laws was subject to much criticism, but a recent study by Boyer (1989) seems to confirm

Malthus.

         Modern day child allowances seem to be motivated by a mixture of concern for the welfare of

children and concern with forecasts of declining population. The latter was clearly paramount in the

case of France and Belgium, which introduced universal child allowances in the 1930s. Following

their lead, all European countries and almost all other developed countries in the world followed suit

— with the notable exception of the United States.11 Notwithstanding the large magnitude of these

programs, there has been no definitive study of the demographic effects of modern European

programs of child and family support. Yet the consensus seems to be that these programs have had

at most a negligible impact on fertility. It is often noted that France, with possibly the most generous

(and complex) child support program in the world, has an overall birth rate no higher than that of


10
   Under Malthus’ influence, Pitt withdrew his proposal. Later on, Britain radically amended its poor laws, still much
influenced by Malthus’ ideas.

neighboring countries, where the allowance program is less extensive. Based on an econometric

study of 22 industrialized countries from 1970 to 1990, Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) have reported

that child support programs may have had a positive effect on birth, but one of a very small

magnitude. Specifically, they estimate that a 25% increase in child support benefits would increase

total fertility from an average of 1.71 children per woman to 1.78 children per woman. Several

studies on European countries have concluded that pro-natalist policies have encouraged women to

give birth earlier, yet have had practically no effect on total lifetime births (see Walker, 1995;

Gauthier and Hatzius, 1997).



2.3. Fertility Patterns in Israel



         The standard source of information on fertility in Israel has been annual data on total fertility,

a construct that measures the average lifetime number of births a woman would have if she were to

give birth over time according to the current birth rates of women of different age cohorts. Figure 2

presents the time series of total fertility in Israel among the three major ethnic sub-populations:

Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Arab Moslems.12 The figure shows a significant decline up to

the middle 1970s and middle 1980s within the latter two groups, and a fluctuating total fertility rate

among Ashkenazi Jews.13




12
  The trend in total fertility of Arab Christians, not shown in the figure, differs from that of Arab Moslems. The total
fertility rate of Christians initially was similar to that of Moslems, but declined by the 1990s to levels below that of
Ashkenazi Jews.
13
   Berman (2000) has used data from surveys of the Israeli labor force to estimate total fertility among Israeli ultra-
orthodox in the periods 1980-84 and for 1994-96. He finds (Table VI) that total fertility increased from 6.9 to 7.8 among
Ashkenazi ultra-orthodox, and from 4.6 to 7.2 among Mizrahi ultra-orthodox. Berman interprets this recent rise in total
fertility, as well as increased religious stringency and reduced labor participation, as a response of a “club to a change in
wages and [non child-specific] transfers” (p. 940, parenthetical explanation added).

         Figure 2: Total Fertility rates of the Main Sub-populations in Israel, 1949-1996



       The trends depicted in this figure do not suggest that the child allowance program, enacted in

1970-5, has had any material effect on fertility. However, total fertility is a synthetic-cohort

construct that may not adequately represent the childbearing decisions of actual women. Moreover,

the Malthusian hypothesis concerning the fertility effects of child allowances should apply primarily

to poor families, who form just part of the large sub-populations depicted in Figure 2. For these

reasons, we decided to obtain data that would enable a less aggregated and more accurate portrayal of

Israeli fertility patterns than has previously been possible.

       At our request, the Central Bureau of Statistics prepared a special data file merging

information from the 1983 Census of Population and Housing and the 1995 Population Registry. We

begin with the random sample of households in which the husband and wife completed the ‘long

form’ of the 1983 Census. Within these households, we identified all women born between 1920

and 1960 who were married at the time of the census, whose husbands were also enumerated, and
                                                             15

whose national identity card numbers appear in the 1995 Population Registry.14 The Population

Registry links the identity numbers of children to those of their mothers; hence we were able to

determine the number and age of children born to each woman until 1995.15

         To understand Israeli fertility patterns, we felt it important to disaggregate the three major

ethnic sub-populations into more homogeneous groups. Information collected from respondents to

the 1983 Census made it straightforward to distinguish Bedouins from other Arabs, and to

distinguish Jews whose parents were born in Israel from those whose parents immigrated to the

country.16 We also thought it important to disaggregate Jewish Israelis by degree of religiosity,

particularly to distinguish ultra-orthodox Jews from others. This was more problematic, because

respondents to the 1983 Census were not asked to report their religious practices. We ultimately

used a schooling-based criterion, previously applied by Dahan (1998), whereby families are

identified as ultra-Orthodox if the last place of study that was reported by the husband in the 1983

census was a post-secondary yeshiva (an orthodox institute of religious study).17

         Table 1, introduced in Section 1, uses the merged Census and Population Registry data to

present completed fertility rates within each of eight groups defined by ethnic origin and religiosity.

The table provides a simple ‘before-and-after’ perspective on the association between fertility and

the 1970-5 child allowance program. To accomplish this, we distinguish women married prior to

1955, who generally completed child-bearing before initiation of the program, from those married in

14
   In cases where a woman had multiple marriages, here and throughout the paper we use “year of marriage” to mean
“year of first marriage.”
15
   The linkage of children’s identification numbers to those of their mothers is quite accurate for children born after
1960, but incomplete for children born in the 1950s and almost nonexistent for children born earlier. Fortunately, the
1983 census itself provides information on the total number of live births up to that year. A detailed explanation of the
manner in which we combined Population Registry and Census data to determine each sampled woman’s births is
available in a technical memorandum which can be obtained from the authors upon request.
16
  In principle, we could further disaggregate those with Israeli-born parents into Ashkenazi and Mizrahi subgroups. We
do not do so because the samples of ultra-orthodox segments of these subgroups are quite small.

17
   See Mayshar and Manski (2001) for analyses of fertility patterns that use alternatives to this criterion for identification
of religiosity.
                                                          16

the period 1970-1980, who were eligible for the allowances throughout most or all of their

childbearing years. The table excludes women married between 1955 and 1970 because their

childbearing period straddles the date of the policy change. It excludes those married after 1980,

who were married only shortly before the 1983 census and had less then 15 years of marriage up to

1995.18

          The disaggregated data on completed fertility in Table 1 present a more nuanced portrayal of

Israeli fertility patterns than do the more aggregated data on total fertility presented in Figure 2. As

already discussed in Section 1, the table shows that Israel manifests the worldwide trend towards

reduced childbearing only within the Mizrahi-Jewish and Arab-non-Bedouin sub-populations.

Within all other groups, completed fertility among women married in the period near the 1975

reform is higher than among women married earlier on. The increase in completed fertility among

ultra-orthodox Jews of non-Mizrahi origin is little short of astonishing. On average, women in these

groups approximately doubled their childbearing, from about three children per women to about six.

          Other analyses of our sample data reinforce the impression that the completed fertility rates

of ultra- orthodox Ashkenazi Jews substantially increased in the period around the 1975 tax reform.19

The discussion below focuses on Jewish Israelis because Arab Israelis, not having veteran status,

generally did not receive significant child allowances at any point during the period of our analysis.

          Figures 3 and 4 supplement the data on averages in Table 1, while concentrating on the

fertility among ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi women. In Figure 3 we present the entire distribution of

completed fertility, comparing those married before 1955 with those married in 1970-1980. The

figure demonstrates the substantial shift rightward in the distribution. The mode increased from two

to five children. The percentage of women with three children or less fell from 78% to 23%.


18
  Some women who married before 1980 were still of child bearing age in 1995. We used ethnic-group, age-specific
fertility rates for 1994-5 to predict childbearing by these women after 1995.

19
  The sample of ultra-orthodox Jews with Israeli born parents is too small to support the analyses to be discussed, so we
now focus on the ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi Jews.

       Figure 4 moves away from completed fertility and compares the kernel-smoothed age-

specific fertility rates of ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi women in the five-year periods that just straddle

the 1970-5 allowances reform: 1965-9 and 1975-9. For women of age 21 and below, the age-specific

rates are essentially identical in the two periods. However, the rates for women of age 22 and above

are persistently higher in the latter period, indicating a marked change in fertility behavior.

       The final descriptive evidence that we present in Figure 5 shows kernel-smoothed completed

fertility rates by year of marriage, for each of the four sub-groups of Israeli Jews whose parents were

not born in Israel. The overall message of Figure 5 is surprisingly simple to describe, albeit not to

explain. During 1945-1950, completed fertility varied by ethnicity, with Mizrahi women bearing

about three times as many children as did Ashkenazi women. Thirty years later, during 1975-1980,

completed fertility again separates the population into two groups, but now the relevant dimension is

religiosity rather than ethnicity, with ultra-orthodox women bearing about twice as many children as

non ultra-orthodox Jewish women. Such large, group-specific changes in fertility present an

intriguing puzzle, or set of puzzles.

3. Family-Size Decisions: Private Preferences, Child Allowances, and Social Interactions



       To do more than speculate about the fertility patterns described in Section 2, it seems

essential to model the family decision processes that generate the population statistics. Combining

basic elements of economic and sociological thinking, we think it plausible to suppose that women
                                                   19

choose family size to maximize utility functions that recognize both private and social incentives for

fertility. The private incentives depend in part on government policy toward children, one aspect of

which is the child allowance program. The social incentives depend in part on the childbearing

behavior of peers.

        We pose a decision model with these properties here. The model aims to balance realism and

tractability so as to provide a suitable vehicle for analysis of fertility decisions.



3.1. Maintained Assumptions



        We assume that a woman chooses family size irrevocably sometime after marriage, based on

the information available at the time. Thus we abstract from revisions to family planning that may

occur if new information later becomes available. Let t denote the date of the fertility decision, j

denote a woman choosing family size (i.e., number of children) at that date, and k denote family size.

We assume that woman j assigns utility Utj(k) to having k children and acts to maximize utility.

Thus the woman chooses



(1) ktj = argmax k = 0, 1, . . . Utj(k)



children, assuming that the argmax is unique. We assume no infertility and no child mortality, or

similar sources of uncertainty that could prevent some women from realizing their family-size plans.

We also take the spacing of the k births as predetermined.

        We now further assume that the above utility function has three additively separable

components, the first two expressing private incentives and the third expressing social incentives:



(i). a private utility of family size, assumed quadratic in the number of children. This is ajk -

bjk2, where (aj, bj) are woman-specific parameters. We assume that aj > 0 and bj > 0.
                                                  20



(ii). a government incentive for childbearing embodied in the child allowances formula prevailing at

the time of the fertility decision. This is Atj(k), the discounted life-cycle allowance that woman j

would receive under the formula prevailing at the decision date, if j were to have k children; we

assume that Atj(0) = 0. The magnitude of the allowance may vary with characteristics of the woman,

such as veteran status. Let Itj denote the family’s expected life-cycle income from date t on; here we

assume, for simplicity, that income does not depend on family size. Then expected life-cycle

consumption if woman j were to have k children is Atj(k) + Itj. The contribution to utility of such

consumption is cj[Atj(k) + Itj], where cj > 0 is a woman-specific parameter.



(iii). a social interaction wherein the woman compares k with the actual family sizes of other women

in the population. We assume that the population is composed of M mutually exclusive and

exhaustive strata, or reference groups. Consider group m. Woman j incurs a utility loss that grows

with the squared deviation between k and the size of each family in group m. The woman averages

these losses across the members of m, yielding the average loss Σh (k - h)2 Ptm(h), where Ptm(h) is the

fraction of women in group m having h children. Finally, the woman aggregates the average losses

across the M groups, yielding the aggregate loss -Σm wmj [Σh (k - h)2 Ptm(h)], where wj ≡ (wmj, m =

1, …, M) are parameters that measure the utility weight the woman attaches to each group. We

assume that wmj > 0, m = 1,…,M.



       Combining the private, government, and social determinants, the form of the utility function

that we assume is



(2) Utj(k) = ajk - bjk2 + cj[Atj(k) + Itj] - Σm wmj [Σh (k - h)2 Ptm(h)].
                                                   21

3.2. Optimal Family Size



        Let Stm = Σh h Ptm(h) be the mean number of children in group m at date t. For each m,



(3) Σh (k - h)2 Ptm(h) = Σh [(k - Stm) + (Stm - h)]2 Ptm(h) = (k - Stm)2 + Σh (h - Stm)2 Ptm(h)

                       = k2 – 2kStm + Stm2 + Σh (h - Stm)2 Ptm(h) .



It follows that



(4) Utj(k) = Utj(0) + ajk - bjk2 + cjAtj(k) - (Σm wmj)k2 + 2(Σm wmj Stm)k

        = Utj(0) + (aj + 2Σm wmj Stm)k - (bj + Σm wmj)k2 + cjAtj(k).



Hence



(5) ktj = argmax k= 0, 1, …. (aj + 2Σm wmj Stm)k - (bj + Σm wmj)k2 + cjAtj(k).



        The model yielding equation (5) expresses many core features of economic and sociological

thinking about fertility decisions. The model acknowledges that family size is a discrete choice

problem and recognizes that women may have heterogeneous preferences, expressed through the

woman-specific parameters (a, b, c, w). The model flexibly expresses the idea that social norms may

affect fertility. We suppose that each woman may pay attention to childbearing in multiple reference

groups and place different weight on the practices of each group. A woman may be concerned with

the entire distribution of family size within each group. Yet, as shown in equations (3) and (4), the

model has the simplifying property that decision making ultimately depends only on mean family

size in each group, not the entire distribution.
                                                   22

        The model yields an especially simple solution if the child allowance is proportional to the

number of children in a family. Thus, suppose that Atj(k) = πtjk for some πtj > 0. Then (5) becomes



(6) ktj = argmax k= 0, 1, …. (aj + 2Σm wmj Stm + cjπtj)k - (bj + Σm wmj)k2.



Observe that both composite coefficients are positive. Hence utility is quadratic in family size with

its maximum at



              aj + 2Σm wmj Stm + cjπtj
(7) ktj = INT[ + ½],
                  2(bj + Σm wmj)


where INT[A] denotes the integer component of the real number in brackets.

        Of course, the model does not express all potentially important features of fertility decisions.

In particular, it neglects associations between fertility and family income that form part of the

Malthusian hypothesis. It ignores possible connections between family-size decisions and female

labor-supply decisions, which would make life-cycle income a function of family size. It also

ignores the possible contributions of child labor to life-cycle income. Nevertheless, we feel that

equation (5) provides an effective, practical starting point for theoretical and empirical analysis of the

interaction of private and social incentives for fertility.

        Section 3.3 approaches the problem from a theoretical perspective, making further

idealizations in order to achieve some understanding of the dynamics and steady-state distributions

of family size that may be generated by the model. Section 4 examines the problem from an

empirical perspective, with particular attention to the difficulty of identification of private and social

incentives.

3.3. The Social Dynamics of Fertility in Two Special Cases



     The fertility model introduced above, although simple in many respects, is still too complex to

permit much in the way of theoretical analysis. An interesting theoretical analysis becomes possible

if we make four further assumptions, as follow:



(a) The number of children is continuous, rather than integer-valued.

(b) Each woman is influenced only by women in her own group who made their choices in the

preceding period.

(c) All women in a given ethnic-religious group have the same values of utility parameters (b, c, w),

so that only the parameter aj may vary within the group.20 The within-group distribution of this

parameter is continuous and time-invariant, with density f(a).

(d) The child allowance formula is piecewise linear in the number of children, with one kink. The

allowance formula is time-invariant and is the same for all members of a given group.



         Given these assumptions, we can consider each group in isolation and characterize the

evolution of family size and the steady state distribution of family sizes. We begin with the special

case in which there is no kink, so the allowance is proportional to family size.




20
   Letting c vary within the group does not qualitatively change the analysis, but complicates the notation somewhat.
Given that behavior is unaffected by a positive multiplicative change in the four utility parameters (a, b, c, w), we could
also normalize b or w. The essential part of our assumption is thus that both (b, w) are constant within the group.
                                                                 24



Allowances Proportional to Family Size

           Suppose that the allowance formula is A(k) = πk, where π > 0 is the time-invariant allowance

per child. Supposing that children are continuous and invoking the other assumptions above,

equation (7) for the optimal family size for woman j who chooses family size at date t becomes:



          aj + 2wSt-1 + cπ
(8) ktj =  ,
              2(b + w)


where St-1 is the mean family size of women who chose their family size at date t – 1. It follows that

the mean family size of women who choose at date t is



                        a + 2wSt-1 + cπ                               µ + 2wSt-1 + cπ
(9) St = S(St-1, λ) = E[ ]                             =         ,
                            2(b + w)                                     2(b + w)


where µ ≡ E(a) > 0, and where λ ≡ [b, c, w, A(.) f(.)] is the full set of parameters that characterize

preferences and child allowances.21

           Equation (9) determines the social dynamics of mean family size. With b > 0 and w > 0, St

converges monotonically to the unique steady state So that solves the equation



(10) So = S(S0, λ).



The steady-state in this case of proportional allowances is:



21
     Equation (9) shows that when allowances are proportional to family size, sufficient statistics for A(.) and f(.) are π and
µ.
                                                    25

               µ + cπ
         o
(11) S       = .
                 2b


         This simple result is qualitatively unsurprising in many respects. The steady-state mean

family size So increases with the magnitude of the allowance per child π and with the parameter c

measuring the contribution to utility of the allowance. So also varies as expected with the private

determinants of utility, increasing with µ and decreasing with b.

         Observe, however, that So does not vary with the social interaction parameter w; hence there

is no social multiplier effect. Furthermore, the steady state is unique and the fertility gap between any

two groups who differ only in the parameter µ is independent of the magnitude of the allowances.

These results turn out to be peculiar to the case of proportional child allowances. We show below

that when the allowance is piecewise linear, steady-state mean family size may not be unique and

may depend on w in a somewhat subtle manner.

         With So determined, it is straightforward to characterize the entire steady-state distribution of

family sizes. Inserting St-1 = So in equation (8), we obtain that the steady-state optimal family size of

a woman with private utility parameter a is



                a + 2wSo + cπ            1 ba + wµ
(12) ko(a, λ) =                  =  (  + cπ).
                   2(b + w)              2b   b+w




         Observe that ko(a, λ) is linear in a. Hence the density function for optimal family size has the

same shape as f(a), the density of a. Observe that the child-allowance π always shifts ko(a, λ) by the

same amount, regardless of the value of a. Hence child allowances affect the central tendency of the

distribution of family sizes but not its dispersion. Finally, observe that ko(a, λ) is determined by a
                                                          26

weighted average of a woman’s own utility parameter and the mean µ of this parameter in the group,

with weights b/(b + w) and w/(b + w) respectively. Thus the social interaction parameter w, which

was earlier shown not to affect the central tendency of the distribution of family size, does affect the

dispersion of the distribution. All else equal, the larger the value of w, the more concentrated is the

distribution around its mean So.



Piecewise Linear Child Allowances

          Now suppose that the child allowance formula has the piecewise linear form



          A(k) = 0 if k < K,                  A(k) = π(k – K) if k > K,



where K > 0 is a specified threshold family size and π > 0 is the time-invariant allowance per child

from the Kth onward. 22 Although the Israeli child allowance formula has changed over the years, the

formula has always been reasonably well approximated by a function of this form.

          Given assumptions (a) – (d) and a piecewise linear allowance formula, the optimal family

size is



(13) ktj = argmax k > 0 {(aj + 2wSt - 1)k - (b + w)k2 + cπ(k – K) · 1[k > K]},



where 1[k > K] is the indicator function taking the value one if k > K and zero otherwise. The


22
  The present analysis generalizes easily to formulas that begin with a positive allowance per child and rise in marginal
value after K children; that is, to formulas of the type

          A(k) = π1k if k < K, A(k) = π2(k – K) if k > K, where 0 < π1 < π2.

However, the analysis does not apply to piecewise linear formulas that initially give larger allowance per child and then
smaller ones; that is to formulas of the above type but with 0 < π2 < π1. Such formulas have qualitatively different
implications for family-size distributions.
                                                   27

objective function in (13) is quadratic everywhere except at the point k = K, where its first derivative

jumps by cπ units. Holding (b, w, c, π, K, St - 1) fixed, optimal family size can be shown to vary

discontinuously with the utility parameter aj, the single discontinuity occurring at a certain pivot

value a(St-1, λ), which is



(14) a(St-1, λ) = 2(b + w)K - 2wSt-1 - cπ/2.



In particular,



                 aj + 2wSt-1
(15a)      ktj =            < K           if aj < a(St-1, λ)
                 2(b + w)


                 aj + 2wSt-1 + cπ
(15b)      ktj =              > K       if    aj > a(St-1, λ).
                     2(b + w)


A woman whose parameter a equals the pivot value is indifferent between these two solutions.

        Recall that the distribution of the parameter a has been assumed continuous; hence the

borderline case a = a(St-1, λ) occurs with probability zero. It follows that the mean family size

among women who choose fertility at date t is



                          a + 2wSt-1
(16) St = S(St-1, λ) = E[   a < a(St-1, λ)] · Prob(a < a(St-1, λ)]
                           2(b + w)


                             a + 2wSt-1 + cπ
                        + E[   a > a(St-1, λ)] · Prob(a > a(St-1, λ)]
                               2(b + w)
                                                             28

                                   1
                             =  [ µ + 2w St-1 + cπ · Prob(a > a(St-1, λ)].
                               2(b + w)


Inspection of equation (16) shows that, given any value of the parameters λ, the function S(St-1, λ) is

increasing and continuous in St-1; hence the recursive equation St = S(St-1, λ) generates a monotone

time path for mean family size.23

         A steady state, where So = S(S0, λ), is defined implicitly by the condition



          1
(17) So =  [µ + cπ · Prob(a > a(S°, λ)].
          2b


Inspection of (17) shows that this equation necessarily has solutions, and these satisfy the inequalities

µ/2b < So < (µ + cπ)/2b. That is, the steady state solutions with piecewise linear allowances lie

between the steady state µ/2b that would prevail in the absence of allowances and the steady state (µ

+ cπ)/2b that would prevail if allowances were proportional to family size.

         Implicit differentiation of equation (17) reveals that ∂So/∂π > 0 and ∂So/∂K < 0. Thus, as

should be expected, a more generous child allowance formula generates increases in steady-state

mean family size. When π > 0 and K > 0, similar differentiation also reveals that sgn(∂So/∂w) =

sgn(S0 – K). Thus, stronger social interactions reinforce the deviation of steady state fertility away

from the threshold K. We think this last result particularly important, and so state it as a proposition:



Proposition: Let our assumptions hold. Under a child allowance program with allowances

proportional to family size, social interactions have no effect on mean steady state fertility So. Under


23
   Equation (16) simplifies substantially if the support of the distribution of utility parameter a lies either entirely to the
left or entirely to the right of a(St-1, λ). In the former case, where Prob(a > a(St-1, λ)] = 0, all women choose to have the
family size that they would prefer in the absence of child allowances. In the latter case, where Prob(a > a(St-1, λ)] = 1, all
                                                        29

a program with allowances piecewise linear and threshold K, stronger social interactions reinforce

the deviation of So from K.



This result is the key to our findings below on the differential effect of allowances on different social

groups and on the possibility of multiple equilibria.



Findings for Specific Distributions of Utility Parameters

        The above analysis partially characterizes steady state fertility when the allowance formula is

piecewise linear, but important questions remain open. In particular, we would like to know whether

the steady state equation (17) can have multiple solutions and we would like to understand the role of

the social interaction parameter w in determining the steady state. Answers to these questions could

shed light on the role that the piecewise linear Israeli child allowance system may have played in

generating the sharply different fertility trends experienced by different ethnic-religious groups. As

we have shown, a proportional allowance program, even when coupled with strong social

interactions, cannot explain the reverse-fertility transition among Israeli ultra-orthodox woman, nor

why their fertility behavior diverged so much from that of other groups in the population.

        To partially address the open questions, we now examine the dynamics of fertility under two

hypotheses about the shape f(a) of the distribution of utility parameters. First we suppose that f(a) is

uniform, a simple specification that yields a closed-form solution of the dynamic equation (16). Then

we suppose that f(a) is log-normal, a specification that may be more realistic but that does not yield a

closed-form solution of this equation.



Uniform Distribution: When the utility parameter a is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 2µ],

the dynamic process (16) becomes:


choose a family size above the threshold K, making the allowance effectively proportional to the number of children.
                                                  30

                          2(b+w)


The function S(St-1, λ) is continuous in St-1 and piecewise linear in its three ranges.

       We are interested particularly in the possibility of a steady-state S° in the intermediate range,

where some women choose to have fewer children than the allowance threshold K, and some have

more than this threshold. The intermediate-range linear equation has the unique solution



                   1
(19)   S° = K + ———— [(µ + cπ/2)(µ + cπ/2 – 2bK)].
                2bµ - wcπ


It can be shown that this steady state is locally stable if 2bµ > wcπ. Moreover, this intermediate

solution satisfies the required boundary conditions 0 < a(S°, λ) < 2µ if wµ + wcπ < b[2(b + w)K–

cπ/2] < wµ+ 2bµ. If the boundary conditions are not satisfied or the intermediate-range steady state

is not stable, the dynamic process converges to one of two polar steady states in which all women

choose to have families of size less than or greater than K. Inspection of (19) shows that if the

intermediate steady state exists and is locally stable, then S0 > K if and only if µ + cπ/2 > 2bK.

       Figure 6 displays how the steady state varies with the magnitude π of the allowance. To

approximate the Israeli formula, we set the threshold at K = 4. We consider two groups, both with b
                                                   31

= 0.5, c = 1, w = 0.4. The groups differ only in the value of the parameter µ. The first group, meant

to represent the ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi, has µ1= 2.5; the other group has µ2 = 2. These figures

were selected so that S01 = 2.5, and S02 = 2 in the absence of allowances; this conforms with the pre-

1955 mean fertility rates reported earlier. It is evident that increasing the magnitude of the allowance

π rapidly widens the fertility gap between the two groups. With π = 3.5, for example, the steady state

fertility levels of the two groups become 5.6 and 3.0 respectively, increasing the fertility gap between

the two groups from 0.5 to 2.6. However, further increases in π narrow the gap.

        c =1, w = 0.4, K = 4, b = 0.5, and a is distributed uniformly over [0, 4] and [0,5]


        The figure illustrates our assertion that a piecewise linear child allowance program combined

with social interactions can generate fertility behavior that is qualitatively different from the linear

case. It can be shown that when w = 0 for both groups, the fertility gap is hardly affected by the

magnitude of the allowance. It is the force of the social interaction that initially (up to π = 3.2) holds

back women of the second group from adapting to the higher allowances by increasing their number

of children to above the threshold K = 4. And it is the same force that operates in the opposite

direction for the first group.



Log-Normal Distribution: Whereas the uniform distribution implies a unique steady state for all

values of π and K, a log-normal distribution may generate multiple steady states. Since we cannot
                                                        32

     explicitly solve the steady-state equation (17) when f(a) is log-normal, we resort to a simple

     illustrative example. Figure 7A plots the dynamic function St = S(St-1, λ) for particular values of λ.

     A steady state, being a solution to the equation So = S(S0, λ), occurs when S(., λ) crosses the 45° line

     shown on the figure. A steady state is stable if [∂S(., λ)/∂St-1] < 1 when evaluated at St-1 = So.

             Figure 7A plots S(St-1, λ) for four values of λ. In all four cases, K = 4, c = 1, w = 0.5 and f(a)

     is log-normal with mean 2.5 and standard deviation 1, for both groups. The two social groups differ

     only in the parameter b, where b1 = 0.5 and b2 = 0.625, selected so that in the absence of allowances,

     the steady-state mean number of children for the two groups are 2.5 and 2.0 respectively. The figure

     displays three plots for the first group, for three alternative allowance values π = (3.25, 3.75, 4.25),

     and one plot for the second group, for the middle allowance value: π = 3.75.

             We find that when π = 3.75, the second group has a unique steady state at So = 2.4 children.

     In sharp contrast, the first group has in this case three steady states, So = (3.69, 5.2, 6.25), of which

     only the first and third are stable. However, when π = 3.25 or π = 4.25, the first group has a unique

st   allowances can produce very significant qualitative and quantitative changes in mean fertility.

4. Attempted Structural Empirical Inference



       This section describes our efforts to use the fertility model developed in Section 3 to interpret

the actual decisions made by Israeli women. Our objective was to estimate a version of the model

that could, with some degree of credibility, be applied to examine how Israeli child allowance policy

has affected family-size decisions. We were unable to achieve this objective, but the attempt was

instructive nonetheless. We explain here.



4.1. Identification in Theory and Practice



       Even though it is idealized in many respects, the model developed in Section 3 still has more

than enough degrees of freedom to generate the main observed features of Israeli fertility. The

different rates of completed fertility observed in different ethnic-religious groups at different times

could be produced by

       (i) cross-sectional and time series variation in the woman-specific utility parameters

       (ii) cross-sectional and time series variation in the child allowance formula

       (iii)social interactions within and across groups.

Indeed, the central problem that arises in empirical analysis of family-size decisions is that many

alternative combinations of these forces could have generated the observed patterns.

       The basic identification problem is evident in equation (5), which shows that observation of a

woman’s chosen family size only partly reveals her preferences. Observation that woman j chooses

family size ktj implies only that the composite utility parameters (aj + 2ΣmwmjStm, bj + Σmwmj, cj)

satisfy the revealed preference inequalities
                                                           34



(20) (aj + 2Σm wmjStm)(ktj – k) - (bj + Σmwmj)(ktj 2 - k2) + cj[Atj(ktj) - Atj(k)] > 0, k ≠ ktj.



The identification problem is especially stark when the child allowance formula provides benefits

proportional to the number of children. In that case, equation (7) shows that choice of ktj children is

consistent with any value of the parameters (aj, bj, cj; wmj, m ∈ M) such that



                aj + 2Σm wmjStm + cjπtj
(21) ktj - ½ <  < ktj + ½.
                     2(bj + Σmwmj)


Thus, the fertility preferences of Israeli women cannot be learned in an entirely empirical manner.

The available data on fertility choices must be combined with a priori restrictions on the distribution

of preferences.24

         In an attempt to cope with the identification problem, we refined the model in a manner that

combined realism with tractability. To specify the timing of fertility decisions, we supposed that

women choose family size six-to-ten years following marriage, and base their utility calculations on

the average annual benefits in effect during that five-year period. This conjecture flows from the

idea that, although women may begin to bear children soon after marriage, they need not decide so

soon on completed family size.

         We defined reference groups by the same criteria of ethnic origin and religiosity as were used

24
   There are further difficulties that exacerbate the identification problem inherent in revealed preference analysis. Our
discussion has presumed that a researcher is able to observe not only the family sizes that women choose but also the
child allowance formulas that they face and the mean family sizes of the women in their reference groups. These are non-
trivial problems in practice. Consider the child allowance formula. Our fertility model assumes that women choose
family size irrevocably sometime after marriage, based on the information available at the time. As discussed in Section
2, Israeli child-allowance benefits have varied over time. Hence the particular timing that we assume for family-size
decisions affects the allowance functions that we assume women use when computing the utility of alternative numbers of
children. Moreover, throughout its existence, the Israeli child allowance program has employed a formula that predicates
benefits on the number of children currently under age 18. This feature of the program, as well as the variation of the
formula over time, implies that the life-cycle magnitude of the child allowance associated with any number of children
                                                            35

in our description of fertility patterns in Israel in Section 2.3; moreover, we distinguished members

of these groups by their year of marriage. We focused on five ethnic-religious groups: ultra-orthodox

Mizrahi, non-ultra-orthodox Mizrahi, ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi, non-ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi, and

non-ultra-orthodox with Israeli-born parents. We neglected the ultra-orthodox with Israeli-born

parents because the available sample of such persons is too small to support empirical analysis. We

neglected the two Arab groups because their members generally did not receive child allowances

during the period of our analysis.

         To simplify the analysis, we constrained the vector (wm, m ∈ M) of social interaction

parameters in two important ways. First, we assumed that women who marry in a given year are

influenced only by women who married in the five preceding years. Second, we assumed that they

give equal weight, say w0, to the fertility of all Jewish Israeli women married in the past five years

and an additional weight, say w1, to members of their own ethnic-religious group.

         After considering a variety of specifications for the distribution of fertility preferences, we

chose to work with a specification that is flexible in some respects but restrictive in others. We

permitted the distribution of preferences to vary freely across ethnic-religious groups and year of

marriage. Thus ‘ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi women married in 1955’ could have one distribution of

fertility preferences and ‘non-ultra-orthodox Jews whose parents were born in Israel and who

married in 1970’ could have another. The flexibility afforded by this aspect of the model is

appealing because there is reason to think that fertility preferences in Israel have varied both across

groups and over time.25

         The restrictive part of the specification is that we assumed all women who belong to the same

ethnic-religious group and who marry in the same year to have the same values of the utility

parameters (b, c, w0, w1). We permitted heterogeneity only in the utility parameter a, which we


actually depends on the spacing of their births.
25
   Social scientists often hypothesize that fertility preferences vary with women’s schooling, family earnings capacity, and
perspectives on the morality of various forms of contraception. All of these factors, and more, have varied both across
ethnic-religious groups and over time in Israel.
                                                   36

assumed to be distributed normal across women who belong to the same group and marry in the

same year. This aspect of the specification was chosen for reasons of tractability; it implies that a

simple ordered-probit model describes the probability that a woman choose any given family size.

        The above assumptions, as strong as they are, only identify the model of fertility decisions if

the child allowance is nonlinear in the number of children. They do not identify the model if the

benefit is proportional to family size. Consider women who belong to a given reference group, say g,

who marry in a given year, say t. For such women, let the parameter a be distributed N(µtg, σtg2). Let

Stg be the mean family size of members of group g who married in the past five years and let Sto be

the mean family size of all other Jewish Israeli women who married in this period. If the benefit is

proportional to family size and is the same for all women who marry in year t, (21) implies that the

probability of choosing k children is



                                           a + 2w 0tgSt0 + 2w1tgStg + ctgπt
(22) Ptg(k; γtg, δtg )   =    Prob[k - ½ <  < k + ½.]
                                                  2(b tg + w0tg + w1tg)


                         = Φ[(k + ½)γtg - δtg] - Φ[(k – ½)γtg - δtg],



where



(23a) γtg    ≡ 2(btg + w0tg + w1tg)/σtg

(23b) δtg ≡ (µtg + 2w0tgSt0 + 2w1tgStg + ctgπt)/σtg.



Equation (22) shows that the only identified quantities are the composite parameters γtg and δtg. Thus,

a necessary condition for identification of the parameters (µtg, σtg, btg, ctg, w0tg, w1tg) describing the
                                                         37

distribution of utility is that the benefit be nonlinear in family size.26

         The Israeli child allowance benefit has, to varying degrees over the years, been piecewise-

linear in family size. Nevertheless, when we attempted to estimate the model, we learned that

piecewise-linearity of the formula provides an insubstantial foundation for empirical analysis. In

particular, we found that the objective functions used in either maximum likelihood or least squares

estimation of the ordered-probit model were close to flat when evaluated at alternative parameter

values that would formally be observationally equivalent if the allowance benefit were proportional

to number of children. Hence, under the maintained assumptions, we were unable to obtain reliable,

stable estimates of the parameters describing the distribution of utility.

         Although unpleasant, this empirical finding is instructive. It cautions against reliance on

nonlinearities in child allowance formulas to identify fertility preferences. The difficulties that we

encountered are reminiscent of those that have long afflicted attempts by empirical researchers to

learn the effects on labor supply of benefit/tax schedules that are nonlinear in hours worked.27




26
   One of these parameters may be fixed in value to normalize the scale of women’s utility functions. We do not choose
a particular normalization here.

4.2. Structural Interpretation of “Approximate” Reduced-form Estimates



        Although the assumptions imposed above did not yield usable estimates of the structural

parameters (µtg, σtg, btg, ctg, w0tg, w1tg), we recognized that strengthening the assumptions could, in

principle, make estimation possible. A simple, flexible way to explore the implications of adding

further assumptions is to estimate the composite parameters (γtg, δtg) for the various reference groups

g and years t. This done, we could attempt to structurally interpret the cross-sectional and time-

series variation in these estimates, via equation (23).

        For each reference group g and year of marriage t, our merged Census and Birth Registry data

make it straightforward to estimate (γtg, δtg). In years when the child allowance benefit was

proportional to family size, equation (22) follows directly from our structural model of fertility

decision. Hence (22) is a reduced-form of the structural model and (γtg, δtg) are reduced-form

parameters related to the structural parameters (µtg, σtg, btg, ctg, w0tg, w1tg) by equation (23). When the

benefit was piecewise-linear in family size, equation (22) does not follow directly from the fertility

model; hence (γtg, δtg) are not formal reduced-form parameters. Nevertheless, it may be reasonable to

view (γtg, δtg) informally as “approximate” reduced-form parameters, with πt defined to be the

allowance per child averaged over a suitable range of family sizes.

        We used a least-squares criterion to estimate (γtg, δtg) for group g and year of marriage t.

Specifically, we chose (γ, δ) to minimize the criterion function Σk [ftg(k) - Ptg(k; γ, δ)]2; here ftg(k) is

the observed frequency with which women of type (t, g) choose k children and Ptg(k; γ, δ)] is the

choice probability given in (22).28 We found that our estimated choice probabilities fit the observed


28
   If equation (22) were a formal reduced-form throughout the period of analysis, conventional considerations of
asymptotic efficiency would suggest maximum likelihood as an alternative to least-squares estimation. However, with
(22) sometimes being only an approximate reduced-form, least-squares estimation seemed advantageous because it does
not emphasize a model’s ability to predict small probability events, as maximum likelihood does.
                                                            39

family-size frequencies very well. We achieved almost perfect fits for the non-orthodox groups,

where our observed choice frequencies are based on large samples of women per year; in these cases,

the value of the criterion function (i.e., the sum of square residuals) was generally in the range

[0.001, 0.01]. The fits were less exact but still good for the orthodox groups, where the observed

choice frequencies are based on samples of only ten to fifty women per year; here the sum of squared

residuals was generally in the range [0.01, 0.05].

         With estimates of the reduced-form parameters in hand, we used equation (23) to interpret

their cross-sectional and time-series variation. We first explored specifications that impose no cross-

group restrictions on the distribution of utility, but do constrain the time-series variation in each

group’s preferences. The findings were disappointing. Estimates of the structural parameters were

statistically imprecise. Contrary to the basic theoretical prediction that utility should rise with

increasing child benefits, we often obtained negative estimates of the parameter ctg.

         A qualitatively more “sensible” estimate of the effect of child allowances on fertility emerged

only when we imposed two assumptions that we find much too strong to be believable: (a) the

parameters (σtg, ctg, w0tg, w1tg) are constant over time and across groups and (b) the parameter µtg,

which describes the central tendency in private preferences for fertility, varies over time only with

the rate of high school completion by women in group g.29 Specifically, we set σtg = 1 to normalize

the scale of utility and let equation (23a) have the form



(24) δtg ≡ (µg + βH tg + 2w0St0 + 2w1Stg + cπt),



where H tg is the fraction of women of type (t, g) who complete high school and β is a parameter.

29
  Demographers have long viewed women’s schooling as a primary determinant of fertility preferences. Israeli women
experienced very substantial increases in their rates of high-school completion during the period covered by our data.
Hence we thought it reasonable to focus on this as a source of time-series variation in fertility preferences. There are two
levels of high-school completion in Israel, a lower level in which a student obtains a diploma and a higher level in which
a student also passes a national examination known as the Bagrut. We measure high-school completion by successful
completion of the Bagrut.
                                                   40

This done, we used our estimates of δtg to obtain least-squares estimates of the common structural

parameters (βδ, w0, w1, c) and the group-specific parameters µg. Now, finally, the estimate of c was

positive and statistically precise by conventional standards.




5. Conclusion



        To reiterate what we see as the main contributions of this research, we first called attention to

the complex time-series and cross-sectional pattern of Israeli fertility, which is much at odds with the

fertility transition that has occurred elsewhere in the world (Section 2). We next presented a

theoretical analysis of the social dynamics of fertility that shows how private preferences,

preferences for conformity, and piecewise linear child allowances could have combined to yield such

a complex fertility pattern (Section 3). We then explained the identification problem that makes it so

difficult to infer the actual Israeli fertility process from data on completed fertility (Section 4).

        Although much about Israeli fertility remains puzzling at the end of our investigation, we

believe that our work casts new light on what has happened in the ultra-orthodox community. In a

recent study of fertility and labor supply in the Israeli ultra-orthodox community, Berman (2000) has

interpreted the trends toward increased fertility, decreased labor supply, and increased supply of time

to religious studies in this community as the behavior of a “club” that has strengthened its norms of

religious stringency in an attempt to maintain exclusion. Berman traces this increased stringency

back to the 19th century reaction of ultra-religious Jews to their exposure to modernity, and he

implicitly views recent changes as continuation of a process that has been underway since that early

time. Our empirical analysis cast doubt on Berman’s interpretation. We have found that in the

marriage cohorts prior to 1955, the fertility of Ashkenazi ultra-orthodox women was almost the same

as that of non-ultra orthodox Ashkenazi women. Hence we conclude that the current fertility
                                                          41

behavior of Israeli ultra-orthodox reflects a relatively recent phenomenon.30 We conjecture, but

cannot prove, that the reverse fertility transition that has occurred among the ultra-Orthodox would

not have happened were it not for the emergence of the Israeli welfare state.

         Our work may also help to understand the conventional fertility transition. To recall,

demographers have questioned why the fertility transition has begun in different societies under

different economic conditions, and why it has been so rapid. It is intriguing that the reverse fertility

transition experienced by the Israeli ultra-orthodox has similarly been rapid. We have conjectured

that this reverse transition arose out of the combination of two key factors: non-continuity in private

behavior, due to the piecewise linearity of child allowances, and social interactions as each women is

influenced by the fertility decisions of other women. The same two factors are central to the recent

analysis by Kohler (2001) of the conventional fertility transition. In his work, non-continuity in

behavior is generated by a binary decision process, whether or not to use contraceptives, and the

social interaction occurs when each woman is influenced by the contraception decisions of other

women. The specifics of our research and that of Kohler differ in many respects, but each illuminates

how non-continuity in behavior and social interactions may combine to explain the social dynamics

of fertility.




30
   The recent non-continuity in behavior is illustrated by a quote from an address by a noted Rabbi to young women in an
ultra-orthodox seminary: “Our mothers … have absorbed too much from the odor of European culture… Our slogan must
be: back to grandmother” [cited in Friedman (1988)].
