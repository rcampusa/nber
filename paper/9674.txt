Current U.S. law nets the total portfolio of realized capital gains and losses to compute capital gains
taxes. Prior research, however, typically ignores the implication of this provision, i.e., the marginal
tax rate for a specific gain or loss depends on the taxpayer's total portfolio of realized gains and

losses. We find that these nettings introduce complexity into the relation between share values and
capital gains taxes, creating an incentive to diversify. For firms with stock returns that are positively

(negatively) correlated with those of the overall market, share values generally are decreasing
(increasing) in the capital gains tax rate.

                Diversification and the Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses

         This paper explores the incentives to hold a diversified portfolio that arise from the
asymmetric tax treatment of capital gains and losses. Under current U.S. law, the total portfolio
of realized capital gains is netted annually against the total portfolio of realized capital losses.1 If
gains exceed losses, the net gain is taxed. If losses exceed gains, individuals can deduct $3,000
of the net loss. Losses that are not deducted in the year of realization are carried forward
indefinitely, offsetting gains in future years.2
         Prior analyses of capital gains taxes typically ignore the provisions governing the pooling
of gains and losses.3 Their impact is assumed minor, and modeling them is an analytical
challenge. This paper develops a model which employs the mathematics of option pricing theory
to evaluate the impact of the current capital gains tax system on common stock valuations. We
find that these nettings introduce complexity into the basic relation between share values and
capital gains taxes. For firms with stock returns that are positively correlated with those of the
overall market, share values generally are a decreasing function of the capital gains tax rate.
However, for firms whose stock returns are negatively correlated with the overall market, share
values generally increase with the capital gains tax rate.
         This counterintuitive result – shareholder taxes enhance share value – occurs because
taxpayers can expect to offset taxable capital gains in an overall portfolio with a capital loss from
an individual stock if the returns of the stock and portfolio are negatively correlated. In such a
situation, the effective capital gains tax rate associated with the stock is negative. Similarly, if
the overall portfolio incurs a realized capital loss, the expected capital gains tax on a stock whose
returns are negatively correlated with those of the portfolio is zero, since the expected gain on
the stock should be offset by a capital loss in the portfolio. Therefore, on balance, the expected
effective capital gains tax rate for a stock whose returns are negatively correlated with those of
the investor’s overall portfolio is negative. Consequently, the current U.S. tax system provides

  For individual taxpayers, further complexities arise from the dichotomization of gains and losses into short-term
and long-term. Throughout this paper, we ignore these holding period distinctions without loss of generality.

  If losses exceed gains for corporations, no deduction is permitted currently. Instead the net realized loss is carried
back and deducted against net capital gains for the previous three years. Any remaining loss offsets net capital gains
in the subsequent five years, after which period it expires unutilized.

  Extant capital gains tax studies include Constantinides (1983, 1984), Stiglitz (1983), Poterba (1987), Landsman
and Shackelford (1995), Erickson (1998), Reese (1998), Guenther and Willenborg (1999), Klein (1999), Poterba and
Weisbenner (2001), Shackelford and Verrecchia (2002), Ayers, et. al (2003), and Blouin, et al. (2003), among many

an incentive to hold investments with returns that provide negative correlation with market
returns.
         This paper makes three primary contributions. First, it advances the ongoing research
investigating the effects of capital gains taxes on equity prices (see reviews in Graham [2003]
and Shackelford and Shevlin [2001]) by showing that the pooling of capital gains and losses can
affect individual common stock valuations. More generally, it contributes to research
that investigates the economic implications of asymmetric tax treatment of gains and losses. For
example, when gains create immediate taxes, but losses do not necessarily create immediate
refunds, hedging is encouraged (Graham and Smith [1999]), but not entrepreneurship (Gentry
and Hubbard [2001]).
         Second, by evaluating a setting where the effective marginal tax rate depends on other
aspects of the taxpayer’s opportunity set, the paper provides a framework that can be applied
more generally, because the tax considerations of all decisions are conditional on an investor’s
other taxable activities. To give an example from a different setting, the U.S. corporate income
tax rate that applies to dividends from a foreign corporation depends on a firm’s repatriations
from all other foreign subsidiaries.
         Third, the paper is timely for current policy debates. In recent years researchers could
ignore the netting of capital gains and losses because the long-running bull market in the 1980s
and 1990s, preceded by inflation in the 1970s (recall taxes are assessed on nominal, not real,
profits), generally rendered the treatment of capital losses irrelevant since gains far exceeded
losses for most investors.4 The downturn in the markets since 2000 has left many investors
facing substantial capital losses. Congress has been considering legislation that would increase
the $3000 net capital loss limit for individuals (which has remained unchanged since 1977). Any
such increase would mitigate, but not fundamentally alter, the complex incentives arising under
the current structure. By explicitly modeling these incentives, this paper may be instructive in
the evaluation of new policy.




4
 As evidence, the Internal Revenue Service [1999a, 1999b] reports that in 1997 individuals in the maximum tax
bracket (39.6 percent), who accounted for 61 percent of all net capital gains, reported $169 billion of long-term
capital gains and only $5 billion of long-term capital losses and $16 billion of short-term capital gains and only $8
billion of short-term capital losses. In addition, Poterba [1987] and Auerbach, Burman and Siegel [2000] found the
$3000 limit for individuals on currently deductible capital losses seldom binding.


                                                          2
         The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section I models a stock’s value in
light of the current capital loss limitations in the U.S. tax. Section II examines the mathematical
properties of the model, and section III provides concluding remarks.


                                                   I. The Model
A. Initial Conditions
         This section derives a stock’s equilibrium value when its capital gains and losses are
subject to a tax system that fully taxes net capital gains (total portfolio gains in excess of losses),
but provides no deduction for net capital losses (total portfolio losses in excess of gains).5 The
principal finding is that this tax structure generally causes a firm’s stock value to be decreasing
(increasing) in the capital gains tax rate if its returns are positively (negatively) correlated with
the returns of the market portfolio of assets whose realized returns are subject to capital gains
taxation. Intuitively, positive correlation reduces the probability that the stock and the portfolio
will move inversely and thus benefit from the pooling of gains and losses. Other relevant factors
in the model include the rate of dividend growth for the stock and the portfolio, the level of
interest rates, and the extent of risk aversion in the pricing of financial assets.
         Assume the price of a stock, S0 , reflects the expectation that the stock and the portfolio of
which it is a part will be sold every m years.6 The sale will trigger a capital gain or loss taxed at
a rate of τ g . No distinction is made between long-term and short-term capital gains and losses,

i.e., both are taxed at the same rate. The stock pays a continuous dividend that starts at an annual
rate of divS dollars and is expected to grow at an annual rate of gS . Dividends are taxed at a rate
of τ d . Both τ g and τ d are assumed to remain constant.



5
  For tractability, we assume that losses, which are not deductible in the year of realization, are never deducted. This
assumption overstates the costs of loss limitations under the current U.S. federal tax system, which permits
carryover of losses. However, since the time value of money reduces the benefit of a deferred deduction during
periods of constant or falling tax rates, this omission does not affect the generality of our principal results.
6
  Unlike Constantinedes [1983], our model of equity valuation does not reflect the possibility of optimal timing of
capital gain and loss recognition. We recognize that timing of capital gains and losses plays a significant role in
equity valuation. Nevertheless, our simpler approach allows us to focus on the valuation effects of the limitation on
the deduction of capital losses and the netting of realized portfolio gains and losses in the computation of the capital
gains tax. However, at least for some investors, this assumption is likely descriptive. For example, an individual
may invest through mutual funds that generate capital gains over which he has no discretion. If so, he may evaluate
individual stocks in light of the capital gains flowing from the fund, an analytical approach analogous to the one
employed in this paper .

           At any time t, the expected annual rate of after-tax dividend payment is divS 1 − τ d e gSt ,                                       b     g
and the actual after-tax dividend received over an infinitesimally small time interval dt is
       b       g
divS 1 − τ d e gSt dt . The discount rate applicable to the after-tax dividend is kS , with kS > gS , and
reflects the uncertainty of the dividend stream. Thus, the present value of the after-tax dividend

           Since the rate of growth in dividends is assumed to remain constant, E ( Sm ) , the

E ( Sm ) = φS E ( PVD [ m, 2m ]) = φS PVDS ( 0, m ) e g S m .

B. Determining the Valuation Impact of Capital Gains and Losses
           The key to understanding the impact of capital gains taxation in the pricing of the stock is
recognizing that the full value of a stock’s realized gain or loss is included in taxable income if
and only if the realized capital gains of the investor’s portfolio exceed the total of capital losses.
Let BS denote the investor’s basis in the stock, Q m denote the aggregate proceeds from the sale

of total portfolio assets at time m, and BQ represent the sum of the tax bases of the total portfolio.
Then, the net taxable capital gain or loss from the proceeds of selling the stock at time m at a

                      (                  )
price of S m is S m − BS Q m > BQ .9 (In our model we assume that S m − BS is sufficiently small

that it can be ignored in determining whether Q m > BQ .10 ) The initial stock value, S0 , can then

be expressed as follows:
                   S0 = φS PVDS ( 0, m )
                                                                                                                                 (2)
                      = PVDS ( 0, m ) + φS PVDS ( 0, m ) e(
                                                                      g S − kS ) m
                                                                                                (                     )
                                                                                     − τ g PV  S m − BS  Q m > BQ ,

where PV (i) denotes the present value operator. In equation (2), PVDS ( 0, m ) is the present

value of after-tax dividends to be received between times t = 0 and t = m .
φS PVDS ( 0, m ) e( g     S   − kS ) m
                                         is the expected stock price at time m discounted to the present at the rate

               (                                 )
k S . τ g PV  S m − BS  Q m > BQ is the present value of the incremental capital gains tax

8
    The use of the dividend multiple, φ S , enables one to infer the mathematics of the stock’s valuation between times
m and ∞ from the valuation between times 0 and m. As such, it significantly simplifies the mathematics of
valuation, although φ S itself plays no direct role in the economics of the model.
9
    In other words, if Q m > BQ and S m > BS , then the investor must pay τ g S m − BS      (    ) in additional capital gains
taxes. If Q m > BQ and S m           < B , then the investor’s capital gains tax liability is reduced by τ ( S − B ) . If
                                             S                                                                g   m       S


Q m < BQ and S m > BS , the individual stock’s capital gain of S m − BS escapes taxation. If Q m < BQ and S m < BS ,

then the individual stock’s capital loss of S m − BS simply increases the investor’s supply of nondeductible capital
losses and thus produces no tax savings.




                                                                     5
expected to be paid from the sale of the stock at time m, conditional upon the value of the
portfolio exceeding its tax basis ( Q m > BQ ).

           Since the tax basis is equal to the stock value at the time of purchase, an investor who
buys the stock at a price of S0 will establish a basis of S0 , i.e., BS = S0 . Accordingly,

   (                           )            (                                             )
PV  S m − BS  Q m > BQ = PV  S m − S0  Q m > BQ , which, in turn, can be expressed as

PV ( S     m   Qm   > B ) − PV ( S
                       Q             0                   )
                                         Q m > BQ . To evaluate these expressions, we assume S m and Q m

                                      (                           )

   Rubinstein (1976) does not include dividends in the formulation of conditional expected values. Nevertheless,
using standard option pricing theory, the inclusion of dividends is straightforward.

        To obtain present values, we apply standard risk-neutral valuation methodology to the
expected values from equations (3) and (4).12 Using this methodology, we first equate the
expected instantaneous returns for the stock and the portfolio to the risk-free interest rate, r,
resulting in µ S + 12 σ 2S = r for the stock and µ Q + 21 σ Q2 = r for the portfolio. Next, we equate the

two components of the expected net capital gain to the risk-free rate by substituting µ S + 12 σ 2S = r

and µ Q + 21 σ Q2 = r into equations (3) and (4) and discounting both conditional expected values at

the risk-free interest rate.

C. Determining the Equilibrium Values of the Portfolio and Stock
        Thus far we have placed no restriction on portfolio Q. It is simply a portfolio held by an
investor that is expected to be sold every m years. However, for the purposes of determining the
equilibrium stock price, we assume that portfolio Q represents the market portfolio of all assets
subject to capital gains taxation and like the stock, its value reflects the expectation that all of its
component assets will be sold every m years.
        Since the equilibrium value of any stock is a function of the value of this market
portfolio, we must first determine the portfolio’s equilibrium value. As in the valuation of the
stock, we assume the portfolio’s value reflects the expectation of lognormal returns and a
constant rate of growth in dividends. Therefore, the mathematics of the portfolio’s valuation is
the same as for the valuation of the stock. Substituting Q for S in equation (2), the value of the
market portfolio becomes:
              Q0 = φQ PVDQ ( 0, m )
                                                                                                                                (8)
                 = PVDQ ( 0, m ) + φQ PVDQ ( 0, m ) e
                                                            ( gQ − kQ ) m
                                                                                      (
                                                                            − τ g PV Q m − BQ  Q m > BQ .     )
As with an individual stock, we assume that the initial purchase price of the portfolio establishes
its tax basis. Therefore, in deriving the equilibrium value of the market portfolio, we set
BQ = Q0* , where Q0* = φQ* PVDQ ( 0, m ) denotes the portfolio’s equilibrium value. Making this

substitution into equation (8) and expressing the initial portfolio value as an equilibrium value
gives:
             Q0* = φQ* PVDQ ( 0, m )
                                                                                                                                            (9)

                                                                                                   − τ g PV Q m − Q0*  Q m > Q0* .

                        (                                        )
         The term PV Q m − Q0*  Q m > Q0* in equation (9) is evaluated by substituting ρ = 1

(since the market portfolio is perfectly correlated with itself), σ S = σ Q and yS = yQ* into equation

(7). The substitution yS = yQ* reflects that the portfolio’s equilibrium dividend yield will be a

function of its initial equilibrium value. With these substitutions, and the evaluation of

PV Q m − Q0*  Q m > Q0* under the assumption of lognormal portfolio returns, the equilibrium

side of the equation. Unfortunately, we are unable to solve for Q0* directly. Therefore, we

employ binary search to solve for the value of Q0* , which equates the left and right hand sides of
equation (10). This equilibrium solution value for the portfolio establishes its after-tax dividend
yield, yQ* . With this dividend yield, the equilibrium value of the stock becomes:

       As in the valuation of the market portfolio, where Q0* appears on both sides of equation

(10), S0* appears on both sides of equation (11), and we are unable to obtain a direct solution for

S0* . Nevertheless, using binary search we are able to determine the value of S0* that satisfies

both sides of equation (11) to any desired degree of accuracy.
       The impact of the correlation of the stock’s returns with the portfolio returns in the
stock’s valuation is the primary focus of this paper. Correlation affects firm value in two ways.
The first is the straightforward effect through x1 , where firms with low correlation benefit from



                                                                              10
the pooling of gains and losses. The second is through the firm’s required return. Specifically,
we assume that a Continuous Time Capital Asset Pricing Model-based risk-return relationship is
embedded in the equilibrium stock price S0* . According to the Continuous Time CAPM (Merton

                                               ρσ S
[1973a]), k S = r + β S , Q ( kQ − r ) = r +        ( kQ − r ) , where β S ,Q is the instantaneous beta of the
                                               σQ

stock in relation to the market portfolio. (Technically, as shown in the appendix, β S , Q is what

the stock’s beta would be if capital gains were not subject to taxation.) Therefore, for the

A. Conditions for no capital gains tax effect in valuation
         An examination of equation (11) shows that the model price for the stock will be the
same as its corresponding Gordon value, and, therefore, will not reflect the potential for capital

                                       (                              )
gains taxation, if the term τ g e − yS m N [ x1] − e − rm N [ x 2] equals zero. This will be the case if the
                                           *




capital gains tax rate, τ g , equals zero or if e − yS m N [ x1] = e − rm N [ x 2] . Clearly, if τ g = 0 , capital
                                                         *




gains taxation can have no effect on the value of the stock. But even if τ g > 0 , the potential to

net portfolio capital gains and losses can eliminate any capital gains tax-related impact in the

valuation of the stock if e − yS m N [ x1] = e − rm N [ x 2] .
                                   *




         To understand the conditions for which e − yS m N [ x1] = e − rm N [ x 2] , note that
                                                                  *

therefore, N ( x1) and N ( x 2 ) will also be equal, if ρ = 0 . But with ρ = 0 and N ( x1) = N ( x 2 ) ,

                                                                       (                            )
the entire capital gains valuation effect as given by τ g e − yS m N [ x1] − e − rm N [ x 2] will equal zero

r = yS* + g S . Thus, if ρ = 0 and g S = 0 , yS* will equal r, causing

      (                             )

              This is an intuitively appealing result. If ρ = 0 , any capital gains resulting from random
movements in the stock’s price should be neutralized by other realized gains and losses in the
larger market portfolio. However, capital gains can also occur for the stock on a non-random
basis if the expected growth rate in dividends, g S , exceeds zero. With g S > 0 , both the level of
dividend payment and the level of the stock’s price would be expected to increase over time.
Thus, even if ρ = 0 , and all potential capital gains taxation from random stock price movements
is expected to be neutralized, if g S > 0 , the expectation of a natural increase in the price of the
stock should cause the potential for capital gains taxation to be reflected in the stock price.
Therefore, to neutralize the effects of capital gains taxation when g S > 0 , ρ must be negative.

              If ρ < 0 , the stock should be priced as if there will be negative taxation of randomly
generated capital gains. With ρ < 0 , if there is a gain in the value of the market portfolio, there
is likely to be a loss in the value of the stock. In this case, the stock’s loss can be offset against
the overall gain, which, in turn, would result in an incremental negative capital gains tax for the
stock. On the other hand, if there is a realized loss in the market portfolio, there is likely to be a

     Implicitly, this analysis requires r > 0 . Otherwise, g S > k S , and the stock’s Gordon value will be undefined.

gain in the stock. But since no tax would be paid at the portfolio level, the incremental tax
associated with the stock’s gain would be zero. Therefore, in an expected value sense, with
ρ < 0 , the stock should be priced as if there will be a negative tax associated with randomly
generated capital gains.
B. General Effect of Capital Gains Taxation in Stock Valuation
           Table I summarizes the general effect of capital gains taxation in the valuation of the
stock as a function of the correlation of stock and portfolio returns, ρ , and the growth rate in the
stock’s dividend, g S . Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of the joint effect of
correlation and dividend growth on the model value of the stock as a proportion of its Gordon
value, assuming capital gains are taxed at a rate of 20 percent as they are today.

           The relationships summarized in table I are evident in figure 1.14 Generally, if both the
growth rate in dividends and the correlation between stock and market returns are positive,
conditions that should hold for most exchange-traded stocks, the potential taxation of capital
gains should have a negative impact on the pricing of the stock. However, it is possible for the
valuation impact of capital gains taxation to be positive for an individual stock if correlation is
negative and / or, if dividends, and, hence, the price of the stock itself, are projected to decrease
in value over time.

     In figure 1, the following parameter values are assumed: τ g = 0.20 , r = 0.05 , kQ = 0.10 g Q = 0.02 , σ Q = 0.18 ,
σ S = 0.30 . It can be shown that higher values of kQ tend to steepen the curves in Figure 1. Higher values of g Q
tend to shift the point at which the three curves converge to the left.

         Figure 1 shows that correlation also affects the stock’s required return through the

particular example. With negative correlation, the stock’s required return will be relatively low,
causing any positive valuation effect from capital gains taxation to be magnified even further.
On the other hand, large positive values of ρ are associated with higher required returns, which,
in turn, partially mitigate the negative impact of capital gains taxation in the valuation of the
stock.
         Figure 1 also illustrates how the selling horizon, m, affects the value of S0* / gordonS . For

the one-year selling horizon, the relationship between S0* / gordonS and the correlation

coefficient, ρ , is steeper in comparison to that for the five-year horizon. Interestingly, even for
a selling horizon as short as five years, capital gains taxation has very little impact in valuation
when ρ > 0 . At the extreme, when ρ = 1 and m = 5 , the values of S0* / gordonS for stock
growth rates of –0.02, 0.0 and 0.02 are 0.989, 0.978, and 0.964, respectively. If there were no
tax impact, all three values would equal 1.0.
         Figure 2 provides more detail on the relationship between S0* / gordonS and the selling

horizon, m, and illustrates that for any rational set of parameter values, such that k S > g S ,

lim S0* / gordonS = 0 if ρ > 0 , lim S0* / gordonS = ∞ if ρ < 0 , and lim S0* / gordonS = 1 for all
m→0                              m→0                                      m →∞


values of ρ . It also illustrates that for selling horizons of two or more years, the relationship

between S0* / gordonS and m is relatively flat; there is little difference between S0* / gordonS for a
selling horizon of two years and that associated with a much longer selling horizon. However,
for horizons less than two years, and especially less than one year, the relationship between
S0* / gordonS and m becomes much steeper. With very short selling horizons, negative
correlation becomes infinitely valuable, while positive correlation drives stock value to zero.
C. Sensitivity of Price to a Change in the Capital Gains Tax Rate
         This section explores the extent to which the equilibrium stock price is affected by a
change in the capital gains tax rate. To examine this effect, the derivative of the equilibrium
stock price with respect to a change in the capital gains tax rate is estimated numerically by



                                                    14
computing the difference between the equilibrium stock price evaluated at τ g + 0.001 and

τ g − 0.001 and dividing the difference by 0.002. This derivative indicates how many dollars the
stock price should change per unit change in the tax rate. It is more useful, however, to express

a one percentage point change in the tax rate, for example, from 0.20 to 0.21, represents a change
of 0.01 units, not one unit. Thus, a one percentage point increase in the tax rate should be

correlation between stock and market returns, the expected return of the overall portfolio, kQ , the

selling horizon, m, and the growth rate in dividends, g S . In figure 3, the capital gains tax rate is
assumed to be 0.28, the Federal tax rate in effect prior to the reduction in 1997 to 0.20. Other
parameter values assumed in all panels of the figure are r = 0.05 , gQ = 0.02 , σ Q = 0.18 and

σ S = 0.30 . In the upper portion of figure 3, the expected market return, kQ , is assumed to be

0.10, which implies a market risk premium of kQ − r = 0.10 − 0.05 = 0.05 . In the lower portion,

kQ = r = 0.05 , consistent with no risk premium. The two panels on the left are associated with a

selling horizon of one year while the two panels on the right are associated with a five-year
horizon.
       Several relationships are evident from the four panels. For stocks whose returns are
positively correlated with those of the market portfolio, the proportional change in price resulting
from a change in the capital gains tax rate is less negative for the longer five-year selling
horizon. For stocks with positive correlation, return sensitivity to a change in the tax rate is
much more negative when the risk premium is low (as shown in the lower portion of figure 3
where kQ = r = 0.05 ). Presumably, in a market with little risk premium, stock prices are

relatively high to begin with, and, in a sense, have further to fall in percentage terms if the tax

rate is increased. This same concept appears to apply to the relationship between            and
                                                                                   dτ g

the growth rate in dividends, g S . Stock prices of firms with positive correlation and higher
dividend growth rates, and, hence, higher prices relative to dividends and earnings, tend to be
more adversely affected by a change in the capital gains tax rate than stocks of firms with lower
growth rates.
       The four panels of Figure 3 suggest some interesting mathematical patterns over the
negative range of correlation. With the exception of the g S = 0.04 portions of the upper panels,
a point is reached in all the panels where the correlation coefficient is sufficiently negative that
dS0* / S0*
           > 0. This implies that stocks with correlations below this level should increase in value

when the capital gains tax rate goes up and decrease in value when it goes down, a result
consistent with the diversification value of negative correlation discussed earlier.
       Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between the proportional change in the value of the
                                                                         dQ0* / Q0*

the selling horizon, the growth rate in dividends for the market portfolio, and the expected
market return. Generally, lower values of the expected market return and higher dividend growth
rates, both of which imply higher values for the market portfolio, are associated with greater
                                                                       dQ0* / Q0*

reasonable combinations of kQ , gQ , and m. This would suggest that the change in the capital

gains tax rate from 0.28 to 0.20 in 1997 should have been accompanied by a proportional
increase in the value of the market portfolio of roughly −1.5 ( 0.20 − 0.28 ) = 12 percent to

−0.05 ( 0.20 − 0.28 ) = 4 percent. These predicted returns are consistent with a 6.1 percent mean

return for stocks of dividend-paying firms and 12.9 percent for non-dividend-paying firms
reported by Lang and Shackelford (2000) for the five trading day period, Tuesday April 29

through Monday, May 5, surrounding the May 2, 1997 budget agreement. Although a reduction
in the capital gains tax rate was not specifically announced at that time, the business press
immediately began to speculate that the capital gains tax rate would be reduced from 28 percent
to between 15 and 20 percent.15
D. Summary
         To summarize, two stock-specific forces are at work in determining the valuation impact
of the capital gains tax, both of which are related to the ability of the stock to offset portfolio
gains with losses (or vice versa). If the stock is likely to incur losses when the portfolio incurs
gains, the inclusion of the stock in the portfolio will have the effect of reducing the capital gains
tax that would otherwise accrue to the portfolio. On the other hand, if the stock is likely to incur
gains when the portfolio incurs losses, including the stock in the portfolio keeps a portion of the
portfolio’s potential tax loss deductions from being wasted, and enables the stock to be priced as
if it is not subject to capital gains taxation. In either case, including the stock in the portfolio has
the effect of reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes, and at the margin, should be value
enhancing.
         Stock and portfolio returns will tend to offset when they are negatively correlated.
Therefore, holding other factors constant, a stock’s value should increase as the correlation of its
returns with portfolio returns becomes lower. Returns will also tend to offset when the growth
rates in dividends for the stock and portfolio are of opposite sign. For example, when the
dividend growth rate for the portfolio is positive, the value of the portfolio would be expected to
grow at the same rate, and, therefore, the portfolio, on average, would be expected to produce
capital gains. If the growth rate in dividends for the stock is negative, then the stock is expected
to produce capital losses. Therefore, adding the stock to the portfolio should reduce capital gains
taxes and, therefore, result in a positive impact in the pricing of the stock.
         Two other effects are also important. First, if kQ ≠ r , the discount rate will be related to
the correlation between stock and portfolio returns. Second, if the stock grows at a sufficiently
rapid rate, the benefits of diversification can be overwhelmed by the capital gains taxes
ultimately paid on the share’s appreciation.

                                           III. Conclusion
        Theoretical and empirical analyses of the taxation of capital gains and losses typically
ignore the fact that the marginal tax rate applied to a specific capital gain and loss depends on the
total portfolio of realized capital gains and losses during the year. This paper analyzes the stock
valuation implications created by this pooling.
        We find that the impact of capital gains taxation on stock values can be positive or
negative depending on the correlation between the stock’s returns and those of the overall
portfolio. The present value of capital gain taxes associated with an individual stock is generally
increasing if the returns of the stock are positively correlated with the returns of the market
portfolio. On the other hand, valuations for stocks whose returns are negatively correlated with
market returns generally are increasing in capital gains tax rates. This consequence of the
current U.S. system of taxing capital gains and losses should produce less of a tax penalty and
even a premium in the pricing of stocks with low return correlation with the market.
        If the extent to which portfolio netting affects current stock valuations is significant, it
carries important and potentially overlooked policy implications for ongoing debates. In short,
the current system of netting capital gains and losses affects individual firm valuations
differently, depending on the correlation of their returns with movements in the overall stock
market. As a result, the burden of the capital gains tax is not born equally by all equity shares.
Some shares bear a significant portion of the overall capital gains tax burden while others can
actually benefit from the taxation of capital gains. A tax whose distributional effects vary with
the correlation and growth characteristics specific to individual investments, rather than the
income and wealth levels of their investors, cannot be justified under conventional tax theory and
is likely an unintended consequence. Policy remedies could include lifting the limitation on
losses or substituting a transaction tax for the capital gains tax.

which breaks out the value of the stock into three components. The first component,
                  m
PVDS ( 0, m ) = ∫ divS (1 − τ d ) e(
                                              g S − k S )t
                                                             dt , is the present value of dividends from now (time 0) until
                  0


time m, the time at which the stock is expected to be sold. The second component,
φS PVDS ( 0, m ) e( g   S   − kS ) m
                                       , is the stock’s expected selling price as of time m discounted to the

                                                                             (                   )
present at the rate k S . The third component, τ g PV  S m − BS  Q m > BQ , is the present value of

capital gains taxes expected to be incurred in connection with the sale of the stock at time m.
        Note that the required return, k S , enters the first two terms but not the third. If it were

not for the third term, the required return, k S , would be that which is appropriate for valuing the
stock in the absence of capital gains taxation. Given the assumption of a lognormal stock price,
if there were no capital gains taxation, Merton’s (1973a) continuous time Capital Asset Pricing
Model would provide the appropriate required return for determining both PVDS ( 0, m ) , the

present value of dividends from time zero to time m, and φS PVDS ( 0, m ) e(
                                                                                                     g S − kS ) m
                                                                                                                    , the present

value of the stock price expected at time m.
        As Modigliani and Miller (1963) show in their classic paper on the effects of the
corporate interest tax deduction on the value of a firm, the value of a levered firm equals the
value of the same firm if it were unlevered plus the present value of taxes saved through the
interest deduction. In determining unlevered value, the firm’s expected unlevered after-tax cash
flow is discounted at an unlevered cost of capital – that is, the rate that should apply to the
valuation of after-tax expected cash flow if the firm had no debt. A separate capitalization rate is
then applied to the taxes saved through the interest deduction. The notion of separating a firm’s
cash flows into components with different tax and risk characteristics and valuing the
components separately has come to be known as the “value additivity principle.”




                                                                        19
        This same principle should apply to the valuation of the components of a stock’s value.
Together, the first two components of equation 2 represent what the total value of the stock
would be in the absence of capital gains taxation. As in Modigliani and Miller, these component
values should be determined as if there were no capital gain tax. The third term in equation 2
reflects the effects of capital gains taxation on firm value, just as the second term in Modigliani
and Miller’s valuation equation reflects the value of corporate taxes saved from deducting
interest. Thus, by assuming k S is determined by Merton’s Continuous Time Capital Asset
Pricing Model, we are simply invoking the value additivity principle.
        Consistent with Modigliani and Miller (1963) and the value additivity principle, k S
should be interpreted as the stock’s required (or instantaneous expected) return in the absence of
capital gains taxation, and kQ should be interpreted as the required market return in the absence

                                                  ρσ S
of capital gains taxation. Similarly, β S , Q =        and its components ρ , σ S , and σ Q , should
                                                  σQ
be interpreted as statistical parameters estimated in the absence of capital gains taxation.
                                                                            ρσ S
Together, these parameters imply an un-taxed required return, k S = r +
                                                                            σQ
                                                                                 ( kQ − r ) , which
should be interpreted in the same way as Modigliani and Miller’s unlevered cost of capital.
