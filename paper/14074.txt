                                            ABSTRACT

This paper tests the hypothesis that the timing of welfare payments affects criminal activity. Analysis
of daily reported incidents of major crimes in twelve U.S. cities reveals an increase in crime over the
course of monthly welfare payment cycles. This increase reflects an increase in crimes that are likely
to have a direct financial motivation like burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and robbery,
as opposed to other kinds of crime like arson, assault, homicide, and rape. Temporal patterns in crime
are observed in jurisdictions in which disbursements are focused at the beginning of monthly welfare
payment cycles and not in jurisdictions in which disbursements are relatively more staggered.

1. Introduction

       Consider an individual who receives support from monthly welfare payments that

are distributed at the beginning of the month. These payments may be made directly to

this individual or to someone who provides for the individual or transacts with the

individual. Welfare payments are disbursed on a monthly basis, and a series of studies

indicate that the typical recipient of cash assistance increases consumption immediately

following the receipt of payments and exhausts these payments quickly. Poor individuals

are also unlikely to have access to savings or credit that might help cover temporary cash

shortfalls and often have weak earnings prospects in legitimate economic activity.

Consequently, this hypothetical individual might deplete welfare related income quickly

and turn to crime to supplement this income. This paper tests the hypothesis that income

generating criminal activity is increasing in the amount of time that has passed since

welfare payments occurred.

       The analysis exploits plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of payments

across cities and differences in the likely motivation of different kinds of crime. The

three welfare programs that provide the largest share of income maintenance benefits to

the poor are considered; these are the Food Stamp program, the Temporary Assistance for

Needy Families (TANF) program, and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.

The sample of reported incidents of crime covers 12 cities in which more than 10% of the

population receives payments from the most inclusive welfare program, the Food Stamp

program. If patterns in crime are influenced by the timing of welfare payments, then

increases in crime over the course of monthly payment cycles should be most pronounced

in cities in which such payments are focused at the beginning of these cycles. If criminal




                                                                                           1
income is used to supplement welfare income, then any increase in crime should be

reflected in Type I Uniform Crime Report (UCR) or Group A National Incident Based

Reporting System (NIBRS) crimes with a direct financial motivation (burglary, larceny-

theft, motor vehicle theft, and robbery) and not other Type I UCR or Group A NIBRS

crimes (arson, assault offenses, forcible sex offenses, and homicide).

        Two approaches yield results indicating that crime rates do in fact increase in the

amount of time that has passed since welfare payments occurred. The first approach tests

if levels of criminal activity are different in the first ten calendar days of the month; this

timeframe corresponds to the period over which Food Stamp payments occur in cities

where they are focused at the beginning of the month. Rates of crime and counts of

reported incidents are higher after the first ten days of the month in jurisdictions where

welfare payments are focused at the beginning of the month but not in other jurisdictions.

The second approach employs an index that reflects the number of days since welfare

payments occurred in a city. This index takes into account payments related to not only

Food Stamps but also TANF and SSI. Higher values of the index are associated with

more crime.

        Both approaches also reveal that increases in crime over the course of monthly

welfare payment cycles are only observed for crimes that are likely to have a financial

motivation and not for other Type I UCR or Group A NIBRS crimes. These findings are

inconsistent with explanations for temporal patterns in crime that are unrelated to the

timing of welfare payments, like explanations related to police officer deployment or

incentives to report crimes as having occurred at certain times.




                                                                                                 2
        The findings in this paper make a number of contributions. First, they suggest a

role for behavioral considerations in economic explanations for criminal activity. Becker

(1968) provides a framework for analyzing criminal behavior in which criminals

rationally weigh the costs and benefits of illegal activity and are more likely to turn to

crime when they are likely to earn less from legitimate activities. This framework has

received ample empirical support.1 Recent work that shows that cash assistance

recipients typically spend their payments too quickly suggests one mechanism by which a

particular behavioral bias, short-run impatience, could affect the decision to engage in

criminal activity. Shapiro (2005) documents that food stamp recipients experience a

decline in caloric intake and an increase in the marginal utility of consumption in

between food stamp payments. Stephens (2003) finds that households that primarily

depend on social security for income increase spending on goods that reflect

instantaneous consumption in the first few days following the receipt of their check.

Dobkin and Puller (2007) find that welfare recipients increase their consumption of

illegal drugs when their checks arrive at the beginning of the month, spurring an increase

in hospitalizations and deaths. These studies provide evidence of behavior that suggests

short-run impatience and violations of the permanent income hypothesis.2 My results

suggest that this type of consumption behavior is associated with increased criminal


1
  Numerous studies including Donohue and Levitt (2001), Raphael and Winter-Ember (2001), and earlier
work summarized in Freeman (1995) have found a significant but small effect of unemployment on
property crimes. Machin and Meghir (2004) and Gould, Weinberg and Mustard (2002) find that changes in
earnings of low wage and unskilled workers in particular affect crime.
2
  Phelps and Pollak (1968) develop a simple framework of short-run impatience, and this framework is
employed by Laibson (1997), O’Donohue and Rabin (1999), O’Donohue and Rabin (2001), and Angeletos
et al. (2001) to consider a variety of economic applications. A number of papers provide evidence on the
validity of the permanent income hypothesis by studying the immediate consumption response to changes
in income. Recent work includes Shapiro and Slemrod (2003), Hsieh (2003), and Johnson, Parker, and
Souleles (2006). Lee and McCrary (2005) present evidence that criminals typically have low discount rates
or hyperbolic time preferences.


                                                                                                       3
activity later in monthly welfare payment cycles. These types of behavioral effects call

for distinctive public policy responses, as noted by Jolls (2007) and Bertrand,

Mullainathan, and Shafir (2004).

       Second, the paper illustrates an effect of the design of welfare programs on crime.

A large literature, parts of which are reviewed in Moffitt (1992) and Blank (2002),

considers the effects of welfare programs on employment, poverty, family structure, and

other factors. Some studies analyze the effects of welfare payments on criminal activity

using cross sectional data. DeFranzo (1996, 1997) and Hannon and DeFranzo (1998a,

1998b) present evidence that welfare payments reduce major crimes. However, Burek

(2005) finds that welfare payments are associated with higher levels of less severe

crimes. These studies typically face challenges controlling for all the characteristics of

jurisdictions that are likely to affect both the use of welfare programs and criminal

activity. The findings in my paper point out that the timing and frequency of welfare

payments have effects that carry policy implications. Staggered, frequent payments

would smooth levels of crime. Police forces might therefore have an easier time fighting

crime because they would be less likely to be overwhelmed during particular periods. If

welfare beneficiaries do exhibit short run impatience when making consumption

decisions, as indicated in the literature, frequent payments would smooth their

consumption and reduce the extent to which they face dire circumstances because they

consumed welfare related income too quickly. Levels of crime would be lower as a

consequence.

       This paper also adds to the burgeoning literature on household finance. Campbell

(2006) explores this field. Only a small part of the work in this field specifically




                                                                                             4
considers the personal finances of low-income individuals. Duflo, Gale, Liebman,

Orszag, and Saez (2006) and Beverly, Shneider, and Tufano (2006) argue that low-

income individuals in particular do not save enough. Low savings levels can have

detrimental consequences for the poor, who face severe credit constraints as documented

in Adams, Einav, and Levin (forthcoming), Barr (2004) and elsewhere. My analysis does

not study the income, savings, and consumption behaviors of poor individuals directly,

but it does suggest that individuals who exhaust their legitimate income rapidly and do

not have access to savings or credit attempt to increase their income through criminal

activity.3

           The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section explains the

hypotheses in more detail, and Section 3 describes the data and the main tests. Section 4

presents the results, and the last section concludes.



2. Hypotheses

           Welfare payments are distributed on a monthly basis according to payment

schedules that vary across programs and states. In many jurisdictions, payments from all

the major programs to all recipients occur during a short period within each month,

typically the beginning of the month. Payment schedules are set at the state and federal

level, not the city level, and they have not changed substantially over the last decade.

Conversations with state policy makers suggest that the distribution schedule for

payments was set on the basis of administrative considerations rather than considerations

related to patterns in consumption or criminal activity.



3
    Garmaise and Moskowitz (2006) show that weak credit conditions increase crime more generally.


                                                                                                    5
       Studies of the consumption of cash assistance recipients, including Shapiro

(2005), and Stephens (2003), reveal that recipients do not smooth their consumption but

instead exhibit short run impatience. They appear to spend their monthly payments too

quickly and to experience increasing marginal utility of consumption over monthly

payment cycles. This increase in the marginal utility of consumption in part reflects that

the poor do not have access to savings or credit, as documented in Adamds, Einav, and

Levin (forthcoming), Duflo, Gale, Liebman, Orszag, and Saez (2006), Beverly, Shneider,

and Tufano (2006), and Barr (2004).

       As a consequence, in jurisdictions where all welfare payments occur at the

beginning of the month, individuals who are welfare recipients or who transact with or

receive support from a recipient might not have the resources to satisfy their needs later

in the monthly payment cycle. Such individuals may turn to crime to augment their

welfare related income later in payment cycles. Frameworks that account for short-run

impatience, like the one developed in O’Dononhue and Rabin (1999), suggest that such

individuals will delay criminal activity even if they anticipate a cash shortfall at the time

of the payment and plan to make up this shortfall with criminal income. This is because

criminal activity has immediate costs; it requires effort and potentially results in

punishment.

       Even an individual who receives support from welfare payments and does not

exhibit short-run impatience may be more likely to engage in criminal activity later

during monthly welfare payment cycles. He may have very low income, a high marginal

utility of consumption, no savings or access to credit, and face uncertainty about the

extent to which he will face a cash shortfall. He may, for example, face unexpected




                                                                                                6
shocks to the prices of the goods he consumes. Given this uncertainty, he would be likely

to delay criminal activity until it is necessary.

        These considerations imply predictions for temporal patterns in crime in different

kinds of cities. In cities where payments from welfare programs are focused at the

beginning of the month, criminal activity should increase as the time since payments

occurred increases. Increased criminal activity should reflect increases in types of crime

that have a financial motivation, not other kinds of crime. In cities where welfare

programs make payments to different recipients on different days over longer time

periods or where payments to individuals occur more frequently than once a month, there

should not be any significant monthly temporal pattern in crime.

        This discussion has stressed the effect of the timing of welfare payments on the

demand for criminal income. It is worth considering briefly the potential effects of the

timing of payments on the supply of victims. These potential effects tend to work against

the predictions described above. If all welfare payments occurred at a particular point in

time during the month, this might increase the pool of potential victims and the

attractiveness and ease of stealing property. Crime rates could then be higher

immediately following payments. However, most welfare payments are distributed onto

electronic benefit transfer cards, and the funds on these cards are difficult to steal because

recipients must present a valid identification card to use them. Alternatively, potential

victims of crime might respond to changes in the demand for criminal income by taking

additional avoidance measures. For example, potential victims of burglary or robbery

could remain ensconced in their locked homes during periods when such crimes are

expected to be more common. However, most avoidance activities are costly. Therefore,




                                                                                             7
the timing of disbursement is unlikely to have a large effect on the supply of potential

victims.



3. Data and Tests

       The basic empirical approach is to study differences in criminal activity over the

course of monthly welfare payment cycles in cities across which there is variation in the

timing of payments. This analysis requires information on the distribution of welfare

payments by jurisdiction and detailed crime data.



3.1 Data on Welfare Programs

       The three primary welfare programs that provide income maintenance benefits are

the Food Stamps program, the TANF program, and the SSI program. Each of these

programs provides assistance to poor households that meet income and resource

requirements. The Food Stamp program provides funds that can be used at most grocery

stores, and the TANF program provides income maintenance payments to needy families.

In most states, both of these programs distribute payments electronically through

electronic benefit transfer debit cards, and payments that are not spent in a particular

month are carried forward to the next month. SSI pays benefits to disabled adults and

children who have limited means. SSI payments are distributed by check, which is

mailed to recipients once a month. The Food Stamp program has the broadest coverage

in the sense that TANF and SSI recipients typically meet the eligibility requirements to

receive food stamps. Because of its extensive coverage, I selected a sample of cities on

the basis of participation in the food stamp program.




                                                                                            8
        Quantifiable effects of the timing of welfare payments on crime are more likely to

be observed in jurisdictions where a substantial share of the population received such

payments. Fellowes and Berube (2005) compute food stamp program participation rates

in major metropolitan areas and counties. On the basis of their study, I select those

jurisdictions in which at least 10% of the population participates in the Food Stamp

program. This screen yields a sample of 15 cities including Baltimore, MD; Detroit, MI;

El Paso, TX; Fresno, CA; McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX; Memphis, TN; Miami, FL;

Milwaukee, WI; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia, PA;

Providence, RI; St. Louis, MO; and Washington, DC. As explained below, data on

reported incidents of crime are not available for Memphis, New York, and McAllen-

Edinburg-Mission, so the final sample includes 12 cities.

        Panels A and B of Table 1 provide information on the use of the three main

welfare programs in each city in the sample. For comparability with the data on the Food

Stamp program which are drawn from Fellowes and Berube (2005), the data on TANF

and SSI programs cover the year 1999.4 On average across cities, the Food Stamp

program serves about twice as many people as TANF programs and more than three

times as many people as SSI. The value of TANF program payments and SSI program

payments often exceed the value of food stamp payments, implying higher payments per

recipient. However, relative to TANF and SSI, Food Stamps have become a more

significant source of income over the 1999-2005 period. Appendix Table 1 provides

information on the value of all three programs from 1999 through 2005. Averaged across

4
  Data on the value of family assistance and SSI program payments are taken from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis Local Area Personal Income Database. Numbers of family assistance recipients are obtained from
the offices of state TANF directors. Data on the number of SSI recipients for counties are from SSI
Recipients by State and County, and for MSAs they are drawn from the State and Metropolitan Area
Databook 1997-1998.


                                                                                                     9
cities, the compound annual growth rate in the value of food stamps over this period is

8.2% while the rates for TANF and SSI are -0.7% and 2.3%, respectively.

        Panel C of Table 1 provides information about the timing of payments for each

program in each city. In most jurisdictions, each of the three programs makes payments

to recipients once a month.5 In some jurisdictions, Food Stamp and TANF payments

occur during time periods. For example, in Fresno, Food Stamps are paid over the first

ten days of the month, with the date of distribution depending on the last digit of the

recipient’s case number. TANF payments occur twice per month in three of the cities in

the sample.



3.2 Data on Criminal Activity

        Conducting tests on the effects of the timing of welfare payments on crime across

jurisdictions also requires detailed data on reported incidents of crime. Unfortunately,

comprehensive incident data for the cities in which welfare is widely used are not

available in NIBRS; NIBRS only covers jurisdictions that have agreed to provide data,

and very few large cities have done so. Therefore, obtaining these data required directly

contacting police departments. In order to ensure the comparability of data across

jurisdictions, I attempted to obtain data covering the 2004-2006 period on each incident

that is classified as a Part I UCR offense or a Group A NIBRS offense. These categories

of crime include arson, assault offenses, burglary, forcible sex offenses, homicide,

larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and robbery. For each incident, I requested

information about the type, the date and time, and the location of the incident.

5
  Cole and Lee (2005) identify the dates on which Food Stamp disbursements occur. I confirmed these
dates and obtained data on the timing of TANF payments from the divisions of state and local governments
that oversee this program.


                                                                                                     10
         12 of the 15 jurisdictions identified above provided useable data.6 Table 2

provides a description of the crime data obtained from each of the cities included in the

sample. All of the cities except Detroit used the UCR reporting system. Although I

attempted to obtain complete data covering the 2004-2006 period from each jurisdiction,

detailed data from some cities are only available for portions of this time frame, as

indicated in the last column of Table 2.7



3.3 The Tests

         The empirical tests consider two measures of crime—crime rates and counts of

reported incidents of crime. Crime rates are computed by taking the number of reported

incidents of crime on a particular day in a particular city and dividing that number by the

sample period average number of daily reported incidents in the city. OLS specifications

are used to analyze crime rates and negative binomial specifications are used to analyze

counts of reported incidents.

         Variation in the timing of payments allows me to conduct two kinds of tests. The

first is transparent but somewhat crude. It distinguishes between cities in which Food

Stamp payments are distributed in the first 10 days of the month and those in which

payments are more staggered. Food Stamp payments occur early in the month in Detroit,

Fresno, Newark, Philadelphia, Providence, and Washington, and I refer to this sample as

the Early Payment Sample. Food Stamp payments are more staggered in the month in

6
  The three cities that did not provide data are Memphis, New York, and the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission
MSA. Police officers in Memphis and New York denied my requests for data and rejected my appeals of
their denials. McAllen-Edinburg-Mission is not a single city but is a collection of three cities so I excluded
it.
7
  In several jurisdictions, changes to computer systems prevented departments from providing me with data
for the full sample period. Certain kinds of crime are not included in the data for some cities. For example,
arson is not covered in the sample for six cities. In some jurisdictions, this type of crime is collected and
aggregated by the fire department and not the police department.


                                                                                                           11
Baltimore, El Paso, Miami, Milwaukee, New Orleans, and St. Louis, and I refer to this

sample as the Staggered Payment Sample. Tests explaining levels of crime include a

dummy that is equal to one in the first 10 days of the month and otherwise equal to zero

as well as an interaction between this dummy and a dummy that is equal to one for the

Staggered Payment Sample and zero for the Early Payment Sample. The coefficient on

the time specific dummy reveals if criminal activity is lower in the early part of the

month in cities where welfare payments are focused at the start of the month, and the

coefficient on this variable interacted with the Staggered Payment Dummy reveals if

temporal patterns in crime are any different in cities where payments are more staggered.

       Information on the magnitude and timing of TANF payments and SSI payments

raises a concern about distinguishing among cities on the basis of the timing of Food

Stamp payments alone. As indicated in Panel C of Table 1, SSI payments are received on

the 1st of the month in all jurisdictions. TANF programs make payments twice a month

in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Providence, which are all in the Early Payment Sample and

these payments are made on the 1st of the month in Milwaukee, which is classified as part

of the staggered payment sample. In robustness checks, I remove observations from

Detroit, Philadelphia, Providence, and Milwaukee, from the data, leaving a set of cities

for which the classification based on the timing of Food Stamp payments is less subject

to this concern.

       The second type of test employs an index that reflects the number of days that

have passed since recipients received their last welfare payment in a particular city. It is

computed using the information on the number of welfare recipients and the dates of

payments. All three of the major welfare programs are taken into account. For programs




                                                                                           12
that make payments over a period of days within a month, I assume that an equal number

of recipients receive payments on each of the days within the period. For each program

on each calendar day, I compute the average number of days that have passed since

recipients received their last payment. For example, if Food Stamp payments occur on

the first and second day of the month, on the fourth day of the month this average will be

two and a half days. I then take a weighted average of these program-specific measures

where weights are set equal to the number of total recipients in each program.8 The

weighted average is divided by 30 to create an index that takes on values between zero

and one. If all welfare recipients received a payment from each program on the 1st of the

month, the index would be zero on that day, and if no additional payments occurred over

the course of the month, the index would be equal to one on the last day of months with

31 days.

           To provide further intuition for this index, Figure 1 displays values of the index

by the day of the month for Providence and St. Louis. In Providence, Food Stamps and

SSI payments occur only once a month on the 1st of the month, and TANF payments

occur twice a month on the first and 16th. Therefore, the index for Providence is zero on

the 1st of the month. It increases over the course of the month and drops down on the 16th

to reflect the fact that TANF recipients receive a payment at that time. In St. Louis, SSI

payments occur on the 1st of the month, but Food Stamp and TANF payments are

distributed over the first 22 days of the month with different recipients receiving payment

on different days. As a consequence, there is less variation in the index for St. Louis than

there is for Providence, and it declines over the first 22 days of the month before

increasing. One benefit of using this index in specifications that identify patterns in
8
    Similar indices and results are obtained if the values of program payments are used as weights.


                                                                                                      13
criminal activity is that it allows for the use of fixed effects for each calendar day of the

month.

         By identifying effects of the timing of welfare program payments off of

differences in payment schedules across cities, the tests rule out explanations for

temporal patterns in crime that are unrelated to welfare payments but that are related to

factors that are likely to be operative in all the cities in the sample. For example, rents

are typically due at the start of the month, and these payments could induce criminal

activity at the end of the month. Paychecks from legitimate employment are also often

issued once or twice a month. Differences in temporal patterns of crime across cities

where the timing of welfare payments differs are not consistent with alternative

explanations for an increase in crime throughout the month based on these kinds of

considerations.

         The tests are performed for different types of crime. The main hypothesis makes

predictions about the timing of crimes in which perpetrators are likely to have a direct

financial motivation. I refer to burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and robbery

as financially motivated crimes. I refer to Other Type I or Group A crimes as non-

financially motivated or other crimes, and they include arson, assault offenses, forcible

sex offenses, and homicide.9

         Some factors would give rise to the same temporal patterns for both types of

crime. Police officers may have an incentive to document incidents as occurring at a

9
  This distinction is not perfect. For some incidents, a criminal commits more than one offense, and these
incidents are typically classified according to the most serious offense in the data according to a hierarchy
established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For example, if a criminal robs and then kills his
victim, this incident is typically classified as a homicide. Therefore, some incidents that are classified as
non-financially motivated crimes may have financial motivations. It is noteworthy that the crime data do
not cover the possession and sale of illegal drugs. Evidence presented in Dobkin and Puller (2007)
suggests that this kind of activity occurs most frequently soon after the distribution of government transfer
payments, when drug users have the resources to increase their consumption.


                                                                                                           14
particular time, perhaps the beginning or end of the month. If the deployment of law

enforcement resources varies through the month, criminals of all types might time their

activity so as to minimize the chances of arrest. Criminals might also benefit from

conspiring to commit more of all types of crimes at a particular point in time because

limited enforcement resources could be more easily evaded. Under each of these

scenarios, financially motivated crimes and other types of crime would exhibit similar

temporal patterns. However, if patterns in crime reflect the timing of welfare payments,

then only financially motivated crimes should become more prevalent over the course of

the welfare payment cycles in jurisdictions where payments are focused at the beginning

of these cycles.

         In keeping with the analysis of patterns in crime presented in papers like Jacob,

Lefgren, and Morretti (2007) and Jacob and Lefgren (2003), the analysis below controls

for the effects of weather and holidays on crime. Daily data on the average temperature

in degrees Fahrenheit, inches of precipitation, and inches of snowfall are obtained from

the National Climatic Data Center.10 Days that are U.S. federal holiday are identified as

holidays. Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis.



4. Results

         Figure 2 presents crime rates, averaged over three day intervals for the Early

Payment Sample and the Staggered Payment Sample. Daily crime rates are computed for

each city and type of crime by dividing the count of reported incidents by the sample




10
  For each city, weather measurements are taken from the airport station nearest to the city and missing
data are augmented with data from other nearby stations.


                                                                                                           15
period average number of reported incidents in the city.11 Panel A displays rates for all

crimes. The solid line with diamond markers indicates how rates change over the course

of the month in cities in the Early Payment Sample. In the cities in this sample, the

overall crime rate is above average in the middle of the month, and it falls at the

beginning of the month. It reaches its lowest point, 0.97, at the start of the month and

then increases to about 1.01 over the next two weeks, implying an increase of about 4%.

Panel B and C respectively show crime rates for financially motivated crimes and non-

financially motivated crimes. In cities in the Early Payment Sample, there are

pronounced monthly cycles in the rate of financially motivated crimes but no discernable

trend in other crimes. Financially motivated crime rates increase from around 0.96 at the

beginning of the month to more than 1.02, indicating an increase of about 6%.

           The dotted lines with square markers indicate how crime rates change over the

course of the month for cities in the Staggered Payment Sample. In this sample, there is

no apparent trend in overall crime, financially motivated crime, or other crime over the

course of the month. These patterns in Figure 1 are consistent with the theory that

welfare beneficiaries exhaust their welfare related income soon after receiving it and then

attempt to augment their income with income from criminal activity later in the month.

Patterns in crime observed in the Early Payment Sample do not appear to be a

consequence of factors that are also operative in the Staggered Payment Sample.

           Table 4 presents the results of specifications that analyze patterns in total reported

incidents of Type I or Group A crimes. The dependent variable studied in the OLS

specifications in columns 1-4 is the crime rate, which is defined as the number of

reported incidents in a city on a particular date divided by average daily reported
11
     Jacob, Lefgren, and Morretti (2007) use a similar approach to measure weekly crime rates.


                                                                                                 16
incidents in the city. Each specification in Table 4 includes two kinds of fixed effects.12

City*Month*Year fixed effects control for differences across cities even if these vary

month to month. For example, these fixed effects control for local election cycles that

have been shown by Levitt (1997) to affect the size of police forces. City*Day of Week

fixed effects control for differences in criminal activity across days of the week in

individual cities. Standard errors that allow for clustering within each city/month pair

appear in parentheses.13

         The coefficients on Dummy for 1st-10th are negative and significant in columns 1

and 2. The -0.0318 coefficient in column 2 implies that the crime rate is 3.2% below

average during the first ten days of the month in cities where welfare payments are

focused in the beginning of the month. The coefficients on the Staggered Payment

Dummy interacted with the Dummy for 1st-10th are positive and significant and of

slightly smaller magnitude than the coefficients on the Dummy for 1st-10th. An F-test

reveals that the sum of the coefficients on Dummy for 1st-10th and on the interaction

terms for each specification is not statistically distinguishable from zero. These results

indicate that there are no discernable increases in reported incidents of crime in cities in

the Staggered Payment sample. Factors that are operative in both the Early Payment

sample and the Staggered Payment sample do not explain increases in crime in the Early

Payment sample.




12
   The results in Table 4 and the remainder of the analysis do not appear to depend on the inclusion of these
fixed effects. Using only city fixed effects to control for constant city characteristics yields estimates of the
effects of the timing of welfare payments on crime that are similar.
13
   In order to consider the possible effect of serial correlation on the magnitude of the standard errors, I
have also computed these for the OLS specifications using a block bootstrap technique. This approach
yields very similar estimates that do not materially change the significance of the results.


                                                                                                              17
       The specifications in column 2 include controls for weather and a dummy that is

equal to one on holidays and zero otherwise. Consistent with previous work, crime

appears to increase as temperatures rise and decrease with precipitation and snowfall.

Crime rates are also lower on holidays.

       The specifications presented in columns 3 and 4 are similar to those in columns 1

and 2, but they use the Time Since Payment Index to identify the effects of the timing of

welfare payments, and they also include a fixed effect for each calendar day of the

month. These specifications identify the effect of the timing of payments off of

differences in how the index changes over the course of the month across cities. The

results indicate that crime rates increase with the amount of time that has passed since

welfare payments occurred. The 0.1079 coefficient on the Time Since Payment Index in

column 4 implies that, if all welfare payments occurred on the 1st of the month, crime

rates would be 10.8% higher on the 31st of the month relative to the 1st of the month.

       Columns 5-8 of Table 4 contain results of negative binomial specifications that

analyze counts of reported incidents as opposed to crime rates. The results in the

specifications are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to those in columns 1-4.

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that criminal income supplements

welfare income at the end of monthly welfare payment cycles.

       The timing of welfare payments is hypothesized to affect crimes in which

perpetrators have a direct financial motivation and not necessarily other kinds of crime.

The specifications in Table 5 analyze crimes that are likely to have financial motives.

The specifications in this table are the same as those presented in Table 4 except the

dependent variables analyzed are the rate of financially motivated crime in columns 1-4




                                                                                            18
and the count of reported incidents of financially motivated crime in columns 5-8. As in

Table 4, the coefficients on the Dummy for 1st-10th are negative and significant, and the

coefficients on this dummy interacted with the Staggered Payment Dummy are positive

and significant. These results indicate that there are increases in financially motivated

crimes in cities where welfare payments are focused at the beginning of the month. In

cities where welfare payments are more staggered, increases are less pronounced and do

not differ statistically from the null of there being no temporal trend. The coefficients on

the Time Since Payment Index are also positive and significant.

        The effects of the timing of welfare payments on financially motivated crimes

appear to be more pronounced than its effects on total crime analyzed in Table 4. The -

0.0378 coefficient on the Dummy for 1st-10th in column 2 implies that, in the Early

Payment Sample, the financially motivated crime rate is 3.8% (as opposed to 3.2% for all

crimes) below average in the first 10 days of the month than it is over the rest of the

month. The 0.1254 coefficient on Day of the Month in column 4 indicates that if all

welfare payments occurred on the 1st of the month, the financially motivated crime rate

would be 12.5% (as opposed to 10.8% for all crimes) higher on the 31st of the month

relative to the 1st.

        If patterns in crime were attributable to reporting biases or effects of police

deployment that are similar across different types of crime, then the data would indicate

an increase in non-financially motivated crimes over the course of welfare payment

cycles as well. The hypothesis that patterns in crime reflect income needs that arise

during welfare payment cycles does not make this prediction. Table 6 presents results of

specifications that test for temporal trends in non-financially motivated crimes. These




                                                                                            19
specifications are the same as those presented in Tables 4 and 5, but the dependent

variables considered are the non-financially motivated crime rate in columns 1-4 and the

count of reported incidents of non-financially motivated crime in columns 5-8. The

results do not indicate any statistically significant relations between the timing of welfare

payments and non-financially motivated crimes. The coefficients on the Dummy for 1st-

10th are positive, but they are insignificant and of much smaller magnitude than the

coefficients on this variable in the specifications that explain financially motivated crimes

presented in Table 5. The coefficients on the Time Since Payment Index are also

insignificant, and they are very small in magnitude in columns 7 and 8. These results

suggest that explanations for patterns in crime over monthly welfare payment cycles that

do not differentiate between financially motivated and other crimes are incomplete.

           Table 7 displays analysis of financially motivated crimes by type of crime. The

specifications are the same as those presented in columns 7 and 8 of Table 5, but the

dependent variable is the count of reported burglaries in columns 1 and 2, larcenies in

columns 3 and 4, motor vehicle thefts in columns 5 and 6, and robberies in columns 7 and

8. The Time Since Payment Index attracts a positive coefficient in each specification,

and these coefficients are significant for all types of crime except burglary. The

insignificant coefficient on burglary could reflect the fact that burglars often study

potential targets before deciding to enter them and typically attempt to commit their

crimes when properties are unoccupied.14 Therefore, this type of crime may be less

motivated by short run liquidity needs than other kinds of financially motivated crimes.

The implied effect of the timing of welfare payments is particularly pronounced for

robbery. The 0.2224 coefficient on the Time Since Payment Index in column 8 implies
14
     Weisel (2002) and Clarke (2002) provide descriptive information about burglary.


                                                                                             20
that robbery rates are 22% higher on the 31st of the month relative to the 1st of the month

in a jurisdiction where all welfare payments occur on the 1st of the month. This result

might reflect the fact that individuals who have exhausted their welfare related income

need liquid assets, and robbery is more likely to yield cash than other financially

motivated crimes.

        The results indicate effects of the timing of welfare payments on measures of

crime at the city level. If increases in criminal activity were focused among welfare

beneficiaries and these beneficiaries committed only a fraction of crimes, then increases

in crime among this population would be larger than the aggregate results indicate.

Exploring this possibility would require detailed information on the sources of income of

the perpetrators of crimes. However, such data are not available. According to national

data, only approximately 15% of Part I UCR crimes result in an arrest and detailed

income data are not even collected for arrested individuals.15

        Even though detailed income data for perpetrators are not available, it is possible

to compare the demographics of arrested individuals with those who receive support from

welfare payments to determine if it seems plausible that they are behind any temporal

patterns in financially motivated crime. Harlow (1998 and 2000) presents the results of

surveys of jail inmates and finds that individuals who are in jail for committing

financially motivated crimes report very low pre-arrest levels of monthly income and that

more than 75% of them qualify for and receive public counsel. Therefore, the income

profile of criminals is similar to the income profile of welfare recipients.16


15
  See Crime in the United States, published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
16
  There are some indications of gender differences between welfare recipients and criminals. During the
sample period, 59% of Food Stamp recipients, 57% of SSI recipients, and 60% of TANF recipients were
female, but only 30% of individuals arrested for financially motivated crimes were female. Furthermore, a


                                                                                                       21
        As mentioned in Section II, the distinction between the Early Payment Sample

and the Staggered Payment Sample used in the tests that include the dummy that is equal

to one for the first ten days of the month is subject to some concerns. This distinction is

based on the timing of Food Stamp payments. Although this form of welfare is the

largest in terms of the number of recipients, TANF programs are larger in value terms in

many jurisdictions, and the timing of TANF payments differs from the timing of Food

Stamp payments. In order to confirm that results are robust to using a more strictly

defined sample, I drop Detroit, Philadelphia, Providence, and Milwaukee, from the

sample. These are cities in which either Food Stamp payments are focused at the

beginning of the month but TANF payments are more staggered or Food Stamp payments

are staggered but TANF payments are focused at the beginning of the month.17

        The results of some of the specifications presented in Tables 5 and 6, run using

the reduced sample, appear in Appendix Table 2. The results indicate that using the more

strictly defined sample yields estimates suggesting larger effects of the timing of welfare

payments on financially motivated crimes in the Early Payment Sample. Using the more

refined sample, there are, as before, no significant temporal patterns in non-financially

motivated crimes in either the strictly defined Early Payment Sample or Staggered

Payment Sample.

        Appendix Table 3 presents results of two other robustness checks. First,

measurement error or reporting biases could give rise to an excessive number of reported


large fraction of the males who received TANF benefits were young children. These patterns suggest that
individuals committing crimes are not solely the direct recipients of payments and include indirect
beneficiaries as well.
17
   In this robustness check, I do not drop New Orleans. Food Stamp payments occur during the 5th-14th
period and TANF payments occur from the 1st-5th. This payment schedule is consistent with including this
city in the Staggered Payment Sample. Removing it does not qualitatively or quantitatively change the
results in a significant way.


                                                                                                      22
incidents on the first or last day of the month. For example, if there is a delay between

when a crime occurs and when it is discovered or reported, there may be an incentive to

report the crime on the first or last day of the month so it is included in crime statistics for

that month. The results are little changed by dropping observations from the first and last

day of each month from the sample. As a second additional robustness check, New

Orleans is dropped from the sample. The New Orleans data only cover 2006 and

conflating factors related to the aftermath of hurricane Katrina could affect patterns of

crime in the city. The results indicate that removing New Orleans from the sample does

not substantively change the results.



5. Conclusion

        Analysis of patterns in crime in 12 large U.S. cities where more than 10% of the

population receive Food Stamps indicates that the timing of welfare payments affects

criminal activity. More crime takes place when more time has passed since welfare

payments occurred. The increase reflects an increase in crimes in which the perpetrator

is likely to have a financial motivation and not other types of Part I UCR or Group A

NIBRS offenses. Temporal patterns in crime are not observed in jurisdictions where

welfare payments are relatively more staggered. These findings are consistent with the

hypothesis that individuals who receive support from welfare payments consume welfare

related income quickly and then attempt to supplement it with income from criminal

activity.

        The results suggest a role for behavioral considerations in economic explanations

of crime. Existing research indicates that welfare recipients exhibit short-run impatience




                                                                                             23
and do not smooth their consumption of welfare income. My results suggest this type of

consumption behavior is associated with increased criminal activity later in monthly

welfare payment cycles.

       The results also carry implications for the design of welfare programs. Increasing

the frequency of welfare payments would smooth patterns in crime. Smooth levels of

criminal activity might make crime easier to combat because police departments would

be unlikely to be overwhelmed. If welfare beneficiaries do exhibit short-run impatience,

frequent payments would smooth their consumption and reduce the extent to which they

face dire circumstances because they consumed welfare related income too quickly. As a

result, more frequent payments would also lower crime rates. Nearly all jurisdictions

now distribute Food Stamp and TANF payments on electronic benefit transfer cards, so

the costs of more frequent payments would be likely to be low. Shaprio (2005), Wilde

and Ranney (2000), and Ohls, Fraker, Martini, and Ponza (1992) also present arguments

in favor of more frequent payments.

       Finally, the findings have implications for the deployment of police officers and

the labor laws applicable to law enforcement. In jurisdictions where welfare payments

are focused at the beginning of the month, increased levels of criminal activity at the end

of the month call for increased police protection during this time. However, 1986

amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act require that law enforcement officers be

compensated with overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. As a

consequence, it might be costly for departments to shift resources to times when they are

particularly needed. More flexible labor laws could help police departments alter

deployment schedules to prevent and combat crime.

Figure 1: This figure displays the values of the Time Since Payment Index for Providence and St. Louis for each day of
the month. The Time Since Payment Index is an index between zero and one that reflects the average number of days
that have passed since welfare recipients received their last payment. It accounts for payments related to Food Stamps,
TANF, and SSI. If a program makes payments over a range of dates, it is assumed that an equal number of recipients
receives payment on each day in the range. The total number of recipients in each program is used to weight the
payment schedules of each program.

Figure 2. This figure displays crime rates over the course of the month. Panel A displays rates for all crimes that are classified as Type I crimes
in the UCR reporting system and Group A crimes in the NIBRS reporting system. Panel B display rates for crimes in which the perpetrator is
likely to have a direct financial motivation, specifically burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and robbery. Panel C displays rates for other
crimes, specifically arson, assault offenses, forcible sex offenses, and homicide. The data points displayed are calculated by taking average crime
rates across three day periods for cities in which Food Stamp payments are focused at the beginning of the month and cities in which these
payments are more staggered. Crime rates for each city on each day are computed by taking incident counts and dividing by the sample period
average number of daily reported incidents in the city.

The crime data include reported incidents of all crimes that are classified as Type I crimes in the UCR reporting system and Group
A crimes in the NIBRS reporting system. Financially motivated crimes include reported incidents of crimes in which the
perpetrator is likely to have a direct financial motivation, specifically burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and robbery.
Other crimes include arson, assault offenses, forcible sex offenses, and homicide. Crime rates for each city on each day are
computed by taking incident counts and dividing by the sample period average number of daily reported incidents in the city.
Dummy for 1st-10th is a dummy that is equal to one in the first ten days of the month and zero otherwise. Time Since Payment
Index is an index between zero and one that reflects the average number of days that have passed since welfare recipients received
their last payment. Average temperature is the average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Precipitation and snowfall are measured
in inches. The Holiday Dummy is equal to one on U.S. federal holidays and zero otherwise.

                                  The Effects of the Timing of Welfare Payments on Crime--Financially Motivated Crimes
The dependent variable in columns 1-4 is the crime rate, and for columns 5-8 it is a count of the total reported incidents of crime. The crime data include reported incidents of crimes in which
the perpetrator is likely to have a direct financial motivation, specifically burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and robbery. Crime rates for each city on each day are computed by taking
incident counts and dividing by the sample period average number of daily reported incidents in the city. The specifications presented in columns 1-4 are OLS specifications, and those in
columns 5-8 are negative binomial specifications. Each specification includes fixed effects for each city/month/year combination and each city/day of the week pair, and the specifications in
columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 also include fixed effects for each day of the month. Dummy for 1st-10th is a dummy that is equal to one in the first ten days of the month and zero otherwise.
Staggered Payment Dummy is equal to one for cities where Food Stamp payments are not exclusively made during the first ten days of the month. Time Since Payment Index is an index
between zero and one that reflects the average number of days since welfare recipients received their last payment. Average temperature is the average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
Precipitation and snowfall are measured in inches. The Holiday Dummy is equal to one on U.S. federal holidays and zero otherwise. Heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors that allow for
clustering within each city-month appear in parentheses.

                                             The Effects of the Timing of Welfare Payments on Crime--Other Crimes
The dependent variable in columns 1-4 is the crime rate, and for columns 5-8 it is a count of the total reported incidents of crime. The crime data include reported incidents of arson, assault
offenses, forcible sex offenses, and homicide. Crime rates for each city on each day are computed by taking incident counts and dividing by the sample period average number of daily
reported incidents in the city. The specifications presented in columns 1-4 are OLS specifications, and those in columns 5-8 are negative binomial specifications. Each specification includes
fixed effects for each city/month/year combination and each city/day of the week pair, and the specifications in columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 also include fixed effects for each day of the month.
Dummy for 1st-10th is a dummy that is equal to one in the first ten days of the month and zero otherwise. Staggered Payment Dummy is equal to one for cities where Food Stamp payments
are not exclusively made during the first ten days of the month. Time Since Payment Index is an index between zero and one that reflects the average number of days that have passed since
welfare recipients received their last payment. Average temperature is the average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Precipitation and snowfall are measured in inches. The Holiday Dummy
is equal to one on U.S. federal holidays and zero otherwise. Heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors that allow for clustering within each city-month appear in parentheses.

                                  The Effects of the Timing of Welfare Payments by Type of Financially Motivated Crime
The dependent variable is the country of reported incidents of burglary in columns 1 and 2, larceny in columns 3 and 4, motor vehicle theft in columns 5 and 6, and robbery in columns 7 and 8.
The specifications are negative binomial specifications, and each specification includes fixed effects for each city/month/year combination, each city/day of the week pair, and each day of the
month. Time Since Payment Index is an index between zero and one that reflects the average number of days since welfare recipients received their last payment. Average temperature is the
average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Precipitation and snowfall are measured in inches. The Holiday Dummy is equal to one on U.S. federal holidays and zero otherwise. Heteroskedasticity
consistent standard errors that allow for clustering within each city-month appear in parentheses.

                                           The Effects of the Timing of Welfare Payments on Crime: Alternative Sample
The dependent variable in columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 is the crime rate and the specifications in these columns are OLS specifications. The dependent variable in columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 is a count of the
total reported incidents of crime, and the specifications in these columns are negative binomial specifications. Columns 1-4 consider crimes in which the perpetrator is likely to have a financial
motivation, and columns 5-8 consider other crimes. Crime rates for each city on each day are computed by taking incident counts and dividing by the sample period average number of daily
reported incidents in the city. Each specification includes fixed effects for each city/day of the week pair and each city/month/year combination. Dummy for 1st-10th is a dummy that is equal to one
in the first ten days of the month and zero otherwise. Staggered Payment Dummy is equal to one for cities where Food Stamp payments are not exclusively made during the first ten days of the
month. Average temperature is the average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Precipitation and snowfall are measured in inches. The Holiday Dummy is equal to one on U.S. federal holidays and
zero otherwise. Heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors that allow for clustering within each city-month appear in parentheses.

                                    The Effects of the Timing of Welfare Payments on Crime: Additional Robustness Checks
The dependent variable in columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 is the incident count for crimes in which the perpetrator is likely to have a financial motivation. For columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 it is the count for other
crimes. The specifications are negative binomial specifications. The first four specifications remove the first and last day of each month from the sample, and the last four specifications remove
New Orleans observations. Each specification includes fixed effects for each city/month/year combination and each city/day of the week pair, and the specifications in columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 also
include fixed effects for each day of the month. Dummy for 1st-10th is equal to one in the first ten days of the month and zero otherwise. Staggered Payment Dummy is equal to one for cities
where Food Stamp payments are not exclusively made during the first ten days of the month. Time Since Payment Index is an index between zero and one that reflects the average number of days
that have passed since welfare recipients received their last payment. Average temperature is the average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Precipitation and snowfall are measured in inches. The
Holiday dummy is equal to one on U.S. federal holidays and zero otherwise. Heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors that allow for clustering within each city-month appear in parentheses.
