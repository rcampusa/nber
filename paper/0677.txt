                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper provides quantitative estimates of the output, price,
interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among a number of countries.
The econometric model that is used for this purpose is described in
Fair (1981), and the present paper is an extension of this work. The
linkages are examined by changing various policy variables and observ-
ing the resulting change in the endogenous variables.

     The model is also used to estimate what is called the "exchange
rate effect" on inflation. One of the ways in which monetary and
fiscal policies may affect a country's inflation rate is by first in-
fluencing its exchange rate, which in turn influences import prices,
which in turn influences domestic prices. The model allows this
exchange rate effect on inflation to be estimated.

     The results in the paper give a good indication of the properties
of the model. The linkages among countries are complicated and there
are few unambiguous effects with respect to sign. This is true not just
in principle but also in fact. Depreciation, for example, increases GNP
for Japan, but decreases it for Germany and the U.K. A spending in-
crease leads to a depreciation in Japan, but to an appreciation in Germany
and the U.K. A spending increase in the U.S. has noticeably different
effects on different countries. The results also show the importance of
price, interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among countries as well
as the usual trade linkages.

I. Introduction

     This paper provides quantitative estimates of the output, price,

interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among a number of countries.

The econometric model that is used for this purpose is described in Fair

(1981), and the present paper is an extension of this work. The linkages

are examined by changing various policy variables in the model and ob-

serving the resulting changes in the endogenous variables. The results

of ten experiments are reported:

          1. An increase in U.S. government spending,

          2. Mi increase in the U.S. interest rate,

          3. An increase in German government spending,

          4, An increase in the German interest rate,

          5. A depreciation of the German exchange rate,

          6. An increase in U.K. government spending,

          7. A depreciation of the U.K. exchange rate,

          8. An increase in Japanese government spending,

          9. A depreciation of the Japanese exchange rate,

         10. An increase in the price of exports of the oil exporting

              countries.

    The model is also used to estimate what will be called the "exchange

rate effect" on inflation. One of the ways in which monetary and fiscal

policies may affect a country's inflation rate is by first influencing

its exchange rate, which in turn influences import prices, which in turn

influences domestic prices. This is what is called the exchange rate

effect on inflation. In order to estimate the size of this effect one

needs a model linking monetary and fiscal policies to exchange rates,

exchange rates to import prices, and import prices to domestic prices,

and the present dei provides these links.

     A complete list of the equations in the model, including all the

estimated equations, is presented in Fair (1981). The model is reviewed

in Sections II and III of the present paper. If the earlier paper has

been read, these two sections can be skipped. This paper is concerned

only with the flexible exchange rate period, although there is also a

version of the model that pertains to the fixed exchange rate period.

The testing of the model is discussed in the earlier paper, and no men-

tion of this is made here. It perhaps goes without saying that the results

in this paper should be interpreted with caution. It is hoped that they

provide some insights into the qualitative and quantitative linkages among

countries, but further tests of themodel are needed before the results

can be considered anything other than preliminary. The results are based

solely on estimated equations and definitions: no adjustments to any

of the estimated equations have been made.

     All exchange rates are in units of local currency per U.S. dollar.

This means that an increase in a country's exchange rate is a deprecia-

tion. When the phrase "depreciation of the exchange rate" is used in

this paper, this refers to an increase in the exchange rate (and vice

versa for appreciation). "Dollar" always refers to the U.S. dollar.

 II. A Review of the Model

      The model is quarterly and contains estimated equations for 44 coun-

 tries. Most of the equations have been estimated by two stage least

squares. The basic estimation period is 19581—19801 (89 observations).

For equations that are relevant only when exchange rates are flexible,

the basic estimation period is 197211—19801 (32 observations). The trade

matrix contains data for 64 countries. The list of countries is presented

in Table A—i in the Appendix. The U.S. part of the model is the model

described in Fair (1976, 1980).

     The model differs from previous models in a number of ways.

(1) Linkages among countries with respect to exchange rates, interest

rates, and prices appear to be more important in the model than they are

in previous models.   (2) There is no natural distinction in the model

between stock—market and flow—market determination of the exchange rate,

a distinction that is important in recent discussions of the monetary

approach to the balance of payments.1 (3) The number of countries is

larger than usual, and the data are all quarterly. Considerable work

has gone into the construction of quarterly data bases for all the coun-

tries. (4) I alone have estimated small models for each country and then

linked them together, rather than, as Project LINK2   has   done, take models

developed by others and link them together. The advantage of the LINK

approach is that larger models for each country can be used. The advan-

tage of the present approach is that the person constructing the individual

models knows from the beginning that they are to be linked together, and



1See, for example, Frenkel and Johnson (1976), Dornbusch (1976), Frenkel
and Rodriguez (1975), and Kouri (1976).

2See Ball (1973) and Hickman (1974).
                                                                        4



this may lead to better specification of the linkages. It is unlikely,

for example, that the specification of the exchange rate and interest

rate linkages in the present model would develop from the LINK approach.

Whether this possible gain in the linkage specification outweighs the

loss of having to deal with small models of each country is an open

question.

     The basic theoretical model that has guided the empirical work is

discussed in Fair (1974). Individual agents in this model derive their

decisions from the solutions of multiperiod maximization problems. These

problems require that agents form expectations of the future values of

a number of variables. Even though the model is deterministic, agents

make expectations errors. They do not know the complete model and must

form their expectations on the basis of a limited set of information

(usually only the past history of a few variables). These expectations

errors lead at times to "disequilibrium" in the labor, goods, and finan-

cial markets, and much of the modeling is concerned with the effects of

disequilibrium. Another important feature of the modeling is making sure

that all flows of funds among the agents are accounted for. A two—country

version of this model is presented in Fair (1979). The idea for this

version came from considering how one would link the single—country model

to a model just like it. Stock and flow effects are completely integrated

in this model because of the accounting for all flows of funds. This is

the reason there is no natural distinction between stock—market and f low—

market determination of the exchange rate.

     There are a number of versions of the two—country model. The version

that was used as a basis for the empirical work is the one in which the

bonds of the two countries are perfect substitutes, the short term interest
                                                                                    5




rates of the countries and the exchange rate are determined by reaction

functions, and the forward exchange rate is "passive." Whether this

choice, which was partly dictated by data availability, provides an ade-

quate basis for constructing an empirical model is an open question.

No direct tests of the assumptions behind this choice have been attempted.

The choice has been indirectly tested by examining how well the model

explains the historical data.

      Let R denote country l's interest rate, r country 2's interest

rate, e the exchange rate (the price of country 2's currency in terms

of country l's currency), and F the forward rate. The covered interest

rate from country l's perspective on the bond of country 2, say r'

is (e/F)(l+r) .         If    for R =   r'   people are indifferent as to which bond

they hold, then the bonds are defined to be perfect substitutes. In this

case arbitrage will insure that R              r' ,   and so one of the equations

in the model is:


(1)        R =   (e/F)(l+r)

Write the reaction functions as:


           R =
(2)
                 f2(...)
(3)        r =
                 f3(.   .   .) ,
(4)        e =
                 f4(...)

where the arguments in the functions are variables that affect the monetary

authorities' decisions regarding the interest rates and the exchange rate.

      The assumption that is most questionable in the choice of this version

is probably the assumption that e is determined by a reaction function.
                                                                              6




The alternative assumption is that e is implicitly determined in the

model, with reserves taken to be exogenous. In practice there is ob-

viously some intervention of the monetary authorities in the exchange

markets, and so this alternative assumption is also questionable. The

assumption that e is determined by a reaction function may not be, how-

ever, as restrictive as it first sounds. The monetary authorities are

likely to be aware of the market forces that are operating on e in the

absence of intervention, and they may take these into account in setting

their target each period. If some of the explanatory variables in the

reaction function are in part measures of these forces, then the estimated

reaction function may provide a better explanation of e than one would

otherwise have thought. Similar arguments apply to the assumption that

R and r are determined by reaction functions.

     The assumption that F is passive means that it is determined by

equation (1): given R ,    r   ,   and   e ,   F   merely adjusts to insure

that the arbitrage condition holds. In this case the forward market im-

poses no "discipline" on the monetary authorities' choice of the exchange

rate. Again, however, if the monetary authorities take into account

market forces in the forward market operating on e and        if   the explana-

tory variables in the reaction function for e are in part measures of

these forces, then the estimated reaction function for e may not be too

bad an approximation. Given the assumption that F is passive and given

that F does not appear as an explanatory variable in any of the equa-

tions, F plays no role in the empirical model. For each country it

is determined by an estimated version of the arbitrage condition, but

the predictions from these equations have no effect on the predictions

of any of the other variables in the model.
                                                                                  7




       The U.S. model is much larger than the models for the other countries.

The two key exogenous foreign sector variables are the import price de-

flator and the real value of exports. When the U.S. model is embedded

in the overall model, these two variables become endogenous. Since the

U.S. model is discussed in detail elsewhere, it will not be discussed

here. All      references   t.o the econometric work in this section pertain

only to the non U.S. part of the model.

       There are up to 11 estimated equations per country in the econometric

model. These equations and their explanatory variables are as follows.

mates.

       Index                rate (+).


       All   expenditure variables are in real terms (1975 local currency).

Many of the variables are on a per capita basis. A "b" after an equation

number denotes that the equation was estimated only over observations

in the flexible exchange rate period. Unless otherwise noted, "lagged"

means lagged one quarter. Explanatory variables were dropped from the

equations if they had coefficient estimates of the wrong expected sign.

Both current and one—quarter lagged values were generally tried for the

explanatory price and interest rate variables, and the values that gave

the best results were used. Similarly, both the short—term and long—term

interest rate variables were tried, and the variable that gave the best

results was used. Data limitations prevented all the equations from being

estimated for all countries and also required that shorter sample periods

from the basic period be used for many countries.

       Lagged dependent variables were used extensively to try to account

for expectational and lagged adjustment effects. This procedure is con-

sistent with the treatment of expectations in the theoretical model, where

expectations are assumed to be formed on the basis of a limited set of

information. All      the   equations except lOb and 11 were estimated with
                                                                        9



a constant and three seasonal dummy variables. A time trend was also

included in a number of the equations. In most cases the functional form

chosen was the log form. The demand pressure variable is a nonlinear

function of GNP.

     The specification of the equations is generally consistent with the

theoretical model. An exception to this is the specification of the con-

sumption function, where income (GNP) is used as an explanatory variable.

If a household is choosing consumption and labor supply to maximize utility,

then income is not the appropriate variable to use. This procedure can

be justified if households are always constrained in their labor supply

decision, and this is what must be assumed here. Also, the investment

equation is missing a variable that plays an important role in the theo-

retical model and in the U.S. model, namely, the amount of "excess" capital

on hand. The transition from the theoretical model to the U.S. model is

discussed in Fair (1976), and this Is a useful reference for the current

transition as well.

     Equation 7b is the interest rate reaction function, and equation

9b is the exchange rate reaction function. Although not noted above,

the U.S. and German short term interest rates are explanatory variables

in a few of the interest rate reaction functions. Also, the German ex-

change rate is an explanatory variable in the exchange rate reaction

functions of the other European countries.

     There are 9 definitions per country. The four most important are:

(1) Final sales equals consumption plus investment plus government spend-

ing plus exports minus imports, (2) inventory investment equals GNP minus

final sales, (3) the balance of payments equals the price of exports times

exports minus the price of imports times imports plus net transfer pay—
                                                                     10



ments, and (4) net foreign assets equals net foreign assets of the pre-

vious period plus the balance of payments (i.e., the change in net

foreign assets equals the balance of payments).



III. Some Ceteris Paribus Effects in the Model

     It is possible to get some idea of the properties of the model without

performing simulation experiments. In what follows a variable is said

to have a "direct" effect on another variable if it appears on the right

hand side of the equation (either a stochastic equation or a definition)

explaining the other variable. Most endogenous variables have at least

an indirect effect on the other endogenous variables——either contempor-

aneously or with a lag of one quarter. Because of this, it is difficult

to explain the properties of the model in a very systematic way. The

following discussion is designed to try to give a general idea of the

properties without going into every possible indirect effect. It should

also be kept in mind that not all of the effects operate for all countries.

All interest rates referred to are short term rates unless otherwise noted.

Trade Effects Among Countries

     There is a standard trade multiplier effect in the model. An auton-

omous increase in GNP in country i increases the demand for imports,

which increases the exports of other countries and thus their GNP and

demand for imports, which then increases the exports of country i and

thus its GNP. In short, exports affect imports and vice versa.

Price Effects Among Countries

     There is also a price multiplier effect in the model. An autonomous

increase in country i's domestic price level increases its export prices,

which increases the import prices of other countries, which increases
                                                                        11




their domestic prices, including their export prices, which then increases

country i's import prices and thus its domestic and export prices.

In short, export prices affect import prices and vice versa.

Direct Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Effects Among Countries

     As noted above, the U.S. and German short term interest rates appear

as explanatory variables in the interest rate reaction functions of a

few countries. The U.S. and German interest rates thus directly affect

these other countries' rates. The German exchange rate appears as an

explanatory variable in the exchange rate reaction functions of the other

European countries, and so it directly affects the other rates.

Direct Effects Within a Country

     The short term interest rate directly affects the long term rate

in the term structure equation (equation 8). The short term or long term

rate has a direct negative effect on imports and consumption (equations

1 and 2) and a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator (equation 5).

The short term rate has a direct negative effect on the demand for money

and the exchange rate (equations 6 and 9b).   (Remember that an increase

in the exchange rate is a depreciation of the country's currency.)

     The asset variable, which is the sum of past values of the balance

of payments and is a measure of the net asset position of the country

vis—a—vis the rest of the world, has a direct positive effect on imports

and consumption (equations 1 and 2) and a direct negative effect on the

short term interest rate and the exchange rate (equations 7b and 9b).

     The exchange rate has a direct positive effect on the local currency

price of exports (equation 11) and on the local currency price of imports

(the equations involved in linking export and import prices). It also

has a direct negative effect on the dollar price of exports (because the
                                                                    12




coefficient estimate of the exchange rate in equation 11, which is in

log form, is less than one). It has a direct positive effect on the short

term interest rate for three countries (equation 7b).

     The price of imports has a direct negative effect on imports (equa-

tion 1), a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator (equation 5), a

direct negative effect on the asset variable (the balance of payments

definition), and a direct positive effect on the short term interest rate

for four countries (equation 7b). The price of exports has a direct posi-

tive effect on the asset variable (balance of payments definition). The

GNP deflator has direct positive effects on imports, the demand for money,

the short term and long term interest rates, the exchange rate, and the

price of exports (equations 1, 6, 7b, 8, 9b, and 11).

     The level of imports has a direct negative effect on final sales

and the asset variable, and the level of exports has a direct positive

effect on these two variables (the final sales definition and the balance

of payments definition). The level of final sales has a direct positive

effect on GNP (equation 4). Any deviation of GNP from final sales in

a period is absorbed by a change in inventories (inventory definition).

The stock of inventories has a direct negative effect on GNP (equation 4).

     GNP or the demand pressure variable has a direct positive effect

on imports, consumption, investment, the CNP deflator, the demand for

money, the short term interest rate, and the exchange rate.

Some Indirect Effects Within a Coun

     It should be clear that there are very few unambiguous indirect effects

in the model with respect to sign. The signs depend on the relative sizes

of the coefficient estimates. It is useful, however, to consider the

likely signs of some indirect effects, even though these signs are not

necessarily logical consequences of the model.
                                                                          13




        Consider first the indirect effect of the exchange rate on GNP.

The main direct effect of the exchange rate is on the price of imports,

at least in the short run. The price of imports has a direct negative

effect on imports, and the level of imports has a direct positive effect

on GNP. In other words, an increase in the price of imports causes sub--

stitution from imports to domestically produced goods, which raises GNP.

The exchange rate thus has an indirect positive effect on GNP through

this channel (i.e., depreciation increases GNP).

        Depreciation also lowers the dollar price of exports, which lowers

the import price indices of countries that import from the given country,

which in turn increases the demand for the given country's exports.

Therefore, depreciation also increases GNP through this channel.

        Depreciation is likely to have a negative indirect effect on GNP

through a third channel. The likely initial effect of a depreciation

on the balance of payments is negative. Depreciation raises the local

currency price of imports more than it does the local currency price of

exports, which, other things being equal, has a negative effect on the

balance of payments. Depreciation also lowers imports and raises exports,

which has a positive effect on the balance of payments. This latter effect

is, however, likely to be smaller initially than the price effect, and

so the initial net effect is likely to be negative. (This is, of course,

the "   J   curve" effect.) A decrease in the balance of payments decreases

net foreign assets, which directly decreases imports and consumption and

directly increases the short term interest rate. Although the decrease

in imports raises GNP, the decrease in consumption and the increase in

the interest rate lower GNP, and the net effect is likely to be negative.

Depreciation is thus likely to have an initial indirect negative effect
                                                                        14



on GNP through this "assetT' effect channel.

       Depreciation has two main indirect effects on the GNP deflator, one

positive and one ambiguous. The positive effect is through the price of

imports, which has a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator. The

second effect is through GNP. If the net effect of depreciation on GNP

is positive, this will have a positive effect on the GNP deflator through

the direct positive effect of the demand pressure variable on the GNP

deflator. If the net effect of depreciation on GNP is negative, the in-

direct effect on the GNP deflator is negative.

       There are three main effects of the short term interest rate on GNP,

one negative, one ambiguous, and one positive. The negative effect is

through consumption. An increase in the short term rate increases the

long term rate. An increase in the short term rate or the long term rate

decreases consumption, which lowers GNP. The ambiguous effect is through

the exchange rate. An increase in the short term rate has a negative

effect on the exchange rate (an appreciation), which has an ambiguous

effect on GNP. The positive effect is through imports. An increase in

the short term or long term rate lowers imports, which, other things being

equal, raises GNP. The consumption effect is likely to be the dominant

one, and so the net effect of the short term rate on GNP is likely to

be negative.

       An increase in the short term interest rate has three main effects

on the GNP deflator, one positive and two negative. The positive effect

is a direct one: the short term or long term rate appears as an explana-

tory variable in the price equation (equation 5). The first negative

effect is the likely negative indirect effect of the short term rate on

GNP   and   thus on the demand pressure variable. The other negative effect
                                                                          15




 is the effect on the exchange rate: the exchange rate appreciates, which

 lowers the price of imports, which lowers the GNP deflator.



 IV. The Results of the Experiments

      The results of the experiments are presented in Tables 1 through

10. The experiments were performed as follows. The estimated residuals

were first added to the stochastic equations and treated as exogenous.

This means that when the model is simulated using the actual values of

the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained. Each

experiment corresponds to changing one or more exogenous variables and

running a dynamic simulation. The effect of this change on an endogenous

variable is the difference between the predicted value of the variable

from this simulation and the actual value. All experiments were for the
                        3
19761—1977IV period.

      All   of   the 44 countries for which there are estimated equations were

used for the experiments. The results for 15 countries and 13 variables

per country are presented in the tables for the two—quarter—ahead and

six—quarter—ahead predictions. Except for the numbers for the balance

of payments, each number in the tables is the percentage change in the

variable (in percentage points) divided by something. For the spending

increases (Tables 1, 3, 6, and 9) the divisor is the change in government

spending as a percentage of GNP (in percentage points).4 Each number

3The model was solved using the Fair—Parke (1981) program. The approxi-
mate time on the IBM 379—158 at Yale for one eight—quarter simulation
was 3.5 minutes.

4Each number in these tables is thus      {Gi._y.)/y.]/[G./Y,] , where
      is the two— or six—quarter—ahead predicted value of     y. after the
change. L\G.       is
                   the change in government spending in quarter t ,      and
 it
Y.    is the actual value of GNP in quarter t
                                                                       16



in these tables is thus the percentage change in the variable induced by

a one percent autonomous increase in GNP of the country in which the policy

change was made. For the interest rate increases (Tables 2 and 4) the

divisor is the change in the interest rate (in percentage points). The

actual change in the interest rates for the experiments was 2.0 percentage

points, and so the divisor was 2.0. Each number in these tables is thus

the percentage change in the variable induced by a 1.0 percentage point

increase in the interest rate. For the exchange rate increases (Tables

5, 7, and 9) the percentage change in the exchange rates was 10.0 percent

and   the   divisor was 1.0. Each number in these tables is thus the percentage

change in the variable induced by a 10.0 percent increase in the exchange

rate. Finally, for the increase in the export prices (Table 10) the per-

centage change in the prices was 50.0 percent and the divisor was 1.0.

Each number in this table is thus the percentage change in the variable

induced by a 50.0 percent increase in the export prices.

      The numbers for the balance of payments are not in percentage terms

and have not been divided by anything. They are merely the actual changes

in the balance of payments corresponding to whatever policy change was

made. The balance of payments variables are in units of nominal local

currency, and so it is not readily apparent from the tables how one country's

balance of payments changed relative to another's. For the most part it

is unnecessary to know this to understand the rest of the results. When

it is necessary, the relative change will be mentioned in the text. The

main interest in the balance of payments results for a country is the

sign of the changes.

      The following discussion of the results is somewhat loose. Reference

is sometimes made to a change in one endogenous variable "leading to"
                                                                        17



 or "resulting in" a change in another endogenous variable. This is not,

 strictly speaking, correct because the model is simultaneous, but it does

help give a general idea of the model's properties. Not all results in

 the tables are explained, and not every possible indirect effect is noted.

 Emphasis is placed on the main results and effects and, as the discussion

progresses, on the results in a table that are different from the results

in previous tables. In what follows "GNP" and "income" are used inter-

changeably, interest rates are always short term interest rates unless

otherwise noted, and import and export prices are local currency prices

unless otherwise noted.


U.S. Spending Increase (Table

     The results of an increase in U.S. government spending on U.S. goods

are presented in Table 1. The increase in spending increased U.S. income,

which in turn increased U.S. imports. This increased other countries'

exports, which in turn increased their income and imports. This is the

trade multiplier effect. The increase in U.S. income and prices led to

an increase in U.S. interest rate through the U.S. interest rate reaction

function. This offset some of the increase in U.S. income that would

otherwise have occurred. It also led to an increase in some of the other

countries' interest rates, which in turn offset some of the increase in

their income that would otherwise have occurred from the pure trade mul-

tiplier effect.

     There are four main effects of the U.S. spending increase on the

exchange rates, three negative and one positive. The spending increase

raised U.S. output and prices relative to those of the other countries,


 This experiment is also discussed in Fair (1981), and the present
discussion can be skipped if the earlier paper has been read.

both of which have a negative effect on other countries' exchange rates

 (an appreciation). The U.S. balance of payments fell relative to those

of the other countries (the balance of payments of other countries gen-

erally rose), and this also has a negative effect on exchange rates.

The positive effect is the interest rate effect. The U.S. short term

interest rate rose relative to other countries' rates, and this has a

positive effect on exchange rates (a depreciation). As can be seen in

Table 1, the net effect can go either way. For some countries, such as

Germany, there is a depreciation after two quarters (the interest rate

effect dominating) and then an appreciation after six quarters.

     The changes in import prices are negative for countries whose exchange

rate appreciated. For most of these countries the fall in import prices

led to a fall in the GNP deflator. In other words, the U.S. expansion

generally led to a fall in inflation rates in those countries whose ex-

change rates appreciated. This exchange rate effect on inflation (through

import prices) tends to dominate the pure price multiplier effect that

would exist if exchange rates were fixed.

     The balance of payments fell for some countries. If a country's

exchange rate depreciates in response to the U.S. expansion (the interest

rate effect dominating), then, as noted above, the initial effect on the

balance of payments is likely 'to be negative (the J curve effect).

     The results at the bottom of Table 1 are for the U.S. model alone.

In this case the rest of the world is exogenous. The results show that

the properties of the U.S. model are not very sensitive to the treatment

of the rest of the world. The increase in the GNP deflator is somewhat

less in this case, which is due to the fact that U.S. import prices did

not rise. In the complete model U.S. import prices rose because of the

general depreciation of the U.S. dollar.

U.S. Interest Rate Increase (Table 2)

     For this experiment the U.S. interest rate reaction function is dropped

and the U.S. interest rate is taken to be exogenous. The results of an

increase in the U.S. interest rate are presented in Table 2. This increase

lowered U.S. income and imports and led to a general contraction in world

income and exports (trade multiplier effect).

     The interest rate increase also led to a depreciation of the other

countries' exchange rates. The depreciation of the German exchange rate

after six quarters, for example, was 4.5 percent. This depreciation was

also due in part to the increase in the U.S. balance of payments relative

to those of other countries. This depreciation led to an increase in other

countries' import prices and then to the GNP deflators. The U.S. interest

rate increase thus led to a general increase in other countries' infla-

tion rates through the depreciation of their exchange rates. The U.S.

inflation rate was little changed: the positive direct effect of interest

rates on inflation was offset by the negative effects on inflation from

the fall in U.S. import prices (due to the appreciation of the dollar)

and the fall in U.S. income.

     The balance of payments of some countries (other than the U.S.) in-

creased. In these cases the change in export revenue (exports price

times exports) was greater than the change in import costs (import price

times imports). In all cases export prices rose and exports fell, and

in almost all cases import prices rose and imports fell.

     The results at the bottom of Table 2 for the U.S. alone again show

that the properties of the U.S. model are not very sensitive to the treat-

ment of the rest of the world. The increase in the GNP deflator is greater

in this case because import prices did not fall.

German Spending Increase (Table 3)

     This experiment is an increase in German government spending on German

goods. As in the U.S. case, it led to a worldwide increase in exports

and income. The increase in income led to a fairly large increase in the

GNP deflator after six quarters (1.96 percent). This increase and the

increase in income led to a large increase in the interest rate through

the reaction function (3.17 percentage points after six quarters). The

negative interest rate effect on the exchange was larger than the positive

price and balance of payments effects in that the German exchange rate

appreciated. The German exchange rate has a positive effect on the ex-

change rates of the other European countries, and this resulted in an

appreciation of the other European rates. For a few countries, such as

Italy, the appreciation resulted in a fall in the GNP deflator (through

the fall in import prices).


German Interest Rate Increase (Table 4)

     For this experiment the German interest rate reaction function was

dropped and the German interest rate was taken to be exogenous. The re—

suits of an increase in the German rate are presented in Table 4. This

increase lowered German income and imports and led to a general contrac-

tion in world exports and income.

     The relative increase in the German interest rate and balance of

payments led to an appreciation of the mark, which led to an appreciation

of the other Eueopean currencies. The price deflator of Germany and of

most of the other European countries was lower because of the appreciation

and of the fall in income.

German Exchange Rate Increase (Table 5)

     For this experiment the German exchange rate reaction function was

dropped and the German exchange rate was taken to be exogenous. The re—

suits in Table 5 are for an increase in the exchange rate of ten percent

(a depreciation).

     It was argued above that the initial effect of a depreciation on

the balance of payments is likely to be negative, and this is the case

in Table 5, even after six quarters. The depreciation also led to a de-

crease in GNP. As noted above, the effect of a depreciation on GNP can

go either way. In this case the negative effect from the fall in the

balance of paynients (the asset effect) and the negative effect from the

rise in the interest rate dominated. (The rise in the interest rate was due in

part to the increase in the rate of inflation that resulted from the depreciation.)

     The depreciation of the German exchange rate led to a decrease in

the U.S. GNP deflator and an increase in U.S. GNP. The decrease in the

deflator was due to the fall in the U.S. price of imports, which was due

to the general appreciation of the dollar. The increase in GNP was due

in part to the increase in assets from the increase in the balance of

payments and in part to the fall in the interest rate from the fall in

the rate of inflation.


U.K. Spending Increase (Table6)

     This experiment is an increase in U.K. government spending on U.K.

goods. In the German case in Table 3 the increase in spending led to an

appreciation of the mark because of the large relative increase in the

German interest rate. In the U.K. case in Table 6 the increase in spending

led to a depreciation of the pound. The U.K. interest rate did rise in

response to the U.K. expansion, but the negative interest rate effect on

the exchange rate was dominated by the positive price and balance of pay-

ments effects.

     The other European exchange rates appreciated relative to the dollar,

although only slightly. This is due primarily to the balance of payments

effect on the exchange rate. The European countries benefited more from

the U.K. expansion than did the U.S. with respect to the increase in ex-

ports, and so their balance of payments improved more.


U.K. Exchange Rate Increase (Table 7)

     For this experiment the U.K. exchange rate reaction function was

dropped and the U.K. exchange rate was taken to be exogenous. The results

in Table 7 are for an increase in the exchange rate of ten percent (a de-

preciation).

     As in the German case, the depreciation led to a fall in GNP. Un-

like in the German case, the effects on the other European exchange rates

were slight. The depreciation led, as in the German case, to a decrease

in the U.S. GNP deflator and an increase in U.S. GNP, although the effects

in the U.K. case were smaller.


Japanese Spending Increase (Table 8)

     This experiment is an increase in Japanese government spending on

Japanese goods. The interesting result in this case is that the increase

had only a small effect on the rest of the world. The increase in Japanese

imports was fairly small, and so there was a small trade multiplier effect.

The increase in imports was small in part because of the increase in the

price of Japanese imports relative to the GNP deflator. This led to a

substitution away from imported goods. The increase in the price of im-

ports was due to the depreciation of the yen. Unlike in the German and

U.K. cases, the exchange rate depreciated in response to the expansion:

in this case the positive balance of payments effect dominated.


Japanese Exchange Rate Increase (Table 9)

     For this experiment the Japanese exchange rate reaction function

was dropped and the Japanese exchange rate was taken to be exogenous.

The results in Table 9 are for an increase in the exchange rate of ten

percent (a depreciation).

     In this case, unlike in the German and U.K. cases, the depreciation

led to an increase in GNP. The dominant effect on GNP in the Japanese

case was the substitution away from imported goods due to the increase

in the price of imports relative to the GNP deflator. Japan is the only

main country in the model for which the import price index is not an ex-

planatory variable in the equation for the GNP deflator (equation 5).

No effects of import prices on domestic prices could be found in the

Japanese case. ii Increase in the price of imports in Japan thus corres-

ponds to a larger increase in the relative price of imports than is the

case in other countries. This is the main reason for the larger Japanese

substitution response.

     The effect on the Japanese balance of payments was initially negative,

as expected, but by six quarters the effect was positive. This is also

due primarily to the Japanese substitution away from imported goods.

     The depreciation led, as In the German and U.K. cases, to a decrease

in the U.S. GNP deflator and an increase in U.S. GNP, although the effects

on GNP were very small.

 Increase in the Price of Exports of the Oil Exporting Countries

 (Table 10)

      The oil exporting countries in the model are Algeria, Indonesia,

 Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,

 and Venezuela. The price of exports is exogenous for these countries.

 The experiment corresponded to a 50 percent increase in the price of ex-

 ports of all these countries.

      Different countries were affected quite differently in this experi-

ment. The exchange rates of all countries except Japan appreciated relative

to the dollar, This is due in large part to the generally larger decrease

in the U.S. balance of payments relative to the decreases for the other

countries. The price of imports rose for most countries, as expected,

although part of the increase that would otherwise have occurred was offset

by the appreciation of the exchange rates. The increase in import prices

led to an increase in the GNP deflators, and so there was a general world-

wide increase in inflation,

     GNP fell for many countries. This was due in part to the increase

in the interest rate in many countries (because of the increase in infla-

tion and the decrease in the balance of payments) and in part to the decrease

in net foreign assets (because of the decrease in the balance of payments).

There was, in other words, both a negative interest rate effect and a

negative asset effect on CNP. Imports fell for all countries because of

the increase in the price of imports relative to the GNP deflator. For

some countries this substitution effect was large enough to lead to an

increase in GNP.

     Although not shown in the table, the balance of payments of the oil

exporting countries rose substantially, as expected. This increase in

net foreign assets then led to an increase in imports of the countries

for which there are import equations (Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia,

and Venezuela). In some cases these increases were quite large. The

six—quarter—ahead increases for Iran, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia, for ex-

ample, were 28.6, 27.6 and 56.9 percent, respectively. These increases

were not, of course, large enough to offset completely the increases in

the balance of payments of these countries (and thus the decreases in the

balance of payments of the oil importing countries).



V. Estimates of the Exchange Rate Effect on Inflation (Table 11)

     Exchange rates have an effect on domestic inflation in the model through

their effects on import prices. The 10.0 percent depreciation of the mark

in Table 5 resulted in an increase in the German GNP deflator of 0.95 per-

cent after six quarters. For the U.K. results in Table 5 the increase

was 2.02 percent. In the case of Japan, as noted above, the price of

imports does not directly affect the GNP deflator, and so for the Japanese

results in Table 7 there was little change in the GNP deflator.

     The question considered in this section is how much of the change

in inflation that results from a monetary or fiscal policy change can be

attributed to the change in the exchange rate that results from the policy

change. Estimates of this exchange rate effect on inflation are presented

in Table 11. The results in the a rows are from the experiments discussed

in the previous section. The results for all eight quarters of the pre-

diction period are presented in Table 11 for the particular variables.

For the results in the b rows the same experiments were performed except

that all exchange rates were taken to be exogenous. Exchange rates, in

other words, were assumed to be fixed. The difference in the two rows

 for a given quarter for the GNP deflator is an estimate of the exchange

 rate effect on inflation for the quarter. The differences are presented

 in the c rows.

      The estimates in Table 11 vary considerably across countries. Con-

 sider, for example, the effect of the spending increases after 8 quarters

and consider the ratio of the c—row value to the a—row value. This ratio

is .19 for the U.s. (.131.69), —.02 for Germany (—.05/2.70), .59 for the

U.K. (.55/.93), and .10 for Japan (.02/.20). The effect for the U.K. is

large because the pound depreciated more than did the mark and the yen.

The mark, as noted in the previous section, actually appreciated for the

first six quarters. The initial sign of the exchange rate effect for

Germany is thus negative (although the size of the effect is small).

The size of the effect for Japan is small because of the lack of a direct

effect of import prices on domestic prices.

     The exchange rate effect for the interest rate increases is much

larger. All of the fall of the GNP deflator for Germany is attributed

to the exchange rate effect. When exchange rates are exogenous, there

is essentially no effect on the GNP deflator of the German interest rate

increase, whereas when exchange rates are endogenous, the effect after

eight quarters is —.68 percentage points. For the U.S. the effect after

eight quarters is .18 in the exogenous case and —.06 in the endogenous

case, for a difference of —.24.



VI. Conclusion

     The results in this paper give a fairly good indication of the prop-

erties of the model. It is clear that the linkages among Countries are

complicated and that there are few unambiguous effects with respect to

sign. This is true not just in principle but also in fact. Depreciation,
                                                                     38



for example, increases GNP for Japan, but decreases it for Germany and

the U.K. (Tables 5, 7, and 9). Also, a spending increase leads to a de—

predation in Japan, but to an appreciation in Germany and the U.K.

(Tables 3, 6, and 8). A spending increase in the U.S. has noticeably

different effects on different countries (Table 1).

     The results also show the importance of the price, interest rate,

and exchange rate linkages among countries as well as the usual trade
