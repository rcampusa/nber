                 The New Nexus Among Trade, Industrial,
                      and Exchange—Rate Policies


                                  ABSTRACT




     This paper explores the new interconnections between real and financial
policies that affect international transactions. Among other conclusions
are the following. (1) In a world of spatially mobile capital and reason-
ably accurate expectations, trends in international competitiveness and
financial asset yields are tightly linked. Volatility in one causes
volatility in the other. Policies that affect one affect the other.
Financial policy influences real exchange rates and alters the pressures
for trade and industrial policy. Trade and industrial policy causes
overshooting of financial variables, and alters the pressures for financial
policy.   (2) ny   failure   to make real and financial policy stable, credible,
systematic, and predictable generates volatile and costly signals to re--
allocate resources. The problems with this are unpredictability more
than inefficiency and resource disorder more than resource mis—order.
(3) Stable, credible, systematic, and transparent exchange—rate policy
can allay resource disorder by limiting deviations around economic trends.
Economic trends can be enhanced in the presence of well—defined market
imperfections by stable, credible, systematic, and transparent trade and
industrial policies. (4) To reduce the likelihood of global resource
disorder, real and financial policy options may involve retreating from
multilateralism and from unrealistically binding rules. Sensible and
timely alternatives seem to be aggressive bilateral peacemaking, non—
inclusive coalition formation, and the formulation of credible ?conventionst
to govern government policy, both real and financial.

     Interconnections among policies influencing trade, industrial structure,

international payments, and exchange rates have long been a focus of development

economics.1 By contrast, these interconnections seem rarely addressed in

developed—country analysis. This is presumably because they have been judged

unimportant or quantitatively insignificant. Present trends in trade and

payments policy, however, have generated new interest in these interconnections,

and several recent papers have explored them (for example, Blackhurst and Tumlir

(1980), Bergsten and Williamson (1982), and McCulloch (1982)).

    This paper is also devoted to exploring these interconnections. Its title

is a variation on Cooper's (1971) counterpart. Cooper's paper stands as a

prescient exception to the usual dichotomous treatment of "real" policy and

exchange—rate policy in developed countries.

    One of Cooper's principal observations was that the absence of an adequate

adjustment mechanism for international payments tempted nations to adopt distor—

tionary trade and investment policies. These distortions were then justified on

balance—of—payments or aggregate—employment grounds. Cooper's treatment of this

observation was eloquent, but the observation predates his paper, and has

 enjoyed a continuing popularity as an argument for exchange—rate flexibility,

 for example:


                ...Flexible exchange rates eliminate the balance—
                of—payments motive for tariffs and should therefore
                facilitate further rounds of negotiations to lower
                trade barriers ((Dudley 1981, p. 264), ascribing the
                view to Richard Blackhurst).



    LFor example, all the mid—197O's work on trade and exchange—rate regimes
coordinated and summarized by Bhagwati and Krueger. See also Krueger (1978,
1981).
                                         2


               The great advantage of a floating exchange rate system
               was to have been that the adjustment would take place
               automatically through currency appreciations and
               depreciations, removing the need for otherwise un-
               desirable trade and capital controls, and allowing
               governments to concentrate their policies on domestic
               economic needs. Thus if the adjustment process is
               working well, trade measures for balance of payments
               purposes are unnecessary and undesirable. (Frank,
               Pearson, and Riedel (1979, p. 15)).

               One of the major arguments for a flexible exchange
               rate system... is that it makes the case for free trade
               clear and simple. If you have a flexible rate and you
               reduce tariffs, movements in the exchange rate will
               automatically protect you against having any adverse
               balance of payments effects, and therefore you are
               not exporting or importing unemployment (Friedman
               (1969, p. 118)).


     Today's payments adjustment is arguably as inadequate as when Cooper
wrote.2   The characteristics of inadequacy have changed, but not the fact,

nor the source. Inadequacy now appears most dramatically as exchange—rate

volatility. It used to appear most dramatically as balance—of—payments cri-

ses (official—reserve volatility). Exchange rates are still misaligned for

long periods in the view of many commentators. And the sources of misalign-

ment and volatility are still both government initiative and
                                                               private specula-
tive response. Distortionary trade and investment policies that used to be

defended on balance—of—payments grounds are now defended by reference to

today's increasingly sharp swings in international competitiveness, real

exchange rates, and current account balances.

    On reflection, it may not be so surprising that pressures for aggressive

trade and industrial policy are ultimately invariant to exchange—rate systems.



    2Nor did Cooper imply, unlike Friedman and the others quoted, that
broadly floating exchange rates would be more adequate. Cooper held out
preferably for a system of gliding parities with presumptive indicators, or even
for a system of flexible uniform taxes and subsidies on trade.
                                           3


Over long enough periods of time ratios of wages, profits, and prices ——      in   one

sector relative to another and in one nation relative to another ——    are   quite

insensitive to exchange rates and monetary fluctuations. These non—monetary

ratios are ultimately the real source of protectionist pressure. The monetary

level of wages, profits, and prices doesn't really matter much. No worker,

manager, shareholder, or creditor sees much inequity or need for government pro-

tection when his or her wages and income rise as fast as prices, and when

foreign wages, prices, and incomes rise at the same rate.

    But over shorter periods of time, exchange—rate fluctuations can cause real

adjustment and injury ——   in   much the same way as monetary policy does. And when

exchange rate fluctuations are recurrent, sharp, and unpredictable, they can

lead to recurrent, sharp, and undesirable signals to reallocate resources

(see, for example, Artus (1982, p. 6)). Unanticipated exchange—rate volati-

lity has all the unfortunate features of unpredictable monetary policy. Both

can send false, misleading, and wasteful price signals to economic decision—

makers. Thus exchange rates are not irrelevant for trade policy even though

they may be neutral in their long—run effects. Changes in the level or even

the trend of an exchange rate may be innocuous; changes in its variance or

predictability are not.

    Nor are trade and industrial policies irrelevant for exchange—rate and

payments adjustment. Industrial policies aim at far more than just sectoral—

share targets. They also aim at temporal targets that are important deter-

minants of exchange rates and international payments. Among such

determinants are growth rates (Influenced by industrial policies toward

research and development activities and "high—technology" industry) and the

end—use production mix between consumption goods, capital goods, and educa-

tion (C and parts of I and G in the familiar national—accounts breakdown).
                                        4




 Trade policies in practice, although not necessarily in principle, often aim

 for the same goals. Of course their more narrow concern is with exports,

 imports, and foreign investment, all of which have obvious

 exchange—rate/payments effects. Both trade and industrial policies involve

 fiscal policy, debt management, and international transfer of rents, all of

which in turn influence exchange rates, payments, and international indebted-

ness.

    Little effort will be made below to differentiate trade policies from

industrial policies, following Corden (1980, p. 167) and Blackhurst (1981, p.

361). Blackhurst argues that as governments become increasingly interven-

tionist, much industrial policy is just a veil for trade policy. Conversely,

the most potent political arguments for trade policy have almost always been

industrial (maintenance of sectoral production and employment). As global

markets for products become more and more integrated, it is harder to

distinguish any unique motivation for one policy compared to the other.

Indeed in the U.S., trade policy (which "we have always had") is essentially

the stalking horse for industrial policy (which "we don't have," because of

philosophical objections). We will use the terms trade policy and industrial

policy interchangeably below.

    In practice, some of the most important links between industrial policies

and exchange—rate adjustment are one part politics and one part economics. In

principle there need not be any links at all, political or economic. We discuss

some practical political/economic connections in Section 2, and the conceivable

absence of any connections in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 are less sweeping.

Section 4 is a compilation of ways that international monetary turbulence

influences trade and industrial policies. Section 5 reverses the causation. It
                                         5




sketches ways that trade and industrial policies influence exchange rates and

international payments.

      There are a number of conclusions in the paper. (1) In a world of spa-

tially mobile capital and reasonably accurate expectations, trends in inter-

national competitiveness and financial asset yields are tightly linked.

Volatility in one causes volatility in the other. Policies that affect one

affect the other. Financial policy influences real exchange rates and alters

the pressures for trade and industrial policy. Trade and industrial policy

causes overshooting of financial variables, and alters the pressures for

financial policy. (2) Whatever the other goals of real and financial policy,

any failure to make them stable, credible, systematic, and predictable genera-

tes volatile and costly signals to reallocate resources. The problems with

this are unpredictability more than inefficiency and resource disorder more

than resource mis—order. The solution is to "re—order" resource allocation,

not necessarily to reallocate resources. (3) Stable, credible, systematic,

deviations   around economic trends. Economic trends can be enhanced in the

presence of well—defined market imperfections by stable, credible, systematic,

and transparent trade and industrial policies. (4) To reduce the likelihood

of global resource disorder, real and financial policy options may involve

retreating from multilateralism and from unrealistically binding rules. But

these should not be replaced by the vacuum of policy anarchy. More sensisble

and timely replacements seem to be aggressive bilateral peacemaking, non—

inclusive coalition formation, and the formulation of credible "conventions"

to govern government policy, both real and financial.

              2. POLITICAL/ECONOMIC POLICY PARALLELS AND PROPOSALS


     One of the most fundamental parallels between exchange—rate policies and

 industrial policies over the past 15 years is their common trend toward laisser—

faire ordering of interchange among governments. A familiar American image may

help to understand this parallel. "Frontier justice" has seemed increasingly to

order both trade and exchange—rate policy. Under frontier justice, if a govern-

ment can "get away with it," it should "do it." Strong governments survive

prosperously; weak governments, tenuously.

    The economic problem with frontier justice is unpredictability. More

organized systems of justice regularize economic exchange, establishing boun-

daries for what qualify as voluntary transactions, rules governing the

exploitation of market advantage, and sanctions to guarantee the enforcement

of contracts. Frontier justice, by contrast, can destabilize economic

exchange, becoming an irritant to the market rather than its lubricant.

    Another way to describe frontier justice among governments is to call it

policy anarchy and aggression. Tendencies toward such are always present, of

course. And it may be unduly alarmist to forecast increasing realization of

them. Yet some of the constraints that check policy aggression have become

looser. U.S. hegemony3 has waned since 1945, however one defines it. And

undesirable though it was in some ways, it clearly checked the scope for

policy aggression, much as the frontier sheriff or U.S. marshall checked the

scope for frontier justice. U.S. Influence was, roughtly speaking, once suf-

ficient to make other nations "fall into line" in trade policy, exchange—

(1976) for extended discussions of hegemony and international economics.

rate policy, and the international institutions that oversee them, but the

U.S. seems currently less able and less willing to play that role. The awk-

ward question this raises is: what happens on the frontier when the citi-

zenry grows stronger and when the sheriff not only grows weaker, but begins

to act just like everyone else? The problem facing both trade policy and

exchange—rate policy is how to avoid frontier justice in inter—government

relations —— how to re—order policy interchange.

    Increasingly aggressive industrial and exchange—rate policies are to be

feared more for their potential to disorder resource allocation than to

mis—order it. To put the problem starkly, the law of the jungle (pure

laisser faire) seems increasingly to dictate policy interchange among govern-

ments. Yet this is as haphazard a way of ordering policy transactions as it

is of ordering market transactions. Even most conservative economists have

in mind some particular legal structure of common—law conventions when they

favor "free" markets and liberal trade policy. The threat that presently

confronts both industrial and exchange—rate policy is that longstanding legal

structures and conventions governing government behavior will be abandoned.

Anarchy could conceivably begin to rule among governments. Uncertainty at

best and chaos at worst could be the consequence for international trade and

investment. The danger of the worst case can be appreciated by considering

what happens to everyday commerce during civil disorder, when legal systems

crumble and vigilante—isin waxes strong.

    Some recent history of this threat is easy to document. Policy initiatives

to minimize its future likelihood are more difficult to conceive.

    Two events play an important historical role. One was an aggressive

exchange—rate initiative that encouraged aggressive trade—policy initiatives.
                                        8


The second was an aggressive trade—policy initiative that reinforced the

earlier abandonment of conventions governing exchange—rate adjustment. The

first was the unilateral abrogation by the U.S. of its commitment to gold—

dollar convertibility in 1971. This was coupled with a swashbuckling

"invitation for the rest of the world to adjust their exchange—rate pari-

ties. And both were enforced by an aggressive application of trade policy in

the form of the infamous ten percent import surcharge. The second event, or

set of events, was the mammoth multiplication of world oil prices in 1973—74

and 1979—80. This amounted economically to a repeated application of

beggar—our—neighbor export taxes by OPEC governments. Many of the implied

revenues from these export taxes were recycled successfully. Those that were

not caused transfer problems in much the same way that reparations payments

did. The important role of oil as an input caused stagflation problems. Only

some of the resulting structural and supply stresses could be alleviated by

conventional aggregate demand policies; others were made worse. Sovereign

governments naturally chose different macroeconomic policy mixes to reflect

different menus of relief and endurance. These different policy responses

often necessitated sovereign exchange—rate management.

    The crucial question for policy is whether there are any sensible alter-

natives to the mutually devolving vortexes of aggressive trade and exchange—

rate initiatives. It is easier to describe first what seems to be unlikely or

undesirable alternatives. One is a return to hegemonic policy leadership in

the fashion of the frontier sheriff. This seems out of the question for any

government, barring a massive military realignment that might emerge from

world war. Also out of the question is an extensive (that is, global) set of

new "rules" governing trade or monetary relations. Examples of such include

the return to a gold—based adjustable—peg system, and an exhaustive "ordering"
                                        9

of global industrial and commodities markets. Such initiatives are at worst

unappealing, and at best premature ——   in   the same way that the U.S.

Constitution was premature before a decade's experience with the more loosely

binding, less inclusive Articles of Confederation. Finally, oft—repeated

exhortations to "more policy coordination" are only a pretender to a solution.

They beg the fundamental question of why such largesse would be in the narrow

national interest of aggressive governments. Policy coordination is a safe

haven only in the eyes of commentators without any stake in policy aggression.

    Blackhurst (1981, p. 369 passim) has addressed the fundamental question.

He references the national benefits of a return toward "conventions" in

governmental policy initiatives. Blackhurst seems to have in mind conventions

that would at least order, but not bind, trade and exchange—rate policy.

Governments themselves should be the constituents. Mutually agreed conven-

tions protect governments from each other and also from domestic political

constituents in narrow pursuit of trade and exchange—rate policies that serve

their special interest at the expense of other constituents.

    There are two Important practIcal challenges In any such return toward con-

ventions. One is to avoid over—ambitious promulgation of "rules" which, when

broken, breed the now—familiar unpredictability, uncertainty, and incredu—

lousness that disorders resource allocation. The second is to keep. the resource

and time costs of negotiation in check.

    In these lights it seems timely to consider reinforcing recent retreats from

commercial and financial multilateralism. Multilateralism may currently be

too ambitious and too costly to maintain. Bilateralism, trilateralism,

quadrilaterialism, and so on, may be cheaper, more promising, and the most

predictable route toward a new multilateralism. Initially, after all, the

GATT, IMF, and World Bank were upheld by small, non—exhaustive groups of
                                        10

  nations. In the light of another metaphor, small neighborhood gangs may take

 on the obligations of turf—sharing agreements only after a conclusive

 demonstration of neighborhood peace and predictability that stems from

 agreement within the "exclusive club" of larger gangs.

     What this may suggest practically is aggressive bilateral peacemaking ——   the
 formation of mutually advantageous coalitions with like—minded governments.

 For example, the U.S. and Japan seem likely partners for a bilateral but

 possibly non—MFN trade agreement that would order trade along lines that are

 held closely In common. A successful U.S.—Japan trade agreement might then

 encourage other trade—policy combattants to sue for peace. Or for example,

 the U.S. seems currently in a position to bargain for European trade—policy

 concessions in return for a recommitment on its part to exchange—market inter-

 vention. U.S. intervention can be argued to have at the very worst innocuous

effects on microecononiic allocation and macroeconomic prosperity. At best it

might purge the economic system of large unanticipated exchange—rate

variations that may be mistaken for resource—allocational signals. The case

for stable, predIctable monetary policy to avoid resource—allocaionaj. mista-

kes and disorder ought to apply with equal force to stable, predictable

exchange—rate management.

    The general goal of any return toward convention in government policy

interchange is to re—order resource allocation, or perhaps more accurately to

allay the imminence of disorder. Stability, credibility, and
                                                               predictability
are crucial pre—requisltes for both new trade policy and new exchange—rate

policy (Krueger (1981, p. 91), Grossman and Richardson (1982, pp. 20—27),

Artus (1982, pp. 10—11)). Stable, credible, and transparent trade policy is

able to influence trends in resource allocation.   Stable, credible, and
                                        11

transparent exchange—rate policy is able to influence deviations around

those trends. Ideal trends with minimal divergences are the obvious targets.

Trend mistakes are costly not only for the usual reasons, because resources

are continuously less productive than they would be in the "right" place, but

also because irreversible human and physical investment is often wasted, and

because retraining and retooling costs are ultimately unavoidable. Divergence

mistakes are costly not only because of human aversion to risk, but also

because temporary competitive imbalances can generate empty shelves and

storage lots in one location, excessive inventories in another, and resource—

diverting arbitrage that transfers goods from the latter location to the

former. The three respective resource allocational costs associated with

divergence mistakes are waste from rationing, waste from excessive

stockpiles,4 and waste from unnecessary transportation and redistribution.

    In a peculiar way, the goals of stability, credibility, and predictability

amount to making trade and exchange—rate policy more endogenous and less exoge-

nous. Endogenous policy in this context simply means systematic policy. Policy

    4Stockpiles are costly both to maintain, and in a growing economy, to build
up at steady—state growth rates. Inventories can be excessive in the sense
that they waste resources on maintenance, and in the sense that they force regu-
lar incremental additions to stockpiles that could otherwise be consumed.

 readily apparent to economic decisionmakers.5 Exogenous policy in this

 context, typical though It is In standard economic analysis, amounts to

 arbitrary, unsystematic, and unpredictable policy.




     51n addItIon to the resource—allocatlonal benefits of stable, credible,
 and transparent policy that are sketched above, Richardson (1982) and Grossman
 and Richardson (1982, p. 24) observe Its potential for generating a kind of
 "leading adjustment" to policy. Leading adjustment has the virtue of being
 controlled by expected prices, costs, and profits. All of these are flexible
and able to contribute to market clearing. None of them seem likely to be
distorted in any systematic or undesirable way. Thus resource—allocational
 "adjustment costs" associated with policy that can be forecast and that is
transparent may in general be minimal. There appear, however, to be two
Important situations In which this generalization may be misleading. Market
power on the part of sector—specIfic factors (e.g., a strong union in an
Import—sensitive industry) may lead them to exploit systematically transparent
policy to take further advantage of their monopoly position (e.g., to raise
wages unduly). And foreign policy authorities in retaliatory response may
exploit systematically transparent policy to take advantage of any market
power they have. Gaming situations such as these, however, suggest only
that stable, credible, and predictable policy response should be developed
to deal with domestic market power and foreign policy retaliation.

              3. PURE ANALYTICAL APPROACHES AND THEIR LIMITATIONS


    A familiar position in "pure" analytic approaches to trade and industrial

policies is that exchange rates and payments adjustment are red herrings.

In the most familiar general—equilibrium models exchange rates are ignored and

payments adjustment is taken for granted. Exchange rates and ignored because

they are assumed to be the relative price of two moneys, both of which are

"veils" having no real effects. Money does not matter, and neither do exchange

rates. They are all "neutral". An exogenous change in their value has no ulti-

mate impact on production or consumption, and therefore no ultimate impact on

trade or industrial policy. Trade or industrial policy may by contrast, have

some impact on exchange rates and monetary variables, but the 'real' consequen-

ces of these "real" policies will be invariant to their monetary consequences.

This seems to be what Blackhurst and Tumlir (1980, pp. 3, 13) have in mind when

they remark, "The economic value of trade liberalization is not affected by

increased variability of nominal exchange rates... exchange rate fluctuations in

no way reduce the importance of efforts to liberalize world trade."6 This is

also the regime chartacterized by Corden (1980, p. 174) as having a vertical

long—run Phillips curve.

    As to payments adjustment in pure analytic approaches to trade and

industrial policies, it is implicitly assumed to be maintained automatically.

The automatic maintenance mechanisms are exchange—rate flexibility, stabilizing

official or private trade in assets (as under the gold standard), or a com—

models, see Chipman (1978, 1980).

 bination of all.7 Trade and industrial policies obviously cannot cause

 exchange—rate or payments "problems" under such assumptions. For that matter,

 nothing else can either.

     So under conventional analytic approaches it makes about as much sense to

 write a paper on "Industrial Policy, Floating Exchange Rates, and Payments

Adjustment," as on "Industrial Policy, Variable Tides, and Shoreline

Adjustment." Purity rejoices and Dichotomy reigns supreme.

    Fortunately for the mandate of this paper, one need only add a few elements

of reality to draw richer conclusions about the interaction of trade and

exchange—rate policies. Some of these conclusions bear extended discussion and

are treated in Sections 4 and 5 of the paper. Other conclusions are very

general and will be treated quickly in this section.

    To start, analysts agree in general that "money can matter" to real econo-

mic decisions for as long as some market failure persists. For example,

domestic wages and prices may adjust sluggishly to clear markets. Exchange

rates will matter for real decisions during such wage—price sluggishness.

Temporary but persistent undervaluation (relative to a currency's ultimate

equilibrium value) should encourage exports and protect domestic import com-

petitors, leading Corden to dub it "exchange—rate protection" (Corden (1978)).

Temporary but persistent overvaluation can lead to increased pressures for

compensatory protectionist policy by injured tradeables producers (Bergsten

and Williamson (1982)).



    7it may be surprising to some general—equilibrium trade theorists to
learn that they too are macroeconomists, always implicitly writing down a
rudimentary and convenient macroeconomic structure on which their "real"
analysis is based.
                                      15



    Furthermore, exchange—rate misalignments may be sharper, more frequent, and

more enduring the more that wage—price sluggishness stands in the way of market

clearing. The reason is that the exchange rate and other flexible variables

must "do the work" of sluggish prices. Excess supplies and demands spill over

Into unrationed markets like the foreign exchange market, causing greater

unpredictability in flexible prices there. Trade and industrial policies may even

aggravate this spillover unpredictability of exchange rates (or of official

reserves, or of exchange control adjustments) if they administratively ration

suppliers and demanders. Administrative rationing is of course one tool of

production quotas, import licensing, voluntary export restraints, and man-

datory performance requirements. The counterpart to the policy—induced

rationing is increased spillovers of frustrated supplies and demands into

unrationed markets. And among these unrationed markets are prominently the

international markets that include and are mediated by the foreign exchange

market.

    Distortions other than wage—price sluggishness can also make exchange

rates and money "matter." Take for example intertemporal and capital—market

imperfections that set practical limits to the losses consistent with any

firm's continued survival. With such imperfections, an increase in unan-

ticipated exchange—rate volatility may cause increased incidence of financial

insolvency for firms that are still viable in terms of underlying trends. If

insolvency is a boon, implying only a transfer of ownership and a shaking Out

of the least viable operations in the still viable firm, then there is no

cause for alarm. But if insolvency is a bane, implying waste of resources

through indivisibility or immobility, then greater frequency, amplitude, and

unpredictability of exchange—rate deviations around their trend is an impor—

 tant problem. Even governments can become "insolvent" due to the same

 capital—market imperfections. Increased incipient exchange—rate volatility

 can exhaust not only owned official reserves but borrowed official reserves as

well. This leaves a government with no recourse except to abandon the foreign

exchange market entirely or to apply strict distortionary controls. Financial

crises then do have real effects, as illustrated most recently in the Mexican

dilemma .

    Market failure is at the core of each of these illustrations of substantive

interaction between trade—industrial policies and financial/exchange—rate poli-

cies. The first illustrations rest on the failure of markets to clear at a

moment in time. The second rests on the failure of markets to clear over time.

In general, market failure in one domain can provide a presumptive case for

remedial action in some other domain, albeit of a second—best kind. For

example, real distortions in the inter—temporal trade carried out in global

capital markets can be reduced greatly by stable international banking and

financial arrangements. What imperfections remain in the global capital market

may provide economIcally sensible grounds for infant Industry protection

(Baldwin (1969)). They may also provide grounds for industrial policy aimed at

avoiding the resource waste associated with "unemployed" immobile capital, or

associated with missing insurance markets that cause irreversible human invest-

ment decisions (Grossman and Richardson (1982, pp. 7—8, 22—23), Eaton and

Grossman (1981)). Predatory trade and industrial policy provide another

example. Such policies in one country create market distortions in others. The

ideal retaliatory response (or threat) may lie in exchange—rate manipulation, in

some other financial intervention, or in completely unrelated domains rather

than in the threatened markets themselves. This is because the retaliatory
                                      17



response must be credible to be effective. It must therefore emanate from sec-

tors or activities where the injured country has a strong market position rather

than a vulnerable one.

   We turn In the next two sections to more detailed conclusions about the

interaction of trade, industrial, and exchange—rate policies.

                         III. SOME IMPACTS OF INTERNATIONAL
                               MONETARY TURBULENCE ON
                              TRADE/INDUSTRIAL POLICY



     The confluence of increasing capital mobility and increasing recourse to

floating exchange rates can be argued to have brought unique pressures to bear

on, trade and. i.ndustrial policy.

     Increasing spatial capital mobility can be an independent source of

financial shocks to the "real" international economy. It can also create a

sounding board transmitting real and financial shocks in one region into rever-

berations in others. Financial markets tend to reflect "news" faster than goods

markets or factor markets. And some bits of "news" encourage significant port-

folio reallocations across boundaries and currency denominations.

     That is where exchange—rate systems enter. When pegged exchange—rate

systems are credible and work, international asset—market fluctuations have corn—

paratively minor effects on competitive and comparative advantage. But when

pegged—rate systems fail, then fluid fInancIal capItal may force exchange rates

to oscillate markedly around trends consistent with "real—trade fundamentals',

distorting and destabilizing real trade patterns. It is useful to recall some

familiar features of exchange—rate systems in order to illustrate these points.

     Under credible and successful pegged—rate systems, official reserves

absorb a large portion of the fluctuations in mobile international financial

capital.8 That is to say, official reserves are volatile. Money stocks are

potentially volatile as well, depending on the importance of official reserves

in the monetary base and the potential for sterilization. By comparison,

exchange rates and current account balances are not volatile, although they

may exhibit secular trends, for example, parities may creep or glide by small

increments over time. Exchange rates and current—account balances may also

exhibit "misalignment" (Bergsten and Williamson (1982)) ——   protracted   periods

of departure from normal or long—run values. During such periods, official

reserve stocks may exhibit secular trends as well as volatility.

     Under floating and conservative intervention systems, exchange rates

absorb a large portion of the fluctuations in mobile international financial

capital. That is to say, exchange rates are volatile. Their volatility

induces accommodating adjustments in trade flows or other capital flows.

Adjustment of trade flows takes place for familiar reasons. Adjustment of




   8Two problems are often saId to confront any regular and significant govern-
ment intervention in today's foreign exchange markets. One is that official
reserves are inadequate to cope with the massive cross—boundary portfolio
reallocations. The second is that no matter how large official reserves were,
rational expectations of the government's intervention, based on knowledge of
its policy reaction behavior, would cause the Intervention to be ineffective.
It is rarely observed that both of these problems are caused in turn by a fun-
damentally deeper problem: the incredulousness with which the market greets
government exchange—rate targets and commitments. Suppose that governments
were really believed in their exchange—rate commitments, and that they really
took policy action consistent with those beliefs in order to ratify them.
Then the payments mechanism would work much as it did under the gold standard,
although not necessarily with fixed exchange rates. Massive portfolio re-
allocation might indeed take place. And the government's policy reactions
would be indeed transparent to rational forecasters. But any massive capital
movements based on rational expectations would themselves stabilize the
exchange rate around the government's credible target. Little actual inter-
vention would be necessary. By contrast, if the target is incredible, no
amount of government intervention will succeed. The real problem is thus the
stability and credibility of government financial policy, as discussed in
Section 2.
                                        20

 capital flows takes place because of exchange—rate related capital gains or

 losses, and because of the reversal of speculative asset positions as exchange

 rates change. Exchange rates are almost certainly more volatile than under

 aggressive and credible intervention. Exchange rates may also exhibit secular

 trends, and official resistance to the exchange—rate trends will create trends

 in official reserves. Otherwise official reserves are relatively stable.

     There is obviously a trade—off across exchange—rate systems between official

 reserve volatility and exchange—rate volatility. The former has little direct

 influence on trade and industrial policy; the latter, much. 9   It can be

 argued that the strongest political pressure for protection emanates from spe-

cific sectors of the economy. Each industry views itself as having very

little influence over exchange rates. (Corden (1980, p.176) suggests that

industries think of their movement as "acts of God".) Yet industries are

painfully aware of exchange—rate influences on them. Depreciation and appre-

ciation due to asset market flux cause ebbs and flows in competitiveness, cash

flow, and long—term economic viability)0 To the extent that there are inter—

temporal capital—market dstort1ons that set limits to the maximum losses

consistent with any firms' survival, unanticipated exchange—rate volaltility

may heighten corporate, sectoral and ultimately collective political pressure




     9By contrast, official—reserve swings have considerable direct influences
on financial markets themselves, altering money supplies, bond stocks, and
asset prices. These may have indirect effects on trade and industrial policy,
but rarely any important immediate influence.

    10Deardorff and Stern (1982) empirically estimate some of the sectoral
U.S. effects of dollar appreciation. Marsden and Hollander (1981) show for
Australia how flux in the nominal exchange rate overwhelmingly accounts
for flux in sector—by—sector International
                                           competitiveness.
                                          21



for protection, especially of a quantitative kind. Quantitative trade and

industrial policies shrink the variance of international competitiveness, as

well as changing its mean. Tariffs (more accurately ad valorem tariffs)

affect only the mean.11 The impetus for these sectoral protectionist

pressures is of course the fluctuations in a sector's "real" exchange rate,

the ratio of foreign to domestic commodity prices in comparable currency

units.12

       This argument suggests only that pressures for government intervention in

trade and production will be greater given volatile exchange rates. It does

not suggest that international trade will be discouraged by floating.

The argument is thus consistent with the oft—quoted failure to find convincing

correlation between exchange—rate volatility and international trade (Hooper

and Kohlhagen (1978), referenced for example by Levich (1981, p.15) and Artus

and Young (1979, p.682)). The explanation for this consistency is that

current trade and industrial policies are as likely to be pro—trade—biased as

anti—trade—biased. Examples of pro—trade biased industrial policies include:

export performance requirements, indirect export subsidies, export tax relief,

concessionary export financing, disguised encouragements to dump, and official

cultivation of scale—intensive and technology—intensive industry that necessi-

tates reliance on international markets. Increased export promotion and



  11This may be a reason to expect relatively more recourse to quantitative
protection under floating exchange rates, and relatively less resource to
tariffs, than would be typical under pegged rates.
  12
    Some define real exchange rates as domestic ratios of tradeables prices to
non—tradeables prices (e.g. Neary and Purvis (1981)). Most of the observations
in this section have straightforward correspondents in this conception as long
as tradeables prices follow exchange rates more closely or quickly than non—
tradeables prices.
                                         22



 "export protection" move global production and trade patterns toward their

 free—trade norms, and potentially even past them.13

     Of course some exchange—rate variation is welcomed by interventionist

 interests. For short periods of time, governments can sometimes protect tra—

 d'eab•l'es producers by discretionary leaning toward currency depreciation. This

 is. a.oompli.shed euphemistically by "replenishing depleted official reserves" or

 "building them up 'for a rainy day'". Corden (1978) and a number of subsequent

writers have described this as "exchange—rate protection".     It is limited in

scope by the credibility of the government's exchange—rate targets. Incredible

targets generate ineffective intervention and no exchange—rate protection, as

described in note 8. And even with scope, the effectiveness of exchange—rate

protection is limited in time to the period during which wages, prices and other

nominal magnitudes remain sluggish. Exchange—rate protection is not a viable

policy, for example, where wages are indexed fully and quickly to prices, and

where commodity arbitrage causes prices to adjust rapidly to exchange rates.

    An extension of the idea of exchange—rate protectIon has been recommended

by several recent commentators. It is to use official—reserve intervention

on both sides of the market to stabilize average (aggregate) real exchange

rates around their trends. The idea has some appeal as a means of avoiding

the unanticipated real exchange—rate divergences that destabilize and distort


  13Other explanations for the failure to find much discernible impact of
exchange—rate variation on international trade or investment include: (1)
possible encouragements to trade based on foreign direct investment, vertically
to avoid input—price variation, and horizontally to exploit arbitrage of the
produce—where—cheap, market—where—dear variety (Artus (1982, pp. 6, 8),
McCulloch (1982, pp.10—li)); (2) the large proportion of modern international
trade and investment carried out by genuinely multinational corporations with
no strong currency habitat, so that exchange—rate variation becomes less
important to their real decisions.

resource allocation. What this proposal comes close to in a world with spa-

tially mobile financial capital and with reasonably accurate forecasting of

expected inflation, is simultaneous stabilization of the average "real" interest

rate differential. When nominal interest parity, Fisherian interest parity,

and mean forecast accuracy all hold, the average (aggregate) time trend in

real exchange rates is approximately equal to the average international dif-

ference in real interest rates:1

                      represents the time rate of change of any exchange rate

                   rd, rf represent measures of domestic and foreign "real"
                   interest rates.

Thus to stabilize real exchange rates around their trend is to stabilize inter-

national differences in real interest rates. This requires intervention policy

aimed at moderating asset—market shocks and stochastic variation both at home

and abroad. It is notable that from the left side of the equation such policy

would look like trade or industrial policy, but from the right side it looks

like financial policy. With spatially mobile capital, the two are closely

linked. That is an important charateristic of today's international economy.

   The band of approximation around "equation" (1) is narrower the closer the



  14"Real" interest rates are thought of as the difference between nominal
interest rates and reasonably accurate forecasts of inflation. Nominal
interest rates differ internationally under spatial financial capital mobility
by reasonably accurate forecasts of the trend movement in exchange rates.
                                         24

 spatial links between financial capital markets and the tighter the accuracy

 of economic forecasts. When it is reasonably accurate, "equation" (1) serves

 several purposes. It demonstrates the linkage between what is usually con-

 sidered a concern of financial policy ——     the divergence of real interest rates
 from global levels —— and what is usually considered a concern of

 industrial/trade policy ——   trends in international competitiveness. It also

 demonstrates that small, financially open nations may have on the one hand little

 policy control over real exchange rates (so that the real—exchange—rate

 targetting suggested above would be infeasible) and on the other hand little

 need for such policy control. The volatility of real exchange rates for such

 countries may be quite small, and their mean value may approximate purchasing—

 power—parity norms, since international arbitrage seems likely to minimize

divergences of home real interest rates from dominating global levels. Such

"real—interest arbitrage" might be most likely where multinational corporate

presence is prominent in the small, financially open country.

    Equation (1) serves also to demonstrate how important trade issues can arise

from the inter—temporal considerations associated with real interest rates.

Divergences between home and foreign real interest rates may be as significant

an influence on trade as trade policy itself, especially in a
                                                                  growing economy.
Trends in and shocks to real interest rates can change the
                                                               commodity composition
of trade because they alter real exchange rates, with subsequent shifts in the

margin of comparative advantage among goods.15

    The most widely appreciated illustration of this is of course the

"overshooting" phenomenon, summarized and surveyed by Schadler (1977) and



     15Trends in real interest rates can even change international com-
petitiveness within sectors such as autos and capital goods, because capitaliza-
tion of borrowing costs accentuates the dollar value of natural price
differentials.
                                       25




 Levich (1981)).

     The sequence of overshooting linkages between financial and real variables

 is familiar. The sequence begins with an unanticipated shock to a financial

 variable (Dornbusch (1976), Kouri (1976)) or to a real variable (Neary and

 Purvis (1981)). Unanticipated shocks include announcements of future develop-

ments (Wilson (1979)), which once announced become anticipated future develop-

ments, and unexpected revisions of previous announcements. All these unan-

 ticipated shocks cause rapid adjustment of financial variables ——   asset
valuations, interest rates, and nominal exchange rates. The rapid ajustment of

financial variables then becomes itself a shock, to which some real variables

respond rapidly at first and subsequently with slow unwinding. Most important

for trade and industrial policy are the ways that real interest rates and nomi-

nal exchange rates affect trends in international competitiveness, as revealed

in equation (1). Unanticipated changes in the level of a monetary stock, for

example, cause oppositely signed changes in real interest rates (rd); unan-

tIcIpated changes in the rate of monetary expansion cause similarly signed

changes in the rate of currency depreciation ()    Both cause sudden movement of

real exchange rates and competitiveness, with subsequent slow unwinding.

    Some aspects of overshooting linkages are less familiar than those just

discussed. First, real exchange rates really overshoot in response to

monetary/financial turbulence. Virtually any temporary divergence of real

exchange rates from their real norms should be classified as overshooting if it

is caused by a monetary shock. That is because the ultimate equilibrium values

of real exchange rates, like all price ratios, are relatively insensitive to

monetary variables.
                                        26

     Second, monetary policy innovations are not the only shocks that cause

 overshooting in real exchange rates and sectoral competitiveness. Overshooting

 is just as readily a result of unanticipated shocks to money demand (Artus

 and Young (1979, p.670), Levich (1981, p.25)) and to stock equilibrium In

 other financial markets. Among such unfamiliar causes of overshooting are

 bank and brokerage failures, unexpected features of default and rescheduling

arrangements, unforeseen beginnings and ends to "bubbles," unpredictable out—

workings of international "currency substitutability," and unanticipated port-

folio shifts among official—reserve assets of different maturity and currency

denomination.16

    Third, real shocks themselves can cause financial—market reactions that feed

back in turn on the real economy, in the form of overshooting and volatility.

Examples include unexpected business failures, animal spirits in capital for-

mation, and exogenous resource—price shocks that change the capital value of

resource ownership.17 Even unanticipated cyclical movements in real output can

cause financial—market reactions and subsequent overshooting. Unforeseen

recessionary shocks reduce the stock demand for liquid assets and real interest

rates. These will in turn cause over—depreciation of domestic money and even

larger over—depreciation of the real exchange rate. With no further shocks, the

nominal exchange rate would gradually return part way toward its former value

and the real exchange rate would return all the way)8 Unforeseen expansionary


16See Roosa et al. (1982) and Multiple Reserve Currency Study Group (1982) for
  other ramifications of multiple—currency holdings of official reserves.

17Exatnples abound in the literature on the "Dutch disease." References abound
  in, for example, Corden and Neary (1982) and Neary (1982).

18Therein lies a possible contributing explanation for the well—known hyper-
  sensitivity of the trade balance to cyclical fluctuation. A nation's trade
  balance may vary counter—cyclically not only for the usual reasons, but also
  because its international competitive position varies in an exaggerated
  counter—cyclical way due to overshooting.
                                       27

shocks will have, of course, symmetrically opposite influences.

    Given the large inventory of sources for overshooting, it is no wonder that

concern has mounted over the recent volatility of exchange rates and real

interest rates. Proposals abound for improved exchange—rate management and

increased policy stabilization of interest rates, especially on the part of

governments in the largest financial markets.

    The concern becomes even more credible when each source of overshooting is

seen not as an isolated, unique event, but realistically as a set of recurring,

unforeseeable stochastic impulses. Financial variables will then overshoot

unpredictably on both sides of equilibrium. Induced overshooting and volatility

of "real" variables may be even more pronounced. Equilibrium may be less a

position of rest and more an entrepot for real exchange rates, international com-

petitiveness, and relative prices of tradeables to non—tradeables or capital

goods to consumer goods. This is a disquieting scenario. Stable equilibria are

always assumed to constrain the economic system at its extremes, tugging it back

most aggressively when it was furthest away. But equilibria have also usually

been conceived as dwelling places. It is not clear what happens in an economy

with so much recurrent volatility that equilibrium becomes just a transit point.

The most dangerous potential answer is unpredictibility and disorder in resource

allocation. Inefficiency and distortions might increase too, but seem by com-

parison much less threatening.

    Some commentators on overshooting have observed how pervasive it is among

all economic markets, and how deep are its historical roots in economic analysis

(for example, Levich (1981), Neary and Purvis (1981)). The implicit or expli-

cit message is that exchange—rate volatility is similar to the volatility in

all asset prices, and we should worry no more about one than the other. While
                                         28


 the description of exchange rates as asset prices is undeniable, the prescrip-

 tion to treat them the same as other asset prices seems dubious.     Exchange
 rate volatility seems on the face of it to affect more industrial decisions

 more dramatically and more immediately than volatility in prices of equities,

 bonds, or commodities futures. Variation in other asset prices seems to have

 its most important effects on future resource allocation and investment.19

 Variation in exchange rates seems to have important current as well as future

 effects.

     The most compelling reason why volatility in exchange rates has comparatively

more scope for pernicious real mischief is that exchange rates are relative

 prices of media of exchange, not just stores of value. When the relative price

of exchange media vary, so will the terms of any real transaction requiring

those exchange media to be bartered.2°        Almost all current (as well as

future) international transactions involve such a barter. There is no medium

of exchange for the national media, no super—medium.

     The point is that foreign exchange markets serve more purposes than just

those served by all asset markets. This makes price variation in the former

more important than price variation in the latter. Foreign exchange (spot

claims in foreign money) is different from other financial assets for exactly

the same reasons (whatever they are) that money (whatever it is!) is different


19
  For example, variation in the ratio of the market value of capital to its
replacement value ("Tobin's q") has its most important effects on the future
capital stock, through cumulative effects on current investment.


20The terms of the real transactions may admittedly be only temporarily altered,
as discussed above and in section 4. The period during which this happens is
influenced again by the duration of sluggishness in the adjustments of wages,
prices, and expectations.
                                        29

 from other financial assets. Public interest in stock markets and futures

markets would understandably and properly rise if legal tender were to be

re—defined as contracts for pork bellies or baskets of ownership certificates to

Dow—Jones Industrials. Concern over pork bellies and the Dow—Jones average might

become fit fare for every family's dinner conversation. Opposition would spring

up immediately to the capricious signals for resource allocation that were

generated by the vagaries of pricing on Wall Street and In the pits of the

Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "That's all very well for speculative financial

instruments," people might be heard to say, "but this stuff bouncing around from

hour to hour is legal tender!"

    This discussion has been aimed at documenting the ways that international

monetary turbulence elicits sympathetic real turbulence and pressures on trade

and industrial policy. The last section of the paper reverses the causation.

The chief implication of this section for international monetary policy is that

its credibility and predictability be enhanced. To do this successfully

requires increased credibility and predictability of domestic monetary policy.

And to do this successfully requires some change in monetary targets and tech-

nical procedures (to enhance predictability), but more importantly an improve-

ment in the systematic will, transparency, and endogeneity that govern monetary

control. Given them, any one of a number of international monetary reforms might

succeed well.21 Without them, all seem likely to fail.

                               MONETARY TURBULENCE

     It is obvious that trade and industrial policies aim at sectoral targets.

 They attempt to influence the commodity composition of output and trade. It is

 less obvious that trade and industrial policies aim at temporal targets. They

 attempt to influence current—account balances, capital formation, and growth

 rates. To achieve their sectoral and temporal targets, trade and industrial

 policy inevitably employ not only budget—balancing taxes and subsidies but also

 fiscal, monetary, and debt management policies.

    Exchange rates and international payments are sensitive to both sectoral and

temporal targets of real policy, but especially so to the temporal targets.

These targets and their corresponding instruments influence levels, trends, and

volatility of exchange rates, official reserves, and payments balances on

current and capital account.

    The Importance of temporal targets in trade and industrial policy Is docu-

mented, for example, in Mutti (1982, pp. 9—15). Government capital subsidies to

industry range from 2 to 10 times as large as government operatIng subsidies in

major countries. Without exception, industrial subsidies generate benefits on

balance to employment of capital. Or, for example, government export promotion

is typically a sectoral policy carried out by temporal tools. These include con—

cessionary loans, loan guarantees, and sometimes even equity participation. It

is no surprise therefore that such hybrid sectoral—temporal policies have hybrid

consequences. Does export promotion really strengthen a currency and bolster

reserves? The usual affirmative answer rests on sectoral incidence alone. A

definitive anser must also rest on the policy's temporal Incidence —— how the

export promotion is financed.
                                        31

    The effect of industrial policies on levels and trends of financial

variables is almost always conditional. One important condition is the type of

industrial policy being considered. Two types are often distinguished. One is

a "pick the winners" or "positive—adjustment" policy; the other is a "protect

the injured" or "defensive" policy (e.g., Corden (1980), Blackhurst (1981)).

Many commentators identify export—development policies with the first type and

import substitution with the second (e.g. Krueger (1981)). But there are

enough counter—examples of successful import replacement and of threatened

export sectors clamoring for protection to make the usual identification

dubious, especially on the margin.

    A successful "positive adjustment" policy should strengthen a country's

currency. One of the most familiar reasons for its success is being able to

overcome inter—temporal capital—market imperfections. These imperfections may

be associated with imperfect information, with risk that exceeds corporate—

insurer or creditor ability to bear, and other causes of market failure.

Over time the wisdom of a successful "pick the winners" policy will become

apprecIated in the Integrated global capital market. For as long as this

learning takes, financial investors, some of them foreign, will be adding

assets to their portfolios that carry a stake in the winners' winnings. So

will domestic investors, foregoing some foreign investments that they might

otherwise have made. Those who add the assets earliest realize the largest

capital gains over the period of information diffusion. They also tend to be

the best informed and/or most daring investors. When information about the

successful policy is sufficiently diffuse, extraordinary capital gains cease.

Only normal returns will be made from then on. But divestment will not

thereby be encouraged and none will normally take place. The important impli-

cation for this paper is that investors will end up holding an indefinitely
                                       32

  larger stock of claims than otherwise on the country that picked the winners.

  Increased stock demand for selected domestic assets will then lead to

 arbitrage among the country's other assets. Arbitrage will cause almost all

 asset prices to be higher than otherwise, too.    Among these other asset prices

 is the foreign—exchange_market value of local currency.

     Thus the ultimate monetary effect of a successful "pick the winners" stra-

 tegy is an indefinitely stronger currency and/or an indefinitely more favorable

 tend in official reserves. During the period of information diffusion the

 exchange—rate and official—reserve effects will be quantitatively even more

 marked. This is definitionally overshooting, and must take place because tran-

 sitional capital—account surpluses must be somehow financed during this

 period.22 The transitional impacts will of course be tempered if the winner

 industries are biased toward exports or import
                                                  replacement. Incipient current—
 account surpluses would be financed by even greater transitional official

reserve absorption, or else they would be reversed by even greater transitional

exchange—rate appreciation. Such appreciation would have to create the current

deficit necessary to fund the transitional capital Inflow.

    A "defensive" industrial policy has exactly the same effects if it avoids

temporary insolvency and capital losses in firms that are viable in the long run.

But a "defensive" policy that delays the demise of non—viable enterprise has

exactly the opposite effects. So does an unsucessfuj. "pick the winners" policy,

in which losers are mistakenly identified as winners. Industrial policies in

these last two cases result in a permanently weaker currency and/or less

favorable trend in official reserves. In the transition period during which

the global capital market gradually develops its bleak assessment of the


22The details these transitional and steady—state conclusions are sketched in
                                                                              a
number of recent papers by Jeffrey Sachs and by William H. Branson.
                                        33


 government's policy, depreciation and official—reserve losses will be even

greater than ultimately. The reasoning is symmetric to that sketched above.

     It can readily be seen that raw industrial policies, whether sucessful or

not, cause overshooting of exchange rates and of trends in official reserves.

In this sense they may contribute to exchange—rate and payments volatility as

well as influencing levels and steady—state trends. Yet industrial policies are

not developed exogenously in a vacuum. Some are conscious attempts to vitiate

structural adjustments that are themselves unanticipated real shocks, and that

themselves cause overshooting. The international monetary system may be made

less turbulent, not more, by these trade and industrial policies. Examples

include policies that attempt to offset oil—price shocks, real—wage

aggression, and stagflationary influences of social policies (such as higher

payroll taxes, environmental standards, and occupational safety and health

mandates).

    To argue matters another way, the chief cause of international monetary tur-

bulence during the past decade may well have been the unanticipated stagfla—

tionary shocks described above, coupled with the unanticipatable government

policy responses to them under apparently new rules of the game. Trade and

industrial policies that are consciously counter—stagflationary should then

reduce international monetary turbulence. Examples include supply—side policies

aimed at stimulating modernization, research and development, and capital for-

mation at the expense of consumer—goods production. Many such industrial poli-

cies are, however, unfunded, and lead to larger government budget deficits.

Crowding out may then remove much of their intended counter—stagflationary

influence.

   Even worse, many industrial policies are themselves stagflationary.

They are more clearly described as counter—productive. By affording
                                           34

  ever larger measures of protection to firms and workers in inefficient and

 declining industries, they reduce productivity growth in exactly the same way

 as technological regress. Worst of all, they often create opportunities to

 earn rents and unconditional windfall gains on the privileged position that

 industrial policy provides. Resource diversion away from normal economic

 activity is the consequence. Resources are devoted instead to "rent—seeking"

 (Krueger (1974)), lobbying (Brock and Magee (1981)), and suing the government

 for (industrial) injury. Counter—productive industrial policies like these

 will be catalysts for international monetary turbulence rather than cures for

 it.


       One conclusion is that for trade and industrial policies to alleviate inter-

 national monetary turbulence, they must be motivated by economic dollars and

 sense. They must be either consistent with private—market assessments or per-

suasively corrective of them. Policies motivated by
                                                        anything else——by politics,
national prestige, or irrational attachment to romantic industry (e.g.,

"high—tech")—.-will destabilize international trade and payments (Grossman and

Richardson (1982, p. 22)). Markets have an inexorable way of disciplinIng poli-

ticians, nationalists, and romantics. But a concomitant of discipline is tur-

bulence.

       Finally, It may seem doubtful that the international monetary impacts of

trade and industrial policy are
                                  quantitatively large enough to worry about.

But recent empirical calibrations of mixed real and monetary models (Hool and

Richardson (1981), Richardson (1982), Deardorff and Stern (1980)) suggest the

opposite. At least sometimes the impacts are large. The
                                                           intervening
variables that trade and industrial policy influence
                                                       directly are: effective

of rent—like revenues associated with voluntary export quotas and orderly

marketing agreements; and capital gains and losses on the equity value of

domestic industries. Changes in these variables are what directly and often

significantly affect exchange rates and payments.
