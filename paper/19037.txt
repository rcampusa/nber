                                             ABSTRACT

High and volatile prices of major commodities have generated a wide array of analyses and policy
prescriptions, including influential studies identifying price bubbles in periods of high volatility. Here
we consider a model of the market for a storable commodity in which price expectations are unbounded.
We derive its implications for price time series and empirical tests of price behavior. In this model
commodity price is equal to marginal consumption value, and hence bubbles as defined in financial
economics cannot occur. However the model generates episodes of price runs that could be characterized
as “explosive” and might seem to be bubble-like. At sufficiently long holding periods, a price path
can yield average returns consistent with mean reversion, even though the long run expectation of
price is infinite.

1    Introduction
   Recent volatility of prices of major grains has revealed new interest in under-
standing the price behavior of storable commodities such as grains. A well-grounded
model of a market for a storable staple product subject to random shocks to excess
supply has been available since Gustafson (1958). Its basic logic of inter-temporal
arbitrage is widely accepted, and it can generate price series that have large “spikes”
and “runs” of the type that attract the concern of consumers and policy makers.
However models of this type have been little used in recent analyses of commodity
price ﬂuctuations.
   There are two key reasons. One is the absence of empirical support. For more
than three decades the model could not be seriously tested, due to lack of both
appropriate data and a satisfactory estimation procedure. When a version of the
Gustafson model was eventually tested (Deaton and Laroque 1992, 1995, 1996), it
was roundly rejected due to failure to replicate the high levels of serial correlation
observed in commodity price data. Caﬁero et al. (2011), after solving a problem
of numerical accuracy in the Deaton and Laroque estimation procedure, derived
estimates for several commodities consistent with the observed price correlations.
   A second reason is the common impression that commodity prices can occasion-
ally exhibit bubble-like behavior in which conditional price expectations rise with-
out bound, and that the storage model cannot satisfactorily replicate such behavior.
Recent tests have in some cases detected price “exhuberance” in observations of
sporadic runs of prices of securities rising faster than the rate of interest. Some
authors (for example Phillips et al. 2011) have related such price behavior to for-
mer United States Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Greenspan’s remark in Decem-
ber 1996 regarding “irrational exhuberance” of asset prices. Researchers including
Gilbert (2010) and Gutierrez (2012) have looked for similar behavior in commodity
markets. Others believe that the existence of bubbles in recent grain price data is
obvious only after they “crash.” (Timmer 2009).
   In models in the tradition of Gustafson (1958), (including Samuelson 1971, Gard-
ner 1979, Newbery and Stiglitz 1981, and Wright and Williams 1982), the conditional
expectation of price at far horizons is bounded. In their pioneering model of com-
modity price behavior with responsive supply, Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983,
p.433) presented a model in which, if price at zero harvest is inﬁnite, and zero har-
vest has positive probability, then the long run conditional expectation of price is
unbounded. They inferred that in this case “the model is exactly like an exhaustible
resource model. Since stocks are always held, discounted price must exceed today’s
price by the marginal cost of storage. This seems very unrealistic behavior for the
price of a producible commodity”. Since continuously increasing price is something
not observed in commodity markets (in contrast to price spikes, or price runs that
eventually “crash”), their decision to restrict attention to models in which stocks
carried to the next period are zero so that “mean reversion” occurs when available
supply is below some strictly positive level is understandable.
   Several studies have identiﬁed “mean reversion” variously deﬁned, in commod-
ity prices, adding empirical support to the informal inference of Scheinkman and
2

Schechtman (1983) that the standard model of storage must have occasional ”stock-
outs.” (i.e. periods with zero discretionary stocks).
   After a brief review of the issues regarding consistency of the standard version of
the model with observed time series of prices, we focus on the questions regarding
the capacity of the model to replicate bubble behavior, and mean reversion. We
draw on Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983) and Bobenrieth et al. (2002) to derive
new implications for price behavior, and simulate an example of price realizations in
which the conditional expectation of price goes to inﬁnity. We then establish some
empirical implications for sample averages of returns from time series of prices, and
relate these to ﬁndings of mean reversion.


2     The Model
   In this paper we use a stylized model of a market for a storable commodity such as
a food grain, to reconsider the capacity of storage arbitrage to replicate key features
of commodity price behavior identiﬁed in empirical studies. We model a competitive
market for a single storable consumption commodity such as a food grain in which
time is discrete and all agents have rational expectations, in which the price process
has an invariant distribution similar to that of Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983)
and Bobenrieth, Bobenrieth and Wright (2002). The distribution of the harvest
disturbance can have an atom at its minimum value, here normalized at zero, and
price at zero consumption is inﬁnite.
   Production is subject in each period to a common exogenous i.i.d. disturbance
ω ∈ [0, ω̄], 0 < ω̄ < ∞. The distribution of ω is of the form αLd + (1 − α)Lc ,
where α ∈ [0, 1], Ld is a discrete distribution with a unique atom at 0, and Lc is an
absolutely continuous distribution, with continuous derivative when restricted to its
support [0, ω̄].
   Assume that there is a continuum of identical producers, a continuum of identical
storers, and a continuum of identical consumers; each of the three has total measure
one. There is a one-period lag between the producers’ choice of eﬀort λ ≥ 0 and
output of the commodity ω ′ λ, where ω ′ is next period’s harvest shock. Cost of eﬀort
is given by a function g : R+ → R+ , with g(0) = 0, g ′ (0) = 0, and g ′ (λ) > 0, g ′′ (λ) >
0 for all λ > 0. Storers can hold any non-negative amount of available supply from
one year to the next, and then these stocks are all available for consumption or for
further storage.
   We replace the key assumption of Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983) that the
physical storage cost function is strictly convex and its derivative appears additively
in the Euler equation with the assumption that the physical storage cost function
is zero; the sole cost of storage is the cost of capital invested. Given storage x and
eﬀort λ, the next period’s total available supply is z ′ ≡ x + w′ λ. Producers and
storers are risk neutral and have a common constant discount factor δ ≡ 1/(1 + r),
where r > 0 is the discount rate.
   The utility function of the representative consumer U : R+ → R+ is continuous,
once continuously diﬀerentiable, strictly increasing and strictly concave. It satisﬁes
                                                                                                  3

U (0) = 0, U ′ (0) = ∞.1 The inverse consumption demand curve, with zero income
elasticity, is then f = U ′ .2 We assume U has a ﬁnite upper bound, and thus total
revenue cf (c) is also bounded, and that the expectation of f with respect to Lc is
ﬁnite.3 The perfectly competitive market yields the same solution as the surplus
maximization problem. The Bellman equation for the surplus problem is:


                ν(z) = max{U (z − x) − g(λ) + δE[ν(z ′ )]},            subject to
                          x,λ

                                          z ′ = x + ω ′ λ,
                                  x ≥ 0, z − x ≥ 0, λ ≥ 0,


where E[.] denotes the expectation with respect to next period’s productivity shock
ω′.
   By standard results (see for example Stokey and Lucas with Prescott, 1989), ν is
continuous, strictly increasing, strictly concave, and the optimal storage and eﬀort
functions x(z) and λ(z) are single valued and continuous.
   Consumption and price are given by the functions c(z) ≡ z − x(z), p(z) ≡
f (z − x(z)).

  The storage and eﬀort functions x and λ satisfy the Euler conditions:

(1)       f (z − x(z)) ≥ δE[ν ′ (x(z) + ω ′ λ(z))],          with equality if x(z) > 0,

(2)        g ′ (λ(z)) ≥ δE[ω ′ ν ′ (x(z) + ω ′ λ(z))],       with equality if λ(z) > 0,

and the envelope condition ν ′ (z) = f (z − x(z)).

  Given initial available supply z > 0, if the probability of zero productivity shock,
α, is strictly positive, condition (1) implies that z ′ > 0 and x(z ′ ) > 0, and this
arbitrage condition holds with equality in the current period and for the indeﬁnite
future. When positive, storage x(z) is strictly increasing with z, and eﬀort λ(z) is
decreasing with z. Note that p(0) = f (0) = ∞.
  Deﬁne available supply at time t as zt . Given arbitrary ﬁxed z0 > 0, the function
that yields the supremum of the support of zt+1 is ẑ(zt ) ≡ x(zt ) + λ(zt )ω̄. From
the fact that there exists a unique ﬁxed point z ∗ of ẑ such that ẑ(z) < z for all
1Unbounded     marginal utility implies no substitution in the margin, an assumption which is more
plausible for aggregate rather than for individual food commodities.
2As discussed in footnote 1 of Scheinkman and Schechtman 1983, speciﬁcation of a quasilinear
utility function is one way to incorporate income, in the setting of general equilibrium models that
generate the same set of equilibria as this partial equilibrium speciﬁcation.
3This guarantees that for a model with harvest disturbances with distribution L there is a ﬁnite
                                                                                    c
threshold price above which discretionary stocks are zero.
4

z > z ∗ , we conclude that zt ≤ z̄ ≡ max{z0 , max{ẑ(z) : 0 ≤ z ≤ z ∗ }}, for all t ≥ 0.
Then a suitable state space is S ≡ [0, z̄]. Storage takes values in the set [0, x̄], where
x̄ ≡ x(z̄).


3     Empirical Relevance Revisited
3.1     Failure to match observed high price correlations
   Deaton and Laroque (1992, 1995, 1996) presented empirical tests of the Gustafson
model (1958) using ﬁrst simulations of the model, and then econometric estimates
based on the short available annual time series of prices of a number of commodities.
Deaton (forthcoming, 2012) summarizes their overall conclusion:
   “We have a long-established theory - whose insights are deep enough that some
part of them must be correct - which is wildly at odds with the evidence, and where
it is far from obvious what is wrong [...].”
   Caﬁero et al. (2011) show, ﬁrst, that a version of the Gustafson model with lower
consumption demand elasticity, can generate the high levels of serial correlation
observed in commodity prices. Second, they show that application of Deaton and
Laroque’s (1995, 1996) econometric approach, modiﬁed to improve its numerical
accuracy, using the same data set, yields empirical results that are consistent with
observed levels of price variation and autocorrelation for seven major commodities.
In a subsequent paper, Caﬁero et al. (2012) derive maximum likelihood estimates
that impose no more assumptions than the previous pseudo-maximum likelihood
estimates, for the global sugar market, and obtain even better results.
   Thus we are now in a position to consider the relevance of the Gustafson model for
interpreting and testing recent claims regarding the behavior of commodity prices.
In particular, we address in this paper claims that grain markets display “mean
reversion,” or that they have recently been disrupted by “bubbles” (Gilbert 2010,
Piesse and Thirtle, 2009,Timmer 2009, 2010, Gutierrez 2012), or by “exhuberant”
behavior (Phillips et al. 2011), and by the popular notion that such claims can be
resolved, at least in principle, from observed price behavior.
   The model tested by Deaton and Laroque (1992, 1995, 1996) and Caﬁero et al.
(2011, 2012) assumes linear demand, with stocks that go to zero at a ﬁnite price. To
address questions about mean reversion, speculative runs and related phenomena,
we have adopted a demand speciﬁcation that, if α > 0, does not impose mean
reversion at high prices, and allows for unbounded price expectations.4 Thus our
model is capable of producing behavior that includes conditional expectations of
prices that go to inﬁnity as the horizon recedes, as observed by Scheinkman and
Schechtman (1983). But, is this extension of the model of any empirical relevance
to actual price behavior in commodities such as grains?



4As for the linear case, questions have been raised about the realism of the behavior of prices in
that model.
                                                                                                        5

3.2 Behavior of the model with unbounded conditional price
expectations
   Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983) stated that price behavior when α > 0 and
price at zero consumption is inﬁnite is very unrealistic for a producible commodity,
since it is “exactly like that of a natural resource model in which discounted price
rises by the marginal cost of storage.” Thus we start by considering a case of the
model which is in fact a natural resource model.
3.2.1. The deterministic finite natural resource model
  If α = 1 then our model, which has no storage cost, is the deterministic Hotelling
model of consumption of a ﬁnite resource with unbounded price. Standard results
are that price rises monotonically at the rate of interest, so that discounted future
prices equal the current price. Such price behavior is indeed inconsistent with actual
stochastic evolution of prices for commodities such as food grains. Does this price
behavior generalize to the case in which 0 < α < 1?
3.2.2. The stochastic model with unbounded price expectations
   Intertemporal storage arbitrage implies that, in the model with 0 < α < 1,
{δ pm+t }t≥0 is a martingale and { Em [δ t pm+t ] : t ≥ 0} = pm , where Em [.] denotes
      t

the expectation conditional on the price pm at time m. Indeed the conditional ex-
pectation of price behaves exactly as the price in the deterministic natural resources
model discussed above. But in this stochastic model the price path does not follow
its expectation, contrary to the inference of Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983).
Nor does the statement of Bessembinder et al. (1995 p. 362) that the path of
conditional expectations at diﬀerent horizons “describes several points on the path
that investors expect the spot price will take” hold for this model. To the contrary,
as the horizon recedes, the path of realized prices eventually drifts down and away
from the rising proﬁle of conditional expectations, any fraction of which becomes an
upper bound on that realized path.
   The sequence of probability measures of prices conditional on any initial price
pm converges to a unique invariant measure, uniformly in pm , and consequently the
sequence of discounted prices converges in probability to zero, uniformly in pm .5
   More precisely:

  THEOREM 1: Let α < 1. Given β > 0 and ε > 0, there exists T ∈ N such that
for any price realization pm ,

5If   0 ≤ α < 1, the sequence of probability measures of zt , {γt }∞          t=0 , converges in the total
variation norm to a unique invariant probability γ∗ , regardless of the value of z0 . The idea of the
proof for the case 0 ≤ α < 1 can be found in Bobenrieth, Bobenrieth and Wright (2002). It
follows immediately that the sequence of probability measures of prices {γt c−1 f −1 }∞      t=0 converges
in the total variation norm to the unique invariant probability measure γ∗ c−1 f −1 . Note that
Prob[pt ≥ y] = (γt c−1 f −1 )([y, ∞]), where pt = f (c(zt )) is the price at time t. Ht (y) ≡ Prob[pt ≥ y]
converges uniformly to a unique invariant upper c.d.f. H∗ , with limp→∞ H∗ (p) = 0. If 0 ≤ α < 1,
then the support of the invariant distribution of prices is an interval [p, ∞] with 0 < p < ∞.

                        Prob δ t pm+t < β | pm ≥ 1 − ε, ∀ t ≥ T.


   Theorem 1 implies that for any sample size N ∈ N, given any ﬁnite sequence of
realized initial prices {pm , pm+1 , · · · , pm+N −1 }, we have the following bound on the
joint probability of the gross discounted relative price changes from each initial price
in the sample, beyond a ﬁnite T ′ , where T ′ is independent of the ﬁnite sequence of
initial price realizations:
         [                                                                       ]

             pm            pm+1                    pm+N −1

for all t ≥ T ′ .6

   The existence of a unique invariant distribution which is a global attractor implies
for this price process that, with probability one, the sequence of price realizations
is dense on the support [p, ∞] of the invariant distribution. The inﬁnite sequence of
price realizations visits every neighborhood of every price in the support, no matter
how high, inﬁnitely often, almost surely. Given this fact, the following proposition
regarding discounted prices might not be surprising:

    PROPOSITION 1: Let α < 1. For any given price realization pm , for arbitrary
positive real number D, there exists a horizon d ∈ N, such that:

                           Prob[δ t pm+t > D | pm ] > 0, ∀ t ≥ d.


  For the case 0 < α < 1, the maximum of the support of the conditional distri-
bution of discounted price goes to inﬁnity as the horizon increases, in contrast to
the case for the standard Gustafson model with bounded price, where the maximum
goes to zero. To prove Proposition 1, we need Proposition 2, which might seem
counter-intuitive given Proposition 1.
  For the discussion that follows, given a price realization pm , let Em [.] denote the
expectation conditional on pm .
    PROPOSITION 2: Let α < 1. Given any price realization pm , the sequence of
discounted prices, {δ t pm+t }t≥0 , goes to zero, almost surely (as t → ∞).
    PROOF     OF     PROPOSITION 2: The Euler condition for storage arbitrage (1)
implies that, if α > 0, {δ t pm+t }t≥0 is a martingale and sup { Em [δ t pm+t ] : t ≥ 0 } =
pm < ∞. In the case α = 0, {δ t pm+t }t≥0 is a supermartingale and sup { Em [δ t pm+t ] :
6In the proof, presented in the Appendix, we use the facts that the Markov operator is stable
and quasicompact, and that given any initial price, any neighborhood of inﬁnity, and any integer
k, the price process visits that neighborhood in a time that is some multiple of k, with positive
probability.
                                                                                            7

t ≥ 0 } = p∗ < ∞. In both cases, by the Martingale Convergence Theorem (due to
Doob) we conclude that δ t pm+t → Y a.s. (as t → ∞), where Y is a real random
variable. By Theorem 1, δ t pm+t → 0 in probability (as t → ∞), and hence Y = 0
almost surely.                                                           Q.E.D.
  PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1: For the nontrivial case 0 < α < 1, we prove the
result by contradiction. If not, there exist a price realization pm , a real number
D > 0 and a sequence of natural numbers {tk }k∈N ↑ ∞ with Prob[δ tk pm+tk >
D | pm ] = 0, for all tk . Therefore δ tk pm+tk ≤ D a.s., for all tk . Then the Lebesgue
dominated convergence theorem and the fact that limtk →∞ δ tk pm+tk = 0 a.s. imply
that limtk →∞ Em [δ tk pm+tk ] = 0, a contradiction to Em [δ tk pm+tk ] = pm > 0, for all tk .
Q.E.D.

   If 0 < α < 1, we have that Em [δ t pm+t ] = pm , ∀ t ≥ 0. Nevertheless, Proposition
2 states {δ t pm+t }t≥0 , converges to zero almost surely, implying that {Em [δ t pm+t ]}t≥0
does not converge to the expectation of the almost sure limit of {δ t pm+t }t≥0 . As a
consequence, the sequence of discounted prices is not uniformly integrable.
   Proposition 2 is easy to understand in a model with α = 0, but if 0 < α < 1,
how can the discounted price be going to zero, almost surely, if there is positive
probability that discounted price exceeds D at any suﬃciently far horizon? The
explanation hinges on the distinction drawn above between a proﬁle of expectations
conditional on a price realization and the path of realizations. By Proposition 2,
with probability one, for any given path of discounted price realizations there is a
time beyond which that path is permanently below D. But by Proposition 1, there is
no ﬁnite horizon beyond which all paths possible from date m are below D. In fact,
at any ﬁnite horizon, with positive probability price rises at a rate greater than the
discount rate r, continuously within that horizon. Although any path of discounted
price realizations eventually remains permanently below D, before it does so, it can
exceed any given arbitrary high ﬁnite bound. It is recognition of such a possibility
that keeps Em [δ t pm+t ] equal to pm as the horizon, and the probability that the
discounted price will be below D at that horizon, both increase.
   Proposition 2 implies that, given a price realization pm , the sample mean and
sample variance of a discounted price sequence go to zero almost surely, that is:

                N −1                       ∑

   Thus the estimators are consistent with respect to the ﬁrst two moments of the
limiting distribution of discounted price. For the case 0 < α < 1, the sample average
of discounted price realizations starting at any price realization pm , is eventually
permanently below any arbitrary positive fraction of the proﬁle of expectations,
conditional on pm , of discounted price. Nevertheless the variance of the distribution
of discounted price, conditional on pm , goes to inﬁnity as t → ∞.
   The behavior of the price path is related to the proﬁle of conditional expectations
at time m by the following theorem:
   THEOREM 2: Let 0 < α < 1. Given any price realization pm , with probability
one, for any 1 ≤ l < ∞, there exists a finite time τ (l), which depends on the sequence
of price realizations, such that:

                                    Em [pm+t ]
                                               > pm+t ,           ∀ t ≥ τ (l),
                                        l
implying that

                                       pm+t = o(Em [pm+t ]),           a.s.

    PROOF   OF   THEOREM 2: By Proposition 2, δ t pm+t → 0 (as t → ∞), with
probability one. Therefore, given any l, 1 ≤ l < ∞, there exists a time τ (l) that
satisﬁes δ t pm+t · l < pm = δ t Em [pm+t ], ∀ t ≥ τ (l).                  Q.E.D.

  Theorem 2 deﬁnes a sequence of upper bounds on the path of price realizations.
Note that the proﬁle of conditional expectations Em [pm+t ] is itself an upper bound
beyond some date τ (1). Any given fraction of the proﬁle of expectations conditional
on initial price is an upper bound on any price realized beyond some ﬁxed horizon,
with probability one.

4 Price Behavior in this Model: Do We See Bub-
bles?
   The behavior of price expectations and realizations in the model is illustrated in
the example in Figure 1. At time 0 proﬁle of conditional expectations, E0 [pt ], rises to
inﬁnity at the discount rate. A possible sequence of price realizations is illustrated
as a grey curve beginning at p0 .7 After period 23, all the realizations of price lie
below E0 [pt ]. The curve E0 [pt ]/2 shows another bound at half the price expectations
is eﬀective beginning at date 39. It is obvious that further bounds generated by
successively higher values of l would imply that the long-run rate of increase of
realized price is strictly lower than the discount rate, 4%, even though the storage
arbitrage condition (1) holds, with equality, each period, and that price runs of any
ﬁnite length, understood as sequences of prices rising faster than the interest rate,
recur inﬁnitely often along the path of realizations, almost surely. Figure 2 shows the
logarithms of the same price series, dramatizing the runs of price increases greater
than the rate of interest.
   These ﬁgures show that runs of prices rising for several years at a rate greater than
the rate of interest before crashing, denoted “explosive” by Phillips et al. (2011), and
fulﬁlling the empirical ex post criterion for identiﬁcation of bubbles in grain prices
enunciated by Timmer (2009, 2010), are consistent with our equilibrium model with
rational expectations. In this model, they do not signify the disruptive eﬀects of
irrational speculation, but rather the dampening eﬀect of storage that prevents
sharper price jumps, but with declining eﬀectiveness if low harvests persist.
   Discussions of volatile grain price behavior often raise the issue of price bubbles,
frequently without deﬁning the term. Brunnermeier (2008) includes a key feature
of most deﬁnitions of ﬁnance economists when he states that “Bubbles refer to
asset prices that exceed an asset’s fundamental value because current owners believe
they can resell the asset at an even higher price.” Are price runs characteristic of
price behavior in our model, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, consistent with this
deﬁnition? In our model we have assumed no convenience yield, and the law of
one price holds. In that setting, when storage is positive, the value of a commodity
such as food grain equals its value in consumption, as indicated in the envelope
condition after equations (1) and (2) above. Storage is a one period investment,
so its “fundamental” is the market price, which derives its marginal value from its
value in consumption. Thus in our model bubbles consistent with Brunnermeier’s
deﬁnition cannot occur. In this model, they do not signify the disruptive eﬀects of
rational or irrational speculation, but rather the dampening eﬀect of storage that
prevents sharper price jumps, but with declining eﬀectiveness, during episodes of
repeated low harvests.

5       Some Empirical Implications
  Implications of the model for the empirical behavior of sample averages of returns
on the stocks, held over speciﬁc intervals, are summarized in the following theorem:
     THEOREM 3: Let 0 < α < 1. With probability one, for any given path of
price realizations {pt }t≥0 , for any n ∈ N and for any β > 0, there exist J =
J({pt }t≥0 , n, β) ∈ N, k = k({pt }t≥0 , J, β) ∈ N, k > n, and K = K({pt }t≥0 , k, β) ∈
N, K > J, such that:

             J−1 [ n
             ∑                ]
        −1        δ pt+n − pt
(i) J                                   ∈ (−β, β),
              t=0
                           pt

              J−1 [ k
              ∑                ]
         −1        δ pt+k − pt
(ii) J                                   ∈ (−1, −1 + β),          and
              t=0
                           pt

               ∑[ k
               K−1
                      δ pt+k − pt
                                        ]
          −1
(iii) K                                      ∈ (−β, β).
                t=0
                           pt

                                                                               δ j pt+j − pt
     PROOF OF THEOREM 3: For j ∈ N and for t ∈ N ∪ {0}, let Yt+j ≡                           .
                                                                                      pt
The arbitrage equation for storage (1) implies that there exists p̄ ≥ p(xj (zt )), p̄
depends on zt , such that δ j α1j p̄ = pt , where α1 is the size of the atom at zero of the
distribution of ω, and xj ≡ x ◦ x ◦ · · · ◦ x (j times). Therefore,

                                                               p̄   1
                                             −1 ≤ Yt+j ≤ δ j      = j.
                                                               pt  α1

The arbitrage equation (1) also implies Et [Yt+j ] = 0. It follows that the sequence
                                                       ∑∞
{Xt }t≥0 , where Xt ≡ Yt+j , is uniformly bounded, and     supt |Cov(Xt , Xt−i )| < ∞.
                                                                         i=1
A strong law of large numbers (see Davidson 1994, p.297) implies that

                                 ∑
                                 N −1 [ j             ]
                            −1          δ pt+j − pt
(2)                 lim N                                  = 0,   a.s.
                    N →∞                     pt
                                 t=0


Evaluating (2) for j = n we conclude that there exists J ∈ N such that (i) holds.
For this J, by Proposition 2,
                                             J−1 [ k
                                             ∑                ]
                                        −1        δ pt+k − pt
                                lim J                             = −1,        a.s.,
                                k→∞
                                             t=0
                                                      pt
                                                                                             11

establishing (ii) for large enough k. Finally, evaluating (2) for j = k we obtain
K, K > J, satisfying (iii).                                               Q.E.D.

   Expression (i) of Theorem 3 shows that the average excess rate of return on
stocks held over n periods is greater than a given, arbitrary −β, for a suﬃciently
large sample size J, as implied by a strong law of large numbers.8 Expression (ii)
states that, with the same sample of initial holding dates, if we increase the holding
interval suﬃciently, to k periods, (and increase the sample size by k − n periods to
accommodate the extended lead), the average gross discounted return is within an
arbitrary β of a total loss. At this sample size, the sample average (ii) could be
considered a downward-biased estimator of the expected k−period rate of increase
in price, which in this model is constant. Thus for any sample of prices of any given
length, one can ﬁnd a suﬃciently far horizon such that the estimated average return
can be taken to imply “mean reversion,” as deﬁned for example in Bessembinder et
al. (1995) even if the behavior of prices does not exhibit mean reversion, as in the
stationary model considered here. Expression (iii) reﬂects the fact that the sample
average for the longer holding period approaches the conditional expectation for
that horizon, when the sample size is suﬃciently increased.
   Comparison of results (i) through (iii) has another interpretation, more relevant
for estimation of the long-run return on storage from any given time zero. As the
horizon is increased, the discounted present value of price realizations conditional
on any price pt in the sample of size J in (i) eventually converges, along the path
of realizations, to a neighborhood of zero in ﬁnite time, as stated in Proposition 2.
From this point of view, comparison of (ii) with (i) reﬂects the convergence of the
gross discounted value to its almost sure limit of a one hundred percent loss over
the holding period, as the latter goes to inﬁnity. But (iii) shows an increase in the
average excess rate of return back to an arbitrary neighborhood of the conditional
expectation of zero when suﬃcient observations are added to include some that have
high rates of price increase through the ﬁxed horizon. Note that (iii) does not imply
that an initial investment at time zero can be restored to proﬁtability if held for a
suﬃciently long time.


6     Conclusions
   The remarkable work of Gustafson (1958) introduced a market model that numer-
ically derives the storage demand given consumer demand, yield distribution, cost of
storage and interest rate, assuming maximization of expected proﬁts. The standard
model shows why price distributions tend to be skewed, and why do not closely
reﬂect production shocks. Recent empirical results conﬁrm that it can, contrary
to previous claims, also match the high price correlations seen in annual prices of
major commodities. However the model as presented by Gustafson cannot address

the behavior of prices if their proﬁle of conditional expectations are unbounded, as
in some models of speculative behavior.
   Here we consider an extension of the Gustafson model, introduced in Scheinkman
and Schechtman (1983) and addressed by Bobenrieth et al. (2002), in which price
expectations are unbounded, and derived its implications for price time series and
empirical tests of price behavior. We present versions of the model that exhibit price
behavior that could be characterized as “explosive” or “exhuberant” with episodes
of price runs that might be identiﬁed as “bubbles.” In this model, conditional price
expectations go to inﬁnity as the horizon recedes, consistent with stationary be-
havior. This behavior is indistinguishable from that produced by a version of the
standard model with bounded conditional price expectations, so a test to establish
that price is unbounded is infeasible.
   The stationary price process that we have examined reveals the importance of dis-
tinguishing any given proﬁle of conditional price expectations from the path of price
realizations. The rate of increase of any proﬁle of conditional price expectations in
our model is constant at the discount rate, while beyond some future period the path
of realized prices lies permanently below the proﬁle of expectations conditional on
the current price. Returns on storage are returns consistent with “mean reversion”
at suﬃciently long holding periods, even though the long run expectation of price
is inﬁnite.

where µt is the probability measure of the price at time m + t, conditional on pm .
Furthermore,

where µ∗ is the invariant probability measure of the price process and | · | denotes the total
variation norm.
   The transition probability of the price process satisﬁes, with respect to the point ∞,
what is called in Futia a Generalized Uniqueness Criterion (Futia, 1982, p.390). In ad-
dition, the corresponding Markov operator L is stable and quasicompact (Theorems 4.6
and 4.10 in Futia, 1982, p.394 and p. 397). Using Theorem 3.6 in Futia (1982, p.390),
and Theorem 4 in Yosida and Kakutani (1941, p.200), we obtain the following conclusion:
independent of pm , there exist constants M > 0, η > 0, such that :
                                                        M
                           ||(L∗ )t − L∗1 || ≤                   ∀ t ∈ N,
                                                     (1 + η)t
where L∗ is the adjoint of the Markov operator L, L∗1 is a continuous linear operator, the
image of which consists precisely of the ﬁxed points of L∗ , and || · || is the operator norm.
Therefore, if δpm denotes the unit point mass at pm , then :
                                                                  M
        |µt − µ∗ | = |(L∗ )t (δpm ) − L∗1 (δpm )| ≤ ||(L∗ )t − L∗1 || ≤   ∀ t ∈ N.
                                                               (1 + η)t
                                                                ([       ])
Finally, since µ∗ has no atom at inﬁnity, we have that limt→∞ µ∗ δβt , ∞     = 0.
