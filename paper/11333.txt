Banker Fees and Acquisition Premia for Targets in Cash Tender Offers: Challenges to the

                                             ABSTRACT

We analyze data on fees paid to investment bankers and acquisition premia paid for targets in cash

tender offers. Our results are broadly consistent with the predictions of a benign view of the role of

investment banks in advising acquisition targets. Fees to investment banks are correlated with

attributes of transactions and target firms in ways that make sense if banks are being paid for

processing information. The more contingent (and, therefore, risky) the fees, the higher they tend to

be, all else held constant. Variation in acquisition premia also can be explained by fundamental deal

attributes. Contrary to the jaundiced view of fairness opinions, greater fixity of fees is not associated

with higher acquisition premia, and there is no evidence that investment banks are suborned by

acquirors with whom they have had a prior banking relationship.

1.      Introduction

        Investment banking practices recently have become the subject of intensifying

scrutiny from regulators and the investment community, each of which has raised

questions concerning the efficacy of certain advisory services offered by investment

banks – specifically, fairness opinions. This scrutiny largely has been based on anecdotal

observations.1 This article provides empirical evidence germane to those questions. We

explain why and how fairness opinions are rendered, and how target companies pay

investment banks for this advisory service. We explore potential incentive problems

associated with the structure of investment banker fees and other potential conflicts of

interest on the part of the investment banker from an empirical perspective. In so doing,

we construct a new database on firm and deal characteristics for friendly, two-step cash

acquisitions. Our data measure characteristics of target firms and transactions, fees paid

to investment bankers, and premia paid to shareholders of the target company in

connection with the acquisition, and explore the connections among these variables to

cast light on this neglected area of corporate finance.

        We consider empirical implications of the views expressed by both the critics and

the defenders of investment banking practices relating to the provision of fairness

opinions. We analyze the determinants of investment bank fees and acquisition premia.

We find no evidence in support of the view that the typical investment bank fee structure

engenders conflicts of interest detrimental to the target shareholders. Nor do we find any


1
  See, e.g, Wall Street Journal, December 29, 2004 summarizing the popular criticisms leveled at fairness
opinions and observing that the investment banks that render the fairness opinion are often the advisors
who arranged the transaction in the first instance and whose fees depend on the successful consummation
of the transaction. See also Bebchuk and Kahan (1989) noting that fairness opinions are “problematic”
because investment banks have “substantial discretion in rendering such opinions” and the conflicts of
interest faced by the investment bank “lead them to use their discretion to render pro-management fairness
opinions.”


                                                                                                         2
evidence consistent with the view that bank advisory services to target firms are

adversely affected by pre-existing business relationships between bankers and would-be

acquirors. Furthermore, our analysis of variation in fees and acquisition premia indicates,

among other things, that (1) the variation in fees paid to investment banks by target firms

reflects differences in the fundamental costs of valuing targets, and (2) the variation in

acquisition premia paid to target shareholders reflects target and transaction

characteristics. With respect to the latter, target characteristics include volatility,

leverage, and possibly other transaction characteristics that are less significant

statistically, including the existence of employment contracts entered into by acquirors to

retain target firm management (which are associated with higher acquisition premia).2



         1.1      What is a fairness opinion? Why and how are they rendered?

         When a public company is the target in an acquisition scenario, the target

company’s board of directors commonly will engage the services of a financial advisor –

generally, an investment bank. In connection with this retention, the board of directors of

the target company and the investment bank execute an engagement letter. The

engagement letter delineates, among other things, (a) the services the investment bank

will provide to the board of directors on behalf of the target company in connection with

a proposed transaction and (b) the amount and terms of payment of the fee for such

services.

         Typically, one of the services offered by an investment bank is an opinion as to

the fairness to the target shareholders, from a financial point of view, of the transaction


2
  Our paper does not address the effects of “golden parachutes” that the target company had in place prior
to consummation of the transaction.


                                                                                                             3
proposed to be undertaken by the target board of directors (a “fairness opinion”).

Fairness opinions share several important characteristics. First, the fairness opinion is

issued in the form of a letter addressed to the target board of directors and is filed as an

exhibit to the relevant Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings made by the

target in connection with the proposed transaction. Second, the fairness opinion is dated

as of the date it is rendered to the target board of directors (generally the date the target

board of directors holds its meeting to vote on the proposed transaction) and speaks only

as of such date with no duty (unless the engagement letter specifically provides

otherwise) on the part of the investment bank to update (“bring-down”) the opinion to a

later date. Third, the fairness opinion speaks only to the fairness of the transaction from

“a financial point of view” and does not (a) opine that the consideration to be received by

the target shareholders in the proposed transaction represents the highest or best price

available; (b) address the merits of the transaction or the decision of the board of

directors of the target to proceed with the transaction, relative to other possible business

strategies; or (c) assume any responsibility for independent verification of the publicly

available information respecting the target or the information furnished by the

management of the target to the investment bank in connection with its valuation.

Finally, the fairness opinion addressed to the target board of directors expressly states

that it does not constitute a recommendation to the target shareholders with respect to the

actions necessary to be undertaken by such shareholders for the consummation of the

proposed transaction.

        Despite the lack of any legal imperative, virtually all boards of directors of public

target companies secure fairness opinions before proceeding with a transaction. The




                                                                                                4
basis of securing such fairness opinions is traced by many back to the Delaware Supreme

Court’s decision in Smith v. Van Gorkom, 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985). Under the

reasoning of Van Gorkom and state statutory authority, including Delaware (8 Del. C. §

141(e)) providing that boards of directors may rely on professional opinions of others

assuming such reliance is reasonable, the fairness opinion may serve as evidence that the

board of directors has fulfilled its fiduciary duty of care in assessing the financial terms

of the proposed transaction.



       1.2     How do targets pay for fairness opinions?

       The fee paid by the target company to the investment bank in connection with a

tender offer may be found in Item 5 of the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on

Schedule 14D-9 (“Schedule 14D-9”) filed by the target with the SEC. The fee to be paid

to the investment bank frequently is (a) expressed as a percentage of the overall value of

the transaction (defined as the value paid by the acquiror for the equity of the target plus

the value of the liabilities assumed) and (b) payable upon the consummation of the

transaction (referred to herein as a “Contingent Fee”). In certain instances, the target

board of directors may agree to pay the investment bank a fee irrespective of whether the

transaction is consummated, which fee would typically represent a small portion of the

total fee payable if a transaction were consummated, but may on occasion be the only fee

payable to the investment bank. These non-contingent fees may be in the nature of a

retainer fee payable either upon execution of the engagement letter or over a period of

months during which the investment bank is retained by the target (a “Retainer Fee”) or

an opinion fee payable when the investment bank is prepared to render a fairness opinion




                                                                                               5
with respect to the proposed transaction (an “Opinion Fee”). The Retainer and Opinion

Fees collectively will be referred to herein as “Fixed Fees.” As noted above, as a

percentage of overall transaction value, Fixed Fees generally are much smaller than

Contingent Fees and accordingly, an investment bank earning a Contingent Fee stands to

make considerably more fee income if the transaction is consummated. Contingent Fees

are often referred to in the investment banking industry as “Success Fees.” In certain

instances where the engagement letter provides for a Fixed Fee in addition to the

Contingent Fee, the Fixed Fee (to the extent previously paid to the investment bank) may

be creditable against the Contingent Fee.

       There are three common forms of Contingent Fee arrangements: (1) contingent

payment expressed as a constant percentage of the overall transaction value (a “Constant

Percentage Fee”); (2) contingent payment expressed as an aggregate dollar amount that

does not vary based on the size of the transaction (“Constant Dollar Fee”) and (3)

contingent payment expressed as a sliding scale percentage based on the size of the

transaction (“Variable Percentage Fee”). In the sale of a target company, the most

common form of Contingent Fee is the Constant Percentage Fee. The Variable

Percentage Fee is less common and generally limited to smaller or private company

transactions. The Constant Dollar Fee is a more common fee arrangement for the

investment banker to the acquiror inasmuch as, the acquiror may not wish to “reward” its

investment banker in the form of a higher cash fee as the purchase price to be paid by the

acquiror increases.

       Investment banker fees in merger and acquisition transactions are highly

negotiable. As we will show in Section 2 below, fee amounts vary considerably. An




                                                                                           6
investment bank may “pitch” its services to the target board of directors based on, among

other things, the investment bank’s M&A experience both generally and in the target’s

industry. M&A “league tables” ranking investment banks based on their participation in

announced M&A transactions over a given period are often employed for this purpose.

Ultimately, the target board of directors will pay the investment bank based on the target

board’s perception of the value the investment banker will deliver to the board of the

target in connection with the transaction. 3          In this regard, the then co-head of global

mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse First Boston observed, “It is not just the deal

assignments per se, but the quality of your role that is driving your fees.” Wall Street

Journal, December 11, 2003.



         1.3      Contingent fees: conflict or alignment of interests?

         The fact that investment banks typically are paid the bulk of the fee upon

consummation of a transaction has been criticized by some observers as potentially

giving rise to a conflict of interest between the investment bank and its client - the target

board of directors. According to what we will call the “jaundiced” view of Contingent

Fees, making fees contingent on consummation of the transaction (and by extension the

rendering of a fairness opinion as a de facto pre-condition to consummation of a

transaction) encourages the investment banker to “do what it takes” to opine favorably as

to the fairness of the proposed transaction, in order to receive contingent compensation.




3
 See also comments of a former general counsel of an investment bank observing that the banker’s fee
“exorbitant or reasonable” is the product of many factors, including size and importance of the transaction,
and “the benefits the company-client perceives or, with persuasion, can be made to perceive it is receiving.”
Panel Discussion Chaired by Arthur H. Rosenbloom (Spring 1991).


                                                                                                           7
       In determining whether to address this concern from a regulatory perspective, on

November 11, 2004, the NASD issued Notice to Members 04-83-Request for Comment

on Whether to Propose New Rule That Would Address Conflicts of Interest When

Members Provide Fairness Opinions in Corporate Control Transactions (“NASD Notice

04-83”). In response to the NASD’s request for comment on the proposal, one prominent

activist institutional investor observed that the contingent fee structure creates a “very

large incentive for an investment bank to find that a transaction is fair regardless of the

circumstances, when the bank will receive the bulk of its fee only if the transaction is

successful” (Response of California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CALPERS),

dated February 1, 2005 to NASD Notice 04-83). Another response cast doubt on “how

any board of directors can rely on a fairness opinion provided by an investment bank

when the lion’s share of that bank’s fee is contingent on the underlying transaction

closing.” (Response of American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial

Organizations (“AFLCIO”), dated January 10, 2005 to NASD Notice 04-83).

       Additional causes for concern about the objectivity, and therefore, the utility of

fairness opinions have been raised. For example, an investment bank may favorably

opine on an otherwise financially inadequate offer based on a desire to please the would-

be acquiror of the target because the ultimate acquiror of the target will be in a position to

offer the target’s investment banker additional fee generating transactions. Moreover, the

existence of a pre-existing relationship between the would-be acquiror and the target’s

investment bank further could serve to cloud the objectivity of the investment bank as it

renders its fairness opinion.




                                                                                              8
          Despite the foregoing, there are powerful arguments that weigh against what we

have called the “jaundiced” view of fairness opinions. According to the alternative

“benign” view, Contingent Fees that are proportional to the value of the acquisition serve

to align the incentives of the investment banker with its client since the higher the price

paid by the acquiror the higher the fee received by the investment bank. Accordingly,

investment banks have an incentive to advise against accepting financially inadequate

offers if the investment banks are able to share in the gains produced by accepting higher

offers.

          Furthermore, the critical positions expressed by CALPERS and the AFLCIO,

while commonly echoed by commentators and the popular press, fail to take into account

other important practical considerations. First, experience shows that the Contingent Fee

structure typically is the preferred structure chosen by target boards of directors, who

should seek to align the interests of the investment banker with those of the shareholders

(See Response of each of The Association of the Bar of the City of New York (the

“ABA”), dated February 1, 2005 and Securities Industry Association, dated February 1,

2005 to NASD Notice 04-83).

          Second, investment banks bear reputational and legal risks when offering fairness

opinions. An investment bank that routinely opines favorably on an otherwise financially

inadequate offer will find it hard to attract future clients, and runs the risk of lawsuits.

          Third, an otherwise financially inadequate transaction that collapses under

shareholder opposition after the fairness opinion is rendered (generally at the meeting of

the board of directors where the board votes on whether to proceed with the proposed

transaction) will generate no contingent fees for the investment banker.




                                                                                               9
         Finally, the fact that the publicly observed fairness opinions are typically

favorable ignores the unobservable but real world iterative process involved in rendering

a fairness opinion and does not imply that favorable opinions are rendered with that same

high frequency. The head of mergers and acquisitions at a major law firm framed the

issue plainly stating that “[t]he reason you don’t see unfairness opinions is that those

deals won’t get done.” Wall Street Journal, January 24, 2005. In practice, if the banker

is having difficulty reaching a favorable conclusion as to the fairness of the transaction

from a financial point of view, the banker will alert the board to this fact in advance of

the board meeting and “those transactions are typically either renegotiated or abandoned

[and] [f]or obvious reasons, this occurs much more frequently than is generally known or

apparent.” (Response of the ABA, dated February 1, 2005 to NASD Notice 04-83).



         1.4    “Testing” the jaundiced and benign views of fairness opinions.

         Our empirical analysis does not purport to construct a full-blown structural model

of investment banker fees or target acquisition premia. Instead, we perform simple

means comparisons and regression analyses to measure whether patterns of association in

the data appear to be more consistent with the implications of the benign or the jaundiced

views.

         We focus on six categories of empirical implications of the benign and jaundiced

views of fairness opinions, as set forth below.

         First, according to the benign view, the amount of fees paid to the investment bank

should reflect the difficulty of processing information about the target necessary for the

bank to form a view as to the valuation of the target and the likelihood of an ultimately




                                                                                             10
successful sale transaction. Consequently, according to the benign view, investment

banker fees should increase with attributes of the firm or the transaction that make it

inherently more difficult to make such an assessment of the target. Those information-

cost attributes include the (a) timing of the transaction (e.g., targets in industries whose

stock performance exceeds the broader market are easier to sell); (b) attributes of the

target (e.g., firms perceived by the market to be high risk are harder to value); and (c)

prior relationship between the target and the investment bank (e.g., firms well-known to

the investment banker are easier to value).

       Second, according to the benign view, transactions that are perceived to be more

complicated to complete (involving multiple bidders or an auction process) should

command a higher fee.

       Third, according to the benign view, because of the risks borne by investment

bankers from Contingent Fees, the greater the proportion of the fee that is contingent, the

greater the amount of the fee.

       Fourth, according to the benign view, acquisition premia reflect the franchise

value of the target, including both its tangible and intangible assets.

       Fifth, according to the jaundiced view, transactions where a greater proportion of

investment banker fees are fixed (as opposed to contingent) should, on average, display

higher acquisition premia (since, according to the jaundiced view, Contingent Fee

structures encourage investment banks to permit otherwise financially inadequate deals to

go forward).

       Sixth, according to the jaundiced view, a prior relationship between the

investment bank and the acquiror should result in a lower acquisition premium, holding




                                                                                               11
other factors constant. In contrast, according to the benign view, the acquisition premium

should reflect the fundamental attributes of the target and the transaction, not the

structure of the investment banker fee or any prior relationship between the investment

bank and the acquiror.

        The remainder of our paper explores these six implications of the benign and

jaundiced views, first from the perspective of simple differences in means, and second,

from the perspective of regression analyses. Section 2 discusses the construction of our

dataset, the definitions of the variables employed in our analysis, and summary statistics.

Section 3 presents our regression findings. Section 4 concludes.



2.     Data

       2.1     Sample

       We examine transactions in excess of $100 million in value, which were

announced between 1994 and 2002 and completed, where the consideration was solely

cash, and where the acquisition was effected pursuant to a friendly, two-step transaction.

We focus on cash transactions because in such situations the evaluation of the

consideration received by the target shareholders is clearly known ex ante. In a cash

transaction the target shareholders will not share in any of the “upside” of the ultimate

merger as could be argued they would in the case where the target shareholders receive

stock of the acquiror.

       A friendly, two-step transaction is a transaction approved by the target board of

directors pursuant to a first-step tender offer (wherein the acquiror tenders for all, or a

number of target shares sufficient for the acquiror to effect a subsequent merger of the




                                                                                              12
target into an acquisition subsidiary of the acquiror, whereby the target becomes a wholly

owned subsidiary of the acquiror), and a second-step merger between the target and the

acquisition subsidiary. We focus on friendly, two-step transactions because that structure

generally minimizes the time from announcement to consummation of the transaction.

The greater speed of consummation reflects the fact that the acquiror does not need target

shareholder approval for the second-step merger. This feature of friendly, two-step

transactions obviates to a great extent the potential concern over the “staleness” of an

investment banker’s fairness opinion at the time the target shareholders tender their

shares pursuant to the offer.

       The transactions in the sample were identified based on information set forth in

the database of Securities Data Company (“SDC”). To be included in the sample, the

transaction needed to satisfy the following criteria:

(1) The transaction was announced between 1994 and 2002 and completed.

(2) The target was a U.S. public company.

(3) The transaction value was in excess of $100 million.

(4) The consideration paid to the target shareholders pursuant to the tender offer

consisted solely of cash and the transaction was effectuated pursuant to a friendly two-

step deal.

(5) The transaction was not a (a) “going private transaction” within the meaning of Rule

13e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (b) management buy-in or

management buy-out or (c) leveraged buy-out.

(6) The target company had the following SEC filings available on Edgar: (a) Schedule

14D-9; (b) Schedule 14F and (c) Proxy Statement for the regularly scheduled annual




                                                                                           13
meeting of the target shareholders for the most recent meeting of target shareholders

before the consummation of the transaction.

       All calculations of the fee payments to the investment banker were based on the

fee information reported in Item 5 of the target company’s Schedule 14D-9 and SDC

data. The acquisition premia for the 170 transaction observations were as reported by

SDC and calculated as the per share offer price for the target equity divided by the stock

price of the target four weeks prior to the announcement of the transaction minus one.

       Application of the above selection criteria yielded a sample of 170 transactions.

For each of the transactions so identified, information on a number of attributes of the

transaction was obtained, as described in the Table [2.1]. Table [2.1] also provides the

labels for the regressors used in the tables that report summary statistics in the remainder

of Section 2, and in the investment bank fee (IBFEE) and acquisition premium

(ACQPREM) regression models reported in Section 3.

        2.2 Summary statistics

        We divide the summary statistics into three categories of variables, which are

organized by transaction value: (1) information about investment banker fees (IBFEE)

and acquisition premia (ACQPREM) are described in Table [2.2a]; (2) target

characteristics appear in Table [2.2b]; and (3) transaction characteristics are reported in

Table [2.2c].

        In Table [2.2a], the mean IBFEE is higher for smaller transactions. That finding is

consistent with Calomiris and Himmelberg (2004), and others, who find that investment

banking fees for securities offerings tend to be higher for smaller, riskier firms, and also

reflects a minimum fee charged by investment bankers on any transaction. Inasmuch as

in the acquisition context the fee is expressed as a percentage of transaction value, higher




                                                                                              16
  Fee Dollar Amount increases with transaction size. While the mean ACQPREM varies

  by target category, its standard deviation is much lower for the largest target categories.

          Table [2.2b] shows that the largest transactions understandably involve the largest

  firms, and that the volatility of stock price returns tends to be lower for the largest firms.

  Large firms also tend to show fewer transactions where block shareholders other than

  officers and directors own large stakes in the firm, a fact that reflects the higher costs of

  foregoing diversification when holding a substantial share of a large firm. Across most

  categories of transaction value targets tended to be in industries whose stocks generally

  performed at least as well as the broader market, with the smallest firms exhibiting the

  lowest standard deviation.

          Table [2.2c] reports transaction characteristics of targets. In 102 of the 170

observations, either an auction was employed or multiple indications of interest were

received (ModeSale=1). Clearly, in many cases there are multiple potential bidders for a

target. That fact is significant for our analysis since, as discussed in Section 1, the

potential for more than one bidder gives the investment banker receiving a Contingent

Fee a greater incentive not to render a fairness opinion with respect to an otherwise

financially inadequate offer. In 31 of the 170 transactions, the opinion of the investment

bank indicated that the investment bank did not solicit additional bids (NoSolicitation=1).

Notes: N=1 indicates transaction observations possessing characteristic noted and N=0 indicates transaction
observations lacking characteristic noted. In the case of FixedFee_Pct and Fixed_Pct_ExAnte, N=1 is the 53
observations with the highest FixedFee_Pct and N=0 is the 65 observations with zero fixed fees. Fixed_Pct_ExAnte is
calculated as the ratio of the fixed part of investment bank’s fee relative to the total fee, assuming that the acquisition
value equals the pre-acquisition value of the target plus the sample average acquisition premium.

        Some deal attributes are associated with economically large differences in mean

acquisition premia shown in Table [2.2c.], but only one of these differences is highly

significant statistically. Transactions in which target managers entered into an

employment contract with the acquiror in connection with the transaction display higher

acquisition premia (61.14% compared with 48.80%). This mean difference is statistically

significant at the 2.8% level (for a one-tailed test). In contrast, differences in mean

acquisition premia in transactions in which target managers received a bonus payment

from the target company (other than golden parachute payments) related to successful

consummation of transaction are neither economically large (57.21% compared with

54.17%) nor statistically significant. Greater target shareholder support as evidenced by

the existence of a shareholder agreement is associated with a higher acquisition premium

(57.95% compared with 49.20%), but this mean difference is less statistically significant

(at the 8.3% level for a one-tailed test).

        The FixedFee_Pct variable is defined as the percentage of the target investment

banker’s fee that is not contingent on the outcome of the transaction. Details regarding

the distribution of this variable appear in Table [2.2d], which divides the sample

(roughly) into three terciles according to the degree of fixity of the fee (65 firms with no

fixity, and the remaining 105 firms divided into 52 middling-fixity firms and 53 high-

fixity firms). Transactions in the upper tercile of the fixity of investment banker fees (the

top 53 firms measured according to FixedFee_Percent) tend to show lower acquisition

premia, but this difference relative to the mean for firms with zero fixity is not

statistically significant. Differences in mean acquisition premia related to prior

relationships between the investment bank and the target or acquiror are not statistically




                                                                                           19
significant and in the case of the existence of a prior relationship with the acquiror the

mean acquisition premium difference is less than 2.0%.

         The statistically insignificant mean difference for FixedFee_Percent is opposite in

sign to the difference implied by the jaundiced view, and we can think of no explanation

for this observed difference. When we redefine the FixedFee_Percent variable using an

ex ante measure (i.e., Fixed_Pct_ExAnte, which removes the effect of unanticipatedly

high acquisition premia on the measured ratio), the difference in the means is

substantially reduced.4 That finding indicates that the statistically insignificant difference

in acquisition premia for deals with different FixedFee_Percent reported in Table [2.2c]

may reflect correlation by construction, given that the denominator of the

FixedFee_Percent variable is a positive function of the acquisition premium.

         The simple differences in means shown in Table [2.2c] do not control for other

attributes of targets or transactions (something we explore in the regression analysis in

Section 3), and they are not necessarily indicative of causal relationships. Nevertheless,

despite these limitations, the facts about mean differences suggest two important things:

(a) on average, greater fixity in investment banker fees is not associated with higher

acquisition premia (contrary to the jaundiced view), and (b) there are interesting patterns

of association relating transactions and target characteristics to IBFEE and ACQPREM.

Section 3 explores those patterns of association in the context of simple regression

analyses.

3.       Regression Analysis

         In Section 1.4, we developed six testable implications of the benign and jaundiced

views. In Section 3, we construct simple regression models of IBFEE and ACQPREM to

investigate those implications. Table 3.1 summarizes the six implications on which we

focus.




                                                                                        22

       3.1     Determinants of the Investment Banker Fee (IBFEE)

       In constructing a simple model that explains cross-sectional variation in IBFEE,

we take into account various proxies for the influences referred to in the first three rows

of Table [3.1]. Regression results are reported in Table [3.2].

       The definition of the dependent variable in Table [3.2] is a transformed version of

IBFEE, which we label IBFEE_EXANTE. This transformation of IBFEE uses the

expected transaction value for the target rather than the actual transaction value in the

denominator of the fee percentage calculation. The expected transaction value simply

adds the sample average of the acquisition premium (55%) to the pre-acquisition equity

value of the target and adds the result to the implied book value of the target debt to

arrive at the expected transaction value. This transformation avoids spurious inferences

about association between IBFEE and the regressors, which could result from a

correlation between the error term in IBFEE (related to unpredictably high premia) and



                                                                                            23
the regressors. As discussed in Section 2, the percentage of fixed fee should be similarly

adjusted to avoid spurious correlation; consequently, Fixed_Pct_ExAnte is the regressor

used to capture the degree of fixity of fees. We also ran the same regressions as reported

in Table [3.2] without making these two ex ante adjustments and obtained very similar

results.

           With respect to the first hypothesis in Table [3.1], as proxies for information cost

specific to the target firm, we included firm asset size (modeled using a quadratic

functional form), the volatility of stock price returns, leverage, and whether the target had

a prior fee producing relationship with the investment bank. IBFEE should be higher for

targets that are small firms, firms with higher returns volatility, highly leveraged firms,

and firms that have not had previous contact with the investment bank. PeerBroad is

included to capture the effects of hot markets for a particular industry’s targets. We

anticipated that IBFEE should be lower for target’s in industries where the industry is

outperforming the broader market.

           With respect to the second hypothesis, NoSolicitation is included, and we expect

it to enter with a negative sign. That is, when an investment bank’s engagement does not

entail the solicitation of additional bidders, the fee charged by the investment bank should

be lower.

           With respect to the third hypothesis, FixedFee_Percent is expected to display a

negative coefficient. Note that the variable included in the regression is

Fixed_Pct_ExAnte rather than FixedFee_Percent. Fixed_Pct_ExAnte calculates the

fixity percentage of the fee based on the expected transaction value rather than the actual

transaction value for the target.




                                                                                              24
         We also included IBOtherBus(Acquiror) in the IBFEE_EXANTE regression, and

IB_Rank, to investigate whether fees are related to the rank of the investment bank or the

relationship between the acquiror and the target’s investment bank. To measure IB_Rank,

we constructed a league table ranking for each investment bank. Banks were assigned a

rank (one through 20 with lower rankings associated with a greater participation by the

bank in announced M&A transactions) based on the individual bank’s rank in announced

M&A transactions as reported by Investment Dealers Digest. Banks that did not appear

on the Investment Dealers Digest league table for a given year were assigned a rank of

20. The rank so assigned for each year was then averaged over the three year period

based on the three years prior to the announcement of the transaction.5

         We report five regression specifications in Table [3.2]. Our results for the IBFEE

regressions support all three of the predictions of the benign view, although not all the

variables included are highly statistically significant.

         Consistent with hypothesis one (the benign view), when evaluated over the range

of our sample, asset size (in its quadratic form) is negatively related to investment

banking fees. A similar result has been reported by McLaughlin (1990) in her work on

investment banking contracts in tender offers. McLaughlin analyzed all fees in tender

offers for all types of transactions and for fees paid to target firm bankers over the period

January 1980 to December 1985. McLaughlin reported (1) a mean fee as a percentage of

transaction value of 0.77 with a standard deviation of 0.63, and (2) a mean fee expressed

in dollars of $4.21 million with a standard deviation of 2.50. Consistent with our findings

5
  Sixteen observations in the sample reported multiple advisors to the target. In these instances the average
of the advisor ranks was used and the fee was based on the fee paid to all investment banks. In certain of
these sixteen observations an advisor may have been retained to render only an opinion – what has been
recently referred to as a “second opinion.” See Wall Street Journal, January 24, 2005. We ran our
regression results removing these sixteen observations and obtained very similar results.


                                                                                                          25
in Table [3.2], McLaughlin also observed substantial cross-sectional variation in each

category of offer value suggesting that there is substantial negotiation involved between

the banker and the target firm in setting the fee. In other words, size is not the only

characteristic that matters; the banker does not use a simple “rate card” such as the so-

called “Lehman formula” wherein the fee is determined solely by a decreasing step

function of the value of the transaction (e.g., 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% of various

increments in transaction value).

        Similarly, leverage and volatility enter positively in the fee regression. Other

business between the target and the bank has a negative effect on the fee, as predicted,

but this effect is not highly statistically significant (with a significance level of roughly

12 percent). PeerBroad enters negatively, as predicted, and is highly statistically

significant.

        Consistent with hypothesis two (the benign view), NoSolicitation enters

negatively. Consistent with hypothesis three of the benign view, the degree of fixity of

the fee is negatively related to the size of the fee, reflecting the compensation received by

investment bankers in the form of a higher fee when their fee is riskier (i.e., more

contingent).

        IBOthBus(Acquiror) is small, negative, and statistically insignificant. IB_Rank is

negative and statistically significant. Consistent with our expectation, an investment

bank with more transaction experience (a lower rank) in the M&A field is able to

command a higher premium for its services, all other factors held constant.

       3.2     Determinants of the Acquisition Premium

       In constructing a simple model that explains cross-sectional variation in

ACQPREM, we take into account various proxies for the influences referred to in the last

three rows of Table [3.1], as well as a variety of control variables that previous literature

suggests may be relevant for explaining acquisition premia. Regression results are

reported in Table [3.3].

       With respect to hypothesis four (benign view) in Table [3.1], we include

EmpContr to measure the extent to which there is perceived franchise value to the target

associated with the acquiror’s decision to contract to retain target management.

       With respect to hypothesis five, we include Fixed_Pct_ExAnte. According to the

jaundiced view, more fixity avoids conflicts of interest, and therefore, should result in

higher acquisition premia, all else held constant.

       With respect to hypothesis six, IBOthBus(Acquiror) should enter negatively,

since according to the jaundiced view, investment banks might be suborned by their

contacts with acquirors, resulting in lower acquisition premia for targets.

       We also include several other control variables. Controls that were not included in

the fee regressions include measures of the concentration of stock ownership, which we

thought might be relevant for acquisition premia (since greater concentration might

improve the bargaining power of target shareholders). Similarly, we include a dummy

variable for the presence of a voting agreement between the acquiror and target

shareholders, which should also reflect greater target bargaining power.

       With respect to hypothesis four, EmpContr enters positively and is large

economically, but it is not highly statistically significant (with a significance level




                                                                                            28
ranging between 12 and 15 percent). The Bonus variable, in contrast, is negative and

statistically insignificant. Recall that EmpContr reflects the existence of a contractual

agreement between the acquiror and target management, while Bonus reflects a payment

from the target to its management in connection with the consummation of the

transaction. These results indicate that payments to management, per se, do not affect

shareholder value, but that payments to retain management are possibly value-increasing.

This finding provides some support for the view that acquisition premia reflect, in part,

the value of intangible assets of target firms. This finding also suggests that target firm

shareholders may share in the gains that accrue to target management from preserving

value-creating managerial capital.

       Neither of the two jaundiced-view hypotheses (five and six) receives support from

the regression analysis of ACQPREM. Both the degree of fixity of the investment

banker’s fee, and the existence of a prior fee-producing business relationship between the

acquiror and the target’s investment bank, are unrelated to the acquisition premium.

       Controls for volatility and leverage both entered positively in the acquisition

premium regression. These variables could proxy for many influences (e.g., growth

opportunities, more disciplined management) and are not amenable to clear

interpretation. Interestingly, while none of the controls for target bargaining power

(including the composition of shareholders, and the ShrhAgt variable) prove to be highly

statistically significant, ShrhAgt and Non-O/D_w/5% are both positive and sometimes

significant at levels of 13 or 14%, and the coefficient on ShrhAgt is large.

       ModeSale proved insignificant. Of course, that does not imply that increased

competition has no effect on the acquisition premium. Rather, it may be explained by




                                                                                              29
noting that ModeSale is an endogenous variable. The desire on the part of the target to

receive multiple bids itself results from an expectation that doing so will improve the

outcome, and that improvement will be larger for some firms than for others. That

endogeneity may have the effect of reducing the measured effect of ModeSale on the

acquisition premium in our regressions; that is, ModeSale may be more likely to be

positive when the target’s acquisition premium without ModeSale would be particularly

low.

       Similarly, the fact that IBFEE_Res does not enter significantly in the ACQPREM

regression should not be interpreted as evidence that spending more on investment

banking services is worthless. IBFEE is a highly endogenous variable. As in the case of

ModeSale, its insignificance in the ACQPREM regression can be explained by the

supposition that firms with large unexplained investment banking costs have

unobservable attributes (i.e., information problems) that encourage them to spend more.

4.     Conclusion

       Our investigation of investment banking fees for fairness opinions and acquisition

premia is the first empirical analysis of friendly, two-step, cash acquisitions during our

period of which we are aware. Our study is largely descriptive and we do not purport to

produce a structural estimation of the determinants of investment banking fees or

acquisition premia.

       Nevertheless, our results are broadly consistent with the predictions of a benign

view of the role of investment banks in advising acquisition targets. Fees to banks are

correlated with attributes of transactions and target firms in ways that make sense if

banks are being paid for processing information. The more contingent (and, therefore,

risky) the fees, the higher they tend to be, all else held constant. Variation in acquisition

premia also can be explained by fundamental deal attributes. For example, acquisition

premia are higher when the target’s leverage and volatility are higher, and (possibly)

when the acquiror contractually seeks to retain target management. Contrary to the

jaundiced view of fairness opinions, greater fixity of fees is not associated with higher

acquisition premia, and there is no evidence that investment banks are suborned by

acquirors with whom they have had a prior banking relationship.
