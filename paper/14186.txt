                                                ABSTRACT

The growing prominence of high-stakes exit examinations has made questions about their effects on
student outcomes increasingly important. We take advantage of a natural experiment to evaluate the
causal effects of failing a high-stakes test on high school completion for the cohort scheduled to graduate
from Massachusetts high schools in 2006. With these exit examinations, states divide a continuous
performance measure into dichotomous categories, so students with essentially identical performance
may have different outcomes. We find that, for low-income urban students on the margin of passing,
failing the 10th grade mathematics examination reduces the probability of on-time graduation by eight
percentage points. The large majority (89%) of students who fail the 10th grade mathematics examination
retake it. However, although we find that low-income urban students are just as likely to retake the
test as apparently equally skilled suburban students, they are much less likely to pass this retest. Furthermore,
failing the 8th grade mathematics examination reduces by three percentage points the probability that
low-income urban students stay in school through 10th grade. We find no effects for suburban students
or wealthier urban students.

   The Consequences of High School Exit Examinations for Struggling Urban Students:

                                 Evidence from Massachusetts


I. Introduction

       As part of standards-based educational reforms introduced over the past two decades,

many states have implemented exit examinations that students must pass in order to earn high

school diplomas. Advocates argue that such examinations create incentives for students to work

at learning important cognitive skills. By certifying that high school graduates have mastered the

state-defined academic content standards, the examinations may also increase the economic

value of a high school diploma (Evers & Walberg, 2002). Opponents of these tests suggest that

they put unnecessary stress on students and encourage them to drop out of high school. They also

argue that such tests place the greatest burden on the very groups who are already struggling in

the educational system, such as low-income and special needs students (Thomas, 2005; Jones,

Jones, & Hargrove, 2003). Because high school graduation is associated with many positive life

outcomes, the question of how high-stakes testing affects high school completion rates is

important to educational policymakers.

       While past research has focused primarily on the overall effects of imposing high-stakes

accountability on aggregate student outcomes, we look at the consequences of exit examinations

on individual students within a high-stakes testing regime. Capitalizing on a natural experiment,

we examine the causal impact of failing the statewide 10th grade mathematics examination on the

probability of on-time high school graduation. The natural experiment stems from the state’s

practice each year of determining a minimum passing score, thereby dividing a continuous

performance measure into two categories – pass and fail. We use a regression discontinuity

methodology to examine the consequences of being assigned to each of these categories for
students of similar proficiency near the cutoff. Our data come from Massachusetts, a state that

has earned a national reputation for rigorous content standards and English Language Arts (ELA)

and mathematics assessments that are well aligned to the standards, and whose students have

made substantial progress under standards-based reform. Thus, we examine these effects for

students under an existing high-stakes accountability system.

       An exit examination can prevent students from graduating from high school in three

ways: fear of failing may cause them to drop out before taking the test; failing the examination

may cause them to drop out before re-taking it; and failure to pass even after multiple attempts

may prevent graduation. We refer to these mechanisms as Fear of Failure, Discouragement, and

Repeated Failure. We conduct a variety of analyses to explore the extent to which each of these

mechanisms affects academically struggling students.

       We find that, for equally able low-income, urban students near the cutoff, failing the 10th

grade mathematics exit examination – as opposed to passing it – reduces the probability of on-

time graduation by eight percentage points. In contrast, failing the test does not reduce the

probability of on-time graduation for wealthier urban students or suburban students on the

margin of passing. Thus, the combination of low family income and urban schooling makes

students particularly susceptible to the effects of failing. Importantly, we cannot distinguish here

between a negative effect of failing the examination and a positive effect of passing it – students

who fail the test may be disappointed with their performance and drop out of school, while

students who pass may be encouraged and persist in school. Regardless, the practice of dividing

students with essentially the same ability into two categories by this dichotomous cut score has

an impact on student outcomes; this effect poses an important challenge for urban districts.

       Furthermore, for a typical low-income urban student on the margin of passing the 8th




                                                                                                   2
grade mathematics examination, failing that test also reduces the probability of persisting

through 10th grade by three percentage points, providing some evidence that Fear of Failure may

play a role in students’ decisions. Interestingly, we find that failing the 10th grade ELA

examination does not affect the probability of graduation for low-income urban students on the

margin of passing.

       We supplement these causal conclusions with descriptive analyses that explore possible

sources of these effects for urban students with low family income. Here, we focus on students

who fail the mathematics exit examination when they first take it at the end of grade 10,

exploring their persistence and success on retests. At each retest opportunity, more than 80% of

students who fail continue to retake the test. Massachusetts students show remarkable

persistence, but relatively few students exhaust all of their retest opportunities. Instead, of the

students who fail and never pass the examination, nearly two-thirds stop taking retests and drop

out of school, presumably because their poor test performance has discouraged them. Here, we

find important differences for urban, low-income students compared to their suburban peers.

Among students with the same initial test scores, low-income urban students who fail the

statewide mathematics examination at the end of the 10th grade are just as likely as suburban

students to retake the test, but they are much less likely to pass on retest. Differences in

academic support could explain this pattern.

       In Section II, we provide a brief discussion of standards-based reforms, their

development in Massachusetts, and past research on the effects of high-stakes testing. In Section

III, we explain our data sources, measures, and analytic strategy. Here, we justify our ability to

make causal claims from these data. In Section IV, we detail our main findings. In Section V,

we perform several sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of our results. We conclude with




                                                                                                      3
a discussion of our findings and the questions they raise for policy-makers.



II. Background and Context

Standards-Based Educational Reforms and High-Stakes Testing

       In the years since the 1983 publication of A Nation at Risk, the standards-based reform

movement has gained momentum and exerted substantial influence on state and federal

education policy. While the details of these reform efforts vary greatly from state to state,

common components include specification of content standards in core academic subjects and

regular testing to monitor student progress toward mastering these standards. In addition to

developing accountability structures for schools, many states have begun attaching consequences

for students to their performance on the state-wide examinations. Currently, 25 states have or are

phasing in examinations, typically in English language arts (ELA) and mathematics, that high

school students must pass in order to graduate (Center on Education Policy, 2007). In most

states, including Massachusetts, students first take these exit examinations as 10th graders.

Students who fail typically have multiple opportunities to retake the examination before

graduation.

       Critics of high-stakes examinations argue that they may lead some students to drop out of

high school (Thomas, 2005; Jones, Jones, & Hargrove, 2003). A 1999 National Research

Council report cites qualitative work suggesting that “graduation tests pose no threat to most

students, but, among those who fail them, they increase a sense of discouragement and contribute

to the likelihood of dropping out” (Heubert & Hauser, p. 175). Any policy that causes students to

drop out of school has substantial consequences because high school graduation remains a

gateway into better paying jobs and post-secondary education. Employers recognize and reward




                                                                                                 4
the skills that college graduates possess, especially the ability to engage in non-routine problem-

solving and to communicate effectively (Levy & Murnane, 2004). Because it causes students to

complete less education, dropping out also reduces students’ quality of life in a variety of

dimensions, including reduced health, wealth, and happiness (Oreopoulos, 2007), increased

criminality (Lochner & Moretti, 2004), and increased mortality rates (Lleras-Muney, 2005).

       Given the importance of high school completion and the possible negative consequences

of high-stakes testing, many scholars have explored whether exit examinations reduce graduation

rates. This work has taken two main forms: some researchers have examined the effect of

imposing high-stakes testing on aggregate student outcomes, while others have focused on the

relationship between an individual student’s performance on the test and that student’s

probability of graduating in states with high-stakes testing regimes.

       Much early work examining aggregate outcomes used correlational evidence; Clarke,

Haney, & Madaus (2000) review this literature and conclude that “high stakes testing programs

are linked to decreased rates of high school completion.” Exploiting variation in exit examination

policies across states and/or over time, some recent work provides at least tentative support for

these correlational conclusions (Reardon & Galindo, 2002; Warren, Jenkins, & Kulick, 2006;

Nichols, Glass & Berliner, 2006). In contrast, Carnoy & Loeb (2002), Greene & Winters (2004),

and Carnoy (2005) find no relationship between state accountability policies, including high

school exit examinations, and high school completion rates. Some recent work suggests that

exploring aggregate patterns may obscure heterogeneity in effects for different groups of

students. Dee and Jacob (2006) find increased dropout rates only for urban and minority

students, while Jacob (2001) finds similar patterns only for the lowest achieving students.

       Research that examines the relationship between individual student performance on exit




                                                                                                    5
examinations and high school completion remains much less common. Using data from the

Florida Minimum Competency Test from 1987-91, Griffin & Heidorn (1996) find a relationship

between student performance and drop-out rate only for students with high GPAs. While the

authors control for selected student characteristics, the results cannot be interpreted causally

because it is likely that students who fail the examination differ from those who pass in critical

unobserved dimensions. Griffin & Heidorn also focus on the impact of a minimum competency

test, which differs substantially from the current incarnation of state-mandated high school exit

examinations. Cornell, Krosnik & Chang (2006) examine a group of students who were wrongly

informed that they had failed the Minnesota high-stakes examination. Most of these students

reported some negative academic impact of “failing” this test.

       Martorell (2005) provides causal estimates of the effect of failing a high school exit

examination on high school graduation, using a regression discontinuity analysis similar to the

one we employ in this paper. He finds no effect of failing the Texas exit examination on high

school graduation for students who barely failed. This finding holds for every examination until

the very last administration of a student’s senior year. As students run out of testing

opportunities, failing the examination does prevent them from graduating because they cannot

satisfy state requirements.

       We do not address the overall consequences of standards-based accountability in

Massachusetts. Instead, like Martorell (2005), we look at how this policy plays out in a state

committed to standards-based reform. In other words, we look at the effects of dividing a

continuous measure of student proficiency into two categories – pass and fail – at an arbitrary cut

score. We extend Martorell’s research in several respects. Most importantly, we look for (and

find) heterogeneous causal effects. In Massachusetts, examining only aggregate impacts masks a




                                                                                                     6
substantial effect for low-income urban students; as a result, we focus our analyses on this group.

Second, we examine additional mechanisms by which exit examinations may decrease high

school graduation, including the possibility that students drop out even before taking the 10th

grade test. Third, we conduct descriptive analyses that shed light on the sources of the

heterogeneous causal impacts. Finally, we make use of data from a state quite different from

Texas.

The Massachusetts Context

         In the 15 years since the Massachusetts legislature passed the Massachusetts Education

Reform Act of 1993, the state has invested more than one billion dollars per year in additional

funding for K-12 public education. These investments have borne considerable fruit. For

example, a 2006 study by the Fordham Foundation praised the Massachusetts academic

standards as the most rigorous in the country (Finn, Julian, & Petrilli, 2006). 1 A 2006 report by

Education Week concluded that the state-wide tests used to assess the English language arts and

mathematical skills of Massachusetts students (part of the Massachusetts Comprehensive

Assessment System (MCAS)) were well aligned with the state’s demanding academic standards.

While this report gave an average grade of B- to the standards and accountability systems

developed by states, it gave the Massachusetts system an A (Quality Counts, 2006).

         Most importantly, Massachusetts students are doing well and have improved markedly on

the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) examinations in recent years. In 2007

1
    This same Fordham Foundation report, The State of State Standards 2006, pointed out that the

Massachusetts standards were exceptional. In contrast, “two-thirds of schoolchildren in America

attend class in states with mediocre (or worse) expectations for what their students should learn”

(Finn, Julian, & Petrilli, 2006).



                                                                                                     7
Massachusetts’ 4th graders ranked first nationwide on the NAEP reading and mathematics tests

and second nationwide on the writing test. The state's 8th graders ranked first in mathematics,

tied for first in reading, and third in writing on the NAEP tests (NCES, 2008). Furthermore,

since the introduction of state testing under standards-based reform, the state’s NAEP

performance has improved rapidly. As Figure 1 shows, Massachusetts 8th graders not only far

exceed the national average, but their performance has increased much more rapidly than the

national average. Thus, it is in the context of a system that has brought about significant

accomplishments that we examine the consequences for students of failing the MCAS

examination.

                                     FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE

          Massachusetts began administering the MCAS mathematics and ELA examinations in

1998. For the class of 2003, the 10th grade tests became high-stakes exit examinations. Students

must pass both tests in order to receive a high school diploma. 2 The state allows students to take

the tests without time constraints and to retake them repeatedly if they fail, attempting explicitly

to make the MCAS as minimal a barrier to graduation as possible. 3 Critics, however, claim that

even with these safeguards, the examinations do indeed prevent students from graduating.

2
    As the state imposed high stakes on the MCAS for students, student performance has risen

dramatically. The overall passing rate jumped from 49% to 68% in the year of the policy shift.

Currently, 87% of students pass the test. The state estimates that this effect represents

approximately a 0.5 standard deviation increase in student test performance simply as a result of

imposing the requirement to pass (Conaway, personal communication, 2008).
3
    The state has a performance appeals process in place that allows students to demonstrate their

proficiency in alternate ways. It also offers alternative assessments to certain students. Only 314



                                                                                                       8
        Of the nearly 70,000 students who took the 8th grade mathematics examination in 2002,

76% went on to graduate on time in Massachusetts in 2006. We can partition those students who

did not graduate on time into two groups – those who did not persist to take the 10th grade

examination (9%) and those who took the 10th grade test but did not graduate two years later

(15%). Thus, most students who did not graduate left the system after taking the 10th grade

examination. We focus first on this population and return to the group who dropped out before

10th grade later in the paper.

        That students who passed the 10th grade MCAS examination on their first attempt

graduate at greater rates than students who fail is not surprising – all students must pass the test

to graduate. Of the 66,347 students in the 2006 graduating cohort who took the 10th grade MCAS

mathematics examination for the first time in 2004, 87% passed on their first try. However,

students who failed faced substantial risk of dropping out: only 50% of them went on to graduate

on time, compared to 90% of the students who passed.

        While striking, this descriptive pattern does not confirm that the exit examinations pose a

barrier to graduation. A student’s MCAS scores are associated with a variety of other

characteristics, such as academic proficiency, motivation, and access to educational resources,

that also affect their probability of graduation. As a result, we would expect students who fail the

examination to drop out at greater rates, even in the absence of any testing requirement. The

direct relationship between MCAS score and the graduation rate among students who did pass

the 2004 test provides evidence for this conclusion. Among these students, 73% who just passed




of the state’s 57,000 graduates in 2006 satisfied the requirement using either of these two

alternative routes.



                                                                                                       9
graduated on time, compared to 98% of students with a perfect score. 4 Thus, a challenge in our

current study involves disentangling the effects of failing the examination from the effects of

student ability and other background characteristics related to test performance.

         Conceptually, we would like to take students who scored identically, right at the pass/fail

cut score, and randomly assign them to either a “pass” or a “fail” condition. This assignment

process would render them equivalent in expectation on all observable and unobservable

characteristics prior to treatment, allowing us to identify any differences in the ultimate outcome

(high school graduation) as a causal effect of simply failing the examination, rather than of

earning lower scores. Such an experiment is, of course, both impossible and unethical. However,

we can take advantage of the state’s exogenous imposition of a minimum passing score to

provide a natural experiment from which we can draw equivalent causal conclusions. By

examining students with nearly identical MCAS performance, but just on either side of this

exogenously-assigned cutoff, we can interpret any differences in their graduation outcomes as

the causal effect of failing the examination for these students “on the margins” of passing

(Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002).

Research Questions

         We first examine the effect of failing the 10th grade examination, paying particular

attention to impacts on low-income, urban students. We then attempt to explore the Fear of

Failing effect that may arise as students predict they will not pass the 10th grade test and drop out

4
    For scores above the passing standard, the estimated correlation between the raw MCAS

mathematics score and the proportion of students who graduate on time is 0.965, suggesting a

very strong positive linear relationship between MCAS performance and probability of on-time

high school completion.



                                                                                                  10
before even taking it. We cannot identify this effect cleanly, but we can get some sense of its

magnitude by examining student performance on the 8th grade test. Finally, we look at students

who fail their 10th grade test, examining their persistence and success on retests. We explore

whether students who fail and drop out do so because of Discouragement (students give up and

drop out after failing one or more of the examinations) or through Repeated Failure (after

exhausting the available retest opportunities, students still have not satisfied the testing

requirements). Specifically, we address three primary research questions:

       RQ1. Does failing the high school exit examination as a 10th grader make students on the

             margin of passing less likely to graduate from high school on time?

       RQ2. Among students who fail the 10th grade exit examination and do not graduate, is the

             primary mechanism one of Discouragement or Repeated Failure?

       RQ3. Does failing the 8th grade test cause students on the margin of passing to drop out

             before taking the 10th grade examination?



III. Research Design

Data Sources

       The Massachusetts Department of Education has compiled a comprehensive database that

tracks students longitudinally throughout high school, allowing for clear description of student

graduation outcomes. For the 2006 graduating cohort, the records contain each student’s MCAS

mathematics and ELA test results, demographic characteristics, and status at cohort graduation,

including whether the student graduated, dropped out, is still enrolled, transferred out, was

expelled, or any of eleven possible outcomes. This dataset allows for much more precise

estimation of the probability of high school completion than do previous studies, and it permits




                                                                                                   11
investigation of the direct link between student performance on high-stakes tests and graduation

outcomes at the individual level.

          Our dataset includes 83,892 student records from across the state of Massachusetts. To

analyze the effect of failing the 10th grade examination (our first research question), we focus on

members of the 2006 graduating cohort who first took the 10th grade mathematics MCAS

examination as sophomores in 2004 and for whom the examination was a high-stakes test. This

sample includes students who entered the state between 8th and 10th grade and consequently

missed the 8th grade examination. Our final sample for addressing the first research question

includes 66,347 students. 5 For our third research question, we use the 69,127 students in the

same cohort who took the 8th grade mathematics examination. This sample includes students

who dropped out of school before 10th grade.



Measures

          To address our first research question, we created a dichotomous outcome variable,

named GRAD, that indicates whether the student graduated from a Massachusetts high school in

Massachusetts in 2006 (1=graduated on-time in Massachusetts; 0 otherwise). Districts report the

values of individual student graduation outcomes to the Department of Education using the

state’s Student Information Management System (SIMS). Note that students can be coded as zero

5
    The state identifies slightly fewer than 3,000 students (less than 5% of the total sample) who

are not in the “final 2006 cohort,” meaning that they moved out of the state before high school

graduation. Using only the 63,361 individuals in the “final cohort” does not alter our results. We

include the full sample to account for any effects the high-stakes examination has on student

mobility.



                                                                                                     12
either for dropping out of school, for moving out of state before graduation, or for continuing in

high school without graduating. In Section V, we explore the sensitivity of our results to this

outcome definition. We created several additional outcome variables for the descriptive analyses

that we used to address our second research question. For students who failed the examination,

we created dichotomous outcomes that indicate whether the student retook the test (RETAKE)

and whether they passed this retest (RETAKE_PASS). Finally, to address our third research

question, we created another dichotomous outcome measure, named TAKE10th, that indicates

whether a student who took the 8th grade mathematics examination persisted in school to take the

10th grade test (1=persisted to take the test; 0 otherwise).

          The dataset contains a record of scores from every MCAS mathematics and ELA

examination that each student took from 8th grade 6 through high school graduation. The state

reports raw scores, scaled scores, and performance level for each test. A scaled score of 220

qualifies as passing, with a different performance rating each 20 points, as follows: (a) 200 to

218: Failing, (b) 220 to 238: Needs Improvement, (c) 240 to 258: Proficient, and (d) 260 to 280:

Advanced. Since multiple raw scores translate to a single scaled score, we use raw scores in our

analyses in order to preserve fine-grained performance differences on the test. 7 For the 10th grade

mathematics examination, raw scores ranged from 0 to 60; students who earned more than 20

    Technically, students took the middle school ELA examination in 7th grade and the

mathematics examination in 8th grade. For simplicity, we refer to these examinations as the “8th

grade” tests.

points passed the test. 8 To implement our regression discontinuity approach, we centered

students’ raw scores by subtracting out the value of the corresponding minimum passing score.

On these re-centered continuous predictors, MATH and ELA, a student with a score of zero had

achieved the minimum passing score. We also created a dichotomous predictor, PASS, to

indicate whether the student passed the examination (1=student passed; 0 otherwise).

          The dataset also includes the values of several key control predictors, such as student race

and gender as well as dichotomous variables indicating whether the student was classified as

limited English proficient (LEP), special education (SPED), low-income (LOWINC), attending a

high school in one of Massachusetts’s 22 urban school districts (URBAN), or appearing in the

10th grade sample without an 8th grade test score (NEWSTUDENT). 9 Each of these indicators is

coded 1 for those who belong to the category, and 0 otherwise. Overall, 26% of the students

attended urban schools and 28% of students were identified as low income. Low-income students

tended to cluster in urban schools: 63% of urban students lived in poverty, compared to just 16%

of suburban students.

Data Analyses

          We address our first and third research questions by conducting identical regression

discontinuity analyses with the relevant outcome variable. We describe below the analyses that

we use to address our first research question, which concerns the impact of just failing the 10th

8
    For the 8th grade mathematics test, students had to score 22 points to pass, and for the 10th

grade ELA examinations the minimum passing score was 39.
9
    Some of these students moved into the state after 8th grade, while others simply had missing 8th

grade test scores. Because we cannot distinguish between these two groups, we cannot interpret

this variable as a pure indicator of new students to the state.



                                                                                                    14
grade mathematics examination on the probability of on-time high school graduation. To explore

whether just failing the 8th grade mathematics test reduces persistence to 10th grade (our third

research question), we replace outcome GRAD by outcome TAKE10th.

          Under conditions that we discuss below, we can analyze data from our natural experiment

– using the regression discontinuity strategy first proposed by Thistlethwaite & Campbell (1960)

– to make such causal inferences for students at the margins of passing. 10 Because the

probability that a student passes the examination goes unequivocally from zero to one at a single

cut score, the discontinuity is sharp.

          The internal validity of our regression discontinuity analyses – and consequently our

ability to make unbiased causal inferences about the impact of exit examinations – relies on

several critical assumptions about the relationship between student MCAS score and graduation.

Later in the paper we describe our efforts to verify that these assumptions are fulfilled. If so, the

magnitude of the discontinuity in the outcome provides an unbiased estimate of the causal impact

of failing the examination for students at the cut score. Thus, we obtain an estimate of the

average treatment effect for students on the margin of passing.

          We estimate the effect of failing the examination as a difference in the probability of on-

time graduation between students scoring at the cutoff who just passed ( γ pass ) and just failed

( γ fail ). 11 In our analyses, we use observations above the cut score to estimate γ pass and

observations below the cut score to estimate γ fail . Because we do not know the precise

functional form of the relationship between MCAS score and the probability of graduation, we

     Technically, γ pass =      lim         [P(GRADi   = 1) | MATH i ]   and γ fail =      lim        [P(GRADi   = 1) | MATH i ]

model this continuous relationship using a nonparametric smoothing process to estimate γ pass

and γ fail . A further complication arises as our parameters of interest – γ pass and γ fail – are

estimated at boundary points. As standard nonparametric smoothing strategies have poor

boundary properties, Hahn, Todd, & Van der Klaauw (2001) recommend estimating these limits

with local linear regression. 12

        Our implementation of nonparametric smoothing using local linear regression follows

closely the recommendations of Imbens and Lemieux (2007). 13 We conduct our nonparametric

smoothing within a linear probability specification of the standard regression discontinuity

design. Specifically, at each MCAS score point, we estimate a linear regression function using

only observations within a narrow bandwidth, h, around the point to predict the probability of

graduation for each observation. As we move this bandwidth through our data range, we

therefore generate locally predicted values at each MCAS score point; linking these estimates

together creates the requisite smoothed nonparametric regression line. Here, the extent of the

smoothing depends on the choice of bandwidth, h. Because we can only make causal claims

about the effect of failing for students at the cut score, in our later analyses we focus attention on

the single locally-linear regression analysis that centers on the cut score and estimates γ pass

and γ fail . In this regression, then, we use only observations within bandwidth h on either side of

the cut score, as follows: 14


12
   Fan (1992) shows that, unlike most nonparametric smoothing techniques, local linear
regression does not require boundary modifications.
13
   Ludwig and Miller (2007) use a similar strategy. Our approach differs in our choice of a
rectangular rather than a triangular kernel for the non-parametric smoothing; however, Imbens &
Lemieux (2007) argue that “more sophisticated kernels rarely make much difference” (p. 16) and
instead recommend assessing robustness to different bandwidth choices, as we do in Section V.
14
   We estimate robust (Huber-White) standard errors to account for both the clustering of
students within schools and heteroscedasticity in the dichotomous outcome.


                                                                                                     16
        p (GRADi = 1) = β 0 + β1 MATH i + β 2 PASS i + β 3 (PASS i × MATH i ) + ε i     (1)

for the ith individual. While our nonparametric smoothing approach does not, by definition,

return parameter estimates, 15 we can interpret the estimates from this single locally-linear fit in

(1); these estimates represent the instantaneous slopes and intercepts for students at the cut score.

In this model, parameter β 2 = γ pass − γ fail represents the causal effect of passing the 10th grade

MCAS mathematics examination on the population probability of on-time high school

graduation for students at the cut score. If its estimated value is statistically significant and

positive, then we know that classifying a student as passing the high-stakes test at the cut score,

as opposed to failing it, causes the student’s probability of graduating from high school to

increase discontinuously.

        Our nonparametric procedure requires that we choose a suitable bandwidth, h, for the

smoothing procedure and consequently for defining the region around the discontinuity in which

we fit and interpret the model in (1). In our analyses, we select an optimal bandwidth, h*, using

all of our data by applying the cross-validation procedure described by Imbens & Lemieux

(2007). Essentially, this procedure determines the bandwidth that minimizes the mean squared

error in the predicted boundary points, leading to an optimal tradeoff of bias and precision for the

estimation of γ pass and γ fail . 16 In our analyses, we obtain an optimal bandwidth of between four


15
   For example, the overall relationship between MCAS score and probability of graduation
cannot be represented by a single slope throughout the data range.
16
   In other words, we determine a predicted probability of graduation (GRˆ ADi (h)) for each
observation i using only observations within h points to the left of MCASi for students who failed
and to the right of MCASi for students who passed the examination. We determine the mean
squared error of these predictions across the entire sample. We then systematically vary the
bandwidth, h, choosing as h* the value of h that minimizes this mean squared error. More
formally, h* = arg min 1 ∑ (GRˆ ADi (h) − GRADi ) 2 . Because our ultimate objects of interest are

and six raw score points depending on the model specification, as indicated below. However, in

sensitivity analyses described in Section V, we show that our main conclusions are robust to the

choice of bandwidth.

       We extend this simple model in several ways. First, we include a vector of selected

student background covariates (Xi) to improve precision and to eliminate small sample biases

that result from including observations not immediately at the cut score (Imbens & Lemieux,

2007). Second, because our primary outcome is a dichotomous predictor that indicates whether

the student graduates from high school on time, we replicate our analysis by specifying the

probability of on-time high-school graduation as a logistic function of predictors. Here, we limit

our analysis to those observations that fall within a narrow window around the cut score. For

consistency with our earlier nonparametric smoothing, we choose a window whose width

extends the optimal bandwidth of h* on either side of the cut score. Again, we systematically

vary this window width in Section V in order to test the robustness of our findings. 17

       Finally, we also examine the impact of test failure on high school graduation for

particular groups of students, including urban students from low-income families. We do this in

two ways. First, we add all possible interactions between predictors PASSi, MATHi, LOWINCi,

and URBANi, up to and including the four-way interaction among the predictors, to our

regression equation in (1). Second, we fit separate regressions for each subgroup. As we find

nearly identical results, we present this more parsimonious approach. Again, our main results


in the tails from the cross-validation determination. As data are less dense in the tails, including
these observations may lead to over-smoothing. As a result, we eliminate the 10% of the
observations on either side of, and most remote from, the cutoff.
17
    In preliminary analyses, we investigated whether higher-order non-linear polynomial
specifications of MATH score were required within the logistic model, including quadratic and
cubic polynomial specifications. These specifications did not lead to improvements in model fit,
within the narrow regression discontinuity window that we have selected for the analysis, and so
we present results from the more parsimonious linear specification here.


                                                                                                  18
here derive from a single local linear regression analysis that incorporates only observations

within an optimal bandwidth, h*, on either side of the cut-off.

       For two reasons we focus on the statistically significant impact of just passing/failing the

MCAS mathematics test on high school graduation for low-income urban youth. First, the

educational challenges facing these students have received national attention. Consequently,

understanding the impact of high-stakes testing on the academic prospects for struggling low-

income urban students is especially relevant to educational policy formulation. Second, the data

currently available to us are insufficient to support exploration of other interesting questions,

such as the effect of just failing the 10th grade MCAS test on urban special education students.

We plan to examine additional subgroup effects in future research after we have increased our

sub-sample sizes by pooling data across multiple graduation cohorts.

       To address our second research question, we conduct analyses in which we explore why

failing the 10th grade MCAS mathematics test reduces the probability of high school graduation

for low-income urban students, but not for their wealthier or suburban peers. However, we

interpret these results only descriptively because the additional analyses cannot support unbiased

causal inference. In these descriptive analyses, we explore patterns of test-taking persistence and

success for students who fail, in order to see whether low-income urban students are less likely

than wealthier or suburban students to retake the examination or to pass their first retest. Here,

we fit probit models of the following form on the sample of students who failed the 10th grade

mathematics examination:

      RETAKEi = β 0 + β1 (URBANi × LOWINCi ) + β 2URBANi + β 3 MATHi + β 4 ELAi

for the ith student. 18 In our model, our principal research interest focuses on the parameter sum,

β1+β2, which represents the difference between low-income urban students and suburban

students in the probability of retaking the test. By including mathematics and ELA test scores

and whether the student passed the ELA examination in the model, we explicitly compare

students with the same proficiency on both the mathematics and ELA examinations.

       We conduct similar analyses to examine retesting success, replacing the outcome

RETAKEi with RETAKE_PASSi. One challenge with this approach involves the differential

effects of measurement error on retest success for low-income, urban students and their suburban

peers who fail. 19 For these analyses, we use a truncated sample that generates estimates of retest

success conditional on having failed the examination. Because the passing score is further at the

tail of the distribution for suburban students than for urban, low-income students, 20 suburban

students who fail are more likely than low-income, urban students to have performed so poorly

on the test merely by chance. As a group, then, suburban students who fail are likely to do better

mechanically on the retest than low-income, urban students, regardless of any increase in true

proficiency. In other words, truncating our sample to focus on students who failed their first

examination induces a correlation between the error term and our indicators of group

membership, preventing us from obtaining unbiased estimates of β1. Simulation results,

presented in Appendix A, confirm that suburban students will outperform low-income, urban


18
   In preliminary analyses, we found that low-income and wealthier suburban students were
indistinguishable from one another in terms of their probability of retaking the examination or of
passing their first retest. By omitting the main effect of dichotomous predictor LOWINCi from
the hypothesized model, we implicitly treat all suburban students, regardless of family income,
as the reference group.

students on the retest mechanically, without any difference in true proficiency. As recommended

by Hanushek & Rivkin (2006), we resolve this issue by exploiting the fact that the mathematics

and ELA test administrations occur on different days and measurement error on the two tests is

uncorrelated. Given the strong correlation between mathematics and ELA performance, we use

10th grade ELA scores to instrument for 10th grade mathematics scores and adopt a two-stage

least squares estimation strategy. This approach breaks the link between measurement error and

group membership. Simulation results suggest that this approach successfully resolves the issue

(see Appendix A).



IV. Findings

(1) Effect of failing the high-stakes exit examination on high school graduation

       Passing the 10th grade MCAS mathematics examination increases the probability that a

low-income, urban student on the margin of passing will graduate from high school on-time by

eight percentage points (p=0.015). Given that 26% of low-income, urban students who just pass

the exam do not graduate on time, this effect is quite substantial. We find no such effects for

wealthier urban students or for suburban students, regardless of family income. Thus, it is the

interaction of low family income and an urban environment that appears to render students, on

average, more susceptible to the effects of failing. In Table 1, we present parameter estimates

and approximate p-values from our local linear regression analyses using observations that fall

within our “optimal” window of h* on either side of the cut score. Models 1a and 1b present our

findings for all students from equation (1), with time-invariant student demographic controls, by

subgroup.

       To interpret the estimates presented in Table 1 more easily, we present the fitted

nonparametrically smoothed relationship between graduation and MCAS mathematics score for

low-income urban students from our preferred specification in Figure 2. 21 For these low-income

urban students at the margin, passing the examination substantially increases their subsequent

probability of graduation. Visually, this effect appears as an interruption in the underlying

smooth relationship between the probability of graduation and the MCAS mathematics score at

the cut score. For perspective, we have included the sample mean probabilities of on-time

graduation at each MCAS score level.

                                    FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE

       The effects for wealthier urban and suburban students are not statistically significant.

However, the point estimates indicate that wealthier students on the margins of passing who just

fail have a slightly greater probability of on-time graduation than students who just pass. This

seemingly counterintuitive pattern could stem from efforts by schools with ample resources to

focus attention on the relatively few students with failing MCAS scores. Recent research by Neal

and Schanzenbach (2007) lends some support for this claim; the authors find that, in the Chicago

Public Schools, teachers face and respond to incentives to focus instruction on students who

seem likely to improve their performance on the high-stakes examination.

(2) Persistence and success in retesting among students who fail

       Overall, the 8,269 students who failed the mathematics MCAS on their first try in 2004

showed remarkable persistence in retaking the examination. Nearly 89% took the examination at

least one more time and, of these students, 68% went on to pass the test at some point in high

21
   We can also recover the fitted relationship between graduation and MCAS mathematics score
for the three other categories of students (wealthier urban, low-income suburban, and wealthier
suburban). However, as our analyses show no effects on these groups, we decide to focus on the
relationship for low-income urban students.


                                                                                                   22
school. On average, students who never passed the examination retook it twice before giving up.

As the sample histogram in Figure 3 illustrates, on each retest, approximately 35% of the

students passed. Among those who failed each retest, most students (85 to 90 percent) decided to

retake it yet another time. Although not shown, the numbers of students pursuing retests declines

precipitously after the fourth retest: only 113 students retook the examination a fifth time, and

only 7 took a sixth retest. Thus, very few students took advantage of all retest opportunities.

                                    FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE

       Among students who failed their first test, we find evidence for both Discouragement and

Repeated Failure. Here, we examine students whose initial test scores placed them within one

bandwidth below the cut score but who never pass a retest. More than two-thirds of these

students stop taking retests at some point and do not attempt the March 2006 examination, the

last retest before the cohort’s graduation. Presumably, these students become discouraged and

dropped out of school. However, one-third of these students persist to the March 2006 retest.

Over 85% of these students have taken at least four retests, showing remarkable persistence. For

these students, Repeated Failure appears to be the mechanism at play as they exhaust all of their

retest opportunities but cannot satisfy the graduation requirement. These patterns support the

Massachusetts Department of Education’s claim that most students have ample opportunities to

retake the examination.

       Table 2 includes parameter estimates and approximate p-values from fitting the models

specified in equation (2) to predict the probability that students who failed the 10th grade

mathematics examination retake and pass the first retest. In Figure 4, we present the fitted

probability of retaking the examination (top panel) and passing the first retest (bottom panel) as a




                                                                                                    23
function of initial mathematics test score. 22 Figure 4 illustrates that, among students with the

same predicted MCAS scores on the initial tests, low-income urban students are no less likely

than suburban students to retake the mathematics examination. However, low-income urban

students are nearly ten percentage points less likely to pass this retest than suburban students

with the same initial scores (p<0.001).

(3) Effect of failing the 8th grade examination on persistence to 10th grade

       Although the 8th grade examination does not carry high stakes for students, performance

on the test is clearly related to the probability that students remain in school through 10th grade.

We present results in Table 3 from a regression discontinuity analysis of this outcome. For low-

income urban students on the margin of passing the 8th grade mathematics test, failing reduces

the probability of continuing in school and taking the 10th grade MCAS examination by three

percentage points (p=0.16). While this effect is not statistically significant in the model estimated

with optimal bandwidth, we arrive at nearly identical, but more precise and statistically

significant results using a slightly larger bandwidth. Because only eleven percent of low-income

urban students who just pass the examination leave the system before 10th grade, this three

percentage point decline is noteworthy. In Figure 5, we illustrate this pattern by plotting the

fitted nonparametrically smoothed relationship between persistence to 10th grade and

mathematics score for low-income urban students, indicating that the probability of persisting

jumps at the cut score between Passing and Failing.

(4) Effect of failing the English language arts examination on high school graduation23

       Inspecting raw data in Massachusetts suggests that the mathematics examination is a

larger hurdle to on-time graduation than the ELA examination. Most students who failed the 10th

grade ELA examination also failed the mathematics test, while among students who only failed

one of the tests, three times as many failed mathematics as ELA. The ELA examination proves

interesting, however, because detected patterns differ from the mathematics results. Failing the

10th grade ELA examination does not reduce the probability of graduation for low-income, urban

students (or for another group of students) on the margin of passing. In Table 4, we present

parameter estimates and approximate p-values from our local linear regression analyses, again

using only observations that fall within our “optimal” window, centered on the cut score. We

illustrate the relationship between ELA score and probability of graduation for low-income urban

students in Figure 6. Here, the figure displays no discontinuous jump in the probability of

graduating at the cut score, suggesting that failing the ELA examination does not affect students’

V. Sensitivity Analyses

       As discussed above, for regression discontinuity analyses to identify a causal effect of

failing the MCAS examinations on student graduation, several assumptions must hold. First, the

23
  Because the middle school ELA test for the 2006 cohort occurred in 7th grade, one year earlier
than the mathematics test, the state data system, which began in 2001, cannot match students as
accurately for this test. As a result, we cannot examine the effects that Fear of Failing the ELA
examination may have on persistence to 10th grade.


                                                                                                   25
rule that determines whether a student has passed or failed the examination must be exogenous

and rigidly applied across all students, while all other observed and unobserved characteristics of

the student must vary smoothly and continuously around the cut score. Second, the relationship

linking the probability of graduation and test score must be estimated accurately in the

immediate vicinity of the cut score. In this section, we address these two primary concerns and

describe other sensitivity analyses that we conduct to assess the robustness of our results.

Exogenous Establishment of Cut Scores

       The cut scores established by the Massachusetts Department of Education serve as an

extremely plausible source of exogenous variation and do indeed produce a sharp discontinuity

in treatment. Because the raw score needed to pass the examination differs from year to year and

is only calculated after students take examination, it seems highly unlikely that students could

decide knowingly to fall just above, or just below, the cut score. Furthermore, the state DOE

imposes these performance labels strictly, so that any student with a score of 20 points on the

2004 administration of the 10th grade mathematics examination failed, while any student with a

score of 21 points passed. Thus, the discontinuity is both exogenous and sharp.

       We performed several additional tests to verify the exogeneity of the MCAS cut score, as

recommended by Imbens & Lemieux (2007). We examined a histogram of the 10th grade

mathematics scores to explore continuity around the cut score. We find that 899 students just

failed the exam, while 900 just passed it. We also examined histograms of other covariates not

affected by the examination to identify any apparent discontinuities around the cut score and

found none. Finally, we split our sample into students who passed and students who failed in

order to estimate effects at “pseudo-discontinuities” declared at the median mathematics scores




                                                                                                   26
of these subsamples. In all cases, we find no reasons to doubt the robustness of our findings. 24

Accurate estimation of the relationship between graduation and MCAS mathematics score

          For estimates of the treatment effect to be unbiased, we must predict credibly and

precisely what the probability of graduation would have been for students who failed the MCAS

mathematics examination if they had scored 21 points on the test. We address this issue by

modeling the smooth relationship between the probability of graduation and test score

nonparametrically, using a local linear regression approach. Here, our primary specification

decision then involves the choice of bandwidth, h. Our preferred models use optimal bandwidths

chosen through the cross-validation procedures described above.

          To explore the sensitivity of our results to differences in bandwidth selection, we vary it

systematically, refitting our principal smoothed nonparametric models in each case. In the top

panel of Table 5, we present the fitted effects of failing the 10th grade mathematics examination

on on-time graduation for each subgroup as a function of different bandwidths. In the middle and

bottom panels of Table 5, we present parallel results for the effects of failing the 8th grade

examination on persistence to 10th grade and for the effects of failing the 10th grade ELA

examination on on-time high school graduation. Regardless of bandwidth, our main results are

unchanged – for urban, low income students, failing the 8th grade mathematics examination

reduces the probability of persisting to 10th grade and failing the 10th grade mathematics

examination reduces the probability of on-time graduation. However, we find no effects for other

groups of students or for any group failing the 10th grade ELA examination. Our estimates for the

effect of failing the 8th grade examination for marginal urban students range from 2.7 to 3.7

percentage points, and are quite insensitive to bandwidth. Our estimates of the effect of failing

                                                                                                    27
the 10th grade examination range from 5.8 to 13.1 percentage points. In all cases, we reject the

null hypothesis that the parameter value is zero.

                                     TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE

       Finally, we explore the sensitivity of the results to the choice of functional form for the

relationship between probability of on-time graduation and MCAS mathematics score. As an

alternative to our smoothed nonparametric specification, we fit logistic regression models that

incorporate only observations in selected narrow “windows” around the MCAS cutoff. The top

panel of Table 6 contains the critical predicted logistic regression coefficients and standard errors

from models in which we estimate the impact of failing the 10th grade mathematics examination

on the probability of on-time graduation. To facilitate interpretation, the bottom panel contains

estimates in probability units of the causal impact of failing on the fitted probability of on-time

graduation for a typical student. The results from the logistic regression analysis mirror almost

identically those provided by our nonparametric approach.

Definition of outcome variable

       We choose to present our main analyses using on-time graduation as our primary

outcome measure. However, one concern is that students who fail the MCAS may remain in

school and graduate in subsequent years, or that they may drop out and earn a General

Equivalency Diploma instead of graduating from high school. We find that our results are quite

robust to the definition of our outcome. Here, we use three different outcome measures:

graduated on-time or still enrolled in school; dropped out; graduated on-time or obtained a GED.

As seen in Table 7, in all cases we find statistically significant effects of passing the examination

ranging from 7.2 to 9.1 percentage points.

VI. Discussion

       This paper addresses several important questions about the effects of the state

accountability system on Massachusetts high school students. To put these effects in context, it is

important to recall the evidence cited earlier. Under standards-based educational reforms, the

average reading and mathematics performances of Massachusetts students have improved

markedly. In 2007, the state’s reading and mathematics performances on the NAEP ranked first

in the nation. Thus, we do not see the evidence that we present as an attack on the demonstrably

successful educational reform effort in Massachusetts. Instead, we document unanticipated

consequences of efforts to prepare all students to meet the demands of 21st century life. These

consequences are important and need to be at the center of efforts to make standards-based

reforms work for all Massachusetts students in the years ahead.

       To recap, we find that, for low-income urban students on the margin of passing, failing

the 8th grade mathematics examination reduces the probability of persisting to 10th grade by three

percentage points, while failing the 10th grade examination reduces the probability of on-time

graduation by eight percentage points. We find no effects of failing for wealthier urban students

or suburban students. Again, these estimates are only valid for students at the margins of passing

the examination, under the high-stakes testing regime in Massachusetts.

       Importantly, we know nothing about whether these students are better (or worse) off than

they would have been in the absence of standards-based reform. However, low-income, urban

students with essentially the same proficiency on the state test have substantially different

graduation outcomes simply because they are categorized as “passing” or “failing” the

examination. This effect raises an important challenge for urban school districts. We also have




                                                                                                  29
no information about the extent to which the requirement to pass the MCAS affects the

probability of on-time graduation for students well below the passing score. As a result, we

cannot estimate how much of the state dropout rate for low-income urban youth is due to the

imposition of the exit examination. However, because 60% of students who do not graduate on

time actually pass the MCAS, failing the test is clearly only one of many factors that contribute

to the dropout decision.

       We see several complementary explanations for the finding that failing the 10th grade

mathematics examination reduces the likelihood of graduation for urban students from low-

income families, but not for more affluent or suburban students. First, we cannot distinguish

whether just failing the examination causes these students to drop out or whether just passing it

causes them to remain in school. Low-income urban students who pass may feel encouraged that

they are doing well in school and may decide to persist to graduation. Similarly, students who

pass may get more teacher attention or may be promoted more readily through school, leading to

improved graduation outcomes.

       On the other hand, low-income urban students who fail the examination may become

discouraged or subject to institutional responses that reduce their likelihood of graduating on

time. Families of low-income urban students may lack the resources to help them overcome the

hurdle posed by failing the examination. Low-income urban students typically attend high

schools in which many students have failed the 10th grade MCAS examinations. These schools

are struggling to figure out how, with very limited resources, to respond to this problem. Finally,

the interaction between school and home contexts may produce these effects. Interestingly, the

different consequences for failing the ELA examination than for failing the mathematics

examination suggest that urban schools may devote more resources to or be more successful at




                                                                                                  30
remediation in reading and writing than in mathematics.

        That suburban students, including those from low-income families, appear to face no

barrier from failing the 10th grade MCAS mathematics test suggests that their schools have found

ways to support both low-income and wealthier students who have failed. These suburban

schools typically have many fewer students who fail the examination, so they can afford to

provide more personalized attention and remediation. In some Massachusetts districts, schools

match teachers with students who failed the exit examination in order to provide one-on-one

tutoring. In such an environment, it is not surprising that these students may in fact have more in-

school adult contact and encouragement than students who just passed, and may in fact graduate

at greater rates.

        That most students who fail the 10th grade mathematics examination retake it and that

low-income urban students retake the test at similar rates as their wealthier urban or suburban

peers are also encouraging. These findings suggest that these students are receiving the message

that they should persist and retake the test. As a result, schools have time to work with these

students and prepare them to meet the graduation requirements. However, low-income urban

students are much less likely to pass this retest, even when comparing students with the same

initial examination performance. Finding the explanation for this pattern is an important topic

for research, with critical implications for improving equality of educational opportunity.

        Our findings raise several questions for researchers, educators, and policymakers in

Massachusetts and other states. First, the absence of effects of high-stakes testing on high school

completion for suburban students (including those from low-income families) suggests that it is

possible to overcome the initial disappointment associated with failing a high-stakes

examination. Learning more about the initiatives that improve student retention could be helpful




                                                                                                  31
for districts struggling to support many failing students. A related question that we intend to

pursue in future work is whether some urban districts are more successful than others in

supporting students who failed the 10th grade mathematics examination. If that is the case, then

understanding the successful efforts of some urban districts might help others to improve their

support to struggling mathematics learners.

       Especially intriguing is the finding that marginally failing the high-stakes ELA

examination does not reduce the probability that low-income urban 10th graders graduated on

time, while marginally failing the mathematics examination does reduce the probability of on-

time graduation. Why the difference? Do urban districts concentrate resources on programs to

improve their low-income students’ ELA skills? Does the structure of the examinations make

remediation easier in ELA than in mathematics for students on the border of passing?

       Our finding that the Fear of Failing the 10th grade examination induces some low-income

urban students to drop out before even taking it raises additional questions. Failing the 8th grade

examination gives students some sense of their probable performance on the 10th grade test, but

discerning students should recognize that scores on either side of the cutoff are not substantively

different. Nonetheless, we found a moderate effect of failing on persistence to 10th grade for

these very students. What is the mechanism at play here? Does the “failing” label affect a

student’s self-concept? Do students pay attention only to the performance level that their score

puts them in, not on how close they are to passing? Or, does this effect reflect school or parental

responses, such as retaining students or removing them to private schools?

       Another question concerns the extent to which the consequences of exit examinations

depend on their content and format. The 10th grade MCAS mathematics test is relatively

demanding compared to the exit examinations used by other states. Not only does it assess




                                                                                                   32
students’ skills in a range of topic areas, it does so with questions that contain relatively complex

language. Also, some test items call for open-ended responses while others require students to

explain their answers. Supporters of the Massachusetts examinations argue that good instruction

in mathematics is the only way to prepare students to do well on the test, and that simply drilling

students on released test items is not an effective way to improve MCAS scores. The payoff to

drill, as opposed to good mathematics instruction, may vary among the examinations used by

different states. This difference may influence the success of various remediation programs.

       This research argues for the importance of examining heterogeneous effects. In future

work, we hope to explore more fully the effects of failing on different groups of students,

including those with limited English proficiency. It also raises the question of whether the types

of differential impacts we observe in Massachusetts may also be present in other states,

especially those that use relatively demanding exit examinations. A corollary is the importance

of finding the explanations for any observed differential effects of exit examinations. Finding

differences in the probability of retaking the examination between groups suggests one policy

problem. Finding differences in success rates among those who do retake the examination, as we

do, suggests a different problem. We need to understand more carefully what messages and

remediation efforts low-income urban students are receiving that encourage them to retake the

examination but do not prepare them for success. Finally, we wonder why the effect for urban

students varies by income. Do wealthier students attend different schools, or do they receive

additional support outside of school?

       In summary, the requirement that high school students achieve passing scores on

relatively rigorous state-administered examinations in order to obtain a high school diploma is a

relatively new phenomenon in the United States. The content, format, and difficulty of such tests




                                                                                                  33
vary widely across states, as do opportunities for re-taking the examinations and support for

those who fail. Future research needs to go beyond the question of whether failing a particular

exit examination affects the probability of high school graduation. It needs to examine the extent

to which the consequences of failing an exit examination depend on the attributes of the

examination, the testing system, the student, and the quality of support available to struggling

students.

To explore the extent to which measurement error may affect OLS estimates of retest success by

subgroup and whether IV estimates remove this source of bias, we ran a simulation designed to

mirror our analyses. Here, we simulated mathematics, ELA, and mathematics retest scores for

two groups of students: suburban and urban, low income. Using sample data and published

reliabilities, we derived estimates of the true score means, true score covariance matrices, and

error variances on each of the tests.



Using these estimates, we drew true scores on both the “math” and “ELA” tests for 10,630 ULI

students and 49,378 suburban students from a multivariate normal distribution with the sample

true covariance matrix. We then drew three sets of mean zero errors – two for math and one for

ELA, using the appropriate error variances. We added the appropriate errors to the true scores to

obtain mathematics “test” and “retest” scores and ELA “test” scores for each observation. We

iterated this process, drawing 10,000 different samples.



Our simulation results confirm that truncating the sample to include only students who fail does

produce mechanical differences in retest success. We find that the average urban, low-income

students who fails the first mathematics test scores 3 points lower on their retest than suburban

students who fail. Comparing students with the same initial test scores near the cutoff, low-

income urban students are six to seven percentage points less likely to pass the retest than

similarly able suburban students. OLS regression reveals a statistically significant relationship

between retest score and urban, low-income status in 99.8% of cases. Again, these differences

arose mechanically, without any changes in the underlying true score distribution.




                                                                                                    49
Hanushek & Rivkin (2006) suggest that using another test score to instrument for the initial

mathematics test can resolve this problem. Here, we use the “ELA” test as an instrument for the

mathematics test. We implement this approach with two-stage least squares in each of the 10,000

datasets constructed above. We find a statistically significant relationship (with α=0.05) between

retest score and urban, low-income status in just 4.8% of the samples, within the tolerance that

we could expect by chance. Thus, the simulation appears to confirm that the IV approach

resolves this issue.
