        This paper analyzes the
macroeconomic volatility, financial leverage, stock trading activity, default

risk,   and firm profitability    using monthly data from 1857-1986.    An   important

fact, previously noted by Officer[l973], is that stock return variability was

unusually high during the 1929-1940 Great Depression.       Moreover,   leverage has

a relatively small effect on stock volatility.    The amplitude of the fluctuations

in aggregate   stock volatility is difficult to explain using aimple models of

stock valuation.

1.   Introduction

        Many researchershave noted that aggregate atock market volatility changes

over    time.      Officer[l973]     relates   these   changes to        the volatility     of

macroeconomic variables. Black[197g] and Christie(l982] argue that financial

leverage explains      some    of this phenomenon.      Recently,    there have been many

attempts to relate changes in stock market volatility to changes in expected

returns     to    stocks,     including Mertonl9gO]     ,     Pindyck[l984]   ,   Poterba   and

Susssers(l9SSJ,     French,    Schwert and Stambaugh[l987,          Eollerslev, Engle       and

Wooldridge[l9Sg], Cenotte and Marsh[1987) and     ,         Abel[lSgg]
        Shiller[l98la,l9glb]       argues that the level of stock market volatility is

too high relative to the ex post variability of dividends                in the context of a

simple present value model.         In present value models such as Shiller's, a change

in the volatility of either future cash flows or discount rates causes a change

in the volatility of stock returns.        There have been many critiques of Shiller's

work,   notably Kleidon[1986].        Nevertheless, no one has analyzed the relation

between time-variationin stock return volatility and fundaisental determinants

of value.

        This paper characterizes the changes in stock market volatility through

time.     In particular, the goal is to relate stock market volatility to the

time-varying volatility of a variety of economic vsriables.                   Relative to the

1857-1986 period, volatility was unusually high from 1929-1940 for many

economic series, including inflation, money growth, industrial production, and
other measures of economic activity.               I    find evidence that stock market

volatility increases with financial leverage, as predicted by Black and

Christie,       although this factor explains only a small part of the variation in

stook market volatility.            In addition,       interest   rate and corporate bond return

volatility is correlated with stock return volatility. Finally, stock market

volatility increases during recessions and is relsted to measures of corporate

profitability. None of these factors, however,                    plays a dominant role in

explaining the behavior of stock volatility over time.

     Section     2   describes the time series properties of the data and the

empirical strategy for modeling rime-varyingvolatility. Section                      3   analyzes

the relations of stock and bond return volatility with the volatility of five

important macroeconomic variables. Section 4 studies the relation between

stock market volatility and corporate profitability. Section                   5   analyzes the

relation between financial leverage and stock return volatility, and the

relation between stock market trading activity and volatility. Finally,

section     6   synthesizes the results from the preceding sections and presents

concluding remarks.

autoregressions        used to predict volatility. The sum of the autoregressive

coefficients        measures    the persistence of the volatility series, where               a value

of unity implies nonarationarity (see Engle and Eolleralev[1986] for a

discussion of integrated conditionalheteroskedasticity). The F-test measures

whether there is significant deterministic seasonal variation in the average

volatility estimates.            The coefficient of determination R2 and the Box-

Pierce[1970]        statistic Q(24) measure the adequacy of the fit of the model.

Table 2C contains cross correlationsbetween the predictions for December

volatility of the variables in Table 2A with the one lead, current and one lag

of predicted stock return volatility 1c5j. These annual cross correlations

show the timing relations among these volatility series.

    As suggested by the analysis in footnote                 1,   the estimates of volatility

The sample standard deviation of              is mhout fifty percent larger         than that

of     from 1926-1986,    though   the mverage values are aimilar.       Moreover,       the

autocorrelarions of        are much larger than those of

slowly for both series.      This slow decay shows that stock volatility is highly

persistent, perhaps nonsrarionmry (see Poterba and Sumxsers[l986] and

Schwerr[1987J   for further discussion).      The correlation between         ci     and

is .il from 1926-1986, and the correlation between the volatility predictions

       and      is .85 from 1927-1986. The two methods of predicting volatility

have similar time series properties. This is fortunate since daily and weakly

data are not readily available      before   1926.

     It is interesting that the aurocorrelationsin Table 2k, and the summary

statistics for the estimated models in Table 25, are similar for all of the

volatility series.    The autocorrelarions      are small (between     .2   and   .4),   bur

they decay very slowly.      This is consistent with conditional volatility being

an integrated moving average process,        so shocks to volatility have both

permanent and transitory components.         The 'unit root'   tests   in Table 25 show

that the sum of the autoregressivecoefficients is reliably different from

unity using the tables in Fuller[1976].         However,   Schwert[l987,1988] shows

that the Fuller critical values are misleading in situations such as this.

The estimation error from using a single absolute error in (2b) biases the

unit root estimates      toward srationarity.3 The results for the estimate of

stock volatility from daily data support this conclusion, since the sum of the

autoregressivecoefficients is closer to unity, and the rest statistic is

variables problem associated with models such as (2b).

also analyze the volatility of short and long-term bond retutns.             Monthly

interest rate volatility is estimated from 1859-1986 using equations (2a,b).

Since these short-term securities are essentially default-free, the volatility

of    mt   measures time variation in the ex ante nominal interest rate           not

'risk.'4     Figure 2a plots the predicted values of short-term interest rate

volatility 2rat       for 1859-1986.

      If the underlying 'business risk' of the firm rises, the risk of both the

stock and the bonds of the firm should increase.              Also, if leverage increases,

both the stocks and the bonds of the firm become more risky.             Thus,   in many

instsnoes    the risk of corporate stock and corporate debt should change over

time in similar ways.       High-grade (Aa) and medium-grade (Baa) bond return

volatility, ChtI and         II,       is estimated using equations (2a,b).      The

                                                                   from 1920-
high-grade series is from 1858-1986 and the medium-grade series is

1986.      Figure 2b plots the predicted values of long-term high-grade bond

return volstility '°rhJ from 1859-1986.

      Summary statistics    for the estimates of interest rate and bond return

volatility are in Tables 2A and 25.         As    expected,   the average level of

volatility is highest for the medium-grade bond returns, next highest for

high-grade bond returns,       and lowest for short-term interest rates.         All of

these assets have much lower volatility than the stock returns.              Nevertheless,

the autotorrelations       are similar to those for the monthly stock return

                                                         and of the
expected future cash flows and of future discount rates,

conditional covariances between these series.5

   At   the aggregate   level, the value of corporate equity clearly depends on

the health of the economy.               If discount rates are constant over time in (3),

the conditional variance of security prices is proportional to the conditional

variance of the expected           future cash flows.         Thus,   it is plausible that a

change in the level of uncertainty about future macroeconomic conditionswould

cause a proportional change in stock return volatility.6 If macroeconomic

data provide information about the volatility of either future expected cash

flows, or iuture discount rates,                 it can help explain why stock return

volatility has changed over time.                    Of course, if securities markets are

subject   to 'fads' or 'bubbles,'               stock market volatility would be unrelated to

the volatility of fundamental valuation factors.



     tThe variance of the sun of a sequence of ratios of random variables is
not a simple function of the variances and covariances of the variables in the
ratios,   but standard asymptotic approximationsdepend on these parameters.

     6For positively autocorrelatedvariable, such as the volatility series in
Table 2A, an unexpected increase in the variable implies an increase in
expected future values of the series for many steps ahead. Given the
discounting in (3), the volatilityaseries will move almost proportionally.
See Poterba and Summers[l986J for simple model that posits a particular
ARIMA process for the behavior of the time-varying parameters in a related
context.
      It is easy to imagine that wars, business cycles, and major changes in

factor prices    (e.g.,   the OPEC oil shock), could affect the volatility of real

activity,    inflation and asset values.     In fact, several analysts have noted

that the volatility of macroeconomic variables          changes over time.

Officer[1973]    finds that industrial production and money growth are more

volatile from 1929-1933 than in his oversll 1919-1969 sample period.               He finds

that stock market volatility is more closely related to industrial production

volatility than to money growth volatility.           Mascaro and Meltzer[1982] find a

positive relation between money growth volatility and the level of short and

long-term interest rates.       Lauterbach[19883     finds that industrial production

volatility and consumption volatility are related to expected returns to

short-term debt securities for l9g4-19g5.           It is important to note, however,

that faulty data collection procedures probably affect the measured volatility

of many macroeconomic sories before 1940.           See Romer[l986a,b,c3 for a

discussion of unemployment,      industrialproduction and gross national product

data, respectively.


3.1     Volatility of Inflation and Monetary Grovth

  The stock and bond returns analyzed above all measure nominal (dollar)

payoffs.     When inflation of goods' prices is uncertain, the volatility of

nominal asset returns should reflect inflation volatility.           I   use the

algorithm in equations      (2a,b) to estimate     monthly inflation volatility from

1g63-l986    for the FF1 inflation rate.    Figure 3a plots the predicted FF1

inflation volatility            from 1864-1986.      Figure 3b plots the predicted

volatility of the monetaty base growth rates           from l88O-l986.      Summary

statistics fot these estimates are in Tables 2A and 26.

   The volatility of the inflation was extremely high around the Civil War

(1864-1871),   reflecting changes in the value of currency relative to gold

after   the United States   (US) went off the gold standard in 1862.     Since the

United Kingdom (UK) remained on the gold standard,     this also represents


volatility in the exchange rates between US and UK currencies. The Spanish-

American War (1898)    World War I and its aftermath   (1914-1921),    and World War

II (1941-1946)   are also periods of high inflation uncertainty. Another

increase   in inflation volatility occurred   during the 1973-1974 OPEC oil     -



crisis.    While inflation volatility increased during the 1929-1940 period,

this change is minor compared    with the volatility that occurred during wars.

   The volatility of money base growth rates rose during the bank panic and

recession of 1893 and remained high until about 1900.      The next sharp increase

in volatility occurred during the bank panic of 1907.      The period following

the formation of the Federal Reserve System (1914-1923)     was another period of

high volatility. Finally,      the period of the Creat Depression (1929-1940)       was

a period of very high volatility.      Since the early 1950s,   the volatility of

the monetary base growth rate has been relatively low and stable.

   The snnual cross correlationsbetween inflationvolatility and stock

volatility in Table 2C are small.     The cross correlationsbetween stock

volatility and money gtowth volatility are reliably positive at all three

lags.




        also analyzed the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index
inflation volatility from 1915-1986, and money supply (M2) growth volatility
from 1910-1986.  The results were similar to the PPI and-Base volatility
series, so they are not presented.

volatility from 1864-1926.

     The present value relation in (3) is forward-looking.      In an efficient

market speculative prices will react in anticipation of future events.            Thus,

it is also of interest to see whether asset return volatility helps forecast

subsequent volatility of macroeconomic variables. Except 1864-1926,         when

long-term   bond return volatility helps predict inflation volatility, there is

little evidence to suggest that asset return volatility helps predict future

inflation volatility. Perhaps this is because the major changes in inflation

volatility occur during wars, and there seems to be little effect of wars on

stock or bond return volatility.

     Table 33 contains tests of the incremental    predictive power of 12 legs of

monetary ba;e growth volatility 1ert in a 12rh order VAR system similar to

Table 3A.    The relations    among the measures of financial return volatility are

similar to Table 3A.       Except lg8l-l926 with long-term bond returns,   there    is

little evidence that money growth volatility helps predict the volatility of

aaset returns.    On the other hand, in 1927-1952 (and the sample periods that

include   this subperiod),   stock return volatility helps predict the volatility

of   the base growth rate.

     Thus, the relations   between inflation or money growth volatility with the

volatility of asset returns are not strong.       It is surprising that these

macroeconomic measures of nominal volatility are not more closely linked with

the volatility of short and long-term bond returns.

     interest rate and money base growth volatility, including dummy variables for
     monthly intercepts. The F-tests reflect the ability of the column variable to
     predict the respective row variables. Measures of stock return volatility based on
     monthly data       are used in the first four columns, and measuces of stock return

     volatility based on daily data    are used in the last four columns.  The .05 and
     .01 critical values for the F-statistic with 12 and 200 degrees of freedom are 1.80
     and 2.28, respectively.
3,2      Real Macroeconomic Volatility

      Since common stocks reflect claims on future profits of corporations,          it is

plausible that the volatility of real economic activity is a major determinant

of stock return volatility. In      the present value model (3), the volatility of

future expected cash flows,     as well as discount     rates, will change if the

volatility of real activity changes.

      Figures 4a, 4b and 4c contain plots of the predicted volatility of the

growth rates of industrial production                of bank clearings (debits)
                                                                                   I2dcI)

statistics for these estimates are in Tables 2A and 2B.

      Industrial production volatility in Figure 4a was high during the mid-

l930s,     during World War I, and especially     during the post-World War II period.

There is a small increase in volatility duriog the 1973-1974 recession.

Romer[1986b] argues that data collection procedures cause part of the higher

volatility of this series before 1929.
      Bank clearings are a measure of transactions      that have been popular for

measuring business cycle activitS' at least since Nacaulay[1938].         The plot    in

Figure    4b shows that clearings volatility rose during the Civil War and

remained high until the 1873-1879     recession.      There was a sharp increase     in

volatility in the early l900s and another brief increase in the recession and

bank panic of 1907-1908.      Both World War I and World War II led to moderate

increases     in volatility, and volatility was higher during the 1929-1940

period.     With this series, especially,    the effect of changea in measurement

have probably had important effects on the secular behavior of volatility. In

the mid.l9tF century,     the only banks in the sample were in New York City.

Over time, the sample of banks haa expanded in a succession of discrete

spitced   these series     so the levels ate continuous,    the diversification eiiect

of using larger samples probably explains the downward trend in volatility in

Figure 4b.9

     It is interesting that the sample used to measure stock return volatility

has many of the sane problems as the sample used to measure clearings. There

ate relatively few stocks       in the sample in 1857, and they are all railroad

stocks.    Nevertheless,     they represent the majority of actively traded equity

securities at that time (as the New York banks held a dominant position in the

banking industry).       Even though the number of securities and industries

included has grown over time, the plot of stock return volatility in Figure 1

does not show   a downward trend similar     to the picture of bank clearings

volatility in Figure 4b.

     The volatility of the growth rate of the liabilities of business failures

in Figure 4c was high during World War II and in the 1980s.           Surprisingly,

this series does not show unusually high volatility during 1929-1940.

     The annual cross correlations between industrial production volatility and

stock volatility are positive in Table 2C.        The cross correlations of stock

volatility with both bank clearings volatility and business failures

volatility are small at all three lags.

3,3   Macroeconomic and Financial Volatility Donna Recessions

   Table 5 contains       a final rest oi the relation between stock volatility and

macroeconosic activity.        It contains estimates     of the ooefficient of a dummy

variable    added to equation (2b) equal to unity during recessions as defined by

the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and zero otherwise.               If this

coefficient is reliably greater than zero, the volatility of the series is

greater during recessions than during expansions.1'°

   Table    5    shows that volatility is higher during recessions, since most         of

the estimates are positive and none is more than 1.5 standard errors below              0.


Except 1859-192i, all of the estimates for stock volatility are more than 2.5

standard errors above zero.         Moreover,    the estimates   of   the percentage

increase    in volatility in recessions relative       to expansions, in brackets

below the standard errors, are quite large (up to 299 percent in 1927-1952

using the daily estimates of volatility). Along with the measures of stock

market volatility             and        the volatility of industrial production
                                    c,                                                 c.j
shows the most reliable       increases   during recessions.     There is weaker evidence

that bond returns, short-term interest rates, money growth rates, and business

failures    have higher volatility during recessions.

   Thus, stock market volatility is related to the general health of the

economy.        One interpretationof this evidence     is that it is caused by

leverage.        Stock prices are a leading indicator,    so stock prices fall

(relative       to bond prices) before and during recessions. Thus, leverage

increases       during recessions, causing an increase in the volatility of levered

stocks.     Section 5 addresses     this question directly.



     10Since the NBER announces the timing of recessions and expansions 6 to 9
months    gggthey have begun, this evidence does not imply that the recession
variable can be used to help oredict future volatility.

 4.     Stock Volatility and Corporate Profitability

      In addition to    general macroeconomic factors,
                                                   it is interesting to measure
 the relation between stock            and the health of the corporate sector
                            volatility
 of the economy. Many authors use the dividend
                                                yield <°'2 as an indicator of
 future stock returns (e.g.           and
                             Campbell
                                 ,
                                          Shiller[1988) and Fama end

French[1988)).       Given the evidence that dividend
                                                      yields track time-varying
expected returns,       they mAy also predict time-varying volatility.        By similar
logic, the earnings      yield            and the 'payout ratio'
                                                                   (D/E) could provide
information about the health of corporations.
                                                          Finally, Keim and

Stsmbaugh[l986J      have noted that the
                                         yield spread between high and low risk
corporate      bonds predicts future stock returns.        When these yield spreads
reflect increased probability of default,
                                                     they are likely to predict time-

varying stock volatility.

                                        Volatility
      Figures Se, 5b and Sc contain plots of the payout ratio
                                                                      (D/E). the
dividend yield             and the earnings yield
                    (D/P)t                        (E/F). respectively, from 1871-
1986.     In Figure 5a, the payout ratio was much more variable
                                                                before 1953.            In
particular, during recessions the payout ratio was often greater than 1,

implying that dividend payments exceeded corporate earnings. This
                                                                   implies
that managers perceive recessions are             and

for not changing dividends frequently (Linrner[1956J).             Since 1953, however,

the payout ratio has been relatively stable.

   The          data are only available on an annual basis from 1871-1934              and on

a quarterly basis from 1935-1954.       This explains the step function behavior of


the payout ratios in Figure Sa.       The           series is interpolated to a

                                            data and assuming a constant payout

ratio during the year or quarter.       See the Appendix for more details.

                                                                   so much
   It is curious that the behavior of the payout ratio has changed

over time.     In many ways this is similar to the other macroeconomic variables.

While the sample of securities used to calculate this ratio is smaller before

1926,    the measurement techniques used have not changed over time.

Depression, World War II and the OPEC oil shock.              Nevertheless, the movement

            Note: All tests use the White[1980] heteroskedasticity consistent

coefficients of (D/E), (D/P) and (E/P)t, respectively, with asymptotic

corporate    profitability measures on stock return volatility. These lagged

measures are added to the autoregressivemodel in (2b).        Except for the payout

ratio after 1926, none of the t-testa in Table g are large.      The relation

between stock volatility and the payout ratio is reliably positive from 1927-

1952 and reliably negative from 1953-1986.     Thus,   this relation is not stable

over time.     From Figures 1 and Sm, payout rose during 1929-1940 as did stock

volatility. Payout fell during the 1973-1986 period when stock volatility

rose.   These opposite associations suggest there is no stable relation between

earnings or dividend policy and stock volatility.


4.2 Relation of Bond Yields with Volatility

   Figures 6a and 6b plot the spreads between medium (Baa) and high (As) grade

corporate long-termbonds (MedbondHibond) and between long and short-term

high grade bonds    (HibondInt) respectively.      Assuming that Moody's rating

classes reflect consistent information over time, the spread between yields on

different bonds of different quality should measure the price of default risk.

Thus,   the plot in Figure   6s should vary with uncertainty about   corporate

profitability, and should be related to stock volatility. Indeed, quality

yield spreads are higher in 1929-1940 than in the subsequent periods.        They

also increase in the OPEC period end since 1979.

   The spread between long and short-termyields in Figure 6b reflects a

different phenomenon.    First, since the long-term yields are for corporate

debt, end the short-termyields are for Treasury securities (since 1926), part

of this maturity    spread measures the default risk   of the long-term corporate

debt.   There are many periods, however, when the maturity spread is negative,

 5.2     Stock Market Trading and Volatility

       French and Roll[l986] observe that stock volatility is higher when stock

 exchanges      are open for trading.        In particular,       they find thst the variance of

 stock returns over weekends and holidays              is much less than          a   typical one-day

 variance times the number of calendar days since trading last occurred.                               Most

 peculiarly, during 1968, when the NYSE              closed     on Wednesdays due to the 'paper-

 work crunch,'        the-variance    of Tuesday to Thursday returns was not much larger

 than a one-day variance.            This occurred even though the stock exchanges were

6..Suismary and Conclusions

      Given that stock volatility has changed substantially ovet time, it is

interesting to ask why it has changed.                            This papet analyzes many factots

related to stook volatility, but it does not test for causes of stock ptice

volatility. Rather,              the hypotheses involve associations between stock

volatility and othet variables.

      For example,       the analysis          of the volatility of bond tetumns,                   inflation

rates,     money growth, and teal mactoeconomic variables, along with stock

volatility, seeks to decetaine whethet these aggregate volatility measures

change together thtough tire.                   Jn most general equilibrium models, fundamental

factors such as consumption and production opportunities and preferences would

determine all of these parameters (e.g., Abel[1988] or Cenotte and

Marah[1987]). Nevertheless, the process of characterizing stylized facts

about economic volatility helps define the set of interesting questions,

leading to tractable             theoretical       models.


6.1     Joint Effects of Leverage and Macroeconomic Volatility

      Moat of the tests above analyze financial volatility along with one

additional nonfinancial factor.                    To summarize all of these relations between

stock volatility and nonfinancial factors, Table 10 contains estimates                                     of the

multiple regression,

    The results for stock volatility are interesting.            First,       the average level

 of voletility is much higher during recessions (consistentwith Table 5).                     The

 column labeled 'Recess' in Table 10 contains       estimates     of or the differential

a constant quality class over time, the imprecise estimates of the financial

leverage coefficient are not surprising. The only predicted volatility

measure that has reliably positive coefficient estimates is short-term

interest rate volatility. These coefficient estimates mre between .59 and

.94, depending on the sample period.           This implies that a one percent increase

in predicted short-term interest           rate volatility is associated with a .6 to .9

percent increase in long-term corporate bond return volatility. Note that

this result is not limited        to the post-1979 period when both short and long-

term interest rates exhibited unusual volatility. Thus, the results in Table

10 suggest    that macroeconomic volatility has differential effects           on the

volatility of corporate stock and bond returns.


6.2   Synthesis

   Many economic series were more volatile in the 1929-1940 Great Depression.

Nevertheless,    stock volatility increased by a factor of two or three
                                                                        during
this period relative to the usual level of the series (see Figure 1).               There

is not other series      in this paper that experienced similar behavior.          In this

period,   stock volatility is positively related to measures of corporate

profitability, such as the payout ratio and the quality yield spread for

corporate    bonds (Tables   6   and 7).    For sample periods that do not include

1929-1940,    however,   these profitability measures are not related to stock

volatility.

   Second,    there is evidence that many aggregate economic series are more

volatile during recessions (Table 5).           This is particularly true for financial

asset returns and for measures of real economic activity. One
                                                              interpretation
of this evidence    is that 'operating leverage'       increases during recessions.

   In short, the evidence in this paper reinforces the argument made hy

0fficerl9731 that the volatility of stock returns from 1929-1940 was

unusually high relative     to either prior or subsequent experience.   For many

years macroeconomists have puzzled about the inability of their models to

explain the data from the Great Depression. The descriptive results in this

paper pose a similar challenge to financial     economists. Moreover,   based on

evidence in Fama and French[1988] and Poterba and Summers[l988], the 1929-1940

period plays a crucial role in the evidence     for 'mean reversion' in stock

prices.    I suspect an analysis of Shiller's[l98la,l98lb]variance bounds tests

would reveal that the 1929-1940 period is responsible for the inference of

'excess volatility' of stock prices.     Indeed,   the spirit of the preceding

discussion suggests that stuck volatility was inexplicably high during this

period.    I   am hesitant to cede all of this unexplained behavior to social

psychologists as evidence of fads or bubbles.      Mevertheless, there remains a

challenge to both theorists and empiricists to explain why this episode was so

unusual.

predicts the level of the Cowles
where standard errors are in parentheses under the coefficient estimates.
This is essentially equivalent to adding a dividend yield of .56 percent per
month (6.7 percent per year) to the percent changes in railroad stock prices.
The correlation between the Ccwles and the Macaulay returns is .99 from 1871-
1879.



        2.   Common Stock Yields.    1871-1986

      For 1926-1986, I use the dividend yield. D/P, on the S&P composite index
                                                Federal Reserve[1976b, Table

 12.19, pp. 788-7903 for 1926-46).  For 1871-1925. I use the yield expectations

 series from the Cowles Commission[l939,pp. 270-271], adjusted to splice with
 the 54? series in 1926 by multiplying the Cowles data by the ratio of
                                                                       the

      The earnings yield series, El?, for the 54? composite index

                         To  create  a          series for 1926-1953, I use the
 12.19, pp. 788-750].                  monthly

where standard errors are in parentheses under the coefficieot estimates.
The correlation between these monthly growth rates is .85 over this period.
The F/P ratios are interpolated forward from the beginning of the petiod using
these ptedicted growth rates, and interpolatedbackward from the end of the
period.  The monthly F/P series used in the paper for 1926-1953 is an average
of the forward and backward interpolations.  For 1871-1925, I use the annual
F/P ratio from the Cowles Commission]1939, pp. 404-405]   This is spliced with
                                                                     .




the S&P series by multiplying the Cowles data by .914428, the ratio of the SiP
to the Cowles t/P ratios for 1926.  I assume that the "payout ratio" (0/F) is
constant within the year, and equal to the ratio of D/P for December divided

by F/P. Thus, for 1871-1934 the earnings yield numbers behave like the
dividend yield series within each year.


        3. Short-term Inrerest Rates. 1857-1986

        For 1926-1986, I use the monthly yields on the shortest term U.S.
Government security (with no special tax previsions) which matures after the
end of the month from the Government Bond File constructed by CRSP. For 1857-

1925,    I   use the 4 to     6   month commercial paper rates in New York from
Macaulay]l938, Table 10, pp. A14l-Al6l]. The commercial paper yields are
adjusted so the level of the series is comparable to the Treasury yields,
using the regression of CRSP yields on Macaulay yields from 1926-1937,

                     —    - .000761 + .9737368             +
             CRSPt                             Macaulay
                          (.000085) (.0309330)

where standard errors are in parentheses under the coefficient estimates.
This is equivalent to subtracting an average risk premium of .076 percent per
month (.91 percent per year) from the Mscsulay yields to reflect a small
default premium in commercial paper. The correlation between the CRSP and the

Macaulay yields is .94 for 1926-1937.


        4. Lens-term Interest Rates.         1857-1986

     The high-grade corporate bond yield for 1919-1986 is the Moody's Aa bond
yield (Federal Reserve[l976a,Table 128, pp. 468-471] for 1919-40, Federal
Rasarve[1976b, Table 12.12, pp. 720-721] for 1941-47, and Citibase]l978] for
                                      ii
1948-86).  For 1857-1918, I use Macaulay's[1938, Table 10, pp. Al4l-Al61]
                                                       the Moody's series using
railroad bond yield index, adjusted to splice with
                  of the                 1919,  (FR/As)  — .964372.
the average rario         yields during
                                 bond yield  for  1919-1986   is the Moody's Baa

      5. Returns to Lens-term Corporate 8onds, 1857-1986

                                                                   month is
     The capital gain or loss from holding the bond during the

using the conventional bond pricing
                                                                          return is

                                            these returns are not comparable to
averages of the yields within the month,
returns based on  end-of-month data.   To  correct for this problem, I estimate a

first order moving average process for the returns,


            9bt
                  —   °+   t   -
                                   ttl'
                                                 — ° +      This correction
 then the 'corrected' returns are defined as bt

 eliminates the positive autocorrelation at lsg one induced by
                                             Note, however, that the corrected

The means and standard deviations are similar, but the high and medium grade
bond returns are correlated with the lagged value of the Ibbotson bond
returns.     This is caused by the time-averaged yields used by Moody's. Because
the Ibbotson data are not available before 1926,    and they only measure returns
to high grade bonds,       I also use the returns calculated from the various bond

yield series.


       6.   Inflation Rates, 1862-1986

     For 1890-1986, I use the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index
(PPI) inflation rate, not seasonally adjusted.  For 1875-1889, I use the
inflation rate of Snyder's index of producer prices froSt Macaulay[l938, Table
27, pp. A255-A270] to predict the PPI inflation rate.  I use the regression oi
PPI inflation on one lead, current and one lag of Snyder's inflation      for

1890-1936,


            PPI   — - .001323 + .496811           + .9516745      + .252962St- 1 + u

       10. Bank Clearings            or Debits, 1857-1986

     Bank debits measure the flow of financial transactions. For
                                                                   1857-1918, I
use the daily average clearings data from Macaulay[1938, Table 27,
                                                                    pp. A252-
A2663 . For 1657-1874, I estimate clearings outside of New York City using the
average fraction of clearings in New York for lg75-1884 (70.664 percent), so
adjusted total clearings are New York clearings divided by .70664.   Daily
average debits to demand deposit accounts are from Federal Reserve[1976a,

334-3393 for 1943-1963, Federal Resene3l9lGb, Table 5.2B, pp. 342-343] for
1964-70, and various issues of the Federal Reserve Bulletin since 1970. The
data   are adjusted to reflect increases
                                       in the coverage of the sample by the
Federal Reserve Board in 1919, 1964 and 1970. For 1964 and 1970. I use the

average of the new to old sample values for the year's overlap as a multiple
for  allprior data (these multiples are 1.120562 in 1964 and 1.107030 in
1970).     I   use the ratio of the Federal Reserve debits data to Nacaulay's

     I use the monetary base (referred to as high-powered
                                                          money in Friedman
and Schwartz[1963J). For 1867-1960, I use data from Friedman and

Schwartz[1963, Table 8-3, column (1), pp. 799-808J for rhe base.   For 1961-
1986, I use the seasonally adjusted monetary base reported by the Federal
Reserve Board from Citibase[1978]. These series are spliced
                                                             together using
the average ratio of the respective series during 1960.  Thus, the base data
since 1960 are multiplied by 1.127538.  The Friedman and Schwartz data are
reported on a monthly basis beginning in May 1907. From June 1878 through
April 1907, I use a monthly monetary base series from the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) multiplied by the average ratio of the Friedman and
Schwartz series to the NBER series for 1878-1914, 1.006948.  These data were
provided by Professor Robert Barro. Thus, there are continuous monthly data
on growth rates of the base from July 1878 through December 1986.
