        In                we will discuss and illustrate these points using an

analytical framework. Our starting point is the problem faced by a government
with    a debt        overhang       which     has        to choose          whether          to undertake                an adjustment
with a debt overhang which has to choose whether to undertake an adjustment
program       or not.          Adjustment          has     the potential                  of eliminating                 the overhang,
program or not. Adjustment has the potential of eliminating the overhang,
but,     in   the absence           of external            financing,              the     immediate         costs         would         be too
but, in the absence of external financing, the immediate costs would be too
high     relative        to future       benefits.                We then          look     at the     set       of strategies
high relative to future benefits. We then look at the set of strategies

Notes:

The independent variable is the deviation between annual growth of per-capita
GD?, adjusted for terms of trade shocks, and per-capita CDP growth trend
during 1960-1980. The adjusted annual growth rate of per capita CD? is from
Heston and Summers, 1988. The trend variables for per capita growth 1960-80 in
each country was computed by regressing per capita growth of CDP on a time
variable.

Period dummies: t—0 refers to the year in which an IMP program was first
signed during the period 1977-87. t—-i refers to i years before, and t—j
refers to j years after.

Data set: Early adjustment countries are those that have received two
structural adjustment loans from the World Bank, with the first operation in
1985 or before. All had IMF Stand-by agreements.
