This paper seeks to understand the interplay between banks, bank regulation, sovereign default risk
and central bank guarantees in a monetary union. I assume that banks can use sovereign bonds for
repurchase agreements with a common central bank, and that their sovereign partially backs up any
losses, should the banks not be able to repurchase the bonds. I argue that regulators in risky countries
have an incentive to allow their banks to hold home risky bonds and risk defaults, while regulators
in other “safe” countries will impose tighter regulation. As a result, governments in risky countries
get to borrow more cheaply, effectively shifting the risk of some of the potential sovereign default
losses on the common central bank.

1     Introduction
The European Monetary Union is in distress. Mechanisms that were meant
to safe-guard key institutions and to assure stability have become sources
of balance sheet risk for these very institutions. Liquidity provision within
the European Monetary Union rests upon repurchase agreements, by which
banks guarantee the repurchase of assets deposited with the European Cen-
tral Bank. If either the bank fails or the asset fails, but not both, this
mechanism safe-guards the repayment to the ECB, since it can either rely
on the repurchase by the bank or sell the asset. However, when both fail as
well as the bank home country fails, the ECB incurs a loss.
    One symptom of these developments are the dramatic increases in Tar-
get 2 imbalances, as extensively documented and discussed by Sinn (2012).
Indeed, banks in troubled Euro zone countries appear to concentrate their
portfolio of government bonds particularly on the bonds of their own country,
rather than seeking safety by holding bonds of other countries, see figure 1.
This behavior appears to be encouraged or at least positively tolerated by the
regulators in these countries, who may assert that purchases of the bonds of
their countries by their own banks is necessary in order to be able to finance
the government at all, thereby endangering the safety of their banks down
the road in the case of a sovereign default.
    This paper is motivated by these developments. It seeks to understand
the underlying forces and incentives more deeply. It seeks to understand the
interplay between banks, bank regulation, sovereign default risk and central
bank guarantees in a monetary union. I assume that banks can use sovereign
bonds for repurchase agreements with a common central bank, and that their
sovereign partially backs up any losses, should the banks not be able to repur-
chase the bonds. I argue that regulators in risky countries have an incentive
to allow their banks to hold home risky bonds and risk defaults, while reg-

ulators in other “safe” countries will impose tighter regulation. As a result,
governments in risky countries get to borrow more cheaply, effectively shift-
ing the risk of some of the potential sovereign default losses on the common
central bank. As a result, the monetary union has become a system engi-
neered to deliver underpriced loans from country banks to their sovereigns,
and to implicitly shift sovereign default risk onto the balance sheet of the
ECB and the rest of the Eurosystem.
   In the model, banks pursue their investment strategy voluntarily: it is up
to regulators to potentially constrain them. Other explanations are conceiv-
able, of course. Useful, general perspectives on financial crises and govern-
ment regulations are Reinhart (2012a) as well as Claessens and Kose (2013).
A prominent alternative argument for why banks hold bonds of their home
country is “financial repression”, see Reinhart (2012b), i.e. regulators make
them hold the sovereign bonds, perhaps with strong-arm tactics, perhaps in
exchange for “looking the other way” concerning weak portfolios of commer-
cial loans and mortgages, or simply as a “favor” in a long, ongoing relation-
ship. Since the banks could potentially refuse, though at considerable cost,
it still must ultimately be preferable to them to hold own-country bonds
rather than invest elsewhere or to close: so, in some ways, this paper may
also be understood as a model of financial repression. A further alternative
is a political economy argument: if sovereign bonds are held by home banks,
it makes it politically harder to default on these bonds, as this will hurt
domestic banks and savers. If so, then such a portfolio arrangement might
serve as a commitment device for the government in trouble. While this is
an interesting angle, this paper will be silent on this perspective.
   The issue of sovereign default risk, bank portfolios and the role of the cen-
tral bank has received considerable attention in the recent literature. Acharya
and Steffen (2013) is a careful empirical analysis of the “carry trade” by
banks, which fund themselves in the wholesale market and invest in risky


                                       3
sovereign bonds. They document, that “over time, there is an increase in
’home bias’ – greater exposure of domestic banks to its sovereigns bonds –
which is partly explained by the European Central Bank funding of these
positions,” providing an in-depth analysis of the facts indicated in figure 1 as
well as solid empirical support for the theory provided below. Relatedly, Cor-
radin and Rodriguez-Moreno (2013) show that USD-denominated sovereign
bonds of Euro zone countries became substantially cheaper (i.e., delivering a
higher yield) than Euro-denominated bonds during the Euro zone crisis, and
ascribe it to the usefulness to banks of Euro-denominated bonds as collateral
vis-a-vis the ECB, while USD-denominated bonds do not offer this advan-
tage. Again, this supports the perspective in this paper. Drechsler et. al.
(2013) document “a strong divergence among banks’ take-up of” Lender-of-
Last-Resort assistance “during the financial crisis in the euro area, as banks
which borrowed heavily also used increasingly risky collateral”. They test
several hypothesis and argue that their “results strongly support the risk-
shifting explanation”, in line with the theory below.
   Like this paper, Broner et al. (2013) is motivated by the shift towards
home sovereign debt during the Euro crisis. Their analysis is somewhat par-
allel to my model here, as they also show that “sovereign debt offers a higher
expected return to domestic creditors than to foreign ones”. There are con-
siderable difference in the modeling details, however. Roch and Uhlig (2012)
analyze the role of actuarily fair bailouts to resolve multiple-equilibrium-
driven sovereign default crises, thus shedding light on the OMT program of
the ECB. There is considerably more, but let me stop here.

2         A model

2.1         The actors and their interaction
There are three periods, t = 0, 1, 2. There is a monetary union of many coun-
tries and a common central bank. One “small” country will be considered
risky, while all other countries will be considered “safe”: we shall thus only
distinguish between the risky country and the rest of the monetary union.
All units are in terms of the common currency. I shall abstract from the
issue of inflation, which does not appear to be central at this juncture in
the European Monetary Union, though it may well be so in the future. I
therefore assume that a unit of the currency can be be used to purchase a
unit of the consumption good in any given period, i.e., all the accounting
could alternatively be done in terms of a numeraire consumption good.

    1. There is a continuum of banks j ∈ [0, 1] in each country with initial net
          worth1 n > 0. Therefore, n also denotes the total net worth available
          per country. The banks are each owned by a banker or bank owner,
          who maximizes expected consumption in period 2. Their consumption
          must be nonnegative. I will use the word “bank” and “banker” in-
          terchangeably, but one may wish to think of the bank being regulated
          and carrying out investment strategies, while the bank owner or banker
          cares about the result.

    2. There is large population of households in each country, holding in
          total a deposit of 1 unit with each bank at the beginning of period 0.
          Households withdraw their deposits in period 1.

    3. In each country, there is a government, which has a spending need
          g0 in period 0, and otherwise seeks to maximize expected government
    1
        This can be interpreted as net worth inclusive of long-term deposits, which will not
be withdrawn

                                               5
         spending in period 2. Each government is endowed with resources
         in period 2. I assume that all governments except one are “safe”,
         i.e. always have sufficiently large resources in all periods, including
         period 2. There is one “risky” government (or one government in a
         “risky” country), which has resources y ∼ G in period 2, y ≥ 0 and
         P (y > 0) > 0. I assume that

                                             E[y] > g0                                   (1)

         Governments issue bonds in period 0 to finance their spending need,
         with the promise to repay them in period 2. The budget constraint of
         the risky government in period 0 is therefore

                                              qB = g0 ,                                  (2)

         where B is the total outstanding face value of its debt and q is the
         market price per unit of the bond. The governments regulate the asset
         positions of banks in period 0, by imposing an upper bound b̄ with
                                                    1+n
                                             b̄ ≤
                                                     q
         on their holding of risky bonds in period 0. Note that the same bound is
         imposed on all banks, by assumption2 . Furthermore, the governments
         are nominally obliged to pay for a share 0 < α ≤ 1 of the losses of their
         banks in period 2, but will fractionally default on this obligation, if
         they lack the funds to do so. The regulators will impose the bounds on
         the bond positions optimally in order to maximize expected period-2
   2
       One can easily generalize this model to the situation, where deposits as well as b̄ is
proportional to n: for that reason, we shall often use a notation, expressing everything in
proportion to n. It is considerably more challenging to allow heterogeneity in n as well
as in the regulatory bounds. The assumption of homogeneity can be motivated by the
general legal principle, that the law should treat all market participants equitably.


                                               6
        government consumption, and choose the most liberal regulation among
        all those achieving this maximum.

   4. There is a common central bank. The central bank can issue cash
        and engage in repurchase agreements with the banks. Any shortfalls
        in period 2 are paid for by the governments in period 2: in equal
        proportions, up to the resources available to each government.

      I assume that these players interact as follows. The interactions place
considerable restrictions on the available contracts: these restrictions shall
be examined further below.
      In period 0, the households place 1 unit of deposits at the beginning of
period 0 with each bank: thus, 1/n can be understood as the leverage ratio of
bank j in a country. Banks use their net worth and the deposited resources to
buy a portfolio of bonds from the countries, subject to regulatory restrictions
imposed by their respective governments. More specifically, they buy bonds
b ≥ 0 at price q from the “risky” government, where b is the face value
(“promise to pay in period 2”) of the bonds. They use the remainder of the
funds to buy safe bonds, which are assumed to be like cash: thus, their price
is unity, and their quantity shall be denoted by m ≥ 0. Taking into account
the regulatory constraint, the budget constraint of a bank is

                         qb + m = 1 + n, b ≤ b̄, b ≥ 0, m ≥ 0.                         (3)

      In period 1, households withdraw their deposits3 . In order to meet these
liquidity needs, banks first sells safe bonds m̃, until they reach m̃ = m, and
then approach the common central bank for a repurchase contract for the
remainder. In the repurchase contract, the bank sells b̃ ≥ 0 bonds to the
  3
      This is motivated by the large withdrawals of depositors at banks in the south of the
EMU in recent years. While the withdrawal is “hardwired” here and assumed to be total,
a more complete model might endogenize these withdrawal decisions.


                                             7
central bank at price φq, where 0 < φ ≤ 1 represents a hair cut applied
by the central bank, with the agreement of repurchasing them at the same
price in period 2. I assume that the hair cut parameter φ is common across
all banks. Thus, in period 1, a bank with portfolio (b, m) faces the budget
constraint
                             φq b̃ + m̃ = 1, m̃ = min{m, 1}.                           (4)
For the analysis here, I assume that the central bank chooses the common
hair cut parameter φ in period 1, so that this constraint is always satisfied:
otherwise, banks would need to default on their withdrawing households.
This captures the impression that, up to 2013, the ESCB has largely provided
liquidity to banks in affected countries, when needed.
       In period 2, the bonds mature. The safe bonds (“cash m”) pay one unit
per bond. The risky bonds pay 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1 per unit of face value, with θ < 1
representing a default by the risky government. If a bank has entered a repo
agreement with the central bank, it will purchase back as many of the bonds
sold to the central bank in period 0 at the agreed-upon price φq per unit as
possible, making use of its own resources as well as the maturing payments
on the bonds it is repurchasing from the central bank. If the repurchase is
not done in full, the bank is considered in default: the ensuing losses are
then split between the central bank and the government of that bank, with
the government bearing a share 0 ≤ θα ≤ 1 of these losses4 and the central
bank bearing the remaining fraction 1 − θα of the losses. If the repurchase is
done in full, the banks keep the excess resources and consume. Governments
must first repay bonds and pay for their share of losses at their banks, before
consuming the remainder g2 , with α a parameter of the model, and θ emerging
endogenously from the budget constraint of the government

            g2 + θ(B + αL) = y, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, g2 ≥ 0 and g2 = 0 if θ < 1,                 (5)
   4
       Note that I assume that the government defaults on its obligations to “recapitalize”
its banks at the same rate θ that it defaults on its bond repayments.

the total losses in their banks.


2.2      Analysis
Consider first the problem of a bank j, after purchase of the portfolio (b, m)
per the budget constraint (3). Given the survival in period 1, as assumed,
and the liabilities to the central bank in period 2, and substituting for m per
(3), the banker owning this bank will enjoy period-2 consumption, written
as a function of the value of the investment qb,

                    c(qb) = max{θb + m − 1; 0}
                                (       !          )

and produce losses of

                    l(qb) = max{1 − θb − m; 0}
                                (       !          )
                                       θ qb
                          = max   1−         − 1; 0 n.                     (6)

Define                               (           )

                            β = min     ,      .                           (7)

Notice that 0 ≤ qb ≤ βn, with the first entry denoting the regulatory bound
and the second entry arising from m ≥ 0. Therefore, if the banker invests the
maximum amount possible in bonds (or, more precisely, instructs his bank
to invest the maximum amount possible in bonds), he will receive expected
consumption
                              E[c(βn)] = χ(β)n,

where                                        !

If the banker instructs his bank to invest only in cash, he will receive expected
consumption equal to n.

Proposition 1 The results do not depend on the haircut parameter φ.

Proof: None of the expressions above depends on φ. •


This may be a bit surprising, since it is often argued that by some ap-
propriate haircut, the central bank can insulate itself against losses. The
haircut parameter does not matter here, and therefore, it will not matter
below either.

Proposition 2         • If 1 < χ(β) the banker will invest the maximum amount
      possible in bonds, b = βn.

   • If 1 > χ(β), the banker will only hold cash.

   • If 1 = χ(β), the banker is indifferent between “all cash” and “all bonds”
      and

                                                      − 1 β + 1 < 0 = 0. Equation
(9) follows from dropping the “max” operator in the definition of χ. •




Proposition 3
                                   0 ≤ q ≤ 1.                                (10)

Proof: q ≥ 0 is clear. As for q ≤ 1, note that θ ≤ 1. Therefore, at q > 1,
                                        !
                                θ
                                  −1 β+1< 1
                                q
and thus, χ(q) < 1. Per proposition 2, no banker would hold the risky bonds
at q > 1, in contradiction to market clearing for the risky bonds. •



   Next, consider the problem facing regulators in safe countries. Given the
distribution for default rates θ, let

                          θ = sup{θ̃ | P (θ ≥ θ̃) = 1}

be the probabilistically smallest value for θ.

Proposition 4 If q ≤ θ, regulators in the safe countries will not impose any
regulatory bounds. If q > θ, regulators in safe countries will impose
                                              1
                              b̄safe (n) =       n,                          (11)
                                             q−θ
and thus assure that banks will avoid losses, with probability 1,
                                  !
                           θ
                        P(   − 1 β safe + 1 < 0) = 0.
                           q
Banks in safe countries will purchase risky bonds, if and only if

                                    q ≤ E[θ],                                (12)

                                        11
with indifference between cash and bonds, in case of “=”. I.e., these banks
only purchase risky bonds, if their price is less than or at most equal to the
actuarily fair value.

   Proof:     This follows from the assumption that regulators maximize
expected government consumption in period 2, and seek the most liberal
portfolio regulation that achieves that. Since banks never make losses,
                                   !        (           )
                          E[θ]          q    1+n
                χ(β) =         − 1 min     ,     + 1.
                           q           q−θ    n
Therefore, 1 ≤ χ(β) is equivalent to (12). •



   As an immediate consequence, we have

Proposition 5
                                  q ≥ E[θ].                               (13)
Furthermore, if θ is not constant almost surely, then P (θ < q) > 0 and
regulators in safe countries will impose the constraint (11).

   Proof: The resources of the safe country banks are assumed large com-
pared to the financing need of the risky country. •



   Therefore, from here on forward, we shall only refer to the risky country,
when discussing the regulatory bound b̄ as well as
                                       (        )
                                   q b̄ 1 + n
                           β = min     ,      .                           (14)
                                   n      n
Proposition 6 If the initial financing needs of the risky country exceed the
(regulated) resources of its own banks, g0 > βn, then q = E[θ]. Furthermore,
at q = E[θ], the banks in the risky country are either indifferent between cash
and bonds, or strictly prefer to hold bonds.

                                       12
      Proof: This is a consequence of the analysis above. Note, for example,
that (9) implies χ(β) ≥ 1 at q = E[θ], regardless of β ≥ 0. Proposition (2)
therefore delivers the claim regarding the banks in the risky country. •



      Therefore, if q = E[θ] and χ(β) = 1 for banks in the risky country, the
banks in the risky country might choose cash. But in that case, the regulators
in the risky country might have already set b̄ = 0 in the first place. Without
loss of generality, we can therefore analyze the regulatory problem of the risky
country as the problem of setting the bound b̄, and assume that the banks
in the risky country always hold the maximum amount of bonds allowed,
provided the attractiveness condition

                                   1 ≤ χ(β)                                (15)

is satisfied, see proposition 2. If all bonds are sold to banks in the risky
country (which obviously requires g0 ≤ n + 1), then

                                   g0 = βn                                 (16)

is the market clearing condition. In that case, b̄ implies the market price q
per
                                         g0
                                    q=                                     (17)
                                         b̄
and satisfies
                                   q ≤ E[θ]

If some bonds are sold to safe countries, then

                                   q = E[θ]                                (18)

and
                                         g0
                                    β<      .

                                      13
   The distribution for θ arises from taking into account the losses of risky
country banks, at their maximum bond leverage β. They are
                                     (            !       )

                         ≤ max   1−     g0 − n; 0                       (19)
                                    q
with equality in the second line if all bonds are sold to banks in the risky
country. Nonzero losses occur, if and only if
                                              !

   With these results, we can finally succinctly state the government’s prob-
lem.

Proposition 7 The risky government picks b̄ as well as β, θ, g2, in order to
maximize E[g2 ], subject to

Proof: This collects equations and conditions from above. •



   This can be analyzed further as follows. Define
                                                      !
                               ∗            n

                                         14
Note that θ∗ (q) is that value for θ, at which the expression for the losses in
equation (19) equals zero, in case all bonds are sold to banks in the risky
country. Furthermore, define

                                      y ∗ = g0 − n.                                (28)

Proposition 8 Suppose, all bonds are sold to banks in the risky country.
Then we have

  1. 0 < θ∗ (q) < 1.

  2. The government budget constraint (24) can be rewritten as
                                                  

  3. The right-hand side of (29) takes the value 0 at θ = 0 and the value
     B = g0 /q at θ − 1, is continuous and strictly increasing in θ ∈ [0, 1]. It
     has an upwards-bending kink at θ = θ∗ (q).

  4. Given q and for every y, there is a unique

                                      θ = Θ(y, q) ∈ [0, 1]

     and g2 , solving the government problem of proposition 7. For y < B,
     the solution is g2 = 0 and θ < 1, solving equation (29) at g2 = 0, while
     θ = 1 for y ≥ B and g2 = y − g0 /q. Given q, expected government
     consumption is

   and θ < θ∗ (q) as well as losses in the banking system, L > 0. If
   y ∗ ≤ y ≤ B = g0 /q, then
                                                  q

   while the losses are zero, L = 0.

Proof:

1. This follows from n < g0 .

2. This should be clear.

3. The values at θ = 0 and θ = 1 as well as continuity are easy to verify.
   Given q, define
                                                           !
                              g0

                              q

   which is a quadratic and concave polynomial in θ. The derivative of
   p(θ) is
                         g0
                p0 (θ) =    (1 − 2αθ) + α(g0 − n)
                         q

   Inspecting (19), notice that

   Thus, while p(θ) may reach its maximum for some θ ∈ (0, 1), use the
   second line of (34) and the property (35) or brute-force algebra to
   calculate that
                                       g0
                       p0 (θ∗ (q)) =      (1 − αθ∗ (q)) > 0.

                                       16
       Hence, θ∗ (q) is to the left of the peak of p(θ). Furthermore,
                                                          g0

             g0
       and   q
                  is the derivative of (29) to the right of θ∗ (q), delivering the result
       about the nature of the kink.

    4. This is now obvious.

    5. Calculate.

The attractiveness constraint (15) then demands that

                                          1 ≤ c̄(q).                                (37)

Proposition 9 Suppose, all bonds are sold to banks in the risky country.
Then,

    1. if α < 1, then the solution to the problem of the government is to choose
       the maximum value of q, such that c̄(q) ≥ 1.

    2. If Θ(y; q) is not constant almost surely as a function of y and given q,
       then q < sup{y∈supp(G)} Θ(y; q).

    3. c̄(q) = 1 implies that the expected return Re on investing one unit in
       the risky government bond satisfies
                                            E [Θ(y; q)]
                                     Re =               ≤ 1.                        (38)

      Furthermore, this inequality is strict, if “max” binds with positive prob-
      ability in (36). In that case, banks in safe countries will not purchase
      any risky bonds.

Proof:

    1. Note that expected government consumption E[g2 ](q) given in equation
      (30) is an increasing function of q. The government will therefore pick
      the maximum q compatible with the attractiveness condition.

    2. If q ≥ sup{y∈supp(G)} Θ(y; q) and thus q > Θ(y; q) with positive prob-
      ability in realizations of y, then c̄(q) < 1, violating the attractiveness
      condition.

The second part of the proposition means that, in order to attract the banks
to buy the bonds, they have to earn a profit from holding these bonds on
occasions, in order to make it worth their while. The proposition now also
gives us the key risk shifting insight of this paper, and the insight that bonds
of the risky country are held by their home banks, if feasible. Given that
the risky government will drive c̄(n) to (just above) unity, it follows that the
expected return on investing one unit of resources in the debt of that country

                                        18
is below the safe return, if bank insolvencies occur at all in the defaulting
country. Since regulators in safe countries would strictly regulate their banks
so that no losses are borne by the governments there, the risks are entirely
borne by the banks, the expected return is what matters, and they would
not invest in the bonds of the risky country.
        As for the common central bank and the sovereign default risk shifted
onto its balance books, note that its expected losses are given by
                              "                         (                !)#
                                                          g0
        E[LCB ](q) = E (1 − αΘ(y; q)) max 0; (q − Θ(y; q)) − n               (40)
                                                          q
as a function of q.

Proposition 10 If q = E[θ], then b̄ = 0 solves the problem of the risky
government, i.e., it is best to sell all bonds to foreign banks5 . In that case,
                                                    (        )
                                                   q
                                      θ = min 1; y                           (41)
                                                   g0
                                                g0
                                     g2 = y − θ                              (42)
                                                q
With positive probability, the government will not default, P (θ = 1) > 0.

Proof: This can be seen by examining (24): the left-hand side is constant
or increasing in β, increasing in q and increasing in θ, noting that θαβn/q ≤
θαg0 /q ≤ g0 /q. Finally, multiply (24) or
                                                        g0
                                         y − g2 = θ
                                                        q
with q and take expectations to find

                                  E[θ] (E[y] − E[g2 ]) = E[θ]g0

or E[g2 ] > 0 due to (1). That, however, can only happen with P (θ = 1) > 0.

        I exclude the case q = 0.

                                               19
Intuitively, if there is no price gain to be obtained from selling bonds to
own-country banks, compared to the actuarily fair value E[θ], then it is best
to get the best possible bond price by not also not risking exposure to bank
losses in the second period, since they will be “priced in” by bond holders.

Proposition 11 The complete characterization of the solution to the gov-
ernment problem is as follows.

    1. If g0 > n + 1, then all bonds are sold to foreign banks as in proposi-
       tion 10.

    2. If g0 ≤ n + 1, then compare the solution of proposition 9 from selling
       all bonds to home country banks to the solution from selling all bonds
       to foreign banks given in proposition 10. Pick the solution, which offers
       the highest expected government consumption, i.e. the solution with the
       highest q.

Proof: This follows now from propositions 7, 9 and 10. •




3     Numerical illustrations

3.1     A two-point distribution
For an analytical case, consider a two-point distribution {yL , yH } for y, with

                               0 < y L < g0 < y H

Let pH = P (y = yH ), pL = 1 − pH and 0 < pH < 1. Suppose that α = 1, so
that the central bank only bears losses in the case that the country defaults.

                                       20
Finally, suppose that n is negligible compared to g0 : we shall equate it to
zero, unless we need to divide by it. Assume that g0 < 1, so that own-
country resources at the home banks (per the initial deposits of households)
are sufficient for purchasing all bonds.
   Per proposition 11, calculate the solution given in proposition 9, when all
bonds are sold to home country banks. With n = 0, it follows that

                                    y ∗ = g0
                                 θ∗ (q) = q

It follows from proposition 8, that bank losses will occur for y = yL , but not
for y = yH . Furthermore, the government will be in default for y = yL and
g2,L = 0 will be zero in that state. The government budget constraint for
y = yH reads
                                            g0
                              yH = g2,H + θH
                                            q
and the government will be able to obtain positive consumption g2,H > 0 for
this state only if θH = 1: we shall thus proceed with the assumption that
the government can feasibly choose θH = 1 and verify it. With these results,
one can now examine the attractiveness condition 37, restated as

                        n ≤ c̄(q)n
                                            !       !
                                      1
                            = pH        − 1 g0 + n
                                      q
or as
                                    q≤1                                   (43)

with n = 0. Thus, the government chooses q = 1 with the appropriate date-0
regulation, and consumes
                                g2,H = yH − g0

in the high income state. It follows from proposition 11, that the government
cannot possibly do better than this, since q ≤ 1. Thus, selling all bonds to

                                      21
home country banks is a solution to the government problem. Since the
government must necessarily be in default in the yL -state, if q = 1, it also
follows that this is the unique solution.
   In the low income state, the repayment fraction is given by equation (31)
and thus by                                 s
                                                     yL
                                 θL = 1 −       1−      .                 (44)
                                                     g0
Note that the expected return on investing one unit of resources in the gov-
ernment bond is given by
                                            s
                             e                       yL
                           R = 1 − pL 1 −               <1                (45)
                                                     g0
and that therefore banks in solvent countries will be regulated to invest in
these only at their own peril, and then choose not do so, verifying our initial
conjecture. Finally, note that the losses to the common central bank occur
due the bankruptcy of the country in the y = yL state. The expected losses
are given by (40) and calculate to

                      E[LCB ](q = 1) = pL (1 − θL )2 g0
                                            = pL (g0 − yL ) ,             (46)

since the central bank bears the entire default burden of the difference be-
tween the promised repayment g0 on the bonds minus the actual repayment
yL in the default state.


3.2    A numerical example
To gain some more insights, it is useful to examine some numerical cases.
   Suppose that α = 1, g0 = 1, n = 0.2 and that y is uniformly distributed
on [, 2] for some tiny  > 0. Note that (1) holds “nearly” with equality,
which implies that selling only to foreign banks as in proposition 10 yields a
value very close to q = 0.5, as well as E[g2 ] very close to zero.

                                        22
   When selling only to home banks as in proposition 9, the numerical calcu-
lation yields q = 0.835, E[g2 ] = 0.163 and the expected losses to the central
bank are E[LCB ] = 0.198. Since the bond price as well as expected second-
period consumption of the government is higher than in the solution, when
selling only to foreign banks, the government will prefer this solution.
   For the equilibrium q, figure 2 shows the relation given by the right-hand
side of equation (29) between the default rate θ and the income y. Notice
how the relationship first follows a quadratic, when taking into account the
losses to insolvent banks, and then follows a linear relationship, when banks
remain solvent.
   For the equilibrium q, figure 3 flips the relationship shown in (2) and
shows the solution for θ, given the income realization y. Notice how the
solution first follows the square root law of equation (31) and then follows a
linear relationship for y ≥ y ∗ , until reaching the full repayment point θ = 1.
   In figure 4, the dashed line shows c̄(q), while the solid line starting at
zero and then sloping upwards near q = 0.6 shows E[g2 ](q). The government
chooses q as high as possible, subject to the attractiveness constraint, i.e.,
subject to the constraint that the dashed line is just above unity, indicated
by the horizontal solid line.
   The expected losses to the common central bank as a function of q are
shown in figure 5. They are increasing with q, since higher q means larger
losses in the default states.
   Judged entirely from the perspective of the expected losses, the common
central bank would prefer the country to regulate the banks such that a lower
q results: this makes the banks more profitable, induces fewer losses on the
central bank, but implies lower expected consumption for the risky country
in the second period.

4     Conclusions
This paper seeks to understand the interplay between banks, bank regula-
tion, sovereign default risk and central bank guarantees in a monetary union.
The empirical literature has documented an increasing exposure and shift to-
wards home sovereign bonds, in particular in troubled countries in the Euro
zone during the Euro zone crisis. It has found support for the risk-shifting
hypothesis, i.e., that these portfolio strategies enable banks and sovereign
regulators to shift some of the sovereign default risks onto the common cen-
tral bank. The paper at hand has provided a model of these developments.
I assume that risk neutral bankers can use sovereign bonds for repurchase
agreements with a common central bank, and that their sovereign partially
backs up any losses, should the banks not be able to repurchase the bonds.
I argued that regulators in risky countries have an incentive to allow their
banks to hold home risky bonds and risk defaults, while regulators in other
“safe” countries will impose tighter regulation, and indeed, regulate their
banks such that all losses have to be borne privately. Consequently, banks
in safe countries will hold these bonds only if their price is at least actuarily
fair, while banks in the risky country may be allowed by their regulators to
risk defaults, since these defaults happen precisely when the country is in
default itself, and therefore no longer can and will pay for their share of the
bank losses. As a result, governments in risky countries get to borrow more
cheaply, effectively shifting some of the potential sovereign default losses on
the common central bank. I have analyzed the interplay between the various
agencies, and illustrated the result with a numerical example.
