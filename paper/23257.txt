                                               ABSTRACT

Do information differences across U.S. physicians contribute to treatment disparities? This paper uses
a unique new dataset to evaluate how changes in physician access to a decision-relevant drug database
affect prescribing decisions. Our results indicate that doctors using the reference have a significantly
greater propensity to prescribe generic drugs, are faster to begin prescribing new generics, and prescribe
a more diverse set of products. Notably, physicians using the reference database are not faster to prescribe
new branded drugs. Given that a new generic drug resembles its branded equivalent clinically, these
results are consistent with database users responding primarily to the increased accessibility of non-clinical
information such as drug price and insurance formulary data; the results also suggest improvements
to physician information access have important aggregate implications for the costs and efficiency
of medical care. We address possible selection effects in physician types by relying on within-doctor
variation and an instrument for adoption timing that is based on the marketing strategy of the drug
reference firm.

1       Introduction

National health expenditures exceed three trillion dollars annually in the United States,
account for nearly twenty percent of U.S. GDP, and are to a considerable extent publicly
funded.1 Yet, research by the Dartmouth Atlas Project and Cooper et al (2015) finds sub-
stantial, systematic disparities in both the extent of health spending and the quality of
medical care across U.S. regions, including threefold per-capita expenditure gaps resulting
from inefficient variations in care—differences consistent neither with patient preferences
nor with underlying medical conditions.2 These findings imply significant gains could be
achieved by improving efficiency in low-peforming regions, but this requires first identify-
ing the specific mechanisms that cause treatment disparities. Among the many potential
mechanisms that have been proposed, which include supply, demand, regulatory, and pric-
ing differences, perhaps the most important and intriguing is that disparities result from
a lack of uniformity in physicians’ information about available therapies.3 The possibility
that information problems underlie observed treatment disparities has inspired calls for the
expanded use of medical decision aids, but the difficulties inherent to measuring information
differences have led to a paucity of systematic evidence on their actual importance.4
      To contribute to our understanding of how physicians’ information access impacts treat-
ment choices, we assemble and evaluate a unique, new dataset in which treatment decisions
and access to a decision-relevant database are observed for a panel of over 125,000 individual
doctors during 132 consecutive months.5 Our data cover the universe of U.S. physicians and
capture Medicare patients and the privately insured as well as those with Medicaid or no
coverage.6 To meet the data demands of empirically identifying the influence of information
on treatment choices, which requires a medical context with significant information dynam-
ics, we consider prescribing decisions for cholesterol drugs during January 2000–December
2010, during which 12 nationwide product innovations occurred.7 The differential response

     The Dartmouth Atlas Project has documented healthcare disparities for Medicare patients over decades
(Wennberg et al 1996, Gawande 2009, and Chernew et al 2009); Cooper et al (2015) finds related disparities
among the privately insured population. See also Wennberg and Wennberg (2003), Dartmouth Atlas (2007).

     These latter categories are new relative to existing evidence on healthcare variations; see note #2 above.

     Cholesterol drugs are very widely used. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that
approximately 71 million U.S. adults suffer from chronic hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia, conditions
in which abnormal levels of cholesterol or lipids are present in the bloodstream. These conditions are asso-
ciated with heart disease, heart attack risk, and premature death; accordingly, sales of cholesterol therapies
accounted for over $18 billion U.S. dollars in 2011 (Ledford 2013). See also Mozaffarian, et al (2014). Drug
introductions are listed in Table 1.

across physicians to these repeated drug introductions is essential to our analysis, because it
allows us to isolate the influence of information on treatment decisions, while accounting for
physician characteristics that simultaneously affect both prescribing and database adoption.
      Our results indicate physicians that begin using the drug reference database significantly
increase their likelihood of prescribing a generic drug relative to brand-name therapies, and
thus increase their generic prescription share—one of the key efficiency metrics emphasized
in the Dartmouth Atlas in documenting prescription drug variations.8 Database users are
also faster to begin prescribing newly released generics, an effect notably absent for new
branded drugs. These findings suggest database users may be responding primarily to the
increased salience of non-clinical information included in the database—including whether a
particular drug is currently covered by a patient’s insurance plan, and plan-specific pricing—
as a generic drug and its branded equivalent share essentially identical clinical attributes. We
find that treatment differences decline significantly more across database users than across
non-users during the sample period, while the actual diversity of a user’s own prescribing
increases on average following adoption. Access to detailed information about competing
treatments thus appears to raise efficiency and reduce disparities, but importantly, these
effects do not appear to come at the expense of patient-sensitive decision making.
      Because access to the drug database is not randomly assigned—doctors choose whether
and when to subscribe— identifying the causal effects of database access is challenging. Pre-
scription patterns of subscribing doctors may look different from those of non-subscribers not
due to any effects of the database itself, but instead due to differences in the types of doctors
who choose to subscribe. With this challenge in mind, our analysis relies heavily on within-
doctor variation: rather than estimating effects by comparing database users to non-users,
we focus on comparisons of a doctor’s own prescriptions before versus after she begins using
the database. To account for the possibility that dynamic prescribing determinants may
be correlated with adoption timing within a location, such as changes in drug advertising,
our main specifications also include zipcode-month effects; we verify that our main results
also hold in the presence of doctor-specific trends. We further evaluate specifications that
treat the timing of doctors’ reference adoption as endogenous. Our approach is guided by
observing that the network of reference users has grown primarily through a ‘word-of-mouth’
marketing strategy, whereby users tell friends and colleagues about its value. Accordingly,
we use neighboring physicians’ lagged reference adoption choices as an instrument that is
plausibly independent of patient-specific prescription decisions. Taken together, these spec-
ifications support a causal interpretation of our main results—i.e., that using the database
caused a small but statistically significant change in prescribing patterns.
      Consistent with the regional disparities documented in the Dartmouth Atlas, our data

reveal substantial prescribing variation across the universe of individual U.S. physicians, par-
ticularly with respect to generics and new drug adoption. Doctors differ widely in generic
prescription shares (mean 56.4 percent, standard deviation 24.3 percent) in December 2010,
and span the full range from no generics (5th percentile) to only generics (95th percentile).9
We find that these generic shares are strongly and positively correlated within physician
across patient insurance types (e.g. private vs. Medicare), suggesting patient cost sharing
is unlikely to explain the observed heterogeneity in prescribing patterns. Moreover, with
respect to drug adoption, some U.S. physicians begin prescribing a newly-approved choles-
terol drug immediately, while others delay for a year or more before prescribing it, a pattern
strongly evident even among new generic drugs. Six months after the introduction of generic
lovastatin, for example, the molecular equivalent of Mevacor, the generic version accounted
for only 83 percent of the drug’s prescriptions; by contrast, the generic share reached essen-
tially 100 percent by December 2010. This delayed substitution is evident for each of the
generic entrants we observe, contributing to wide differences across doctors in the overall
prescription share of generic drugs, and to large corresponding gaps in cost.10
      Our empirical analysis indicates that some of this observed prescription heterogeneity
is explained by differences across doctors in information access. Our most conservative esti-
mates indicate that, after obtaining database access, a physician user increases the likelihood
of prescribing a new generic drug within its first market year by 1.4 percent; after correct-
ing for the potential endogeneity of adoption timing, this rises to a 6.4 percent increase.
Regarding diversity, database users increase the number of unique drugs prescribed each
month by a modest but highly significant 0.030 drugs, reducing the prescription Herfindahl-
Hirschman index by 0.001 points. In line with both results, users increase the monthly
likelihood of prescribing new and old generic drugs by 1.6 and 2.4 percent, respectively, af-
ter database adoption, while reducing the likelihood of prescribing a new branded drug by
0.42 percent. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the resulting increase in users’
generic prescription shares contributes to substantial aggregate cost savings, which amount
to approximately $1 billion annually for prescription drugs alone.11
      This paper is related to an extensive literature documenting wide healthcare disparities
across U.S. regions, including the Dartmouth Atlas (e.g. Wennberg et al 1996) and its anal-
ysis of prescription drug use among Medicare patients (Munson et al 2013), and Cooper et al
(2015) for the privately insured. We contribute to this work by first documenting prescription
disparities for the universe of U.S. prescribers and patients with all insurance types within
a major therapeutic area. Second, relying on the unusual level of detail and coverage in the
dataset we have assembled, we identify a highly significant link between observed dispari-

ties and a specific mechanism—physician information differences—that we find is partially
responsible for these disparities. While our data are broader with respect to physician and
patient coverage, our empirical strategy is demanding (our dataset includes over 200 million
observations) and we therefore focus on a single clinical area while Dartmouth Atlas and
Cooper et al (2015) cover a comprehensive set of treatments; aggregating our physician-level
data to Dartmouth Atlas regions, we nevertheless find that locations with high generic pre-
scription shares in our dataset also have high generic shares for Medicare overall (correlation
44.4 percent), as well as lower per-capita medical spending for prescription drugs (correlation
23.9 percent) and non-drug healthcare (correlation 12.4 percent)—patterns that underscore
the highly systematic nature of U.S. disparities in care, and suggest the potential value of
extending our physician-level analysis to other clinical settings.12
      Our paper is also closely related to work aimed at evaluating the impact of information
technology on economic decisions and outcomes.13 Agents’ electronic information access can
affect productivity (Solow 1987) and has been specifically shown to improve performance in
emergency healthcare delivery (Athey and Stern 2002). However, in routine medical contexts
the evidence is less clear: Dranove et al. (2014) finds that the adoption of electronic medical
records (EMR) raised hospital costs on average, with an important exception—adopting
locations with an abundance of industrial I.T. did in fact experience cost declines. Our
results complement this latter finding in that the medical decision-support tool we study is
standardized, likely to a greater extent than EMR, yet we observe that both the intensity
and impact of its use differ substantially across physicians in the data. In particular, we find
that the efficiency impact of database use is systematically larger among adopters using the
database intensively to search for information about the cholesterol drugs we study.
      In finding that use of an information database tilts prescribing away from branded
drugs and toward generics, our results contribute to important work highlighting the in-
fluence of information on tastes for generic products. Bronnenberg et al (2015) find that
relatively informed buyers are more likely to choose a generic version, for example when pur-
chasing an over-the-counter drug, suggesting consumer misinformation contributes to the
brand premium for health products. Our results add nuance to this finding, suggesting that
even among highly trained and educated U.S. physicians, access to current product infor-
mation including pricing increases the propensity to prescribe a generic and decreases that
for branded drugs. We find that the impact of database access is systematically larger for
  12
     Our data do not include individual patient characteristics, precluding a direct extension of Munson et
al (2013) to non-Medicare patients, as well as a quantitative welfare analysis. This aspect of our dataset
further precludes estimating a model featuring prescription dynamics within each patient-physician pair, as
in Crawford and Shum (2005) or Dickstein (2015).

han, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt (2002); Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2003); Hubbard (2003); Forman, Goldfarb, and
Greenstein (2005); Bloom et al. (2009); Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2012); Agha (2014).

physicians located far from the information frontier, and that dynamics in the product space
(drug entry) may be important in explaining our results, as database users are also faster to
begin prescribing a newly-introduced generic version. In finding that physicians’ information
access affects decisions made on behalf of patients, and that prescribing is highly correlated
within a physician across patients regardless of insurance coverage, our results are further
aligned with Brot-Goldberg et al (2015) and Cutler et al (2015), which find evidence that
physician preferences are key in explaining treatment decisions.
      Our results add to the literature examining the determinants of new medical technology
diffusion. Classic work by Coleman, Katz, and Menzel (1957, 1996) finds that new phar-
maceutical products diffuse unevenly across medical practitioners: physicians that interact
more frequently with other physicians are more likely to adopt early. Relatedly, Skinner and
Staiger (2007) provide evidence that certain U.S. states have a systematic tendency to adopt
early across technology types as varied as beta blockers and hybrid corn (Griliches 1957).
We find that physician access to a digital database also speeds new drug adoption—but only
for generics; and, to account for local differences in the tendency to adopt both drugs and
the database early, which could reflect general differences in unobserved factors such as drug
advertising, we emphasize specifications that include both physician and zipcode-by-month
fixed effects.14 In focusing on individual-level drug adoption, our work is also closely re-
lated to Crawford and Shum (2005) and Dickstein (2015), who estimate models of physician
learning, and Agha and Molitor (2015), who study the diffusion of cancer drugs.15
      More broadly, our analysis complements research on general theories of technology
diffusion featuring agents with imperfect information. Such theories can be shown to explain
large existing differences in productivity across locations (Solow 1956, Arrow 1969, Parente
and Prescott 1994, Comin and Hobijn 2004) as identified in Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare
(1997) and Casselli and Coleman (2006), for example.16 We introduce a unique dataset
in which a sequence of technology adoption decisions is clearly observed at the individual
level for the universe of U.S. prescribers, allowing our study to speak both to micro-level
mechanisms driving diffusion and to the aggregate consequences of these mechanisms.
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in
our analysis. Section 3 describes a simple model of prescription choice and our estimation
framework. Section 4 presents the empirical results, Sections 5 and 6 discuss interpretation,
and Section 7 concludes.
  14
     We also consider the influence of local differences in mandatory substitution regulations that could be
particularly important for explaining generic diffusion in the data, and find that the effects of database access
are evident among physicians practicing both within and outside states with a mandatory substitution law.
  15
     See also Escarce (1996), who studies physicians’ decisions to adopt a surgical technology.
  16
     The idea that underlying heterogeneity across agents could influence technology diffusion also relates our
work to neoclassical models of technology adoption, e.g. David (1966) and Manuelli and Seshadri (2014).

2      Data and Descriptive Evidence
Evaluating the influence of information access on new pharmaceutical drug diffusion requires
detailed measures of drug innovations and individual prescribers’ treatment decisions, infor-
mation usage, and characteristics. We introduce each of these measures below and go on to
describe physicians’ prescribing of new and existing pharmaceutical drugs.


2.1     U.S. Innovations in Chronic Hypercholesterolemia and
        Dyslipidemia Therapy
At the start of our sample period in January 2000, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
were understood to be the most effective pharmaceutical therapies for hypercholesterolemia,
and there were five such products available: Lescol, Lipitor, Mevacor, Pravachol, and Zo-
cor.17 The most common non-statin used to treat high cholesterol was Niaspan, which is
also included in our sample. Thereafter, twelve new cholesterol or lipid control therapies
were introduced, including new formulations, combinations, and versions.18 These include
three new molecular entities, Crestor, Lovaza, and Zetia; three generic versions, lovastatin
(Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), and simvastatin (Zocor); two new formulations, Alto-
prev (extended-release Mevacor) and Lescol XL (extended-release Lescol); and four new drug
combinations, Advicor (extended-release niacin and Mevacor), Pravigard PAC (aspirin and
Pravachol), Vytorin (Zetia and Zocor), Simcor (extended-release niacin and Zocor). Each
new therapy received nationwide approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
on a known, drug-specific date (Table 1). All products are described in Appendix A.1.
      While these 18 products are therapeutic substitutes, in that they aim at a similar clini-
cal endpoint—cholesterol or trigliceride reduction—they are only imperfect substitutes: each
product features distinctive characteristics relevant for the prescribing decision. First, many
but not all cholesterol therapies are pure statins, which act to reduce cholesterol synthe-
sis in the liver by inhibiting a specific coenzyme; these include Lescol (fluvastatin), Lipitor
(atorvastatin), Mevacor (lovastatin), Pravachol (pravastatin), Zocor (simvastatin), Crestor
(rosuvastatin), Altoprev (extended-release lovastatin), and Lescol XL (extended-release flu-
vastatin). Other products rely on different mechanisms of action: Zetia (ezetimibe), for
example, is distinct in that it achieves cholesterol reduction by reducing intestinal absorp-
tion of cholesterol. A second distinction involves therapeutic intensity. High doses of Lipitor
and Crestor are more effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol than
  17
    Cannon et al (2004).
  18
    To ensure adequate coverage in the data, we consider all cholesterol therapies introduced by December
2008, but not those introduced after this date. For the same reason, our analysis excludes Baycol, a drug
that was available in January 2000 but withdrawn from the market in August 2001.



                                                       6
alternatives (Law et al 2003). Side effects are also relevant; evidence suggests, for example,
that high doses of Lipitor and Crestor may increase the incidence of adverse reactions, while
combination therapies such as Vytorin may in certain cases be more appropriate care for
patients with severe cholesterol abnormalities (Kastelein et al 2008).
      More subtly, clinical evidence suggests the benefits and risks associated with statins
are heterogeneous across patients; randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) indicate, for exam-
ple, that the benefits of statin use are higher for patients with diabetes, negligible among
those with prior heart failure, and vary with age; risks and side-effects also vary with statin
intensity, age, weight, comorbidities, and so on (Brooks et al 2014). Adding to this, patients
with ‘complex’ attributes are often underrepresented in RCTs, raising clinical uncertainty
and, accordingly, the likelihood that patient preferences—including willingness to suffer side
effects and to pay for medications—may influence the prescribing choice (Brooks et al 2014).
      Physicians’ decisions about which drugs to prescribe are further affected by the evolution
of clinical information as new trials are completed—particularly head-to-head studies aimed
at establishing the relative efficacy of one drug therapy over another.19 These ongoing
changes in clinical evidence, combined with an expanding set of available products and the
accompanying evolution in prices and insurance coverage (e.g. Duggan and Scott Morton
2010), suggest that physicians may turn to drug references that help to ensure patient-specific
prescription decisions are based on accurate information.


2.2     Prescriptions by U.S. Physicians
To measure physicians’ prescribing of new and existing therapies aimed at cholesterol and
lipid control over time, we use physician-level prescription data for the 18 drugs described
above from the IMS Health Xponent database. These data are provided at a monthly
frequency by drug during the period January 2000 through December 2010, and cover each
of the 280,622 U.S. physicians associated with at least ten cholesterol-drug prescriptions
during January to December 2010; this low threshold for inclusion implies that our dataset
captures essentially the universe of U.S. cholesterol drug prescriptions during this period. For
each product and month, we observe the number of prescriptions written by each physician
and filled through a U.S. pharmacy. Beginning in January 2006, the data also include
information on the method of payment used to fill each prescription (Medicaid, Medicare
  19
    For example, an RCT completed in 2004 demonstrated that for patients with severe cholesterol abnor-
mality, the incrementally larger reductions achieved by Lipitor resulted in fewer deaths and major coronary
events relative to patients taking Pravachol (Cannon et al 2004). Another such study released in 2008 found
that, while Vytorin achieved larger cholesterol reductions than simvastatin, the two drugs were observably
identical when it came to the thickness of arterial plaque buildup (atherosclerosis); adding to this, a second
study in 2008 found a positive association between Vytorin and cancer (Rossebo 2008) that was later reversed
(Cannon et al 2015).



                                                          7
Part D, Cash, or Commercial Third-Party Insurance). Importantly, each physician in the
dataset is identified by a unique medical education number, name (first name, last name,
middle name), and location (a five-digit U.S. zipcode). These identifiers enable us to match
individual prescribers with their observed pharmaceutical information technology use.
     To ensure that our sample includes only those physicians actively prescribing cholesterol
drugs during the entire sample period, we restrict attention to the 128,043 physicians that
prescribe ten or more statins both during January to December 2000, and during January to
December 2010; this allows us to abstract from potential differences in prescribing that may
surround a physician’s entry into or exit from medical practice, and also ensures that we have
adequate data on database adopters’ pre-adoption and post-adoption prescribing patterns.
The final prescription dataset includes over 200 million observations (132 months × 128,043
physicians × up to 18 drugs). Summary statistics appear in Table 2, and additional details
regarding data assembly and the Xponent database appear in Appendix A.2.


2.3    Drug Information Access by U.S. Physicians
To construct an index for the extent of physicians’ pharmaceutical information access, we
use novel physician-level data from the private firm that owns and operates a prominent
electronic reference for pharmaceutical products. The data include a monthly indicator for
whether a U.S. physician is a registered user of the reference database, and this suggests the
database is widely used: by December 2010, 45.1 percent of sample physicians had established
an individual database account (Table 2). The data also include information about registered
physicians’ actual use of the reference during the sample period: we observe a lower bound on
the number of times a physician looks up a cholesterol drug using the database. This proxy
is 3.83 on average, and the data indicate that, while 24.2 percent of physicians are registered
database users in the average month, only 13.1 percent of physicians use the database to
look up one of the cholesterol drugs considered in our study. It is for this latter group of
physicians that database access is likely to be relevant to the cholesterol-drug prescribing
outcomes we consider; in Section 5, we thus consider whether the observed intensity of
database use explains variation in its impact on prescribing.
      The drug reference contains information that is, in principle, relevant for improving the
match between patient characteristics and available pharmaceutical products. At any point
in time, the drug reference contains detailed information about each available U.S. FDA-
approved medication. This information is obtained from the medical literature, specialist
recommendations, clinical guidelines, manufacturer labeling, standard medical references,
and FDA drug safety alerts and is updated continually; the results of this ongoing research
are condensed into drug-specific monographs that may be accessed through the electronic
database interface. Beyond standard clinical information such as contraindications, cautions,

                                                  8
adverse reactions, safety, monitoring, and pharmacology, the reference monographs also in-
clude a set of additional variables for each product that may affect prescribing decisions.
Specifically, the monographs include retail pricing and formulary status information for each
drug, drug interaction information, FDA warnings, and off-label and pediatric usage guide-
lines. Each physician customizes the tool with respect to formularies, selecting those relevant
to their decision needs; it is then straightforward for any drug to check copay tiers, formu-
lary alternatives, generic substitutions, criteria for prior authorizations, and quantity limits,
facets of a formulary that are subtle but often have significant consequences for patient costs.
The database includes separate entries for each branded product and each generic, based on
product-specific information such as available formulations, dosing, indications, manufac-
turer, and pricing. The database is updated to reflect both the current set of products and
formulary details, as well as the current state of knowledge regarding drug characteristics
and clinical practice. Importantly, information for new drugs becomes available around the
time the drug is released by the FDA for commercial prescription.
      Because the drug reference combines available information into a single, current mono-
graph rather than contributing new or proprietary drug information, it is best viewed as a
tool that makes it convenient for physicians to quickly access condensed clinical, insurance,
and pricing information about a drug. Doctors commonly use the reference to check dosages,
contraindications, and coverage details, but rely on other sources, such as medical journals
or more encyclopedic references, for information such as a drug’s results in clinical trials.
      For our study, it is critical to understand what drives database adoption. Figure 1 indi-
cates that use of the reference database during the sample period is not random, but differs
according to observable doctor characteristics.20 Throughout the sample period, physicians
are more likely to have adopted the database if they had graduated from a top-ranked U.S.
medical school (Panel A) and had graduated recently (Panel B); males are also more likely
to adopt (Panel C). Doctors in obstetrics and gynecology (Panel E), and those practicing in
the U.S. South (Panel F) appear systematically slower to adopt the database.
      Presently, new physician adopters tend to learn about the reference while in medical
school. However, because the physicians in our dataset had all completed medical school
before the database became available, their adoption decisions are more likely to have been
driven by marketing or peer effects. Documents filed along with the reference firm’s initial
public offering state that its marketing strategy was, in fact, an informal ‘word-of-mouth’
approach, and that throughout the sample period, the network of reference users grew over
time primarily through users telling friends and colleagues about its value. The filings state
that this strategy had been both highly effective and inexpensive relative to the alternative
  20
   Physician characteristics were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician
Compare database, and were matched based on physician first name, last name, and five-digit zipcode.



                                                       9
of hiring a dedicated sales force.21 Thus, while our data indicate that physicians are visibly
idiosyncratic in their adoption timing, a doctor is much more likely a user if a high share of
other doctors in her zipcode are also users—consistent with the firm’s reported marketing
strategy. Moreover, only 16 percent of the variation in the time to adoption is explained by
zipcode fixed effects, indicating that within-zipcode dynamics are quite important.
      Regarding adoption motives, the main reason doctors cite for registering is convenience:
database use reportedly yields meaningful time savings. By contrast, it is unlikely that price
was an important factor in physicians’ adoption decisions. Access was always available
through a free version of the database application, which included the core drug reference
tools (e.g. dosage lookups) that are relevant to our study. Additional features were available
with a paid subscription, but the annual fee for this version was low, never above $200.
      It should also be noted that database adoption appears to be mostly an individual
decision, even for doctors in group practices. Large clinics and physician groups sometimes
purchase site licenses for institution-level access to the database as part of broader I.T.
initiatives; however, some of the benefits of using the database require individual registration,
and most doctors therefore have individual accounts even if their group or clinic has a site
license. Nevertheless, to check whether doctors practicing in groups tend to synchronize their
database adoption, which would suggest the influence of a group-level adoption decision, we
used the 2014 CMS Physician Compare database to identify doctors who were likely working
in the same practice during our sample period. Among over 7,000 groups we identified, just
38 were ones in which all doctors in the group adopted the database at the same time. In
light of this, it seems unlikely that site-level access or group adoption decisions are primary
drivers of the physician-level database use we consider.


2.4       Descriptive Evidence
The data provide suggestive indications that incomplete information may affect physicians’
prescribing as well as the rate and extent of new product diffusion, depicted in Figure 2.
Consider the statistics presented in Table 3, which quantify differences in prescribing across
U.S. physicians for the class of cholesterol medications evaluated. The statistics in Panel A
provide evidence for the December 2010 cross section. It is apparent that the pronounced
variation in cholesterol-drug prescribing previously found among Medicare patients (e.g.
Munson et al 2013, Brooks et al 2014) is also present within the overall population both across
zipcodes (columns 5–8) and individual physicians (columns 1–4). The share of prescriptions
accounted for by generics ranges from zero to one in column 4; moreover, while the average
physician prescribes a generic in 56.4 percent of cases, the standard deviation is also large
 21
      By contrast, sales force marketing is standard for new pharmaceuticals. See Datta and Dave (2013).



                                                         10
(24.3 percent), and spans the full range from zero (5th percentile physician) to 100 percent
(95th percentile). The relative heterogeneity across doctors is even wider for the specific
drugs described in columns 1 through 3, and across all columns, the idiosyncratic behavior
of individual physicians appears to be important: for the vast majority of zipcodes, there is
substantial within-zipcode variation in generic shares across local physicians (Table A.1).
      Even if physicians were perfectly informed, variation in prescribing could result from an
uneven distribution of patient characteristics. For example, Lipitor is a high-intensity statin
that may be preferable for patients with a severe cholesterol abnormality, the incidence of
which may cluster geographically. Similarly, risk-averse patients may prefer an established
drug over a new one—even if the new drug is simply a new generic version—if they perceive
the quality of a new product as uncertain relative to another option. Such underlying patient
heterogeneity may partially explain the slow and incomplete diffusion of new drug varieties,
which is apparent for each new drug except simvastatin (Figure 2 and Table 1, column 3).
It may also explain why a substantial fraction of the variation across doctors observed in
columns 1–4 remains even after aggregating to the zipcode level (columns 5–8).
      Unobserved patient heterogeneity likely explains some of this variation in prescribing,
but columns 1, 2, and 3 indicate that additional factors are also likely present. Specifically,
these columns assess within-physician changes in the prescription of new generic products.
The advantage of focusing on these columns is that it is possible to compare prescribing of
a branded product with its molecularly-equivalent generic, two distinct drugs that have no
relevant clinical differences. And, by examining changes over time in the generic share of
molecule-specific prescriptions—e.g the share of simvastatin plus Zocor prescriptions that
are accounted for by generic simvastatin—it is possible to determine whether stable patient
heterogeneity is likely to be the only explanation for variations in care. For each of the three
generic drug introductions (lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin), the data indicate that
physicians differ in their use of generics in the short run, six months after generic entry,
and that substitution toward generics is initially incomplete at this point (Panel B). By
contrast, in the long run, physicians differ substantially less: nearly complete substitution
toward generics is observed for each of the three products (Panel C).22 This pattern of
delayed substitution between two molecularly equivalent products strongly suggests factors
other than time-invariant patient heterogeneity contribute to prescribing differences among
cholesterol drugs, and is consistent with the influence of information frictions.
      Beyond cost implications, these same factors may impede the diffusion of new non-
generic therapies, with consequences for health outcomes. The data indicate that physicians
are slow to begin prescribing new molecular entities, new drug combinations, and new dosage
  22
     By December 2010, physicians had broadly switched away from prescribing Mevacor, Pravachol, and
Zocor. However, six months after each respective patent expired, generic prescribing was far less prevalent
for each molecule, though the generic version was in each case already substantially less expensive.

forms—branded products not facing generic competition. Figure 2 shows that diffusion
curves differ considerably across new drugs; Figure 3 plots the gradual diffusion of Crestor
across U.S. zipcodes; and Table 1 describes how the time lag in months between a drug’s
approval and its initial prescription varies across U.S. physicians for each drug introduction.
The average physician delays prescribing a new drug for 20.3 months among the new products
considered in our analysis; the standard deviation is even larger (22.1 months), and this
adoption lag ranges from zero to 122 months, indicating some physicians adopt immediately
and others had yet to adopt the first new drug by the end of our sample period (Table 2).
      Unlike the Dartmouth Atlas and Cooper et al (2015) studies, which cover a compre-
hensive set of treatments and analyze regional differences in the cost and quality of care, we
analyze behavior at the physician level and focus on the specific clinical decision of which
cholesterol drug to prescribe. However, it is nevertheless useful to ask whether the patterns
we observe for this context are consistent with the broader treatment patterns documented
by the Atlas. Aggregating our physician-level data to Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs)
and comparing against data from the Dartmouth Atlas project, we find that locations with
high generic prescription shares in our dataset also have high generic shares for Medicare
overall (correlation 44.4 percent), as well as lower per-capita medical spending for prescrip-
tion drugs (correlation 23.9 percent) and non-drug healthcare (correlation 12.4 percent). As
noted above, these patterns underscore the highly systematic nature of U.S. disparities in
care, and suggest that the disparities in physicians’ prescribing of cholesterol drugs may
reflect some of the same factors that drive disparities in treatment decisions more broadly.


3      Empirical Strategy
In this section we provide a conceptual framework indicating how physician information and
prescribing outcomes may be related. We describe the model implications and restrictions
that guide our approach to estimating the treatment impact of physicians’ database access.


3.1     Conceptual Framework
Consider a baseline model in which physician i faces a period-t choice over which drug to
prescribe for each of her patients n = 1, 2, ..., Nit . Like other economic studies of prescribing
decisions, suppose that physician i makes this decision for each patient by selecting the single
drug j ∈ {1, 2, ..., Jt } available at t that maximizes patient utility according to physician-i
information.23 Specifically, suppose that the true utility derived by patient n from drug j
at t is unjt ≡ θjt + Vnjt , which combines the quality of drug j that is both known at t and
  23
    See, for example, Dickstein (2015), Crawford and Shum (2006). Unlike these papers, we do not observe
patient-level information; this precludes estimating a model of learning within each patient-physician pair.

                                                        12
common across patients (θjt ) with the quality of j that is unknown and partially specific
to patient n (Vnjt ). The first of these terms (θjt ) thus captures the accepted wisdom at t
about the efficacy, costs, side effects, and so on of drug j for the average patient, while the
second reflects novel information that may, in part, be relevant to the match between j and
patient n. In particular, suppose that Vnjt combines two terms: Vnjt ≡ vjt + njt , where vjt
is a drug-specific value—a revision to accepted wisdom about the quality of drug j—and
where njt reflects the quality of the match between patient n and drug j. We assume the
physician is only partially informed about Vnjt , to a degree indexed by a parameter φit ; she
bases her prescribing decision on a partial observation of unjt given by

                     ûnjt ≡ θjt + (1 − e−φit )Vnjt = θjt + (1 − e−φit ) (vjt + njt ).                       (1)

Physicians with a higher value of φit in (1) are more responsive to information about drug
quality that is not commonly known at t (vjt ), and about the patient-specific match (njt ).
In particular, (1) implies physicians with no special information (φit = 0) are insensitive
to Vnjt and thus prescribe the same drug—that with the highest θjt —for all patients, while
physicians who are fully informed (φit → ∞) respond to Vnjt perfectly.
     If we assume that the njt follow an i.i.d. Type-1 Extreme Value distribution, it is
straightforward in this simple setup to show that the probability physician i prescribes drug
j for patient n at t depends on the information index φit as follows
                                                         n                     o
                                                               θjt
                                                   exp       1−e−φit
                                                                       + vjt
                                  pjt (φit ) = P              n                     o
                                                 Jt                 θkt
                                                  k=1   exp       1−e−φit
                                                                            + vkt

and that, accordingly, the probability Pijt that drug j is prescribed by physician i at least
once during period t is

                Pijt (φit ) ≡ P {Xijt > 0} = 1 − P {Xijt = 0} = 1 − (1 − pjt (φit ))Nit                       (2)

where Xijt is the number of physician-i prescriptions written for drug j during period t.24
Moreover, starting from the introduction date t0j of a new drug j, the expected number of
periods Tij that lapse before drug j is prescribed at least once by physician i is
  24
     Qualitatively identical results hold under more general assumptions regarding the distribution of njt ;
the Type-1 Extreme Value assumption is thus imposed here only for expositional simplicity. A realistic
alternative would be to allow for persistence in the njt draws, reflecting that the chronic nature of cholesterol
and lipid disorders implies physicians often treat the same patient for multiple successive periods. In our
analysis to follow, we thus consider the possibility that the prescription outcomes we evaluate are persistent.

                                 j=1                               j=1                     j=1


      Within this framework, we regard the electronic database as a technology that increases
a physician’s φit , which is otherwise unobserved. The database is continuously updated, so
users of the database are more likely aware of any new information about the drug, including
price changes, new warnings, or new results about its efficacy for different patient types.
And the database allows doctors to look up a drug’s current formulary status for a specific
patient’s insurance plan, so database users should also be more responsive to differences
in, and changes in, match quality across patient-drug pairs. From (2), if database use
indeed increases φit , it impacts the probability drug j is prescribed: whether Pijt increases
or decreases for drug j depends on the distribution of Vnjt across drugs j and patients
n. In general, Pijt will increase for drugs with high values of vjt relative to other drugs;
alternatively, if all vjt = 0, an increase in φit raises Pijt for all drugs (due to the njt ) except
for that with the highest θjt . Similarly, (3) implies the expected number of periods that
pass before drug j is prescribed declines in φit whenever Pijt increases in φit . That is, if a
permanent increase in φit causes a permanent increase in Pijt for drug j, then it also causes a
decrease in Tij . The impact of an increase in φit on the number of distinct drugs prescribed
depends on the sum of derivatives ∂Pijt (φit )/∂φit across drugs j in (4). If a higher φit implies
increased sensitivity to patient-specific match quality njt , for example, Pijt would increase
for most drugs j, and diversity of prescribing would also rise.25
      It is important to note that doctors who regularly prescribe cholesterol medications
will be aware of most drugs’ clinical attributes. However, if patient-specific economic details
such as the pricing and formulary status of a drug evolve substantially over time, or if news
about negative drug interactions and other adverse reactions emerges only gradually, doctors
may prefer to look up these drug attributes prior to writing a prescription. For newer, less
  25
       See also Berndt et al (2015).


                                                                             14
familiar drugs, doctors may also be inclined to look up details like dosage, and it is for these
drugs that one may expect differences between unjt and ûnjt to be particularly relevant.


3.2     Econometric Model
One natural approach to evaluating the influence of increases in φit due to database adoption
would be to directly estimate equations derived from the conceptual model above. However,
the model indicates it is important to control not only for the number of drugs Jt and i’s
prescribing intensity Nit , but also for unobserved drug quality θjt and unobserved determi-
nants of φit . Given the size of the data set, handling the nonlinearity implied by (2) in the
presence of multiple sets of fixed effects is computationally infeasible. We therefore estimate
the effects of database use through specifications that are guided by the model, but linear.
      In particular, we consider three main linear specifications corresponding to each of
the three observable outcomes discussed above: the new-drug adoption lag Tij , prescription
diversity Mit , and prescription probabilities Pijt . Our estimation approach does not impose
the restrictions that link Pijt with Tij and Mit in the model; as a result, comparing our
estimates across these outcomes is qualitatively informative regarding the fit of the model.
      We first assess the time lapse Tij between the initial market release of drug j and its
first prescription by physician i as in Coleman, Katz, and Menzel (1957) using the following
equation

                         P {Tij ≤ 12} = ηi + ηzj + βZij + δNit(j)−1 + εij ,                            (5)

where Tij is measured in months, P {Tij ≤ 12} is the probability that j is prescribed by i
within twelve months of release, and where ηzj and ηi are zipcode-drug and physician fixed
effects, respectively. Zij indicates whether doctor i has database access at the time drug
j is first introduced, and Nit(j)−1 is i’s total prescription volume for cholesterol drugs in
the month preceding j’s introduction. We also estimate (5) with closely-related alternative
dependent variables including P {Tij ≤ 6}, P {Tij ≤ 24}, and Tij .26
      Both (3) and (5) are expressed at the doctor-drug level and, but for the functional-form
differences mentioned above, the two equations are connected. The estimating equation
essentially considers φit to be a function of database use (Zit ), physician fixed effects (ηi ),
and zipcode-month fixed effects (ηzt ) reflecting local changes in access to information. We
arrive at (5) by noting that the evolution of time is, in doctor-drug space, marked by the
sequential introduction of each new drug j, and that the ηzj we therefore include take the
place of ηzt while also accounting for the drug quality effects θjt in (3). In addition, like (3),
  26
    With Tij as the dependent variable, it is necessary to address truncation—which is more pronounced
for drugs introduced late in the sample period. To apply a uniform truncation rule, a significant number of
observations must be omitted, hence Tij , though more direct, is not our preferred dependent variable.


                                                        15
(5) includes i’s prescription volume Nit(j)−1 , and Jt is absorbed by the ηzj .
      Equation (5) is estimated on the subset of drugs first introduced during the sample
period. Finding that the coefficient of interest β is positive would indicate that when a
physician obtains database access, she significantly increases her likelihood of prescribing
a new drug within its first year, relative to before access began. This would be consistent
with database use increasing φit and the probability Pijt of prescribing a new drug j at t:
∂Pijt (φit )/∂φit > 0. Notice that the inclusion of physician fixed effects implies that β is
identified using within-doctor variation over time: i may be a database user at the time
drug j is first introduced, but may not yet be a user upon the introduction of drug j 0 .
These effects are important if stable, unobserved physician characteristics determine both
physician-specific database use Zij and the rate of drug adoption Tij (e.g. early adopters).
Possible common unobserved random shocks that are local and correlated with database
adoption are further accounted for by clustering standard errors at the zipcode level.
      Nevertheless, even with these fixed effects and clusters, there could be time-varying
factors such as local technology adoption propensities (Skinner and Staiger 2007) or phar-
maceutical advertising that jointly determine, or are correlated with, both physician i’s
database use and her rate of new drug adoption. The ηzj in (5) partially address this by
accounting for differences across zipcode-drug pairs in doctors’ average first-prescription tim-
ing, which in this context would be correlated with Zij . However, if the omitted factor is
idiosyncratic across physicians, even within a zipcode, then Cov(Zij , εij ) 6= 0 and (5) will fail
to yield a consistent estimate of β. We return to this in describing our instrumental-variables
estimates in Section 5.
      Second, building from (4), we consider the possibility that information access could
affect physician i’s knowledge about the match quality between drug j and patient n, in-
ducing better-informed physicians to prescribe a more diverse set of products than less-
informed peers. To assess this possibility, we determine the number of unique drug products
        P
Mit ≡ j∈Jt 1{Xijt > 0}, where 1{Xijt > 0} is an indicator for whether physician i writes
at least one prescription for drug j during month t, and evaluate the following specification

                              Mit = ηi + ηzt + βZit + δNit−1 + εit ,                           (6)

where all variables are as defined above. Mit is low when the prescriptions of physician
i are concentrated within a narrow subset of products during month t, and is high when
prescribing is diverse. Finding that β is positive in (6) would thus indicate that database
access is associated with higher product diversity among physician i’s prescriptions; notice
that, through (4), this occurs only when the period-t prescription probability Pijt rises more,
on average, than it falls—that is, when Jj=1
                                          Pt
                                               ∂Pijt (φit )/∂φit > 0. Setting aside functional
forms, the connection between (6) and (4) again rests on the idea that the information index

                                                    16
φit is a function of database use, physician fixed effects, and zipcode-month fixed effects. We
control for Nit−1 directly, and for Jt through ηzt . Standard errors are clustered by zipcode-
month to allow for local unobserved shocks correlated with database adoption Zit .
      We also estimate (6) replacing Mit with the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHIit ) as an
alternative dependent variable; an advantage of this alternative is that it simultaneously
captures both intensive- and extensive-margin effects of information on prescribing. Notice
that β in (6) is again identified using within-physician variation over time in information
access Zit . The zipcode-month fixed effects further help to account for changes over time
in unobserved, location-specific determinants of prescribing diversity; these are particularly
important if patient characteristics—such as insurance coverage, mandatory substitution
laws, patient preferences, and disease severity—or other local factors evolve in ways that
affect prescribing and are correlated with measured physician technology adoption.
      Finally, we evaluate directly the impact of information access on Pijt , the probability
that drug j is prescribed by doctor i at t. It is of particular interest to understand how
database users’ Pijt values across new and old drugs j change after database adoption.
Moreover, because new patent-protected products differ from new generics in both cost and
novelty, access to the database may also tilt prescribing based on the patent status of a
product. We thus evaluate whether physicians using the database are more or less likely to
prescribe a product of a given type using the following specification

                                                                                     τ
      P{Xijt > 0} = ηjt + ηi + ηzt + δNit−1 + [β0 Genj + β1 (1 − Genj )] × Zit × N ewjt
                                                                       τ
                         + [β2 Genj + β3 (1 − Genj )] × Zit × (1 − N ewjt ) + εijt ,       (7)

where P{Xijt > 0} is the probability that physician i writes at least one prescription for drug
j during month t, Genj is an indicator that is equal to 1 if product j is a generic variety,
          τ
and N ewjt  indicates whether drug j is within τ months of its initial approval for U.S. sale.
The main coefficients of interest β0 , β1 , β2 , and β3 jointly capture the association between
database use Zit and prescribing propensity for both new drugs (β0 , β1 ) and established
products (β2 , β3 ), where finding β0 > 0 would indicate that database users are more likely
to prescribe a given drug j that is both new (within τ months of initial market release) at
t and generic, relative to other physicians. Similarly, finding that β1 > 0 would indicate
that database users are more likely to prescribe a new, branded product j. Note that the
estimates of (7) have implications for Tij and Mit through (3) and (4) above.
     Equation (7) includes three sets of fixed effects, in line with (2). Drug-month effects
ηjt account for the average perceived quality of drug j across physicians at t (θjt ), which
may depend on factors such as drug potency and side effects known at t, as well as the
average expected pharmacy price at t. As with our other estimating equations, we further


                                                  17
include physician fixed effects ηi that absorb any individual characteristics affecting φit or the
prescribing propensity such as location, patient composition, and physician age, education,
and medical specialty. The coefficients of interest β are thus identified primarily from within
doctor variation over time in information access Zit . Zipcode-month fixed effects ηzt absorb
any dynamic, location-specific determinants of φit or prescribing that may be correlated with
physicians’ database use; standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the zipcode-month
level, and we control for Nit−1 directly.


4      Main Results
4.1     Time to First Prescription
We begin by evaluating the relationship between a physician’s database use and whether
she adopts a new drug j within a year of its release. The model indicates that physician
i is faster to begin prescribing j if she is a database user, for any new drug j satisfying
∂Pijt (φit )/∂φit > 0. For these drugs, we thus expect a positive coefficient on Zij (Databaseij ),
where Zij takes a value of 1 if physician i has access to the drug reference database at the
time a new drug j receives approval for sale in the U.S. market, and is otherwise zero.27
      Estimates of (5) appear in Table 4. Columns 1 and 2 support the idea that database
users are more likely, on average, to begin prescribing newly-approved drugs early, within
their first year. The estimated coefficient on Zij is positive and highly significant in both
columns, suggesting users are 1.91 percentage points more likely than non-users to write
their initial prescription for a new drug within its first year (column 1); the estimate changes
to 0.89 percentage points if we include physician fixed effects (column 2).28 The data also
confirm that doctors with large prescription volumes Nit−1 are also significantly faster to
begin prescribing a new drug, consistent with the model’s qualitative predictions.
      Columns 3 and 4 assess potential differences between new brand-name and new generic
drugs. With prescriber fixed effects in column 4, we find that the estimated effect for generics
(Databaseij × Genericj ) remains positive and significant, while that on branded products is
indistinguishable from zero. Specifically, physicians using the database are 2.13 percentage
points more likely to prescribe a new generic within its initial year, but are no faster in the
case of new branded drugs.29 That database use may tilt prescribing toward faster generic
  27
     Throughout Section 4, Databaseij (Zij ) is the Database and Use Indicator described in Table 2.
  28
     For comparison, we replicate Table 4 using ln Tij as the outcome variable. Truncation in Tij is addressed
by limiting the duration of analysis to a window of 54 months following each new drug introduction and
omitting Simcor; 54 months is the time span between the release of simvastatin and December 2010. The
results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 4, and imply that database users begin prescribing a newly-
approved drug 1.2 months or 0.83 months sooner, on average, than non-users. We also consider P{Tij ≤ 6}
and P{Tij ≤ 24} as alternatives, and find results for each that are qualitatively identical to those in Table 4.
  29
     Notice that the zipcode-drug fixed effects ensure that this result is not explained by differences in local

                                                          18
adoption has potentially significant aggregate cost implications given the size of the market
for cholesterol therapies and the chronic nature of the condition they treat.30 Moreover,
because generic drugs share identical clinical attributes with branded versions, these results
strongly suggest database users may be responding to the increased salience of non-clinical
information—in particular, price and insurance formulary data.
      While the estimates in columns 1–4 rely on the full sample of U.S. physicians, these
results may be sensitive to differences across database users and non-users in the evolution of
prescription outcomes. To better isolate the within-doctor impact of database use, columns
5 and 6 restrict the physician sample, including only those that both register for and use the
drug database during the sample period. Doctors that have yet to adopt the database by
December 2010 are thus omitted. With this restriction, the estimates in column 6 suggest,
as in column 4, that database users are indeed significantly faster to begin prescribing new
generics, but show no significant effects on the adoption of new branded drugs.
      Across all columns, zipcode-drug fixed effects absorb variation across locations and over
time in a) access to other drug information sources (e.g. advertising), b) physicians’ tendency
to adopt new technology, c) patient characteristics affecting the price or match quality of
drug j, and d) competition. Any component of factors a) through d) that is stable over time
is further captured by physician fixed effects in columns 2, 4, and 6.


4.2     Prescription Diversity
To evaluate the impact of physicians’ database use on the diversity of prescribing, Table
5 provides estimates of (6) for two outcome variables: the number of unique drugs Mit
prescribed by physician i at t (columns 1 and 3), and the associated Herfindahl-Hirschmann
index, HHIit (columns 2 and 4). The coefficient of interest is on Databaseit (Zit ), which takes
a value of 1 if physician i has access to the drug database at t, and is otherwise zero.
      In the model, prescribing diversity increases when a physician adopts the drug database
if the prescription probability Pijt rises more, on average, than it falls—that is, if adoption
                                     PJt
induces an increase in φit and if       j=1 ∂Pijt (φit )/∂φit > 0. The results in columns 1–4
are strongly consistent with this. In column 1, the estimated coefficient on physician-i
database access Zit is indeed positive and highly significant, and indicates that database users
prescribe, on average, 0.123 additional unique drug varieties each month relative to a non-
user.31 In column 2, we find that HHIit is also strongly responsive to database adoption: the
estimate −0.006 is negative and highly significant, indicating that database users’ prescribing
mandatory substitution laws. We nevertheless provide additional results regarding the effects of substitution
laws on prescribing outcomes in Section 5.
  30
     See Section 7.
  31
     Because Mit is a count variable, we re-estimate the coefficients in columns 1 and 3 using both Poisson
and Negative Binomial estimators, and find qualitatively identical results.


                                                         19
is substantially less concentrated across drugs j. Consistent with the model, we also find that
prescription diversity increases significantly in a physician’s monthly prescription volume.
     In columns 3–4, physicians differ only in their respective drug reference adoption dates,
yet the estimates are qualitatively identical to those in columns 1–2: prescription diversity
increases significantly when physicians adopt the drug database. The estimates in columns
3–4 are considerably smaller than the full-sample results, however. This suggests the possible
influence of unobserved factors, correlated with Zit , that influence prescription diversity. We
discuss this concern in more detail in Section 5 below.


4.3     Prescription Propensity
We report estimates of the propensity equation (7) in Table 6, again for all physicians (column
1) and for the sample restricted to eventual database users (column 2). The outcome variable
1{Xijt > 0} is binary, indicating whether physician i writes at least one prescription for drug
j at t, and the main coefficients of interest β0 and β1 correspond to Databaseit (Zit ) and its
interaction with indicators for new generic and branded drugs, respectively.32 We define j
to be new while it is within τ = 24 months of its initial market approval.
      As described above, the model predicts that the coefficients β0 , β1 , β2 , and β3 could
be positive or negative depending on the distribution across drugs in the unobserved quality
terms vjt and njt about which physicians learn as φ increases. Pijt will tend to increase in φit
for drugs with high vjt values, but will generally fall if vjt is relatively low. Whether database
adoption increases or decreases prescribing for a particular drug type is thus an empirical
question. It is, however, one to which we can partially predict the answer, given the model
and results in Tables 4 and 5 above. First, Table 4 indicates physicians using the database
are faster to begin prescribing new generics, but mildly slower to adopt new branded drugs; if
the model is correct, this suggests, through (3), that β0 > 0 and β1 < 0. Second, prescription
diversity increases with database adoption in Table 5; in (4), this implies that the sum across
β0 , β1 , β2 , and β3 , weighted by the number of drugs per category, is positive.
      Across both columns in Table 6, it is clear that physicians with database access are
substantially more likely to prescribe generic products, regardless of vintage: β0 > 0 and
β2 > 0. Specifically, these estimated coefficients are positive and highly significant, indicating
the likelihood physician i prescribes a new generic drug is 1.62 percentage points higher when
she has access to the database, and 2.40 percentage points higher for an older generic product
in the restricted sample (column 2). The coefficients on branded drugs are much smaller
  32
    The estimates in Table 6 span January 2000 through December 2010. To manage the computational
burden of the sample size, we include only observations in January 2000 and each subsequent June and
December in estimating the coefficients. The results are not qualitatively or quantitatively sensitive to this
sample size reduction.



                                                         20
in magnitude, but still precisely estimated: users are 0.15 percentage points more likely
to prescribe an old, branded product (β3 > 0), and are 0.42 percentage points less likely
to prescribe a new, branded product (β1 < 0). Viewed through the lens of the model,
the estimated coefficients β̂0 and β̂1 are thus exactly aligned with the results in Table 4.
Moreover, the coefficients in Table 6 are consistent with the diversity estimates in Table
5. Accounting for the distribution of drug types in the data, the weighted sum across the
coefficients β in column 2 is always positive. The predictions of the model, in light of the
estimates in Tables 4 and 5, are thus strongly consistent with the results in Table 6.
      Importantly, the estimates in Table 6 provide additional suggestive evidence regarding
the mechanism through which database adoption may influence prescribing. That the impact
of database access is apparent not only for new, but also older products suggests that there
could be important reasons for doctors to continually reference the drugs in question—
possibly to learn about aspects of a drug that are either time-varying or patient specific. This
ongoing process of information acquisition could thus be an important factor in explaining
why a significant fraction of a new drug’s diffusion occurs beyond its first two years (Figure
2), a feature of technology diffusion that has fascinated economists for decades (Manuelli
and Seshadri 2014). Second, the estimated coefficients of interest are again consistent with
responsiveness to economic information—price and formulary status—the inclusion of which
is a distinctive feature of the drug database we consider. In particular, users tilt prescribing
away from new, branded products—for which prices are generally high—and strongly toward
generic products, for which prices are low. That the estimated increases in generic propensity
(β0 , β2 ) are so large in magnitude relative to those for branded products further suggests the
response to price information is economically important—which is not only surprising, but
also indicates database adoption could therefore have significant implications for aggregate
prescription costs.


5    Interpreting the Results
The results in Tables 4 through 6 above indicate that physicians using the point-of-care
reference begin prescribing new generics sooner than non-users, prescribe a more diverse
set of drugs than non-users, and more often prescribe a generic drug. Because database
adoption is not randomly assigned, however, a key question that remains is whether a causal
interpretation of our results is supported by the data. Our fixed-effects approach helps rule
out certain alternative explanations including cases in which ‘early-adopters’ or physicians
facing intense local advertising exposure begin both using the database and prescribing a new
drug sooner than other physicians—for reasons unrelated to the actual impact of database
use. A limitation of this approach arises when database adoption is either correlated with, or


                                                  21
involves selection on, time-varying, idiosyncratic physician characteristics that are relevant
to the prescribing outcomes we consider.
     In the case of advertising, for example, if an individual physician’s database adoption
timing were to be correlated with the idiosyncratic change in her own exposure to detailing—
that is, the component not accounted for by zipcode-month effects—our estimates of the
impact of adoption could be confounded with the influence of drug advertising. Without
granular data on detailing, it is not possible to know whether there are meaningful shocks to
detailing efforts that differ substantially across physicians within a U.S. zipcode-month for
the drugs we consider. It is important to note, however, that, our results indicate database
adopters are primarily quicker to prescribe new generic drugs, which are not advertised.33
     Relatedly, it is possible in Table 5 that a physician’s decision to adopt the database
is partially determined by the underlying, idiosyncratic rate of increase in her prescribing
diversity: naturally, adopting the database today could be a more attractive option for a
physician who anticipates prescribing a wider range of products in the future, than for a
physician in the opposite situation.34 In this section we describe additional results in order
to clarify the degree to which a causal interpretation is warranted and to determine which
alternative interpretations can be ruled out.


5.1     Endogenous Database Adoption
One approach to handling the endogeneity of database adoption is to find an instrument that
generates quasi-random variation in a physician’s database adoption decision, and to estimate
the impact of information access relying on variation in this instrument. We have considered
three such instruments: 1) a measure of location-year specific hospital I.T. use from Dranove
et al (2014), and 2) a measure of location-year specific high-speed internet penetration, and
3) the doctor-month specific share of other local physicians that have adopted the reference
database; all three are factors that could influence doctors’ database adoption decisions while
being plausibly unrelated to choices over which anti-cholesterol drugs to prescribe. While we
find that the first two instruments are only weak predictors of database adoption, resulting in
second-stage estimates highly sensitive to small specification changes, the third instrument
is a robust predictor of database adoption.
      We therefore reassess the results in Tables 4, 5, and 6 using this third instrument.
Estimates appear in Tables 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The logic underlying the first stage is
  33
    The data studied by Larkin et al (2017) show that detailing is almost exclusively done for branded drugs.
  34
    While U.S. physicians always face the same set of drugs approved for prescription, and in that sense do
not differ in changes to the range of products available, their exposure to such changes may differ due to the
potentially distinct characteristics of the specific patients they treat. To the extent that these distinctions
are time-varying and correlated with database adoption, even across doctors practicing in the same zipcode-
month, our fixed effects estimator could yield biased estimates.


                                                          22
identical across all three specifications. Consider Table 5: the first stage corresponding to a
version of (6) that replaces ηzt with ηt is

                               Zit = α Sz(i)t−1 + νi + νt + ξNit−1 + uit ,                                 (8)

where Sz(i)t−1 is the share of physicians, excluding i, that are located in i’s zipcode z(i)
and are database users at t − 1.35 The identification restriction is that the instrument is
conditionally uncorrelated with the error term in (6): Cov(Sz(i)t−1 , εit |ηi , ηt , Nit−1 ) = 0.
      Most explanations linking neighbors’ database adoption decisions would suggest α > 0
in (8). One possible mechanism is that neighboring physicians are likely to share information
about tools and techniques that improve professional performance; alternatively, physicians
interacting locally may simply observe a peer accessing the database, and may decide to
adopt on that basis. As discussed above, the reference firm’s public statements indicate
that such informal peer effects were the most important driver of database adoption among
doctors during the sample period. Regarding excludability, it does not seem likely that
the database adoption decisions of physicians neighboring i would directly affect i’s own
prescription decisions, as patient medical information is privacy-protected by law.36
      Whether the bias in our baseline estimates is upward or downward hinges on the rela-
tionship between the omitted factor and database adoption (Zit ). One possibility is that a
physician makes an unobserved decision to move closer to the efficiency frontier by adopting
new generic drugs quickly, prescribing them more often in place of a branded drug, and
increasing the influence of patients’ diverse characteristics on prescription choice—and that
as a result of this unobserved decision, the doctor now finds it profitable to begin using
the database to assist her increasingly complex prescription choices. This would suggest
Cov(Zit , εit ) ≥ 0 in (6) and a corresponding upward bias in our baseline estimate of β. On
the other hand, if time-constrained physicians choose among multiple sources of drug infor-
mation, those adopting the reference we consider (with Zit = 1) may do so at the expense
of relying on a substitute resource that could affect prescribing similarly.37 This would tend
  35
      Notice that this instrument is not valid in the presence of zipcode-month fixed effects ηzt . With ηzt ,
identification through the instrument comes from comparing two doctors i and i0 in the same zipcode and
month that have different adoption shares Sz(i)t−1 and Sz(i0 )t−1 . However, such a difference arises only when
exactly one of the two has adopted the database. But in this case, the instrument for i directly reflects
Zit−1 , which is correlated with Zit and thus also with the prescription outcome Mit . We therefore replace
the ηzt (or ηzj ) with ηt (or ηj ) in the instrumented specifications.
   36
      There are channels through which Sz(i)t−1 could be correlated εit in the second-stage equation. Changes
in neighbors’ database adoption could reflect changes in the proximity of their location to the technology
frontier, possibly due to advertising; this could manifest itself not only in a high early rate of database
adoption but also a high early rate of new drug adoption. Neighboring physicians that share information
about database use could also share information about new drugs, affecting prescribing even if patient-
specific details are not discussed. Such cases are better addressed by the baseline specification (6), which
includes zipcode-month fixed effects that absorb local changes of these types.
   37
      For example, relevant alternatives include the Micromedex and UpToDate Lexicomp databases.


                                                          23
to result in Cov(Zit , εit ) ≤ 0 in (6), placing downward pressure on the estimate of β.
      The estimates in Tables 7 through 9 are largely in line with the latter interpretation.
Based on our preferred second-stage estimates in Table 7, column 6, database users are
6.10 percentage points more likely to begin prescribing a new generic within its initial year,
relative to a non-user, with no significant effects among new branded drugs. The magnitude
of the effect for generics is larger than in Table 4, suggesting a bias toward zero for this
coefficient; the coefficients for branded products are statistically indistinguishable. In Table
8, column 4 similarly suggests that the true impact of database adoption on diversity is an
order of magnitude larger than in Table 5; however, this result is limited to prescription
concentration HHIit , with the effect on Mit insignificant in Table 8, column 3. Table 9
suggests that Table 6 understates the impact of the database on generic prescribing by
a factor of four for new generics (β0 ) and a factor of ten for old generics (β2 ).38 However,
database adopters are less likely to prescribe old branded drugs (β3 < 0). Each table includes
the first-stage estimates and reports the F statistic, which in every case is substantially higher
than its weak-instrument threshold value.
      Overall, the IV estimates reported in Tables 7–9 confirm a pattern of database impacts
that is similar to the corresponding OLS estimates, but with larger estimated magnitudes.
We view these as a set of robustness checks, with results that lend credibility both to the
qualitative effects estimated above, and to a causal interpretation of these effects. Never-
theless, it is worth noting that our leave-out mean instrument relies on variation in group
composition that in many applications leads to small-sample bias from weak instruments,
and that could confound interpretation in certain cases (Angrist 2014). Regarding the for-
mer, we have confirmed the strength of the instrument, aided by the fact that the instrument
varies over 13,000 zipcodes × 131 months = 1.7 million observations, across which there is
sufficient heterogeneity for identification. Regarding the latter concern, that groups with
high database adoption rates could also have different prescribing tendencies due to factors
other than actual database access, three observations are useful. First, such an unobserved
factor would need to cause a correlation between zipcodes’ database adoption timing and
increased generic prescribing in the absence of effects on brand-name drug adoption; second,
provided this unobserved factor varies by zipcode-month, then it is reassuring that the base-
line estimates including these fixed effects are qualitatively similar (Tables 4–6); third, we
find that the results in tables 7–9 are essentially unchanged when defining the instrument at
a broader geographic unit (three digit zipcodes).
 38
      In the interest of space, first-stage estimates for Table 6 appear in Appendix Table A.2.




                                                           24
5.2    Timing the Impact of Database Adoption
For an important class of alternative explanations, physicians either adopt the reference
database in response to pre-existing changes in prescribing, or are influenced by omitted,
dynamic factors that simultaneously affect both prescribing and database adoption. A symp-
tom that would likely appear where these influences are active is adopters who exhibit a trend
toward the predicted outcomes, even before accessing the database. To account for this pos-
sibility, we consider variants of (6) and (7) that include a full set of physician-specific time
trends. The results appear in Tables 10 and 11. Considering the estimates in Table 10, it
is clear that including doctor trends reduces the estimated impact of database adoption in
the overall sample (columns 1 and 2) relative to the baseline estimates in Table 5; however,
the impact increases within our preferred specifications (columns 3 and 4) that include only
eventual database adopters. Relative to Table 6, the results in Table 11 are essentially iden-
tical. Accounting for physician-specific trends thus leaves unchanged the main qualitative
implications of Tables 5 and 6.


5.3    The Intensity of Database Use
The model proposes a specific mechanism: physicians’ prescription outcomes are influenced
by database access because the information obtained through the database is important, yet
otherwise unknown. If this proposed mechanism is correct, then if we observe physicians
using the database to search for cholesterol drugs with different intensities, those search-
ing more intensely should have correspondingly larger prescription responses. There could
certainly be other explanations linking search intensity with the prescribing outcomes we
consider, but this evaluation is informative nevertheless: if intensity and response are not
linked in the data, it would strongly suggest the proposed mechanism is invalid.
     With these considerations in mind, we make use of a key feature of the data that
allows us to observe not only a physician’s database registration date, but also a proxy for
the extent of her drug-month specific database use, conditional on adoption. The variable
is unfortunately not an exact lookup count, as the database company changed the way it
maintained lookup data over time; given this, we aggregate the lookup proxy into a coarser
measure reflecting a lower bound for each physician’s overall intensity of database use. We
then divide the sample of physicians into three groups based on this lower bound, and re-
assess the results in Tables 4, 5, and 6 allowing different coefficients for each intensity group:
low-intensity users are database adopters for whom the lower bound on cholesterol drug
lookups is zero; the high-intensity group includes doctors whose total lookup proxy is in the
top decile. The results appear in Tables A.3, A.4, and A.5 in the Appendix.
     The estimates in Table A.3, columns 1 and 2, reveal that the impact of database adop-


                                                   25
tion is systematically and monotonically increasing in the intensity of usage. In column 1,
the low-intensity users are 0.32 percentage points more likely to adopt new drugs within one
year of release, while high-intensity users are 3.41 percentage points more likely to do so;
both coefficients are strongly significant, but reveal meaningful heterogeneity across database
adopters in its prescribing impact. Column 2 reveals a similar pattern of increasing impact,
and column 6 confirms the finding in Table 4 that database use systematically speeds adop-
tion of new generic products.
     Analogous results obtain in Tables A.4 and A.5. The estimates in Table A.4 indicate
that diversity increases with database adoption only for high-intensity users; Table A.5 sug-
gests that the highest-intensity users are the most responsive to database access in switching
away from branded drugs and toward generic products. Taken together, these results are
consistent with the mechanism we propose in the model.


5.4    Mandatory Substitution Laws
To encourage cost savings, many U.S. states impose regulations mandating generic substitu-
tion where available; in most cases, such laws have been in force since the 1970s (Grabowski
and Vernon 1979) and were thus in effect during the sample period. This means that phar-
macists dispense the generic version of a drug even if the physician prescribed the branded
version. Since our IMS data are collected from pharmacies and are based on prescrip-
tions dispensed, a possible concern is that the patterns in our data reflect pharmacists’
behavior rather than physicians’ prescribing behavior—for example if the implementation of
mandatory substitution laws differs across states and over time in a manner correlated with
physicians’ adoption of the drug database.
     On this point it is important to note that all of our baseline results include zipcode-drug
or zipcode-month fixed effects that absorb any impact of mandatory substitution laws on the
prescription outcomes we consider—even where these laws may be correlated with physicians’
database adoption choices. Nevertheless, to further check the robustness of our results to this
potential concern, we re-estimate the regressions reported in Table 4, replacing the zipcode-
drug fixed effects with a set of drug fixed effects, and splitting the sample between doctors
in states with vs. without mandatory substitution laws. We also consider triple-interacted
specifications in which the effect of database adoption is allowed to depend on whether the
doctor is in a mandatory substitution state. The results, shown in Table A.6, indicate that
database adoption is associated with faster adoption of new generics regardless of whether
the physician is in a mandatory substitution state.




                                                  26
5.5    Pharmaceutical Innovation
Physicians practicing in locations known for pharmaceutical innovation may have access to
frontier knowledge regarding pharmaceutical development and pricing, limiting the potential
for the reference database we observe to influence prescribing decisions. Within the concep-
tual framework outlined in section 3, proximity to the frontier could imply physicians have
initially high φit parameters that are either minimally or not responsive to database use. If
so, database use has little potential to affect prescribing. The zipcode-drug or zipcode-month
fixed effects included in the baseline specifications account for the innovativeness of a physi-
cian’s local environment. To assess whether location-specific differences in innovativeness
impact the mechanism, we therefore replace these effects with either drug or month fixed
effects, and use patent data from the NBER U.S. Patent Citations Data File (Hall, Jaffe,
and Trajtenberg 2001) to measure the number of pharmaceutical patents granted between
1975 and 1999 by zipcode. We then re-evaluate the adoption-lag specifications in Table 4
separately for two samples corresponding to the top and bottom five percent across zip-
codes based on the number of pharmaceutical patents granted. We also consider interacted
specifications that account for differences in pharmaceutical patenting across locations.
      The estimates appear in Table A.6, and suggest that physicians plausibly located near
the knowledge frontier—that is, physicians in zipcodes among the top five percent by drug
patenting—indeed respond to drug information differently than their more distant peers.
Specifically, the estimates indicate that while use of the database in the least-innovative
locations is associated with a larger impact on the likelihood of new drug adoption within
one year (columns 2 and 6) relative to the most innovative locations (columns 1 and 5).
Considering the full sample, columns 3 and 7 both indicate that the database speeds generic
adoption on average, but has especially pronounced effects among the least-innovative loca-
tions that are likely to be far from the information frontier. Columns 4 and 8 confirm this
result using a continuous measure of local patenting. Innovative areas adopt generics more
quickly regardless of database adoption, but on average, a physician using the database in
these locations is significantly less responsive to the information in terms of new generic drug
adoption. The database nevertheless has an independent effect, speeding the adoption of
new generic drugs regardless of patenting.


5.6    Other Robustness Checks
We re-estimate the results involving the count variable Mit in Table 5 using Poisson or
Negative Binomial regressions, and we estimate specifications involving the binary variables
in Tables 4 and 6 using logistic fixed effects regressions. We reevaluate Table 6 including
doctor-drug fixed effects and zipcode-month-drug type fixed effects. To allow for persistence


                                                  27
in prescription outcomes, we also control for the first lag of each outcome in Tables 5 and
6.39 Each of these robustness checks reveals qualitatively similar results.40
      Finally, a physician’s decision to prescribe a generic drug may be related to the insur-
ance coverage of her patient population. We therefore evaluate split-sample estimates based
on whether physicians receive a high or low share of Medicare and Medicaid patients, rela-
tive to the privately insured; separately, we repeat this split-sample analysis, distinguishing
physicians based on whether a high or low share of their patients pay for prescriptions with
cash. In both cases, we find negligible differences across groups.


6      Physician Heterogeneity
As a final point, we consider whether the data are broadly consistent with the idea that
incomplete information contributes to disparities in prescribing behavior across physicians.
If indeed these disparities partially reflect systematic informational differences, then physi-
cians sharing access to a common source of drug information, like the reference database in
our study, should tend to exhibit observable homogenization relative to other doctors. We
consider this possibility using a simple approach. We first assign each physician to one of
two groups based on her database registration status in December 2010. Then, within each
group, we measure the extent of prescribing heterogeneity across physicians: specifically, we
determine the vector of prescription shares for each prescriber i in December 2010, and then
compute the Euclidean distance between this physician-i vector and the average vector of
prescription shares among physicians in her group (database users or non-users).
      These within-group similarity measures are reported in Table A.8, Panel A. The pre-
scription shares of database users are indeed more homogeneous than those of non-users.
The average Euclidean distance between the physician-i prescription vector and the group-
specific average is 0.152 for users and 0.176 for non-users, and the difference (-0.0236) is
highly statistically significant. Importantly, note that database users prescribe a signifi-
cantly more diverse set of products than non-users, as shown above in Table 5; the relative
homogeneity of database users’ prescribing patterns thus does not imply a loss of variation
in therapies generally. Rather, the result implies that physicians who are connected to the
same information source resemble each other more closely in spite of the fact that they tend
to prescribe a more diverse set of drugs.
      Of course, the fact that database users’ prescribing patterns are less heterogeneous could
reflect selection rather than any causal effect of information access. Indeed, Panel B of Table
A.8 shows that eventual database users’ prescribing exhibited greater homogeneity than non-
  39
     Structural persistence could arise in the presence of persistent patient specific match quality njt terms
in the model, given the chronic nature of the relevant medical condition.

users’ even in January 2000, before anyone was using the database. But, the changes by
group between 2000 and 2010, summarized in Panel C, indicate that while a) both groups
(users and non-users) exhibit homogenization over time, with the average Euclidean distance
declining by 0.052 for users and by 0.040 for non-users, b) the difference in differences is also
highly significant—i.e., significantly more within-group homogenization is observed among
database users than among non-users, even when controlling for physician fixed effects.41
      Our data cannot definitively say whether the faster convergence for database users was
directly caused by the database: unlike the regression analyses reported in Section 4, the
results described in Table A.8 are based on across-group comparisons rather than within-
doctor comparisons, so the stronger trend toward homogenization among adopters could
reflect other characteristics that are correlated with the decision to adopt. Nevertheless, we
view these results as suggestive of the idea that database use could reduce disparities in
care—an idea that merits exploration in future research.


7      Conclusion
This paper has empirically examined how physicians’ prescribing decisions are affected by
access to a drug reference database at the point of care. Using a novel dataset that includes
prescription choices and drug reference use for over 125,000 individual U.S. physicians, we
find that after adopting the database, users increase the likelihood of prescribing a generic
drug, are faster to begin prescribing a newly-released generic, and yet also significantly in-
crease the diversity of products prescribed each month. These results are consistent with the
predictions of a simple, incomplete-information model of prescription choice, and are robust
across specifications that control for physician and location-month unobserved prescribing
determinants and that treat the timing of physicians’ database adoption as endogenous.
      While the magnitude of database users’ estimated shift toward generic drugs is mod-
est at the prescriber level, the implied aggregate impact on drug spending is economically
significant. U.S. pharmacies filled approximately 170 million cholesterol drug prescriptions
in 2010, for example, a year during which roughly 45 percent of sample physicians were
users of the drug reference database, and during which the average price difference between
branded and generic cholesterol-drug prescriptions was around $94.42 If 45 percent of these
prescriptions correspond to database users, and if users’ generic shares increase by even half
  41
     For clarity, Panel C reports coefficients from a least-squares regression of the Euclidean distance to the
mean Dit for doctor i at t = {January 2000, December 2010} on an indicator I2010 for December 2010, its
interaction Z2010 × I2010 with an indicator Zi,2010 for physician-i database access in December 2010, and
physician fixed effects.
  42
     Assuming each prescription is for a standard 30-day supply, this estimated price difference based on
Marketscan data for December 2009 is conservative; CMS data indicate the price gap corresponding to
Medicare and Medicaid patients is substantially wider.


                                                          29
a percentage point—approximately the magnitude of the measured effect of database use
in our data—the implied annual cost savings of database usage would exceed $35 million
for cholesterol drugs alone.43 If effects of the same magnitude apply to all drug classes, the
implied savings would be on the order of $1 billion annually.
      More importantly, our study speaks to policy debates regarding the efficiency of U.S.
healthcare provision, particularly those concerning unwarranted disparities in the observed
cost and quality of medical care (Wennberg et al 1996) including that involving prescription
drugs (Munson et al 2013). Our results provide new, systematic evidence that information
differences contribute significantly to treatment variation across U.S. physicians, and suggest
that connecting physicians to common, high-quality information sources has the potential
to meaningfully increase the efficiency of health care delivery.

A.1     Medical Innovation
Innovation in hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia therapy: Information about the
evolving set of pharmaceutical therapies available for prescription was obtained from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the period January 2000 through December 2010. Twelve
new statin or lipid-lowering drugs, including new formulations, combinations, and versions, intro-
duced during this period and are described below. These include three new molecular entities
Crestor, Lovaza, and Zetia; three generic versions lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol),
and simvastatin (Zocor); two new formulations Altoprev (extended-release Mevacor) and Lescol XL
(extended-release Lescol); and four new drug combinations Advicor (extended-release niacin and
Mevacor), Pravigard PAC (aspirin and Pravachol), Vytorin (Zetia and Zocor), Simcor (extended-
release niacin and Zocor). A description of each drug innovation appears below based on publicly
available data including approval letters and administrative, medical, and pharmacological review.
Baycol was withdrawn early in the sample period in August 2001 and is thus omitted.
Existing therapies available in January 2000:
1. Lescol (fluvastatin) is a statin marketed by Novartis since its FDA approval as a new molecular
entity on December 31, 1993; its patent protection expired in 2012. Like other statins, its mechanism
of action is to limit a specific enzyme in the liver, preventing cholesterol synthesis.
2. Lipitor (atorvastatin) is a statin marketed by Pfizer. Its mechanism of action is similar to that
of fluvastatin, but unlike other statins, atorvastatin is a synthetic compound. The therapy was
approved by the FDA as a new molecular entity on December 17, 1996. Between 1996 and 2012,
Lipitor was the best-selling drug globally; its patent expired in November 2011.
3. Mevacor (lovastatin) is the first statin to receive FDA approval. The drug was approved as a
new molecular entity on August 31, 1987 for sale in the United States by Merck. The therapy was
protected by patents through June 2001.
4. Niaspan (extended-release niacin) is vitamin B3 , or nicotinic acid, and is marketed by Abbott
Laboratories. Extended-release niacin was approved for sale in the United States on July 28, 1997.
5. Pravachol (pravastatin) is a statin marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb since its FDA approval on
October 31, 1991. In addition to inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, Pravachol also inhibits low-density
lipoprotein synthesis. Two clinical trials, each completed in November 2003, suggest Pravachol is
outperformed by both Zocor and Lipitor. Patent protection expired in June 2006.
6. Zocor (simvastatin) is a statin marketed by Merck since its FDA approval as a new molecu-
lar entity on December 23, 1991. Zocor outperformed Pravachol in its prevention of cholesterol
synthesis in a clinical trial completed in November 2003. Patent protection expired in April 2006.
New chemical entities, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) is a new molecular entity approved by the FDA for sale in the
United States by Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals on August 12, 2003. The molecule acts by reducing
intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols, and is thereby distinct relative to
other statin therapies. The drug was approved for use in treating primary hypercholesterolemia
and mixed dyslipidemia (by reducing total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B), and as an adjunct to other
lipid-lowering treatments. It was thus approved for use alone or with other statins. A 2008 clinical
trial revealed additional evidence supporting the superior performance of Crestor compared with a
placebo treatment. Patent protection expires in January 2016.
2. Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) is a new molecular entity introduced by Abbott labs and
approved by the FDA on November 10, 2004. It was initially introduced under the trade name
Omacor. Unlike statins, Lovaza is aimed at reducing tricylerides rather than low-density lipopro-
teins and may thus be combined with a statin as an adjunct therapy. Patent protection expired in
September 2012.
3. Zetia (ezetimibe) is a new molecular entity introduced by Schering and approved by the FDA on
October 25, 2002 for sale in the United States. The molecule acts by reducing intestinal absorption
of cholesterol and related phytosterols, and is thus distinct from statins. The drug was initially
approved for use in treating hypercholesterolemia for use alone or with other statins. In January
2008, a clinical trial found Zetia performed poorly compared with other therapies, and it was at
that time recommended that Zetia not be prescribed except in cases for which all other cholesterol
drugs had previously failed. Patent protection expires in April 2017.
New generic versions, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Lovastatin is the generic equivalent of Mevacor, and was initially approved by the FDA for sale
in the United States by Geneva Pharmaceuticals applied on December 17, 2001.
2. Pravastatin is the generic equivalent of Pravachol, and was initially approved by the FDA for
sale in the United States by Teva Pharmaceuticals on April 24, 2006.
3. Simvastatin is the generic equivalent of Zocor, and was initially approved by the FDA for sale
in the United States by Teva Pharmaceuticals on June 23, 2006.
New dosage forms, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Altoprev (extended-release lovastatin) is a new dosage form and was approved by the FDA
on June 26, 2002 for sale in the United States, following a new drug application by Aura Phar-
maceuticals, Inc. of March 30, 2001. The approval is for use of Altoprev for lowering cholesterol
and LDL-C to target levels along with diet and exercise, to slow the progression of atherosclerosis
in patients with coronary heart disease, and to reduce total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and triclycerides
and to increase HDL-C in patients with dyslipoproteinemia. The drug was found to outperform
Mevacor (lovastatin). Altoprev is protected by patents though at least December 2017.
2. Lescol XL (extended-release Lescol) is a new dosage form and was approved by the FDA for sale
in the United States by Novartis on October 6, 2000. Patent protection expired in 2012.
New drug combinations, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Advicor (Mevacor and extended-release Niacin) is a new drug combination approved by the
FDA on December 17, 2001 for sale in the United States by Kos Pharmaceuticals. Advicor was
approved for use in treating primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in two types of
patients: a) those treated with lovastatin who require further triglyceride lowering or HDL raising
who may benefit from adding niacin to their regimen, and b) patients previously treated with niacin
who require further LDL lowering and may benefit from having lovastatin added to their regimen.
Thus, Advicor was not approved as an initial therapy for lowering LDL levels. Moreover, in clinical
trials, Advicor was found to perform no better than Mevacor as a first-line agent.
2. Pravigard PAC (Pravachol and aspirin) is a new drug combination approved by the FDA on
June 24, 2003 for sale in the United States by Bristol Myers Squibb.
3. Vytorin (Zetia and Zocor) is a new drug combination approved by the FDA for use, along
with diet or with other lipid-lowering treatments to reduce total C, LDL-C and raise HDL-C, on
July 23, 2004 by MSP Singapore company, LLC. The drug combination was more effective at
lowering lipids, but was also associated with more adverse events (both serious and leading to
discontinuation) than either monotherapy. In January 2008, a completed clinical trial revealed
Zetia, a component of Vytorin, performed poorly relative to other therapies.
4. Simcor (simvastatin and extended-release niacin) is a new drug combination approved by the
FDA on February 15, 2008 for sale in the United States by Abbott Laboratories. Like Advicor,
Simcor is approved only as a second-line treatment for cases in which the monotherapy is considered
to be inadequate.
A.2     Data
U.S. Prescriptions for Hypercholesterolemia and Dyslipidemia Therapies: Prescription
data for U.S. medical practitioners and each of the products described above were obtained from the
IMS Health Xponent database. IMS Health draws its prescription data from a large but non-random
sample of over 70 percent of U.S. pharmacies. As of the time our data were assembled, Xponent
included direct information from over 38,000 retail stores, including approximately 119 mail-service
pharmacies and 820 long-term care facilities; this compares with a universe of approximately 57,000
retail pharmacies, 327 mail-service outlets, and 3,000 long-term care facilities. In addition to
observing directly dispensed prescription volumes (or “sell-out”) for each sample pharmacy, IMS
Health observes prescription drug purchase volumes (or “sell-in”) for the universe of U.S. pharmacies
and drugs—that is, including both sample and non-sample stores. To correct for sampling error
and to ensure the data are representative, IMS Health has applied a proprietary procedure that
a) combines sell-in and sell-out data for sample pharmacies to determine what ratio of purchased
product is actually dispensed for each drug and store, b) uses this ratio (or “projection factor”),
appropriately weighted by store type and proximity, to estimate the dispensed volume by drug for
any store reporting sell-in but not sell-out volumes. Importantly, this projection and weighting
procedure applies only to strictly positive prescription levels, but does not apply to zeros, enabling
us to accurately track the initial adoption of new products over time for each physician.
      The data IMS Health provided include prescriptions by 280,622 unique U.S. physicians for
each product in each month during January 2000 through December 2010. To avoid studying
physicians specialized outside cardiovascular care, we restrict analysis to physicians that prescribe
at least some cholesterol products. Specifically, for a physician to be included in the dataset, he
or she needs to have written at least ten filled prescriptions for cholesterol therapies during the
calendar year 2010. The data provide precise identifying information for each prescribing physi-
cian, including the unique, 11-digit American Medical Association Medical Education Number, the
first name, last name, and middle name, and the five-digit zipcode corresponding to the medical
practice of the physician. From January 2006 through December 2010, the data provide additional
detail regarding prescriptions: for each drug, a separate prescription count is observed for each
of four payment methods, including Medicare Part D, Fee-for-Service Medicaid, cash, and com-
mercial insurance. In the data, approximately half of dispensed prescriptions for cholesterol drugs
correspond to individuals with commercial insurance; 34 percent obtain products through Medicare
Part D, ten percent purchase medications with cash, and the remaining six percent are covered by
Medicaid.
      To prepare the data for analysis, we reshaped the files provided so that each row corresponds
to a doctor-drug-month triplet. With guidance from IMS Health, zeros were explicitly introduced in
this step for missing observations corresponding to existing products not associated with positive
prescriptions in the IMS data. Starting in 2006, we aggregated prescriptions across methods of
payment to arrive at a single number of prescriptions written by physician, drug, and month. We
combined prescriptions for “Pravastatin” and “Pravastatin SOD”, which are the same product, and
did likewise for “Lovaza” and “Omacor”, which are the same product. We dropped Baycol from the
dataset. For some years, due to the projection calculation described above, the prescription variable
was not a whole number; with guidance from IMS Health, we rounded the number of prescriptions
to the nearest whole number. To abstract from physician entry during the sample period, we impose
a sample restriction in addition to that described above: specifically, each physician included must
prescribe at least ten cholesterol drugs during the calendar year 2000. Finally, we used information
from the U.S. FDA to determine the approval date for each therapy. The first month after this
date was determined to be the first month of a drug’s market life in the United States. We created
indicator variables for drugs that are new corresponding to the first six months of the drug’s market
life in the United States, and separately, to the first 24 months of the drug’s market life in the United
States. We created indicator variables for generic products lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin.
Electronic Database Use for Hypercholesterolemia and Dyslipidemia Therapies, by
U.S. Physicians: We obtained data on individual physicians’ information access from the leading
U.S. point-of-care medical applications firm. For each physician, we observe the corresponding
initial database registration date; this is used to construct the indicator variable Zit that takes
on a value of one for registered users, and that is otherwise zero. For each physician-product-
month triplet, we also observe a proxy for the number of lookups completed. We use this proxy
to construct a physician-specific indicator for database use that is equal to 1 if the doctor records
at least one cholesterol drug lookup during the sample period, and that is otherwise zero. During
January 2000 through December 2010, the share of sample physicians registered as database users
rose from 0.003 to 0.451. Our analysis is thus based on a sample combining a) physicians that first
registered during or before the sample period, and b) physicians that registered before the sample
period, and c) physicians that never registered. Each physician is identified in the data by a unique,
11-digit American Medical Association Medical Education Number, first name, last name, middle
name, and five-digit zipcode. These characteristics form the basis for a merge with the prescription
information described above.

practicing  in  the  same  zipcode  for  which  Drug  Database  and  Use  is  equal  to  one.    The  intensity  of  use  proxy  is  a  lower-­
bound  on  the  number  of  physician-­specific  database  queries  corresponding  to  the  cholesterol  drugs  considered  in  this  
analysis.    Prescription  diversity  by  physician-­month  is  summarized  by  the  number  of  unique  drugs  prescribed  and  the

that  prescribe  the  new  drug  within  its  initial  market  year  and  is  otherwise  zero.    Drugs  are  considered  New  if  within  24  
months  of  market  approval  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration.    Prescription  variables  are  from  IMS  Health  and  
database  registration  data  are  from  a  leading  U.S.  point-­of-­care  medical  applications  firm.

Notes:  *  p  <  0.10,  **  p  <  0.05,  ***  p  <  0.01.  This  table  provides  least-­squares  estimates  of  equation  (5)  for  U.S.  physicians'  
prescription  of  twelve  cholesterol  drugs  first  approved  for  U.S.  sale  during  January  2000—December  2008  (Table  1).    The  
binary  dependent  variable  captures  the  time  lapse  between  FDA  approval  of  drug  j  and  physician  i 's  initial  prescription  of  it,  
taking  a  value  of  1  if  initial  prescription  occurs  within  a  year  of  FDA  approval;;  specifications  are  included  for  the  full  sample  of  
physicians  (columns  1-­4)  and  for  the  subset  of  physicians  that  eventually  adopt  and  use  the  electronic  reference  to  search  
for  information  about  cholesterol  drugs  (columns  5-­6).    Database  is  the  Drug  Database  and  Use  indicator  variable  described  
in  Table  2,  and  takes  a  value  of  1  for  a  physician  user  with  database  access  at  the  time  drug  j   receives  FDA  approval.    
Generic  indicates  the  products  pravastatin,  lovastatin,  and  simvastatin.    Regressions  include  zipcode-­drug  (columns  1-­6)  
and  physician  (columns  2,  4,  6)  fixed  effects  as  well  as  the  cholesterol  drug  prescription  volume  for  physician  i   in  the  month  
prior  to  drug  j's  introduction.    Results  are  robust  to  Poisson  and  Negative  Binomial  estimation,  and  are  qualitatively  identical  
when  replacing  the  dependent  variable  with  an  indicator  for  first  prescription  within  six  months,  an  indicator  for  first  
prescription  within  two  years,  or  a  continuous  measure  for  the  time  to  first  prescription  (corrected  for  censoring).  Standard  
errors  clustered  by  zipcode  appear  below  each  point  estimate;;  results  are  robust  to  clustering  errors  by  physician.

Appendix
A.1     Medical Innovation
Innovation in hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia therapy: Information about the
evolving set of pharmaceutical therapies available for prescription was obtained from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the period January 2000 through December 2010. Twelve
new statin or lipid-lowering drugs, including new formulations, combinations, and versions, intro-
duced during this period and are described below. These include three new molecular entities
Crestor, Lovaza, and Zetia; three generic versions lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol),
and simvastatin (Zocor); two new formulations Altoprev (extended-release Mevacor) and Lescol XL
(extended-release Lescol); and four new drug combinations Advicor (extended-release niacin and
Mevacor), Pravigard PAC (aspirin and Pravachol), Vytorin (Zetia and Zocor), Simcor (extended-
release niacin and Zocor). A description of each drug innovation appears below based on publicly
available data including approval letters and administrative, medical, and pharmacological review.
Baycol was withdrawn early in the sample period in August 2001 and is thus omitted.
Existing therapies available in January 2000:
1. Lescol (fluvastatin) is a statin marketed by Novartis since its FDA approval as a new molecular
entity on December 31, 1993; its patent protection expired in 2012. Like other statins, its mechanism
of action is to limit a specific enzyme in the liver, preventing cholesterol synthesis.
2. Lipitor (atorvastatin) is a statin marketed by Pfizer. Its mechanism of action is similar to that
of fluvastatin, but unlike other statins, atorvastatin is a synthetic compound. The therapy was
approved by the FDA as a new molecular entity on December 17, 1996. Between 1996 and 2012,
Lipitor was the best-selling drug globally; its patent expired in November 2011.
3. Mevacor (lovastatin) is the first statin to receive FDA approval. The drug was approved as a
new molecular entity on August 31, 1987 for sale in the United States by Merck. The therapy was
protected by patents through June 2001.
4. Niaspan (extended-release niacin) is vitamin B3 , or nicotinic acid, and is marketed by Abbott
Laboratories. Extended-release niacin was approved for sale in the United States on July 28, 1997.
5. Pravachol (pravastatin) is a statin marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb since its FDA approval on
October 31, 1991. In addition to inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, Pravachol also inhibits low-density
lipoprotein synthesis. Two clinical trials, each completed in November 2003, suggest Pravachol is
outperformed by both Zocor and Lipitor. Patent protection expired in June 2006.
6. Zocor (simvastatin) is a statin marketed by Merck since its FDA approval as a new molecu-
lar entity on December 23, 1991. Zocor outperformed Pravachol in its prevention of cholesterol
synthesis in a clinical trial completed in November 2003. Patent protection expired in April 2006.
New chemical entities, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) is a new molecular entity approved by the FDA for sale in the
United States by Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals on August 12, 2003. The molecule acts by reducing
intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols, and is thereby distinct relative to
other statin therapies. The drug was approved for use in treating primary hypercholesterolemia
and mixed dyslipidemia (by reducing total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B), and as an adjunct to other
lipid-lowering treatments. It was thus approved for use alone or with other statins. A 2008 clinical
trial revealed additional evidence supporting the superior performance of Crestor compared with a
placebo treatment. Patent protection expires in January 2016.
2. Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) is a new molecular entity introduced by Abbott labs and
approved by the FDA on November 10, 2004. It was initially introduced under the trade name
Omacor. Unlike statins, Lovaza is aimed at reducing tricylerides rather than low-density lipopro-
teins and may thus be combined with a statin as an adjunct therapy. Patent protection expired in
September 2012.
3. Zetia (ezetimibe) is a new molecular entity introduced by Schering and approved by the FDA on
October 25, 2002 for sale in the United States. The molecule acts by reducing intestinal absorption
of cholesterol and related phytosterols, and is thus distinct from statins. The drug was initially
approved for use in treating hypercholesterolemia for use alone or with other statins. In January
2008, a clinical trial found Zetia performed poorly compared with other therapies, and it was at
that time recommended that Zetia not be prescribed except in cases for which all other cholesterol
drugs had previously failed. Patent protection expires in April 2017.
New generic versions, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Lovastatin is the generic equivalent of Mevacor, and was initially approved by the FDA for sale
in the United States by Geneva Pharmaceuticals applied on December 17, 2001.
2. Pravastatin is the generic equivalent of Pravachol, and was initially approved by the FDA for
sale in the United States by Teva Pharmaceuticals on April 24, 2006.
3. Simvastatin is the generic equivalent of Zocor, and was initially approved by the FDA for sale
in the United States by Teva Pharmaceuticals on June 23, 2006.
New dosage forms, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Altoprev (extended-release lovastatin) is a new dosage form and was approved by the FDA
on June 26, 2002 for sale in the United States, following a new drug application by Aura Phar-
maceuticals, Inc. of March 30, 2001. The approval is for use of Altoprev for lowering cholesterol
and LDL-C to target levels along with diet and exercise, to slow the progression of atherosclerosis
in patients with coronary heart disease, and to reduce total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and triclycerides
and to increase HDL-C in patients with dyslipoproteinemia. The drug was found to outperform
Mevacor (lovastatin). Altoprev is protected by patents though at least December 2017.
2. Lescol XL (extended-release Lescol) is a new dosage form and was approved by the FDA for sale
in the United States by Novartis on October 6, 2000. Patent protection expired in 2012.
New drug combinations, January 2000–December 2010:
1. Advicor (Mevacor and extended-release Niacin) is a new drug combination approved by the
FDA on December 17, 2001 for sale in the United States by Kos Pharmaceuticals. Advicor was
approved for use in treating primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in two types of
patients: a) those treated with lovastatin who require further triglyceride lowering or HDL raising
who may benefit from adding niacin to their regimen, and b) patients previously treated with niacin
who require further LDL lowering and may benefit from having lovastatin added to their regimen.
Thus, Advicor was not approved as an initial therapy for lowering LDL levels. Moreover, in clinical
trials, Advicor was found to perform no better than Mevacor as a first-line agent.
2. Pravigard PAC (Pravachol and aspirin) is a new drug combination approved by the FDA on
June 24, 2003 for sale in the United States by Bristol Myers Squibb.
3. Vytorin (Zetia and Zocor) is a new drug combination approved by the FDA for use, along
with diet or with other lipid-lowering treatments to reduce total C, LDL-C and raise HDL-C, on
July 23, 2004 by MSP Singapore company, LLC. The drug combination was more effective at
lowering lipids, but was also associated with more adverse events (both serious and leading to
discontinuation) than either monotherapy. In January 2008, a completed clinical trial revealed
Zetia, a component of Vytorin, performed poorly relative to other therapies.
4. Simcor (simvastatin and extended-release niacin) is a new drug combination approved by the
FDA on February 15, 2008 for sale in the United States by Abbott Laboratories. Like Advicor,
Simcor is approved only as a second-line treatment for cases in which the monotherapy is considered
to be inadequate.
A.2     Data
U.S. Prescriptions for Hypercholesterolemia and Dyslipidemia Therapies: Prescription
data for U.S. medical practitioners and each of the products described above were obtained from the
IMS Health Xponent database. IMS Health draws its prescription data from a large but non-random
sample of over 70 percent of U.S. pharmacies. As of the time our data were assembled, Xponent
included direct information from over 38,000 retail stores, including approximately 119 mail-service
pharmacies and 820 long-term care facilities; this compares with a universe of approximately 57,000
retail pharmacies, 327 mail-service outlets, and 3,000 long-term care facilities. In addition to
observing directly dispensed prescription volumes (or “sell-out”) for each sample pharmacy, IMS
Health observes prescription drug purchase volumes (or “sell-in”) for the universe of U.S. pharmacies
and drugs—that is, including both sample and non-sample stores. To correct for sampling error
and to ensure the data are representative, IMS Health has applied a proprietary procedure that
a) combines sell-in and sell-out data for sample pharmacies to determine what ratio of purchased
product is actually dispensed for each drug and store, b) uses this ratio (or “projection factor”),
appropriately weighted by store type and proximity, to estimate the dispensed volume by drug for
any store reporting sell-in but not sell-out volumes. Importantly, this projection and weighting
procedure applies only to strictly positive prescription levels, but does not apply to zeros, enabling
us to accurately track the initial adoption of new products over time for each physician.
      The data IMS Health provided include prescriptions by 280,622 unique U.S. physicians for
each product in each month during January 2000 through December 2010. To avoid studying
physicians specialized outside cardiovascular care, we restrict analysis to physicians that prescribe
at least some cholesterol products. Specifically, for a physician to be included in the dataset, he
or she needs to have written at least ten filled prescriptions for cholesterol therapies during the
calendar year 2010. The data provide precise identifying information for each prescribing physi-
cian, including the unique, 11-digit American Medical Association Medical Education Number, the
first name, last name, and middle name, and the five-digit zipcode corresponding to the medical
practice of the physician. From January 2006 through December 2010, the data provide additional
detail regarding prescriptions: for each drug, a separate prescription count is observed for each
of four payment methods, including Medicare Part D, Fee-for-Service Medicaid, cash, and com-
mercial insurance. In the data, approximately half of dispensed prescriptions for cholesterol drugs
correspond to individuals with commercial insurance; 34 percent obtain products through Medicare
Part D, ten percent purchase medications with cash, and the remaining six percent are covered by
Medicaid.
      To prepare the data for analysis, we reshaped the files provided so that each row corresponds
to a doctor-drug-month triplet. With guidance from IMS Health, zeros were explicitly introduced in
this step for missing observations corresponding to existing products not associated with positive
prescriptions in the IMS data. Starting in 2006, we aggregated prescriptions across methods of
payment to arrive at a single number of prescriptions written by physician, drug, and month. We
combined prescriptions for “Pravastatin” and “Pravastatin SOD”, which are the same product, and
did likewise for “Lovaza” and “Omacor”, which are the same product. We dropped Baycol from the
dataset. For some years, due to the projection calculation described above, the prescription variable
was not a whole number; with guidance from IMS Health, we rounded the number of prescriptions
to the nearest whole number. To abstract from physician entry during the sample period, we impose
a sample restriction in addition to that described above: specifically, each physician included must
prescribe at least ten cholesterol drugs during the calendar year 2000. Finally, we used information
from the U.S. FDA to determine the approval date for each therapy. The first month after this
date was determined to be the first month of a drug’s market life in the United States. We created
indicator variables for drugs that are new corresponding to the first six months of the drug’s market
life in the United States, and separately, to the first 24 months of the drug’s market life in the United
States. We created indicator variables for generic products lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin.
Electronic Database Use for Hypercholesterolemia and Dyslipidemia Therapies, by
U.S. Physicians: We obtained data on individual physicians’ information access from the leading
U.S. point-of-care medical applications firm. For each physician, we observe the corresponding
initial database registration date; this is used to construct the indicator variable Zit that takes
on a value of one for registered users, and that is otherwise zero. For each physician-product-
month triplet, we also observe a proxy for the number of lookups completed. We use this proxy
to construct a physician-specific indicator for database use that is equal to 1 if the doctor records
at least one cholesterol drug lookup during the sample period, and that is otherwise zero. During
January 2000 through December 2010, the share of sample physicians registered as database users
rose from 0.003 to 0.451. Our analysis is thus based on a sample combining a) physicians that first
registered during or before the sample period, and b) physicians that registered before the sample
period, and c) physicians that never registered. Each physician is identified in the data by a unique,
11-digit American Medical Association Medical Education Number, first name, last name, middle
name, and five-digit zipcode. These characteristics form the basis for a merge with the prescription
information described above.

the  final  sample  period,  December  2010.    The  upper-­left  number  in  Panel  A  (mean,  lovastatin,  0.079)  is  the  
average,  across  zipcodes,  of  the  standard  deviation  across  local  physicians  in  the  fraction  of  their  total  
December  2010  prescriptions  that  are  accounted  for  by  generic  lovastatin;;  the  upper-­left  number  in  Panel  B  
(mean,  lovastatin,  0.276)  is  the  average,  across  zipcodes,  of  the  standard  deviation  across  local  physicians  in

Notes:  *  p  <  0.10,  **  p  <  0.05,  ***  p  <  0.01.  This  table  provides  least-­squares  estimates  for  a  variant  of  (6)  for  cholesterol

for  information  about  cholesterol  drugs  (columns  3-­4).    The  dependent  variable  in  columns  1  and  3  captures  the  
prescription  diversity  of  physician  i   as  the  number  of  unique  drugs  j  that  are  prescribed  by  i   during  month  t .  The  
dependent  variable  in  columns  2  and  4  is  the  prescription  Herfindahl-­Hirschman  index  for  physician  i   in  month  t .

of  physicians  who,  conditional  on  adoption,  use  the  database  to  look  up  cholesterol  drugs  to  differing  extents;;  the  usage  
proxy  is  zero  for  low-­intensity  users,  between  zero  and  14  for  medium-­intensity  users,  and  above  14  for  high-­intensity  
users.    All  regressions  include  physician  and  zipcode-­month  fixed  effects,  as  well  as  the  cholesterol  drug  prescription  
volume  for  physician  i   in  month  t -­1.    Standard  errors  clustered  by  zipcode-­month  appear  below  each  point  estimate.

Notes:  *  p  <  0.10,  **  p  <  0.05,  ***  p  <  0.01.  This  table  summarizes  prescription  heterogeneity  across  U.S.  physicians  and  
over  time.    Columns  1  and  2  indicate  the  average  Euclidean  distance  (norm)  between  a)  the  vector  of  physician-­i  
prescription  shares  across  drugs  j  and  b)  the  vector  of  average  prescription  shares,  in  December  2010  (Panel  A)  and  in  
January  2000  (Panel  B)  for  physicians  without  access  to  the  electronic  database  in  December  2010  (column  1)  and  for  
physicians  with  access  in  December  2010  (column  2).    Column  3  presents  estimates  from  two  cross-­section  regressions  
in  which  the  mean  Euclidean  distance  between  physician  i   and  his  group  average  is  the  dependent  variable,  regressed  
on  an  indicator  for  database  access  in  December  2010  and  zipcode  fixed  effects.    Panel  C  provides  difference-­in-­
differences  estimates  with  two  time  periods  (January  2000  and  December  2010);;  the  dependent  variable  is  as  in  Panels  
A  and  B,  and  is  regressed  on  an  indicator  for  December  2010,  its  interaction  with  the  indicator  for  database  access,  and  
physician  fixed  effects.    Standard  errors  appear  below  each  point  estimate.
