             Economic Effects of the Firefighters' Union




      This is a study of the effects of unionism in the public sector

occupation of firefighting. A large and detailed set of data permits

the examination of submarkets of this occupation. A before/after

methodology is introduced to obtain more precise estimates of union

wage differentials. The study's findings are: (1) that there is a

greater union effect on fringes than on salaries which indicates a

significant alteration in the composition of the compensation package;

(2) that the estimates from the before/after methodology confirm the

cross—section results which show modest union wage differentials; and,

most significantly, (3) that the union effect varies along different

dimensions —— most notably the length of the contractual arrangement

between municipality and union.

       The growth of public sector unionism in the last two decades raises

important questions about the economic effects of unions of governmental workers.

Do these unions have large or small impacts on wages or costs? Most recent

research, based on cross—sectional comparisons of wages and union status across

cities or selected decision units (see Lewin for a useful summary), have found

only small effects. In part because of data availability, little attention has

been given to the impact of public unions on fringe benefits and the structure

of wages, and little to differences in the impact of unions under different

market conditions. Although public sector unionism is a recent development,

no study has estimated union effects on a before—after basis.

        This study seeks to remedy these gaps in our knowledge. It examines

the economic effects of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF)

using a large pooled cross—section sample of cities. It compares cities before

and after unionism as well as on a cross—section basis; it estimates the impact of

unionism on fringes and the structure of wages as well as total compensation,—

and on cities with different forms of municipal governments. The large sample

permits estimation of separate equations for union and nonunion cities which

cast light on the way unionism alters the wage—setting process.

        Previous work on the IAFF has dealt with relatively small samples

(Ashenfelter, 130 cities; Ehrenbrugh, 256 cities) and been limited to cross—

section comparisons of wage effects. Ashenfelter found a modest union impact

on wages (the average cross—section result for 1961 to 1966 was .036) but con-

trolled only for cost of living differences across cities. Ehrenburgh made the

important innovation of using the presence of an IAFF contract as the union

variable and found a larger effect (.098). Neither study corrected for 'omitted'

city factors that might be associated with both unionism and the level of wages.
                                                                                 2




       This study finds moderate union compensation effects using cross—section

data on over 1,000 cities and comparisons of pay before and after unionism in

300 to 500 cities, and finds that most of the effect occurs via fringes rather

than straight—time pay. The similarity between before—after and cross—section

comparisons suggests no serious selectivity bias in the standard cross—section

union equations. The study also finds quite different union effects depending

on the length of time organized and on the type of cities, suggesting thatmarket and

organizational factors influence the economic impact of unionism

        The paper is divided into four sections. Section I describes the insti-

tutional setting in which the IAFF and cities bargain over compensation. Section

II describes the data used in the analysis. Section III sets out the econometric

model. Section IV presents the basic empirical results and considers differential

effects of unionism among types of cities. The paper concludes with a brief

summary of findings.



I. The Firefighter's Market

        Firefighting is the most extensively organized public employee occupation.

The IAFF has been organizing fire fighters since 1918, so many large fire depart-

ments were IAFF locals prior to the surge of public employee unionism in the

sixties. In 1960, approximately 74 percent of the nation's 137,884 firefighters

were organized. Through the sixties, the IAFF's ranks grew (from 1962 to 1964,

85 new locals and 2,044 members; from 1964 to 1966, 122 new locals and 7,000 mem-

bers); however, this growth did little more than keep pace with the growth of the

occupation itself. By 1972, there were 194,785 firefighters in the United States,

and approximately 77 percent organized.

        As municipal employees, firefighters are paid out of a publicly financed

budget, not out of a firm's revenue like private employees. Revenue from pro-

perty taxes is usually the largest part of a municipal budget, supplemented by
                                                                                3




income and sales taxes. The property tax—based revenue is often divided between

more than one governing unit or district, all depending on the same base.

Because municipal government decisions depend on a politically formulated budget,

the collective bargaining process in firefighting is political in nature.     Dis—

tiiictfrom actual negotiations, IAFF lobbying on issues of budget formulation and

budget allocations is a key process affecting firefighters' pay. Often the IAFF

finds itself competing with other municipal unions for a larger share of the

budget. (Although this inter—union competition is similar to craft union com-

petition in the construction industry, the occupational peculiarities of fire

fighting limit the usefulness of such an analogy.)

        The second "tier" of the process, the actual negotiations, also has

distinctive political aspects. Government authority is generally not as cen-

tralized as that of a private institution. A bargaining representative may not

even have the authority to allocate funds for a settlement he may have reached.

A legislature may repudiate the settlement, or certain state funds may not be

forthcoming to ensure a settlement at the local level. Despite the problems

of repudiation, and the potentially lengthy delays involved in litigatioris,

rarely will a contract dispute result in a strike. Depending on state laws,

public employees and union officials may face stiff fines, jailing or even

dismissal for participating in a public—employee strike. Although the IAFF

eliminated a "no—strike" clause from its constitution at its 1968 convention,

harsh consequences do deter firefighter strikes. In 1972, there were only 11

work stoppages by firefighters in the United States. The average work stoppage

 involved a department of 52 employees and lasted for only four days. To remedy

 the costly problems of delays due to repudiation and litigation, 17 states have

 adopted arbitration systems for public sector bargaining impasses. Five of

 these states have adopted a "last best offer" arbitration system in which the

 arbitrator chooses either the last position of union or of management on an
                                                                                4




issue—by—issue basis, or on a package basis. However, the results of the

arbitration process are often longer delays, and occasionally more court action.

        IAFF contract negotiations in the town of Ipswich, Massachusetts

illustrate the problems involved in this second tier of public bargaining.

In Ipswich contract negotiation has involved an initial settlement, repudiation

of that settlement eight months later, failure of mediation and fact finding

by appropriate state agencies, a last best offer arbitration award in favor

of the IAFF local, court action which vacated the arbitration panel's award,

and an appeal by the local of the court decision. Finally, the town and the

firefighters agreed to a retroactive agreement in April 1978, but through the

first months of 1978 the Ipswich firefighters continued to work under their

1973 contract.

        Overall, contrary to the claim of Wellington and Winter, industrial

relations in this public sector do not appear to create great union power

because of the essential nature of the services provided. The threat of repu-

diation and court delays makes it more difficult for the heads of the locals

to deliver a wage agreement to their ranks. The penalties accompanying strikes

severely limit the economic power of the union. Moreover, seniority compensation

(called longevity pay in the protective services) and pension benefits are often

non—portable from department to department, depending on state rulings. This

non portability of benefits is sometimes coupled with residency requirements.

In such a case, a firefighter cannot change departments without first changing

his residence and losing his longevity salary increments and his position in his

employer's pension system. This immobility within the firefighter occupation

works against the bargaining power of the IAFF, because firefighters are not

free to change jobs to look for better conditions. It would appear unreasonable

to expect enormous union wage effects.

II. Data

            This study has obtained data from a variety of sources on wages, fringes,

unionism, and diverse control variables to estimate the economics of the

-IAFF.      Wage and fringe data are obtained from statistics on wage and salary

expenditures CS), number of full—time employees (E), and duty hours per week (H),

and city contribution (C) to employees' retirement benefits and to insurance

programs, in the Municipal Yearbook. The average hourly wage is measured by

W =   (S/E)/52H on the assumption that workers are employed year round. Fringes
paid per hour are defined as F = (C/E)/52H while total compensation (TC) is the

sum F + W. The data on wages are available for two years: 1966, when relatively

few collective contracts were signed for firefighters, and for 1976. Fringe

data relate to 1976 only and thus cannot be analyzed in the before—after frame-

work. :1:


            In addition to the average hourly wage or salary and fringes, the analy-

sis uses total salary (52HW) and entrance and maximum salaries (defined as "the

annual base salary of a firefighter during his first twelve months on the force,...

and the maximum annual base salary paid full—time firefighters not holding any

promotional rank"), as dependent variables likely to be affected by unionism.

If the IAFF influences hourly wages by changing hours worked rather than yearly

salary, the coefficient on the hourly and yearly wage equations will differ. If

the IAFF changes the wage structure or accelerates promotions, it is likely to

have different effects on entrance, maximum, and average salaries.

            Unionism is measured by the presence of an IAFF contract and in some

calculations by the presence of an IAFF local. As Ehrenberg argues, the contract

variable provides a better measure of the potential effectiveness of the union

in altering wages and work conditions. Because of the lack of data on unioniza-

tion for some cities in 1966, the study employs three samples: (1) a sample of

1,015 cities for the 1976 cross—section when figures exist for all of the relevant
                                                                                 6



cities; (2) a sample of 597 cities for the 1966—1976 analysis based on the

smaller number of cities in the Municipal Yearbook 1966, with cities having

"not reported or not applicable" union figures categorized as nonunion (a

reasonable surmise as those cities were not included in the 1964 IAFF Convention

Reports as sending delegates to the union convention); and (3) a smaller sample

of 307 cities in which the "not reported or not applicable" were deleted from

consideration.

        The other "control" variables fall into two categories: those which

differ over time2 and those which do not change over time for each city (or

in which the change is assumed to be insignificant in the determination of wages).

        Those variables which change over time include: population; opportunity

wage; alarms per 1,000 people; per capita income; median value of single family

housing; and per capita general revenue from city's own sources. Population is

expected to be positively related to the demand for fire services, while oppor-

tunity wage3 should be negatively related to the supply of firefighters. The

fire insurance rating could signal a compensating differential for work in more

hazardous communities; number of alarms, as a proxy for number of runs by a

department, is expected to be positively related to wage. Per capita income,

median housing value, and per capita revenue should yield positive coefficients

in wage equations as well.                                 --

        Those variables in which the change is assumed to be insignificant

in the determination of wages are: percent of population that is non—white;

four region controls; government type (council—manager, canmission plan, mayor—

council,, town meeting); and land area. With population controlled land area

may be positively related to wages (fire department responsible for more ter-

ritory) or negatively related to wages (fire department responsible for a more

densely populated area, in which firefighting may be more hazardous).4

 III.    Econometric Models

           Two types of econometric models will be used to estimate the effect of

 the IAFF on pay. As in previous studies of union wage effects,, a cross—section

 model of the following form will be estimated first:


           (1)            mW1 = a1   + ct1U1 +          +


 where      = wage or compensation

         U1 =    0—1   variable for whether or not city has a collective contract for

                 period 1

                 list of controls for period 1

            =    residual,   assumed N(0, a2)

 To the extent that the X's control for factors which are correlated with mW

 and unionism, so that E(E1U) =             0, equation (1) will yield an unbiased estimate
 of the union effect.

           Iti reasonable to expect             that   the union effect will differ along

rious dimensions. Information                on organization in a prior (base year)
 period permits the model (1)          to   be extended to allow the length of organization
 to influence the union effect. Let IJ = 0—1 dummy variable for having a contract

 in the base year and in the current period; U = 0—1 dummy variable for having

 a contract in the base year only; and U1                0—1 dummy variable f or a contract in

 the current period. Then we can expand (1) as follows:


           (2)            mW1 =   a+           + a2(U01) + c3(U0) + X1 + Ej

 If   being organized over two periods has a greater impact on wages than organiza-

 tion over a shorter span, the coefficient on U01(c2) will exceed that on

 If a city that signs a contract in an early period but not in a later period

 maintains union wage scales,. the coefficient on U0(c3)              will be positive. If
 neither of these factors operate, (2) will collapse in the model (1).
                                                                                          8




                 If the X's do not completely control for wage—determining factors that

         are correlated with unionism, (1) and (2) will not yield the desired impact

         parameters. Assume, for example, that there is an omitted city effect (D) that

         is positively correlated with unionism and with wages: in this case the OLS

         estimate of (1) would yield an upwardly biased estimate of the true         c. Alter-
        natively, if the omitted effect were positively correlated with Uand negatively

        with wages, the OLS estimate would be downward biased.

                 To handle this problem, we make further use of data on an earlier cross—

         section, in which the omitted factor is also expected to operate. Formally,

                                    = D +
         assume that in (1)                   where E(DU1)     QandE(Z1U1) = 0.    Assume also

_thatDalsoaffects wages in the other period:

                 (3)          lnW = a0      + c0U0 +t +         +

         where   is a scaling factor that permits city effects to vary over time and

         where E(50i1) =               E(50U) =    0.
                           E(J.0)                       In this base year equation, there is no

         specification of detailed union variables, as the          U0 period is chosen early

         enough so that interaction variables with even earlier periods have littlemeaning.

         Substituting for D in (1) we obtain:


                 (4)         mW =       A
                                             mW0 + (am—Aa&+
                                                                    —        + a1U1 —

                                               +
                                     Ao0U0

         If X=l and U0 =   0, (4) becomes a straightforward before—after comparison:

                 (5)        mW1 — mW0 = a + ll —           OO + lUl OUQ +

        where E((—)U ) = 0.

                 When      1, however, equation (4) must be estimated

        An estimate of A can be obtained by regressing mW1 on in W0 and the other

        right—hand side variables of (4). However, because                     0, the estimate
                                                                     E(W0)
                                                                                9




of ). will be biased downward, causing an upward bias in the union coefficient

if, conditional on all other variables, W1 is positively correlated with W0.

To estimate the magnitude of the bias, let b          '    be the regression

correlation coefficient and P (O<P<l) be the ratio of the variance of          to the

variance of mW0. Then the bias on the union coefficient c due to the failure to

obtain the appropriate value of A is determined by (see Griliches Ringstad, p. 197):


        (6)       plimcIU
                        01              Pc+o

while the bias in estimating   A   is



                  plim A= l—P/(l—r
                  n÷
Empirically, the values of the relevant regression and correlation coefficients

suggest that the bias on the union term is slight.

        More complex equations, which include union interaction terms as in (6)

can also be developed, with comparable results. The key point is that by addition

of the base year wages to the equation, one obtains at least some control on the

charges that results are due to unobserved city factors.

        The empirical work focuses on two dependent variables, wages paid firemen

and fringe benefits. For several reasons the union effect is likely to be greater

on fringes than on straight—time pay. First, in setting their bargaining goals

unions are likely to give greater weight to the preferences of the more senior

employees who favor fringes and less to young marginal employees than would occur

in a competitive market (see Freeman for detailed discussion). Second, because

of the timing of elections, and the short—term horizon of politicians, local
                                                                      10




governments are likely to be more willing to pay fringes whose costs will

accrue more greatly in the future than in the present.

        When straight—time pay is the dependent variable, (1) or (4) or (5)

can be estimated directly. When fringes are the dependent variable, it is

also necessary to control for the overall level of pay, due to the likely

positive income elasticity of fringes. Simply adding total compensation to

the list of independent variables would not be correct, for fringes are in-

cluded in total compensation. To deal with this problem, let us write the

model with variables in linear form:


        (7)            F        + 13t + 32(TC) + YU + E


                           =o+       + 2(F+S) + yu + c


where F =    dollars   of fringes

      TC =    dollars      of total compensation

      S =    dollars   of straight—time pay

Solving for F by separating F out of TC,


                       F =
        (8)                                   + (/i)S +/i)u +s/1
The true union effect, y, is isolated by first solving for     Let 2 represent

the coefficient on S obtained in (S). The product of the coefficient on unionism

in (8) and 12 (which equals l/l+2) then yields the desired parameter y of

equation (7).
        Besides the union effect on straight—time pay and fringes, unionism

may also affect the structure of wages in the city, as has been found to be

the case of the teachers' union (Gustman and Segal). We will examire the

effects of the IAFF on maximum pay, entrance salary, and hours worked.

        Finally, to evaluate the possibility that unionism influences the

entire process of wage—setting and/or has different effects on different types

of governmental bodies, separate union and nonunion wage equations will be
                                                                                 11

estimated. With separate equations, union effects will show up in different

weights placed on different factors. Average effects can be calculated by

using the regression weights to standardize the wages. For example, if 6.

is    the coefficient on X. in the nonunion equation, and X is the mean of the
                          1                               U
variable for unionists, the overall union wage effect would be the difference

between what unionists got (W) and what they would have obtained if they were

nonunion:

Conversely, using the union equation to provide weights, the union effect could

be estimated as:

IV.    Basic     Empirical Results

          Table 1 presents estimates of the effect of an IAFF local and, more

importantly, a signed contract on several measures of the wages and work con-

ditions of firemen for 1976 and 1966. The table presents calculations for

several samples, defined by the selection criteria described earlier. In

column 1 unionism is measured by the presence of an IAFF local; in columns 2—6

by a signed contract. Columns 1 and 2 show, consistent with the Ehrenberg

argument, that the presence of a contract is the key to a trade union effect,

with the measures of pay in the largest sample unaffected by the IAFF local

      se but positively influenced by the presence of the contract. The remaining

columns focus on the contract variable. For 1976, the table reveals a modest,

but significant, union effect on total compensation, a smaller effect on hourly

and annual salary, little impact on hours worked, and a small effect on the maxi-

mum and entrance scales. In 1966, by contrast, the union effects are much less

and do not differ significantly from zero. In both years the results differ

only slightly by sample size.

          The markedly greater effect of unionism on total compensation than on

salaries in the 1976 cross—section imply a sizeable effect on fringes, since

fringes make up 14.6 percent of total compensation. Table 2 shows the impor-

tance of introducing a more detailed union break, as in equation (2). Using

three contract variables (contract in both periods, U76,           contract in 1976
                                                             66'

only, U76; and contract in 1966 only, U665) reveals a clear and striking pattern.

With the exceptions of the hours variable (in which there are no significant

differences among the three coefficients) and of the maximum salary variable

with r=597 (in which the contractin—l976—only coefficient is insignificantly

greater than the contract in both periods coefficient), it is always the case

that the U66, 76 coefficient is largest and the U66 coefficient smallest.

Furthermore, the p66, 76 coefficients in the non—salary scale equations are

nearly twice the coefficients on simple contract variables in the corresponding

"equation 1" —   type   cross—sections, indicating that the union effect varies

significantly with length of time organized.



Fringes

          Table 3 examines the union effect on fringes by regressing $1/year in

fringes on unionism and the control variables used in Table 1 and by estimating

logistic probability equations that relate the probability of having city—funded

fringes to unionism.      The results are clear. Total fringe spending is raised

by $170.38 or 9.4 percent of fringes by presence of an IAFF contract (column 1,

line ).

          More specifically, the effect of unions on fringe spending

can be of two types       unions can raise the likelihood that a city

offers a given fringe or it can raise spending

on that fringe. To examine the former possibility a logit curve [P = 1/1+exp

—       was estimated linking the probability of having specified fringes to

a contract and other variables. As can be seen in lines 7 and 8, according to

the logistic equations, unionism raises the probability of having those benefits

of .05 and .08 points respectively at the mean levels.

        The union effect on the spending on fringes is examined in lines (1)

through (5). Line (3) shows the union coefficient taken from the equation (8)

model of Section III. Then correcting these coefficients according to the

analysis of that section yields the line (5) coefficients. The union effect on

both fringes taken together is 9.4 percent; on retirement fringes (which comprise

78.1 percent of this fringe package), it is 6.1 percent; and on the insurance

benefits (with a mean of $397 for all cities), 18.4 percent. As the results in

Table 1 imply, the union effect on fringes is significantly greater than on

salaries and wages.

        IAFF representatives offer interesting explanations for the greater

union impact on fringes. A Los Angeles representative cites the importance

of the JAFF's central research department in "informing the locals' represen-

tatives of the successes of various experiments in the arrangement of fringe

packages." He also feels that city negotiators are sympathetic to the argument

that the government has a "social responsibility" to keep fringe benefits up to

levels offered to employees in the private sector. Finally, he says that the

costs of fringes "do not impact immediately." A bargaining representative and

trustee for the Yonkers fire fighters also feels that city negotiators do not

realize the full impact of fringe costs. This is especially true if an admini—

stration is going out of office. He has found that bargaining with a lame—duck

administration, when there is going to be a change in party control, allows the

union local to make significant gains in fringes. He says the administration

of one party will sometimes make it more difficult on the rival party's admini-

stration by putting a greater strain on following years' budgets, while winning

support of a special interest group ——   the   firefighters.

Before/after analysis

        To what extent might the preceding results be in error because of the

possible correlation between unionism (other independent variables) and omitted

city factors? Does before/after contract analysis yield similar or different

estimated union effects?

        As a first step toward getting a handle on this question, it is useful

to find Out which cities are being unionized. From 1966 to 1976, approximately

19 percent of the sample of 597 became organized. Logistic curve estimates of

the impact of wages on the probability of organization yielded only a slight

tendency for organization to be affected by initial wages (a logit coefficient

of .55 with asymptotic standard error of .80). Since the correlation between

unionization and salary or wages is not clear cut, the implication is that the

omitted city factor is not an important determinant of wages and salaries that

is correlated with unionism.

        Part I of Table 4 presents explicit estimates of the contract effect on

average yearly and hourly salaries and on the maximum and entrance salaries given

a A of 1. It regresses the change in salaries on the presence or absence of

contracts in 1976 and 1966 broken into the three discrete categories used earlier:

contracts in both years (U6 66);-no.cont-ractin the initial year, contract in

1976 (U76); and contract in 1966-, none in 1976 (U66); with a, deleted group of

no contracts in both periods.

        If unionism had the same effect on pay in both years there would be no

effect on the U66,
                     76 variable while those on U and U66 would have equal oppo-

site signs. If unionism had larger effects in 1976 than 1966, as indicated in

the cross—section regressions, the U6676 dummy would obtain a positive coeff i—

cient which would be smaller than that on U76 while the U66 group would have

negative coefficients of equal magnitude. As is evident in the tables, neither

of these possibilities turns out to be the case. While the U661

those for the- u g-roup, the biggest effects are on cities with contracts in both

          Part II of Table 4 presents the contract coefficients for the case of a

variable A. Although A's range from .40 to .6-8 in the OLS estimators for the four

dependent variables examined, the union coefficients are nearly identical in three

cases with those from the Al estimators. In the fourth case, with hourly wage

as the dependent variable, the tJ7666 group-'showsan even greater advantage

however, there is a bias in the variable A which needs to be estimated.

          Regressing mW66 on the three contract dummies and the other control

variables yields rW U.Xs which range from .0003 to .089. Thus for all of the

bounds at .008, or effectively zero. Allowing P from section III to be .50 as

an upper bound, we see that       (Table 4, part II) will underestimate A by a factor

of 2 at most. Twice the calculated A's will yield estimates of the union effect

                            with frxedEJ, the case already examined. Since A's

will range between the calculated A's and X=l, and since the contract coefficients

vary only slightly between when these upper and lower bounds for A are used, we

conclude that the biases in the contract coefficients as presented in Table 4,

part II are also slight. A comparison of the coefficients 1n-Tbi4 ith-h-Q-

in   Table 2 shows that the estimates of the coefficients on unionisn are only

slightly affected by different allowances for the omitted factor. Although in

the hourly wage regressions there is some decrease in the union coefficients

with the addition of a control for base period wages, union coefficients in the

salary regressions are virtually unaffected by the addition of such a control.

         The most novel result in the calculations thus far is the much greater

impact of unionism when contracts are signed in 1966 and 1976 than in the other
                                                                                      20



cases.   What explains this result? The most likely explanation is that the

trade union effect differs notably by period of time and/or by type of city,

with either those organized earlier being more prone to union influence or for

the union effect to increase with time organized. More broadly, the results

suggest that there is no single union compensation effect, but rather that ef-

fects differ depending on the environment in which the union and city find them-

selves. In the remainder of this study we examine the interrelation between

union wages and 'environmental' factors in greater detail.



The nature of the union effect

         One way of examining the interrelation between unionism and environmental

factors is to estimate separate wage functions for contract and noncontract cities

and to compare the resulting coefficients on variables. When the effect of a

variable is larger in the contract sample, this means that it is conducive to a

greater union wage effect and conversely when it is lower in the union sector.

         Table 5 compares coefficients on selected variables in 1966 and 1976.

It shows clearly that the earnings functions of the union and nonunion cities

are quite different. However, from one time period to the next, patterns of coef-

ficients of the contract and noncontract are not consistent The most consistent pattern from

sample to sample, from one wage statistic to another, is that the per capita city

revenue. c-oefficients for the contract sub samples are greater than those in the noncontrac

subsamples. According to the estimates in column 3 for acontract and.änoncontract city

starting from a given wage level, a unionized city will tend to increase its

fire fighters' wages more for a given increment in per capita city revenue, pos-

sibly because the increased revenue results from political pressures by the

firefighters. Other noticeable differences in the coefficients include those

in median value of housing variable, which tend to be significantly greater for the

noncontract sample,   and in per capita income, which also are generally greater in

         Next, the separate earnings equations can be used to estimate the contract

effect, by examining what contract (noncontract) wages would be if members were

paid according to the other equations, as indicated in (9) and (lO).of section III.

These estimates presented in Table 6 reinforce the earlier results revealing mode—

rate union effects on total compensation and straight—time pay and large effects

on fringes in 1976 (5.2 percent to 8.4 percent on retirement benefits; 14.7 percent

to 16.1 percent on insurance benefits). The 1966 contract effects are near zero

and usually negative.

         Finally, are there any differences in union effects depending on the

governmental structure of cities? Are mayor—council cities more influenced by

unionism, because of less continuity of the political decision makers?

         To examine this possibility, separate regressions were run for the two

major government types, mayor—council (MC, n=356) and council—manager (CM, n=657)

selected from the entire population of cities for 1976. No signif icant differences exist

by government type: contract coefficients in salary regressions were 3.9 percent

and 4.1 percent for MC and CM cities respectively, as compared to 3.1 percent

for the entire n=10l5 sample. Also consistent with results for the entire sample

are the MC and CM contract coefficients in the total compensation equations ——

both about 1 percent larger than their corresponding salary coefficients. These

slightly larger compensation coefficients again signal greater impact in the area

of fringes. MC and CM contract coefficients (with the level of compensation con-

trolled) for all fringes are 8.5 percent and 7.4 percent, consistent with the 9.4

percent for the total 1976 sample. However, contract coefficients for these two

government subsamples are slightly less than the coefficient for the entire sam-

ple in retirement benefit regressions (MC — 4.6%; CM — 4.2%; all — 6.1%), and

somewhat greater in insurance benefit regressions (MC — 26.9%; CM — 19.1%;

all —   18.4%).

Conclusion

        This study investigated the International Association of Fire Fighters

as a case study of public sector unions. With a larger number of observations,

and a larger set of variables, cross—section results show a small effect (local

or contract) on salaries in both 1966 and 1976: from —1.6 percent to 3.4 percent

and larger effects in fringes and total compensation. The IAFF's effect on

fringes is as much as four times its impact on salaries. The IAFF has an es-

pecially significant impact on insurance benefits, with as much as an 18.3 percent

contract effect. Furthermore, with compensation controlled, the study illustrates

how the IAFF significantly alters the composition of the total compensation pack-

age itself.

        This paper also introduced a superior before/after methodology to the

study of union differentials in wages and salaries. For the firefighters, the

before/after model confirms the cross—section results.

        Finally and perhaps most importantly, we have found significant dif-

ferences in union effects depending on economic environments, notably the length

of the contractual arrangement, and other factors, which suggest the need for

more detailed study of the diversity of union effects in the public sector.

           1
            Since the various wage statistics are derived from city expenditures, the

figures may not be accurate measures of firefighters' compensation in unionized

cities. If negotiations (and possible mediation, fact finding, repudiation,

and court action) are not completed by the end of a fiscal year, these statistics

will understate the eventual city expenditures for that year. Also, depending

on methods of reporting, retroactive settlements will cause such expenditure

statistics to overstate the true compensations in union cities for a given

fiscal year.

           2There are missing values for some independent variables, especially




               --.--
for smaller cities. So as not to lose cities from the samples, missing values

are estimated in a step—wise fashion based on the method described by Griliches,
       -
Hall   and Ilauseman in "Missing Data and Self—Selection in Large Panels." While

not perfect, these estimates are reasonable approximations for the natural loga-

rithm of the given characteristic with the available information. Those charac-

teristics missing for only a few observations,          ,   are   regressed on those inde—
                                                   ml
pendent variables which are present for the entire population, nm


                     Y     a+B 1(Ynm  )




Once the few missing values are estimated, a second set of characteristics (which

are missing for a slightly larger group of cities, m2' are regressed on the now

larger set of non—missing information.

In a four—step process, all missing values are estimated with a least squares

equation.

        3The occupation classification "craftsmen and kindred workers," is

used for the opportunity wage variable because, out of those general classi-

fications available in the Census of Population for urban places of 10,000

or more, the "craftsmen" class had, on a national level, a composition by

race and sec closest to that of the firefighter occupation. The composition

by race and sex was the only check of the classification readily available.

In dollar terms, in 1976, the average salary of a firefighter was approximately

$10,845; the average of the median earnings of craftsmen was $8,113. In 1966,

the figures were $5,896 for firefighters, and $5,238 for craftsmen.

        4Control Variable Data are taken from: The Municipal Yearbook 1966/

1976; Census of Population, vol. 1 1960/1970; County and City Data Book, 1967/

1972; Fire Record of Cities, 1960/1970, as published by National Fire Protection

Association.

        5There are 84 cities in the "union 1966 — nonunion 1976" category in

the n307 and n=597 samples. The size of this group raises doubts about the

consistency of the union data for 1966 and 1976. However, the size of the

group is not improbable. IAFF convention reports show that 35 U.s. locals

and 36 U.S. locals lost charters in the 1962—1964 and 1964—1966 periods,

respectively.
