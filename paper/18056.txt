Estimating Person-Centered Treatment (PeT) Effects Using Instrumental Variables

NBER Working Paper No. 18056

JEL No. C21,C26,D04,I12

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper builds on the methods of local instrumental variables developed by Heckman and Vytlacil
(1999, 2001, 2005) to estimate person-centered treatment (PeT) effects that are conditioned on the
person‚Äôs observed characteristics and averaged over the potential conditional distribution of unobserved
characteristics that lead them to their observed treatment choices. PeT effects are more individualized
than conditional treatment effects from a randomized setting with the same observed characteristics.
PeT effects can be easily aggregated to construct any of the mean treatment effect parameters and,
more importantly, are well-suited to comprehend individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity. The
paper presents the theory behind PeT effects, studies their finite-sample properties using simulations
and presents a novel analysis of treatment evaluation in health care.

INTRODUCTION


Much of the literature on treatments effects has focused on estimating effect
parameters that inform population level or policy-level decisions. Even when
distributional impacts of treatments and policies are studied, the impacts are viewed
as informing a social decision maker to help choose across alternative options
(Heckman 2001). However, in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects, it is
natural to expect that individual choices of treatments may vary from the socially
optimal treatment that is identified based on some average social welfare criterion.
More importantly, treatment effect information that can help change future individual-
level behavior on treatment choices would automatically influence social choice of
treatments through positive self-selection. Hence, estimating treatment effects that
can inform individual-level decision making can be of great social value.


This conundrum manifests in its most acute form in the health care setting. In
traditional clinical outcomes research, the focus has always been on finding average
effects either through large clinical trials or observational datasets. Estimating
treatment effect heterogeneity has mostly been relegated to post-hoc analysis, rather
than becoming the central goal of the analysis.1 Yet, the clinical setting is an obvious
place where individual-level decision making is most relevant as a physician-patient
dyad tries to decide on the best line of treatment for that patient. There is a growing
recognition based on fundamental theoretical principles that more nuanced and
possibly individualized estimates of treatment effects between alternative medical
interventions can lead to increased welfare through more efficient use of medical
technologies (Basu 2009, 2011). In contrast, failing to generate such individualized
estimates and also producing results on population average effects without recognizing
the underlying heterogeneity could lead to welfare losses including faster growth in
health care expenditures (Basu et al., 2011; Basu 2011).2


1 In randomized settings, heterogeneity analyses are often accomplished using post-hoc
subgroup analyses (ref provenge). In some of our recent work, we have shown that such
approaches are likely to be futile since these subgroups are often defined based on broad
characteristics (e,g, gender) that only explains a very small fraction of the individual-level
variance in treatment effects (Basu et al, 2012).

2 In fact such insights and assertions line up well with the political economy of outcomes
research funding in the United States, which witnessed the creation of the Patient-Centered
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                       3

In the evaluation literature, such nuanced treatment effects are most popularly
characterized by conditional average treatment effects (CATE) where an average
treatment effect is estimated conditional on certain values of observed covariates over
which treatment effects vary. For example, if age is the only observed risk factor, one
can establish a conditional effect of surgery versus active surveillance on mortality for
patients of age 60 years diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. This is an
average effect for all 60 year olds in this condition. However, does this estimate apply
to all men with clinically localized prostate cancer at age 60 years? Certainly not, as
there may be many other factors that determine heterogeneity in treatment effects in
this population. For example, clinical stage and grade of cancer not only determines
overall survival but may also determine differential effects from alternative treatments.
To the extent that all potential moderators of treatments effects are observed to the
analyst of the data, a nuanced CATE can be established conditioning on values of all
of these factors.


In most applied work however, not all moderators of treatment effects are observed.
One reason is that many of these moderators are yet to be discovered and hence
remain unknown to scientific knowledge. They are typically represented by the pure
stochastic error term in statistical analysis of data. However, there are some
moderators that fall within the purview of scientific knowledge but remain
unmeasured in the data at hand.           This is usually the case for most randomized
studies that rely on randomization to equate the distribution of all these factors across
the randomization arms and forgo measurement of several factors in the interest of
time and expenses.


In observational studies, these unmeasured moderators of treatment effects play a
vital role in generating essential heterogeneity as often they are observed by
individuals and acted upon by some while making treatment selection (Heckman
1997; Heckman and Vytlacil, 1999).3 An entire genre of methods, including methods
based on local instrumental variable (LIV) approaches, have been developed to

Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) through the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act.
3 In fact Basu (2011) made the argument that the traditional ‚Äúselection on gains‚Äù rationale used

in the education and labor literature is not the only mechanism to assert essential
heterogeneity. Even if gains are unpredictable and selection is based on baseline factors, as
long as those factors are not completely independent of the gains, essential heterogeneity is
induced.
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                  4

estimate policy-relevant and structurally stable mean treatment effect parameters in
the presence of essential heterogeneity (Heckman and Vytlacil 1999, 2001, 2005).
Basu et al. (2007, 2011) introduced these methods to the health economics literature
where essential heterogeneity is widespread and instrumental variable methods are
gaining meteoric popularity. Carneiro and Lee (2009) extended the LIV methods to
estimate the marginal distributions of expected potential outcomes that are geared
towards studying distributional impacts of population level policies.


LIV methods can seamlessly explore treatment effect heterogeneity across both
observable characteristics and unobserved confounders and also be used to establish
CATE based on observed factors. In this paper, we develop and present a new
individualized treatment effect concept called Person-Centered Treatment (PeT) effects,
which can also be estimated using LIV methods. This new treatment effect concept is
more personalized than CATE as it takes into account individual treatment choices
and the circumstances under which people are making those choices in an
observational data setting in order to predict their individualized treatment effects. In
our prostate cancer example suppose that we not only have data on age of the prostate
cancer patients but also the treatment they choose and the distances of their
residence from the hospitals that offer surgical procedures. Assume that these
distances impart a cost for accessing surgery and therefore influence treatment
selection but do not affect the potential outcomes for these patients under either
treatment, i.e. they are instrumental variables. Under such circumstance, 60-year old
patients, who live far from hospital and still choose surgery is likely to have a different
distribution of unobserved confounders than 60-year old patients who live close to the
hospital and choose surgery. Therefore, by taking into account treatment choices and
the observed circumstances under which those choices were made, we can enrich
CATE to form a Person-centered Treatment (PeT) effect that provides a conditional
treatment effect that is averaged over a personalized conditional distribution of
unobserved confounders and not their marginal distribution as in CATE.


There are several intuitive aspects about the PeT effects:


   1. They help to comprehend individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity better
       than CATEs.
   2. They are better indicators for the degree of self-selection than CATE.
       Specifically, they are better predictors of true treatment effects at the individual
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                 5

      level both in terms of the positive predictive value and the negative predictive
      value.
   3. They can explain a larger fraction of the individual-level variability in treatment
      effects than the CATEs. That the marginal distribution of PeT effects is a better
      proxy for the true marginal distribution of individual effects that that of CATEs.
   4. All mean treatment effect parameters can be easily computed from PeT effects
      without any further weighting. So, they also form integral components for
      population‚Äìlevel decision making.


All of these features of PeT effects will be studied here. We begin in Section 2 with the
definition, identification and estimation of PeT effects. Section 3 presents a simulation
study showing the how PeT effects inform individual-level and the mean treatment
effect parameters across a variety of outcomes and sample sizes. In Section 4, we
illustrate the use of estimated PeT effects of surgery versus active surveillance on 7-
year survival and costs among patients diagnosed with clinical localized prostate
cancer. Discussions follows in Section 5.




2. PERSON-CENTERED TREATMENT (PeT) EFFECTS


Structural Models for Outcomes and Choices


We start by formally developing structural models of outcomes and treatment choice
following Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2004). For the sake of simplicity we will
restrict our discussion to two treatment states ‚Äì the treated state denoted by j = 1 and
the untreated state denoted by j = 0, The corresponding potential individual outcomes
in these two states are denoted by Y1 and Y0. We assume,


                    Y1 ÔÄΩ ÔÅ≠1( X O , XU ,ÔÅä )   and   Y0 ÔÄΩ ÔÅ≠0 ( X O , XU ,ÔÅä )        (1)


Where X0 is a vector of observed random variables, XU is a vector of unobserved
random variables which are also believed to influence treatment selection (they are the
unobserved confounders) and ÔÅä is an unobserved random variable that capture all
remaining unobserved random variables.
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                                   6
PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION

Assumption 1. ( X O , XU ) ÔÅÉ ÔÅä and X O ÔÅÉ XU where ÔÅÉ denotes statistical independence.


We assume individual choose to be in state 1 or 0 (prior to the realization of the
outcome of interest) according to the following equation:


        D = 1 if ÔÅ≠D ( X 0 , Z ) ÔÄ≠ U D ÔÄæ 0                                                          (2)


Where Z is a (non-degenerate) vector of observed random variables (instruments)
influencing the decision equation but not the potential outcome equations, ÔÅ≠D is an
unknown functions of X0 and Z, and UD is a random variable that captures XU and all
remaining unobserved random variables influencing choice. By definition, U D ÔÅÉ ÔÅä ,
which also defines the distinction between XU and ÔÅä in (1).                     Equation (1) and (2)
represent the nonparametric models that conform to the Imbens and Angrist‚Äôs (1994)
independence and monotonicity assumptions needed to interpret instrumental
variable estimates in a model of heterogeneous returns (Vytlacil, 2002). As in
Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005), we can rewrite (2) as


        D = 1 if P (x 0 , Z ) ÔÄæ V                                                                  (3)


Where V = FU D|XO ,Z ÔÅõU D | X O , Z ÔÅù , P(x0,Z) = FU D|XO ,Z ÔÅõ ÔÅ≠D (x O , Z )| X O , Z ÔÅù . Therefore, for any

arbitrary distribution of UD conditional on XO and Z, by definition, V ~ Unif[0, 1]
conditional on XO and Z.


Assumption 2. Assume that a)                  ÔÅ≠D (x 0 , Z ) is a nondegenrate random variable
conditional on XO=xO; b) (XU, ÔÅä , UD) are independent of Z conditional on XO=xO; c) The
distribution of UD conditional on (XO, Z) and that of ÔÅ≠D (x 0 , Z ) conditional on XO=xO are
absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure; d) Y1 and Y0 have finite
moments and e) Pr(D =1) > 0.


An individual‚Äìlevel treatment effect is given as


         TE = (Y1 ‚Äì Y0)                                                                            (4)


Obviously, we never observe both the potential outcomes for each individual. Our
observed outcome Y is given as
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                                              7
PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION

       Y = Y1 if D = 1 and Y = Y0 if D = 0                                                                     (5)


Therefore, the goal of the analysis is to obtain estimates of Y1 for subjects with D = 0
and of Y0 for subjects with D = 1.                     These outcomes are known as counterfactual
outcomes as they represent the potential outcomes had the subjects chose a different
treatment than they have in practice. Differences in the counterfactual outcomes
across individual subjects will depend of XO, XU, and ÔÅä . Several individual level
treatment effect parameters can be defined that reflect these variations.


Treatment Effect Definitions


Individualized Expected Treatment Effect (IETE): Since ÔÅä is typically not only
unmeasured but also unknown (as otherwise would have been used for treatment
selection), the most precise individualized expected treatment effect (IETE) that one
can hope for in terms of predictions is given by:

       IETE = ÔÅ∏ (x O , xU ) ÔÄΩ EÔÅä|XO , XU (Y1 ÔÄ≠ Y0 | x 0 , xU ) ÔÄΩ EÔÅä (Y1 ÔÄ≠ Y0 | x 0 , xU )                      (6)


Throughout this paper, we will denote IETE as ÔÅ∏ (x O , xU ) and it will serve as a reference
to which our proposed individual treatment effect parameter and other parameters will
be compared. The typical population-level mean treatment effect parameters, the
Average Treatment Effect (ATE), the Effect on the Treated (TT) and the Effect on the
UnTreated (TUT), can be derived by appropriate aggregation of ÔÅ∏ (x O , xU ) over the
relevant subgroups.


       ATE = E XO ÔÅªE XU |XO ÔÅªÔÅ∏ (x O , xU )| x O , xU ÔÅΩ| x O ÔÅΩ = E XO ÔÅªE XU ÔÅªÔÅ∏ (x O , xU )| x O , xU ÔÅΩ| x O ÔÅΩ


       TT =      E XO|D ÔÄΩ1 ÔÅªE XU |XO ,D ÔÄΩ1 ÔÅªÔÅ∏ (x O , xU )| x O , xU , D ÔÄΩ 1ÔÅΩ| x O , D ÔÄΩ 1ÔÅΩ


       TUT = E XO|D ÔÄΩ 0 ÔÅªE XU |XO ,D ÔÄΩ1 ÔÅªÔÅ∏ (x O , xU )| x O , xU , D ÔÄΩ 0ÔÅΩ| x O , D ÔÄΩ 0ÔÅΩ                        (7)



Note that the second equality for ATE follows from Assumption 1.


Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE): Since XO are the only observed
variables from the outcomes equation, a conditional average treatment effect (CATE)
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                        8
PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION

(Heckman 1997) can be formed which is the average treatment effect conditioned on
levels of XO only.

       CATE = E XU |XO ÔÅªÔÅ∏ (x O , xU )| x O , xU ÔÅΩ ÔÄΩ E XU ÔÅªÔÅ∏ (x O , xU )| x O , xU ÔÅΩ   (8)


where the second equality follows from Assumption 1. We will denote CATE as ÔÅ∏ (x O ) .
This is the treatment effect parameter that an ideal experiment can give where only XO
are observed. Note that the outer expectation in CATE averages over the marginal
distribution of XU. Although the ATE can be obtained by trivial aggregation of CATEs
over all individuals (as in (7)), aggregation of CATE over the treated or the untreated
individuals do not produce the TT or the TUT parameters respectively.


Marginal Treatment Effect (MTE): The marginal treatment effect is perhaps the most
nuanced estimable effect (Heckman 1997; Vytlacil 1999, 2001). It identifies an effect
for an individual who is at the margin of choice such that one‚Äôs levels of XO and Z are
just balanced by one‚Äôs level of V (which includes XU), i.e. P (x 0 , Z ) ÔÄΩ V . MTE can be
expressed as

       MTE(xO, z) = E XU |XO ,P ( Z )ÔÄΩV ÔÅªÔÅ∏ ( x O , xU )| x O , p(z )ÔÅΩ                 (9)


Note that, unlike CATE, the expectation in MTE averages over the conditional
distribution of XU conditioned on meeting the definition for marginal patients.
Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001) have provided the weights needed to aggregate
MTEs to form the mean treatment effect parameters. These weights need to be
calculated from the data at hand.


Person-centered Treatment (PeT) Effect: Despite the granularity of MTEs, it may be
hard to use MTEs directly as representation of individual treatment effects as they
themselves lack individual identity. This is because it is hard (if not impossible) to
pinpoint an individual to whom an MTE estimate can be applied to. Instead another
treatment effect, which we call the Person-centered Treatment (PeT) effect (denoted as
ÔÅÑ ), can be written as:

       ÔÅÑ ÔÄΩ E XU |XO ,P ( Z ),D ÔÅªÔÅ∏ ( x O , xU )| x O , p(z ), D ÔÄΩ d ÔÅΩ                  ( 10 )
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                  9
PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION

where the expectation of unobserved confounders is made conditional on person-
specific estimates of XO, P(Z) and D. Naturally, PeT effects are more nuanced than
CATEs. Note that this parameter was originally defined by Heckman and Vytlacil
(1999). However, they use this parameter as a stepping stone for defining structurally
stable mean effects on treated parameter whose definition do not depend on data (Y,
X, Z). The PeT effect in (10) would take on different values corresponding to two values
of Z =(z, z‚Ä≤), z ‚â† z‚Ä≤, with (Y, X,D) being constant. However, this is exactly the variation
we are after when we are envisioning PeT effects. The fact that two otherwise
observably similar persons choose the same treatment under two values of Z informs
us that their personalized treatment effects may be different.


Conceptually, a PeT effect is also a weighted version of MTEs. For any given individual,
the PeT effects identifies the specific margins where that individual may belong given
its individual values of XO, P(Z) and D. It then averages the MTEs over those margins,
but not all as in ATE. As we prove below, a PeT effect is basically the X-Z-conditional
Effect on the Treated (x-z-CTT) for persons undergoing treatment and is the X-Z-
conditional Effect on the Untreated (x-z-CTUT) for persons not undergoing treatment.
Because conditioning is done based on identifiable individual-level characteristics, a
PeT effect can be identified for each individual in the data.


Uses of PeT effects


All mean treatment effect parameters can be easily computed from the PeT effects
without any further weighting. For example:

       ATE =E X O ,P ( Z ),D ( ÔÅÑ)
       TT =E XO ,P ( Z )|D ÔÄΩ1( ÔÅÑ)                                            ( 11 )
       TUT =E XO ,P ( Z )|D ÔÄΩ 0 ( ÔÅÑ)


In fact, any policy parameter that shifts a certain subgroup of individuals,
characterized by shifting the distribution of XO, to take up or give up treatment can be
predicted. Therefore, these patient-centered treatment effects can form integral
components for population‚Äìlevel decision making.
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                        10

More importantly, distributions of treatment effects are useful for policy makers who
care about distributional effects of policies (Heckman and Robb, 1985). For individual
decision maker, such distributional effects are of central importance. Although
difficult to establish, the most useful metrics to study distributional impacts of policies
and treatments are the full marginal and joint distributions of potential outcomes.
Previous work by Imbens and Rubin (1997) and Abadie (2002, 2003) have developed
estimators for the marginal distributions of potential outcomes under the local average
treatment effect (LATE) framework, where the instrument corresponds to the specific
policy question that is being studied. Carniero and Lee (2009) extends the LIV
framework of Heckman ad Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005) to identify distributions of
potential outcomes and to develop a semiparametric estimator for the entire marginal
distribution of potential outcomes. However, when it comes to understanding
individualized decision making, estimating the marginal distribution of potential
outcomes is not enough. They carry no information to help identify the quantile of the
marginal distribution of counterfactual outcomes where an individual may lie had he
taken an alternative treatment (Carneiro et al 2001). One must have knowledge about
the full joint distribution of potential outcomes, which can only be established under
much more stronger assumptions (Heckman and Honor√© 1990, Heckman and Smith
1993, Heckman et al. 1997).4


In the absence of identification of the joint distribution of potential outcomes, however,
the marginal distribution of the PeT effect can be crucial for understanding individual
level decision making. The PeT effects can be used to more accurately comprehend
individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity that CATEs fail to convey. First, they
may be better predictors of true treatment effects at the individual level both in terms
of the positive predictive value (Pr( ÔÅ∏ (x O , xU ) ‚â• 0| ÔÅÑ ‚â• 0)) and the negative predictive value
(Pr( ÔÅ∏ (x O , xU ) < 0| ÔÅÑ < 0)) than the CATEs (we will study this using simulations). Second,
PeT effects are more likely to explain a larger fraction of the individual-level variability
in treatment effects than the CATEs. Both play a big role in not only identifying person
characteristics to guide treatment allocations but also in guiding future research to
focus on collection of relevant measures of XO and XU.

4 Heckman and Honor√© (1990) uses parametric assumptions. Heckman and Smith (1993) and
Heckman et al. (1997) assume that the persons at the qth percentile in the density of Y0 are at

Naturally, in the absence of essential heterogeneity, the PeT effects converge to CATEs.

provided that EÔÅä (Y | X O , P ÔÄΩ p ) is continuously differentiable with respect to p for almost
every xO.


Proof. The identification for PeT effects follows identification of marginal treatment
effects (MTEs). Assumption 1(a) and (c) ensure that P is nondegenrate, continuously
distributed random variable conditional on XO. Assumption 2(d) is needed to ensure
that the expectations considered are finite. First, following Heckman and Vytlacil
(1999, 2001, 2005), the marginal treatment effect is identified as


EÔÅä (Y | X 0 , Z ) ÔÄΩ E (DY1 ÔÄ´ (1 ÔÄ≠ D )Y0 | X O , Z )


                     ÔÄΩ EÔÅä (Y0 | X O ) ÔÄ´ EÔÅä (D(Y1 ÔÄ≠ Y0 )| X O , Z )


                     ÔÄΩ EÔÅä (Y0 | X O ) ÔÄ´ Pr(D ÔÄΩ 1| X O , Z ) ÔÉó EÔÅä ((Y1 ÔÄ≠ Y0 )| X O ,V ÔÄº P )

Where the second and third equalities follow from Assumptions 1(b) and the fourth
equality comes from the fact that V is uniformly distributed on [0,1] conditional on XO
and Z . Therefore, differentiating both sides with respect to p, we have

Similarly, conditional effect on the untreated (CTUT) is obtained by integrating MTEs
over values of V that are greater than p.                               ‚ñ†


The identification of PeT effects comes out directly from the identification results of
Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005). However, while Heckman and Vytlacil
(1999, 2001, 2005) are mainly concerned with average treatment effects in the
population, we use their results to identify individualized expected treatment effects
and their marginal distribution in the population.


The PeT effects can be trivially aggregated over observed distribution of (XO, P(Z), D) in
order to estimate mean treatment effect parameters such as the Effect on the Treated
(TT), Effect on the Untreated (TUT) and the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). These
derivations are provided in Heckman and Vytlacil (1999).


Semi-parametric estimation


In order to avoid certain disadvantages of full nonparametric estimation of the models
in (1) and (2), we propose a partially separable outcomes model as follows:


                     Y ÔÄΩ ÔÅ≠( X O , X U , D ; ÔÅ¢ ) ÔÄ´ ÔÅä                                 ( 14 )


where ÔÅ≠( X O , XU , D ) is an unknown non-linear function of observable (XO) and
unobservable (XU) characteristics and treatment indicator (D); ÔÅä are purely random
error term. Conditional on specific levels of XO and XU, idiosyncratic expected gains (or
losses) from treatment over control is given by ÔÅ≠(x O , xU , D ÔÄΩ 1; ÔÅ¢ ) - ÔÅ≠(x O , xU , D ÔÄΩ 0; ÔÅ¢ ) .
These idiosyncratic gains or losses may vary either over observed characteristics XO or
over unobserved characteristics XU or both, giving rise to treatment effect

heterogeneity. The terms, observable and unobservable, pertain to the analyst‚Äôs
perspective and these covariates enter the structural model symmetrically in
determining potential outcomes (Mullahy 1997). We will refer to this formulation of
the symmetric structural non-linear model as the pure non-linear model. It
encompasses the broad categories of all parametric and semiparametric generalized
linear models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) that include models for limited dependent
variables.


In addition to the assumption of X O , XU ÔÅÉ ÔÅä, X O ÔÅÉ XU and that of Assumption 1, we
make the following additional assumptions:


Assumption 3: E ( ÔÅ≠( X O , XU , D; ÔÅ¢ )| P ÔÄΩ p, Z ) ÔÄΩ ÔÅ∂ ( X O , K (P ); ÔÅ° ) , is continuously
differentiable with respect to p, where K(P) a non-linear kernel for P.


Estimation of PeT effects proceeds in four steps:


1. An estimate P is constructed using a semiparametric regression of D on XO and Z
   (Das et al, 2003).
2. ÔÅ° is estimated using local polynomial approximation of ÔÅ∂ ( X O , K (P ); ÔÅ° ) over P
    (Robinson, 1988; Fan and Gijbels, 1996). Here, K(P) is represented by the
    polynomial approximation. Such approximation can be estimated using GMM
    estimators using the well-known quasi score equations (Wedderburn, 1974). For N
    individuals,

Variance estimates for PeT effects at the individual level can be readily obtained by
bootstrap, which is in line with obtaining variance estimates of CATEs. For each
replicate of the bootstrap with-replacement sample, the average effect for each person
is saved. In any given replicate, only those persons who are sampled would have an
estimate. However, multiple bootstrap replicates should be able to cover all
individuals. The total number of bootstrap replicates needed can be monitored by
monitoring the minimum number of times each individual is sampled across replicate
datasets.




Simulations


Set up


We study the effects of a binary treatment variable on three different types of
outcomes. First is a typical normally distributed outcome. Second is a binary outcome
and the third is a count data outcome. For each outcome, we specify a data generating
process that incorporates essential heterogeneity.6 We then estimate the PeT effects
across individuals using LIV approaches assuming that we observe (Y, D, XO, Z) only.
We compare these PeT effects to the true values of CATEs. Also we compare the PeT-
based estimates of mean treatment effect parameters to their true values. We also
compute the traditional IV effects for comparison.

 We thank James Heckman and Philipp Eisenhauer for suggesting this approach to numerical computation.

 Note that essential heterogeneity is not being generated by direct selection of gains but rather through factor XU
that is shared between treatment choice and potential outcomes models.

also construct true values for CATE, where conditioning is done on XO: Œæ(xO) = Œº1i(xO) ‚Äì
Œº0i(xO).8 We compute ATE, TT and TUT using estimated ÔÅÑ and compare them to their
respective true values. We also estimate the IV effect using traditional IV methods
and compare them to the true values of the mean treatment effect parameters.
Additionally, we report the Monte Carlo standard deviations for each parameter
estimate and their 95% coverage probabilities.


In order to show that CATE(XO) are consistently recoverable from the PeT effects, we
estimate CATE(XO) by averaging ÔÅÑÀÜ i over deciles of XO and comparing then to true

values.


Finally, in order to evaluate the accuracy in predicting individual level effects, we will
compare the distribution of ÔÅÑ i and Œæ(xO) to the true distribution of expected
individual-level treatment effects Œæ(xO, xU)= Œº1 ‚Äì Œº0 using the following metrics:

 These sample sizes are most typical of health economic analyses. For example, a Medline search of all IV
applications in the past three years revealed that 70% of then had sample size greater than 5000. In fact, in field of
CER, with the emergence of more integrated data, these sample sizes are only likely to increase.

 Note that we do not estimate CATEs but rather construct them based on true values in order to make the
comparisons with estimated PeT effects conservative.

Results


Table 1 compares the performance of traditional IV estimates and constructed
CATE(xO) values to PeT estimates of mean treatment effect parameters. As expected, in
the presence of essential heterogeneity, the traditional IV estimates do not correspond
to any of the mean treatment effect parameters. In case of binary and non-negative
outcomes, the IV estimates have signs opposite to the true value of Average Treatment
Effect (ATT) and Effect on the Treated (TT). Increase in sample size has no influence on
these results.


CATE(xO) values when aggregated over all individuals provides an unbiased and
consistent estimators for the ATE. But when aggregated over subjects choosing or not
choosing treatment, it provides a biased estimator for TT or TUT respectively. Although
this is expected since TT and TUT are influenced by levels of XU that are not accounted
for in CATE(xO) values, this limitation of CATE(xO) has strong implications for
heterogeneity estimated from randomized studies. If these studies fail to measure
certain factors, which would then by acted on by subjects in the population, then
heterogeneous treatment effects estimated from randomized setting cannot be used to
forecast population impacts of access to these treatments.


Finally, the PeT effects were found to be consistent estimators of all of the mean
treatment effect parameters and maintained appropriate coverage probabilities at 95%
even at larger sample sizes.


Table 2 presents the performance of CATE(xO) values versus PeT effects as compared
to true individualized effects Œæ(xO, xU). Across the board, we find that the PeT effects are
better correlated with Œæ(xO, xU), explain a large amount of variance of Œæ(xO, xU) and have
higher PPV and NPV compared to CATE(xO) values. All differences were statistically
significant even in datasets with sample size of 5000.

Figure 1 illustrates how PeT effects can be trivially aggregated across deciles of a
covariate to form CATEs for that decile. The figures show that, for all types of
outcomes, the PeT based aggregation provides unbiased estimates for the true CATEs,
maintaining appropriate coverage probabilities. Results arising out of sample size of
20,000 are not shown as they convey the same message.


The simulations presents strong evidence that the PeT estimates can provide
consistent and nuanced individual-level treatment effects in observational data.




3. DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACTS OF PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENTS ON 7 YEAR
COSTS AND SURVIVAL.9


Background


We study the distributional effects of alternative treatment modalities on health and
economic outcomes in prostate cancer patients using PeT Effects. Note that although
this empirical example is set to look at an evaluation in health care, the methods
employed have broad applicability to a wide variety of evaluations across many
different fields.


Prostate Cancer Treatment Evaluations.


Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly detected non-cutaneous malignancy
among American men (Landis et al. 1999) with more than 186,000 cases diagnosed in
2008 and more than 28,000 men dying from the disease (Jemal et al. 2008). As the
cohort of ‚Äúbaby boomers‚Äù age, the incidence and prevalence of PCa will likely continue
to increase as long as contemporary screening patterns continue. Here we compare
two treatment strategies: Surgery versus active surveillance (AS), in terms of 7-year
costs and survival for elderly men diagnosed with early-stage (clinically-localized)
prostate cancer. The broad rationale for looking at these patients and these treatment
modalities can be found elsewhere (Hadley et al. 2010). Most importantly, many have

argued that the rapid growth in costs of prostate cancer treatments does not fit in line
with the clinical benefits that the sole randomized study in this area have shown
(Holmberg et al, 2002). Result of that randomized study showed that among elderly
patients, surgery and AS produces 8-year survival probabilities of 77.4% and 78.6%,
respectively (p= 0.78) (Bill-Axelon et al. 2008).10


However, many factors render this RCT evidence to be obsolete. Besides the fact that
the above RCT was not powered to look at differences among the elderly group of
patients, life expectancies for elderly individuals have dramatically improved over the
last two decades. Between 1975 and 2005, 15-year survival probabilities for 65-year
old men have increased by 17 percentage points in the US (Muenning and Glied 2010).
This indicates that the survival gains from eliminating cancer are likely to be more
than those twenty-years ago, even when the underlying disease progression from
diagnosis had remained the same. Moreover, with more aggressive screening regimen
implemented during the late 1980s and early 1990‚Äôs, and especially with the advent of
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, distribution of PCa diagnosed among elderly
men in the late 1990s were less advanced than those diagnosed during the pre-PSA
era. Last, but not the least, the quality of surgery has arisen over the past two decades
as evident from the declining morbidity from such procedures. Therefore, exploring the
casual effect of surgery versus AS among elderly patients with PCa using recent data
becomes important.




Data


Our data comes from the 1995 ‚Äì 2009 SEER-Medicare linked dataset. SEER is an
epidemiologic surveillance system consisting of population-based tumor registries
designed to track cancer incidence and survival in the United States. The SEER-
Medicare data links claims for health services collected by Medicare for its
beneficiaries to the SEER registry (Cooper et al. 2002; Viring et al. 2002). We extracted
data for patients of age 66 years or older and who were diagnosed with prostate cancer
between 1995 and 2002. The data contains zip codes for patient residences which
were used to link to Hospital Referral Regions (HRR) identifiers and HRR- year-specific

characteristics based on the Dartmouth Atlas Data11. We used the linked claims data
from these patients for up to December 2009 or their death if that happen before
December 2009. We have 7 years follow-up data for everyone in our sample. The key
variables in our sample are categorized as (a) Outcomes Variables (Y); Treatment (D);
Independent Risk Factors (XO); Instrumental Variable (Z). These categories are
common to any type of evaluation analysis.


     (a) Outcomes Variables: We look at two outcomes. On the benefits side we use a
        binary indicator for 7-year overall survival. On the costs side, we use the total
        undiscounted 7-year expenditures on health care expressed in 2009 dollars.
        Expenditures accumulate over all types of medical costs reimbursed by
        Medicare or a third party payer and patients‚Äô out-of-pocket costs.


     (b) Treatment (D): Comparison is made between the use of surgery (without any
        form of radiation of hormone therapy) in the first six months of diagnosis versus
        active surveillance that is defined as no use of surgery, hormone therapy or
        radiation in the first six months of diagnosis along with at least two PSA tests
        within first year of diagnosis. Treatment indicator takes a value of one for
        surgery.


        An indicator of surgery is likely to be endogenous for three reasons: True
        severity of cancer is unobserved as we only have data on the cross-sectional
        characteristics of the tumor at diagnosis, but not how the tumor is growing or
        prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (used to detect prostate cancer) is rising.
        Higher severity may be positively correlated with surgery receipt and also
        negatively correlated with survival, but positively correlated with costs.12 These
        correlations render the na√Øve effects on surgery to be biased downward and that
        on costs to be biased upward. Second, general frailties of the patients are
        unobserved, which again would follow the same correlations as tumor
        severity.13 Third, psychological anxiety of being diagnosed with cancer would be
        positively correlated with both surgery receipt and costs and utilizations. Its
        correlation with survival remains to be ambiguous.

12
   Decreased survival within a fixed window of time is usually associated with higher costs due to expenditure
spikes at the end of life (Brown, 2002).
13
   Although one may expect that higher frailty would be negatively correlated with surgery, our first stage
regression shows that patients with more number of hospitalization and more comorbidities are more likely to get
surgery.
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                 21

   (c) Independent Risk Factors (XO): These include clinical stage and grade of cancer
      for patients at diagnosis using standard definitions (Meltzer et al. 2001),
      demographics, indicator for metropolitan area, Elixhauser comorbidity indices
      based on hospitalization in year preceding diagnosis, year and state fixed
      effects, zip-code level area characteristics on racial makeup, density and
      education levels. We also adjust for HRR-level characteristics using logged
      versions of population size, and per 100,000 patients‚Äô supply of hospital beds,
      physician, specialists and urologists.


   (d) Instrumental Variable (Z): We use HRR-specific rates of active surveillance in
      prostate cancer patients in the year prior to the diagnosis of a patient. Such an
      instrument has been used in the past in the context of prostate cancer (Hadley
      et al. 2010); however, concerns exist about the contamination in area-level
      variations that would violate the exclusion restriction for two reasons: first,
      such variations may be correlated with variations in case-mix of patients;
      second, contamination may exist due to productivity spillovers that make areas
      with more efficient deliveries of treatments correlated with higher rates of
      treatment (Chandra and Staiger, 2007) . We try to address both of these
      concerns and mitigate the effect of such contaminations on the IV. In order to
      address the first concern, we control for many concurrent area-level fixed
      effects and variations as mentioned above. Contamination due to productivity
      spillovers (Chandra and Staiger, 2007) are directly controlled by adjusting for
      the number of urologist per capita as the urologist are the main specialists
      delivering surgery for prostate cancer patients. We study the properties of our
      IV after controlling for these factors and believe that it meets the requirements
      for a valid and strong instrumental variable.




Methods


We study the strength of the IV in a logistic model for surgery along with all other
independent risk factors. To explore plausible contamination in the IV due patient
level characteristics, we run a separate logistic model for treatment with only the IV as
a regressor. We then compare the imbalance in the patient-level independent risk
factors across treatment categories with the imbalance in the same across the median
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                                       22

of the IV-only predicted propensity to choose surgery. A valid IV would necessarily
appear to reduce such imbalances. We explore these comparisons mainly for
individual level demographic and illness severity factors after converting them to their
respective z-scores.


Next, MTE‚Äôs and PeT effects are estimated using standard LIV methods described in
our estimation and simulation sections. For the binary survival outcome we use a
logistic regression. For the expenditure outcome, we use a semiparametric generalized
linear model with log link and Gamma variance. Various goodness-of-fit tests were
employed to ensure good model fit to these data. We study both the mean treatment
effect parameters and also the joint distribution of PeT effects across survival and
costs and the implications of such distributions for treatment choices.


Results & Discussions


Our final analytic sample consists of 13,495 patients, of whom 9,913 (73.5%) received
surgery. As evident from the first-stage regression results in Table 1, likelihood of
receiving surgery increases with ages younger and older than 74 years, T1 stage,
advancing grade, and increased number of hospitalization in previous year. The
instrumental variable was found to be strongly predictive of surgery receipt conditional
on other factors (F-stat: 10.9, p<0.0001).


Figure 2 illustrates that the IV may be particularly suitable in reducing residual
confounding in this application since it is able to reduce imbalance in observed factors
considerably.14 The identified support of the IV-based predicted propensity score (PS)
ranges from 0.07 to 0.995.


Polynomials of propensity scores were not found to be significant in either of the LIV
models. The final models for either outcomes contained covariates, interaction of
covariates with PS and PS.15 This indicates that essential heterogeneity is small for
these outcomes.16 This is presumably because we capture a very rich array of

15
   The models passed all goodness‚Äêof‚Äêfit tests. No systematic biases were detected from residual analyses.
16
   Note that since we use non‚Äêlinear models, absence of polynomial of PS does not mean absence of essential
heterogeneity in the additive scale, which is our scale of interest.
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                    23

observed factors and estimate significant treatment effect heterogeneity across those
factors. In essence, in this application PeT effects become similar to CATEs, where
conditioning is done on the entire vector of observed factors. The mean treatment
effect estimates are given in Table 4. The average treatment effect was estimated to be
-$30,056 and 7.4%pts for costs and survival respectively, which were not significant.
The average survival effects, although not significant, indicates the potential for
substantial benefits of surgery over AS in this population, which are in stark contrast
to the results from the largest and only randomized trial comparing these two
treatments that was conducted on patients diagnosed with PCa about a quarter
century ago (Holmberg et al 2002).


Figure 3 illustrates the joint distribution of PeT effects for 7-year survival and costs in
an incremental cost-effectiveness plane where the X-axis represents PeT effects on
survival and the Y-axis the PeT effects on costs. Each dot on the plane represents a
patient. The size of the treatment effect marker for each patient is driven by the z-
score of their respective treatment effect. Patients with more significant effects have
larger markers. The correlation between estimated PeT effects on costs and survival
was small: 0.03 (95% CI: -0.20, 0.25). Only 21% of patients were found to have
negative incremental survival from surgery. Surgery was found to be a dominant
treatment in 61% of patients (South-East quadrant of graph) as it incurs lower costs
and increased survival.


There is little evidence of positive self-selection in practice. This is not surprising given
that a majority of patients appear to benefit from surgery. Surgery rates were 74%
among patients for whom surgery produces negative effects versus 73% among those
who would benefit from surgery. This is reflected in the estimates for the effect on the
treated (TT) and the untreated (TUT) (Table 4). Both TT and TUT are identical to ATE
and neither reach statistical significant for costs or survival. The heterogeneity of
treatment effects illustrated in Figure 3, however, indicates that there may be much
room for improvement. In a hypothetical world of perfect selection (Meltzer et al. 2003),
where patients who would get hurt by surgery are removed from being eligible for
comparing these two modalities of treatment, the ATE and TT of surgery would climb
to 12.6%pt (95% CI: 2.5, 37.0) and 12.7%pt (95% CI: 1.5, 40.5) respectively for 7-year
survival (Table 4). These estimates can also be used to establish the value of more
targeted approach to treatment allocation. However, compared to the ATE and TT
estimates without selection, the ATE and TT estimates with perfect selection indicate
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                   24
PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION

only modest cost savings and better survival (Table 4), which do not reach statistical
significance.


Finally, PeT effects can be used to explore the dimensions (factors) along which
treatment selections are efficient (i.e. they conform to gains) and where they are
inefficient (i.e. they conform to losses). Compared to patients for whom survival effects
are significantly positive (at 10% level), patients with significant negative survival
effects with surgery had significantly higher rates of well grade cancer, higher number
of pre-period hospitalization and higher rates of every comorbidities listed in Table 3
except for peripheral vascular disease. Future work can use the estimated PeT effects
and its uncertainties to develop prediction algorithms for treatment effects.




4. CONCLUSIONS


This paper interprets a treatment effect parameter, originally defined by Heckman and
Vytlacil (1999), to represent Person-centered Treatment (PeT) effects. Heckman and
Vytlacil (1999) use this parameter to establish relationship between the mean
treatment effect parameters such as LATE, ATE, TT and TUT with the Marginal
Treatment Effect (MTE) parameter but do not use it further. A PeT effect is derived as
an alternate weighting of MTEs and is shown to represent individualized treatment
effects that not only conditions on the individual‚Äôs observed characteristics but also
averages over a conditional distribution of unobserved characteristics (in contrast to
their marginal distributions as in CATEs) that conditions on treatment choice made by
an individual and the circumstances under which that choice were made. The paper
presents the theory behind PeT and proposes semiparametric estimators to estimate
PeT effects using instrumental variables.


Finite sample simulations show that, in the present of essential heterogeneity
(Heckman 1997), the PeT effects may explain a significantly larger fraction of
individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity compared to CATEs. Therefore, in the
absence of data that can help identify the full joint distribution of potential outcomes,
PeT effects can serve as a valuable addition to the evaluation literature looking at the
distributional impacts of treatment access and policies. Moreover, they truly mimic
individual level treatment effects as they can be trivially aggregated across all patients,
Person‚Äêcentered Treatment (PeT) Effects                                                25

or across patients who did or did not choose treatment in order to construct estimates
of ATE, TT or TUT respectively.


The introduction of PeT effects and its role in identifying treatment effect heterogeneity
lines up well with the political economy of health care evaluations. Despite the age-old
practice of evaluating health care technologies using randomized trial and more
recently with observational data that were used to estimate average treatment effects
(and often local average effects), the Affordable Care Act of 2010 specifically ask for
producing estimates at a more nuanced and individualized level. It created a Patient
Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) as an independent, non-profit research
organization to conduct research to provide information about the best available
evidence to help patients and their health care providers make more informed
decisions. Its mission is to help people make informed health care decisions ‚Äì and
improves health care delivery and outcomes ‚Äì by producing and promoting high
integrity, evidence-based information ‚Äì that comes from research guided by patients,
caregivers and the broader health care community (PCORI Mission Statement, 2011).
PCORI is positioned to be one of the largest funders of outcomes research in the
United States in the coming years and has so far asserted that one of the primary
focus in patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) should be answering the question
for patients:   ‚ÄúGiven my personal characteristics, conditions and preferences, what
should I expect will happen to me?‚Äù.


While CATEs can provide answers to these questions, estimating CATEs directly based
on multiple observed covariates can be tricky. In contrast, PeT effects can serve as
outcomes that can be used to develop predictive algorithms for CATEs based on
combinations of patient and other observed characteristics in the data. Such an
approach would be most valuable for allocating Category II and III treatments, as
defined by Chandra and Skinner (2011), since uncertainties in their comparative
effectiveness either precludes them from access in some settings or facilitates rapid
adoption that leads to welfare loss. Furthermore, since PeT effects allow for estimating
more nuanced individual treatment effects, understanding the difference in variance
between PeT effects and CATEs can help establish the value of future research that
can identify factors relevant for treatment effect heterogeneity that are not collected in
the current databases (Basu and Meltzer 2007).

In summary, PeT effects can serve as a useful treatment concept for a variety of
evaluations both at the policy and at the individual level.
