     ENERGY TAX CREDITS AND RESIDENTIAL CONSERVATION INVESTMENT



                                          ABSTRACT


       We model the decision to invest in residential energy conservation capital as an

irreversible investment in the face of price uncertainty. The irreversible nature of this

investment means that there is a value to waiting to invest (an option value) which helps

explain the low rate of conservation investment as a result of the residential energy tax credit.

Simulations suggest that a tax credit of the type implemented from 1978 through 1985 will

not increase conservation investment significantly.

       We investigate the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of credits using data from a

panel data set of roughly 38,000 individual tax returns followed over a three year period from

1979-1981. Unlike previous work, we find that the energy tax credit is statistically significant

in explaining the probability of investing. Our estimates suggest that increasing the federal

credit by 10 percentage points would increase the percentage of households claiming the

credit from 5.7% to 7.1%.

                           L. Introduction
     There is an extensive literature which documents that a
significant number of energy conservation investments, which by
any reasonable measure have a very high rate of return, are net
undertaken (see, for example, Williams and Ross (1980) and
Carlsmith et al (1990)). This literature in the past has argued

that a variety of market barriers, e.g. fuel price distortions,
lack of information, etc., discourage these investments1.
     While many of these market barriers may exist, we believe
that an important explanation for this low rate of investment is

the uncertainty over the path of future energy prices.       Key to
this explanation is the recognition of the irreversible nature of

many home energy improvements which frequently involve structural
alteration of one's residence.       This paper develops a model of
home energy investment which formally incorporates this feature.2

We then apply this model to evaluate the effectiveness of an
energy tax credit for conservation investment along the lines of

the Residential Energy Tax Credit which was in effect from 1978

through 1985.       We first develop a set of energy price and
investment simulations based on the model to investigate how


1 Sutherland (1991) summarizes and raises objections to many of
the common market failures that are proposed to explain the
"energy paradox".
    In a recent paper, Jaf fee and Stavins (1991) attempt to
incorporate many of the market barrier features described above
into an economic model.   They focus on the relative merits of
price based controls versus regulation to increase conservation
investment and do not consider irreversibility and price
uncertainty in their model.

                                 1
uncertainty over future prices affects the decision to invest in

conservation capital.      We also consider how different tax
policies might affect the rate of investment. We calibrate these

simulations to aggregate data under a variety of assumptions
about the nature of stochastic prices facing investors. The
simulation results based upon the moments of the relevant price

processes replicate      the   pattern of    residential   energy
conservation investment observed in the United States during the

late 1970s and early l980s and suggest that it is unnecessary to
appeal to myriad ad hoc market failures in order to explain the

"energy paradox". Irreversibility and uncertainty alone can
explain the observed adoption rates quite well, and we view both
to be reasonable features of a model of residential conservation

investment. In order to evaluate our approach more thoroughly,
we then analyze a large data set on individual federal tax
returns in the United States over the three year period 1979-
1981.      This data set has extensive information on energy
conservation investment made by individuals which, combined with
state level energy and weather data, allows us to investigate the

impact of conservation incentive programs on individuals'
investment decisions. Unlike previous authors, we find, as the

theory would suggest, statistically significant tax credit
effects on residential conservation investment; the size of these

effects is consistent with the predictions of the model.

        In the next section we present our model of conservation
investment in the presence of price uncertainty. We then provide

                                 2
simulation results which explore both the speed of technology
diffusion and the size of tax credit effects in our model. Some
background on conservation investment incentives at the federal

and state level precedes our empirical work.           We close with a
brief conclusion.

        .L A Model      Irreversible           Energy Improvement

       In this section, we sketch out a simple model of the
decision to invest in conservation measures to reduce energy

consumption.3    Key to our analysis is the assumption that the
investment in energy conservation capital is irreversible.
Typical conservation investments include ceiling and wall
insulation, storn doors and windows and caulking; the salvage
value of any of these investments is likely to be very low.
Because of this, as is well known in the literature on
irreversible decisions, there is an option value associated with

n investing which contributes to a slowdown in the rate of
investment.

       Assume that the price of energy (P) varies across
individuals and time according to a geometric Brownian motion

process:

(1)                  dP1 =   uPdt       +   oPtdz
where z, is a standardized Brownian motion (Wiener) process whose
change dz has mean zero and unit variance. The change in P
over time t has mean &t and variance ot. Similarly, we assume


      This model could also be used to analyze renewable energy
investment.

                                    3
that the price of conservation capital (K1t) varies over time and

(perhaps) individuals according to a geometric Brownian motion

process:

(2)                    dK1    kXltdt +
where z is a Wiener process with dzk having mean zero and unit
variance. The correlation between z, and z is denoted by p.
       The lifetime cost of energy use for a risk neutral household

is composed of three parts.               The first part is the stream of
energy costs prior to undertaking an energy conservation
investment.       The second part is the stream of costs after the
conservation investment is made. The third part is the cost of
the investment itself. We assume that the household chooses an
optimal strategy at time zero to determine when to make the
conservation investment to minimize the expected value of the
present discounted value of lifetime energy costs (including the

conservation capital costs)

(3) E{ }      pit           dt +    f(1—i     )it et dt + Kj1 eflT

In equation (3),        is the discount rate for the it2        individual,
      is the savings in energy costs due to the conservation
investment expressed as a fraction of energy costs and T, the
time at which investment occurs (which could be infinite).

       Equation (3) can be rewritten so that the problem becomes

one of maximizing expected energy savings:

(4) E {       $    S    e          dt —   x11 ehiT   +:   Pmtett dt }
Formulated    in   this fashion, the problem now is clearly one of

                                          4
choosing an optimal sequential decision rule which selects the
time to make an irreversible investment which has a revenue
stream of jP per period at investment cost Kit. As we show in
the appendix, the optimal time to invest in the energy
conservation capital occurs when:
                                       b
(5)                          IPIT > —      (—,)K,
where


                   .5 — +J(.S 02—a)2 + 2(TtlLK) Q•
(6)          b=
                                            0

In equation (6), QQ2      is the variance and   is the drift of the
hybrid geometric Brownian motion process Pit/Kit           (see the
appendix for details). The term b will be greater than one if a
+       < v, that is, if the trend in the geometric Brownian motion

process of Pit/Kit (adjusted for the trend in capital costs) is
less than the individual's disOount rate. This condition is
essentially the condition that it be optimal for the individual
to make an investment in the energy capital in finite time.

        As        approaches zero, the term b/(b—l) approaches one,
and the investment rule in equation (5) collapses to the


                                                     )
Marshallian investment criterion that one should invest if the
present discounted value of the savings, P/( —           exceeds the
cost of investment K.         With stochastic prices, however, the
investment rule is scaled up by the factor b/(b-1) > 1.        Thus,
individuals might choose not to invest even though the return
substantially exceeds their cost of funds, something consistent

                                   5
with the survey data showing "low" responsiveness, because the

gain to waiting, summarized by b/(b—l), is high.          Moreover,

studies (e.g.     Hausinan (1982)) which ignore the impact of
irreversibility on the decision by a homeowner to purchase
appliances would necessarily significantly overstate the discount

rate used by consumers.

     Having     established    that   uncertainty   combined   with

irreversibility can reduce the amount of investment made in
conservation capital, we next turn to stochastic simulations of
our model, in order to explore more fully the impact of
irreversibility on the diffusion of new technologies.      We also
analyze the impact of tax policy on the diffusion process in this

setting.
                 Simulations      the g Investment
     There has been a substantial literature analyzing the
diffusion of technology dating back to Griliches (1957).          A

stylized fact emerging from this literature is that the adoption

of new technologies occurs subject to an S—shaped curve4. What
is striking about the energy conservation experience in the 1970s

is the very slow rate of diffusion of new technologies. This has
led to considerable speculation that information about new
technologies has not spread sufficiently rapidly or that capital
market failures might deter investment.



4 See Jovanovic and Lach (1989) for a review of the literature
on diffusion as well as a theory based on learning by doing.
     One need not appeal to market imperfections, however, to

generate extremely slow diffusion processes.                  Consider the
following example.       Assume that individuals have identical
preferences.   If       were the same for everyone, then we would
observe no investment until equation (5) were satisfied at which
point everyone would invest.            However, even with identical
preferences, there will be a distribution of ex ante expected
improvements ()     .    Put   differently, the housing stock is
heterogeneous and there exists considerable variation in the
gains from particular energy improvements. Hence as P/K rises,
people who will reap large savings from a particular energy
conservation investment will invest first while people with lower

expected gains wait for P/K to rise further5. To illustrate the
diffusion pattern which emerges from our model, we                 present
simulation results from a model where the energy savings
parameter, ,   is   normally distributed with mean 0.2 and standard
deviation .1, values chosen to correspond roughly to existing
engineering estimates of the return to these investments.

     For the purposes of simulations, we estimated the trend and

variance of the price process P/K using data on energy prices and
capital over the period 1955 through 1981, the last year of data


   This is an example of the "probit" type diffusion model (viz.
Stoneman (1983)). We note, however, that this argument is much
more   powerful   when    combined   with   an.  assumption    of
irreversibility, which provides       an S—Shaped adoption curve
and the potential for extremely slow adoption rates.     We also
prefer our formulation because the diffusion comes about because
of a heterogeneous housing stock, not because of ad-hoc
assumptions of preference heterogeneity.
used in the empirical work described below. The household fuel
oil price index was used as a measure of P while the durable
comitiodities price index was used as a measure of K.    Data were

taken from the Economic Report         President.    Assuming that
P/K follows geometric Brownian motion, we obtain estimates of a

equal to .046 and and o equal to .093.     In order to help gauge

the effect of the irreversibility assumption we also provide
simulations assuming there is no uncertainty, which drives the

option value to zero. Figure 1 presents the price process and
Figure 2 the rate of cumulative investment over a 20 year horizon

when o = 0.   The hurdle rule is the traditional Marshallian one.

figure 2 shows that investment rises dramatically with 40% of
households making conservation improvements within 5 years and
99% by 20 years.
     Contrast this result with the cumulative investment in the
case where o = .093.      Figure 3 shows the price process and
figure 4 the rate of investment. The price process is started at
the same value (Pa) as in the certainty case (figure 1). With a
real discount rate of .05, b equals 1.31 and b/(b—l) equals 4.23.
With these assumptions, the rate of investment is remarkably
slow, with many intervening years of no investment at all.
Cumulative investment after 20 years is less than 5%. Note that
the price both increases and decreases over the 20 year period.
Thus there are periods of rapid investment followed by periods of
no investment which can last as long as six years.

     Figure 5 shows the results of a set of 500 replications of

                                 8
the price process and cumulative investment under uncertainty.
The trend and variance of the price process is the same in the
replications, matching the moments used for figure 3. The figure
shows that the dispersion in investment increases with time as
would be expected given that the price process follows geometric
Brownian motion.        At the end of the 10th year, the mean
cumulative investment is 7.5% with a standard deviation of 4.7%.

Minimum investment is 2.5% and the maximum is 31%. As figure 5
shows, cases with cuu1ative investment after 10 years as large
as 15% are quite rare.      Hence we do not attribute our results
showing low investment under price uncertainty to the particular
price process that we generated in figure 3.
     Figures 6 and 7 show the effect of instituting a 15% tax
credit on the purchase of the conservation capital at time t—l.
For the certainty case (figure6), the stimulation to investment
is dramatic.   Investment increases from about 27% to 43% as a
direct result of the credit.      Investment after 5 years is now
about 60% versus 40% without the credit.        However, with the
geometric Brownian motion assumption, the credit is much less
effective (figure 7).     Investment increases by .2 % as a direct
result of the credit and by less than 3% after 20 years6.

     Of course, with the investment trigger increased by a factor
of 4, these results are perhaps not surprising. But note that if



6 This result is general. In a series of 1000 replications, the
mean increase in investment is .2% at t=l with a standard
deviation of .11%. The maximum increase is .57%.

                                 9
individuals weighted recent energy price data more heavily when

they make subjective estimates of , oo,               and b, the adjustment
factor would be even larger. Using data from 1960 through 1981

gives estimates of b/(b—l) of 7.65.
      The simulation results show in a striking way that
uncertainty can sharply reduce investment in conservation
capital. Moreover, a tax credit can have a significant effect on

increasing investment —       to   the order of doubling the probability

of investing in conservation capital. However, in the presence
of price uncertainty, the probability of investing is so low that

doubling the investment probability has negligible effects on
total conservation investment. In the next section, we turn to a
closer examination of the state and federal tax incentives that
existed in the late 70s and early 80s which will provide the
basis for an empirical examination of the actual response of
residential conservation investment to tax incentive programs.

            IV. Tax Policy Toward Conservation Investment

      Tax incentives to stimulate conservation investment existed
during the l970s-l980s at both the federal and state level.                   As

most state programs "piggy backed" on the federal system, we
discuss the latter program in greater detail. We also discuss
how previous researchers have tried to measure the effectiveness
of the tax incentives at stimulating investment.

      The Energy Tax Act of 1978 (ETA78) provided homeowners with
tax credits to encourage conservation investment activities such
as insulating walls and ceilings, replacing furnace burners and

                                       10
ignition systems, storm or thermal windows and doors, installing

clock thermostats, and weatherstripping.       These investments
received a credit of 15%, with a credit ceiling set at $300 and
could only be taken on houses that were constructed prior to
1977.
     In addition to the federal credit, nine states offered a
conservation incentive (either a deduction or a credit) over the

period 1979 through 1985 when the federal credit expired.8 These

state programs will be important in the econometric work below as

they provide variation in the tax price of conservation
investment which allows us to identify the importance of the
programs in stimulating investment.
     Given the broad coverage and low cost of some highly
productive improvements, one might think that the credits would
be universally claimed.    Surprisingly, this is not the case.
Table 1 presents information from the Statistics    Income on the

fraction of returns which claimed the credit for either
conservation or renewable energy activities. The credit is most


   ETA78 also encouraged investment in solar, wind and geothermal
energy equipment used to heat, cool, and supply hot water or
electricity to the principle residence.    These investments
received a higher credit, with 30% of the first $2000 and 20% of
the next $10,000 qualifying for the credit, with a maximum credit
of $2600.   ETA78 was amended by the Crude Oil Windfall Profits
Tax Act of 1980, which increased the tax credits available for
renewable systems to 40% of up to $10,000 in expenditure.     The
credit for these investments was available to all principle
residences regardless of when built.
8   Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, and Oregon
offered credits of some form while Arkansas, Idaho, and Indiana
offered deductions.    Information on these programs comes from
Walsh (1987) and tax forms.

                                11
heavily taken in 1978 where 6.5%. of the returns claimed a
credit.       Note that the energy tax credit was retroactively
applied beginning April 20, 1977. Credits for investments made
in 1977 could be taken in 1978; hence the data for 1978 cover
roughly 20 months.     The fraction of returns filing the credit
drops from 6.5% in 1978 to roughly 3% by 1985, the last year in
which the credit could be taken.

     One might think that conservation credits might be
fraudulently claimed, or that, unaware of the possibility of
taking them, taxpayers may fail to claim a credit they ought to.
Fortunately, the TCMP audit data allow us to analyze the extent
to which mistakes or frauds occur. The 1986 TCMP data indicate
that of the 560 million dollars of tax credits claimed in 1985,
531 million were legitimate, and an additional 28 million
allowable claims which were not originally reported were
discovered.     These numbers are typical of those for most items
covered by the audit, and indicate that fraud or mistakes will
not be an important source of measurement error in the empirical
work we present below .
     In   Table 2, we report the distribution of returns for 1979

by income and the fraction of credit takers in each group along
with the fraction homeowners.           The probability of taking the
credit rises with income and reaches a peak of 15.67% for returns

in the $50,000 to $100,000 group.         For the group with AGI less

                                   12
than $10,000, the fraction of takers is 1.21%, roughly a third of

the fraction of takers in the next income group.
    Table 3 reports the fraction of credit takers and mean
conservation expenditures by state for 1979 along with the
average credit for those who took the credit in each state. The
geographic distribution of the propensity to take the federal
credit for the most part is not surprising.        However, certain
states stand out, California most prominently.            With the
exception of Hawaii, California had the lowest fraction of credit

takers of all the states.       California's state conservation

incentive program is unique in offering a very generous credit
for conservation activity (40% of costs). However, the credit is
net of the federal credit.    For most households, it is simply
easier to claim the entire 40% on the state return than claim 15%
on the federal return and the remaining 25% on the state return.

Thus the low participation rate in the federal program for
California reflects a measurement problem, a problem we address
in the estimation strategy below.

    Results of previous research on the effectiveness of energy
tax incentive programs have been relatively inconclusive. This
literature consists of a small series of survey studies, (Pitts
and Wittenbach (1981), Carpenter and Chester (1984), Peterson
(1985)) and three econometric analyses (Cameron (1985), Walsh
(1987),(l989) and Dubin and Henson (1988)). The survey studies
indicate that the tax credits are important motivators for
purchases of renewable energy improvements,          but not for

                                13
conservation.

     Cameron does not directly estimate the additional investment

resulting from federal and state incentive programs but rather
estimates the price elasticity of investment for energy
conservation and renewable investment. Using cross section data

from the National Interim Energy Consumption Survey of 1977—78,
she constructs and estimates a nested logit model over many
improvement alternatives and finds significant price sensitivity,
suggesting that credits might provide an important stimulus.
     One problem with the approach used by Cameron is that it is
assumed that changes in price due to the implementation of tax
credits will have the same effect as direct changes in investment
costs.      This will be true in a world in which the transaction
costs of taking the credit are minimal and in which information
about the tax incentives are widely dispersed.      Moreover, one
must have a positive tax liability to benefit from the credit.
In the absence of these conditions, the tax credit changes in
price may induce less investment than an equivalent direct change

in price.

     Walsh (1987,1989), using Department of Energy data and state
level variation       in tax credits, attempts to test directly
whether the tax incentives at the federal or state level induce
additional conservation investment.     He found that the states
which had high energy tax credits experienced very low
conservation investment activity. In a cross section regression,
he finds a significant negative effect of tax credits on

                                 14
investment.

     Dubin and Henson, used a cross section of IRS audits for
1979 and related energy conservation activity to state level
temperature data and individual characteristics.10     They found
that investment increases with income and that it responds to

measures, such as "heating degree days", which help predict its
return.   While the coefficient on a dummy variable for the
existence of a state credit for conservation is positive in a
regression with federal tax credit claimed as the dependent
variable, it is statistically insignificant with a t statistic of

roughly .3.

     Thus, the only evidence relating the tax incentives to
investment activity suggests that they have been ineffective,
although investment does respond to other variables that enhance
its profitability. We believe that there are two major reasons
why these studies have been unable to find a statistically and
economically significant relationship between the tax incentive
programs and investment.   First there are individual and state
specific effects which are likely to be correlated with the
explanatory variables.     State specific effects include the
measurement error noted for California as a result of the nature
of the state incentive program.     Individual specific effects
include individual propensities to      invest in conservation

returns from a TCNP cross tabulation.          This limits the
effectiveness of individual variables. Our data is also IRS data
but consists of individual returns.

equipment. These might include conservation "taste" factors as

well as attributes of the housing stock that individuals choose.

Second, many of the state tax incentive programs are deduction
programs. A dollar of deduction reduces taxable income by 1 and
tax liability by m where m is the marginal tax rate. Therefore,
the tax price of one dollar's worth of investment is 1—rn.
Measuring the tax price accurately for residents of states with
deduction incentives is important. We use the NBER TAXSIM state
tax calculator to measure the tax price at the individual level.
In the next section, we describe our data set and present results

from a set of regressions where we measure the responsiveness of
residential conservation investment to changes in state tax
incentives.                                                        -



                        V. Empirical
     As the last two simulations in section III suggest, an
important question is whether tax policy can substantially affect

the decision to invest in conservation capital.      We test the
effectiveness of tax incentives directly by estimating the effect

of state tax incentive programs on the decision to invest in a
discrete choice framework.       To do this, we exploit the
information filed on federal returns by tax payers claiming the
federal residential energy conservation tax credit along with
variations in state level tax incentives.

     The regression estimates are from a reduced farm model in
which the dependent variable (' is a binary variable
indicating whether the tax payer has an expenditure for

                                16
conservation investment.        We relate this to a vector of
explanatory variables which theory suggests should help determine
the payoffs to investing. As discussed previously, it is also
important to account for individual heterogeneity or fixed
effects11. Assuming the probability of making the investment has

the extreme value distribution, then
                                   eai+1t
(9)                     P(I1=l) = ____________

Following   the suggestion of Chamberlain (1980), we condition the

likelihood function on making an expenditure at least once. This



Z   I
latter probability will equal the sum of the probabilities that
        equals 1, 2, and so on. To see how this solves the problem

of heterogeneity, consider the probability that I =        1   in a

two period model where P(l,0) is defined as the joint probability

of taking the credit in the first year and not taking it in the

second year. P(0,l) is similarly defined.



(10)                  P(I1=1) = P(1,0)+P(01)


Consider the probability that we observe P(0,1) conditional on
the sum being equal to 1:


11 The likely direction of the fixed effects bias may well explain
previous estimates which found the wrong sign on the tax credit
variable. If a state is populated by citizens who have a higher
than average probability of investing because of unobservables,
it may be that that state has a low probability of introducing a
credit program. This type of interaction is consistent with the
evidence provided below.

               eii1 + emi+j2                               ei2
In the last step we can factor out e and we are left with a
contribution to the likelihood function which does not include


       Since we have T>2 the problem becomes significantly more

complex.          Note,         for      example,    the     P(E 1tt=1)     =

P(I=O)P(I=O)       P(I=l) + P(I=O)P(I=O)...P(I=1)P(I=O)            +...

The contribution to the likelihood of the individual who takes a
credit in period K will be:
                            T

(12)             P(O,O,O,...,l,O,O)/P(E il)

Clearly this is quite a complicated expression, although the
likelihood     function    is         still globally concave       and    its
maximization is straightforward.

If we want to allow for E        I>l then we have to consider all the
possible ways each of the sums could be obtained, but the fixed
effect will still disappear. The number of possibilities will be




                                        18
        with K successes in T trials, for each k.

        Unlike a fixed effects regression model with a continuous
dependent variable, we cannot "back out" estimates of the fixed
effects and forecast the dependent variable. Thus we are unable
to answer the question "How does increasing x change the
probability of making a conservation investment?".              However,
Chamberlain (1989) shows that


(13)               ln
                        P(lIx=x")
                                    /
                                        P(lIx=x')   = (x   —x
                        P(OIx=x )       P(OIx=x


which is of interest, and doesn't depend on a because the odds
format makes the a's cancel. Thus we can answer the question,
"By what proportion will the probability of an agent taking the
action increase?".

        We utilize data from tax returns for households followed
over the 3 year period from 1979 through 1981. The tax data are
drawn from the Ernst and Young! University of Michigan Tax
Research Database which consists of a simple random sample of
returns drawn by Social Security Number for the tax years 1979
through 198612. The number of returns each year varies from 9235
to 46,67013. From these returns we are able to construct a three


12 We have also experimented with using the full seven year panel
(1979-1985 - there is no energy investment information on the
1986 returns).    The number of returns falls to roughly 6,000
which limits significantly the number of credit takers.
13   Column 5 of Table 1 provides information on the sampling
frequency while column 2 shows how many returns were filed that

year panel which follows 37,658 individuals. We have information
on each individual's state of residence, income,        number of

dependents, and home mortgage and property taxes (from which we

can infer home ownership status). There is also     information on

whether they filed an energy tax credit form, how large a credit

they received and their expenditures on the conservation portion.

In addition, there is detailed information on expenditures by
sub—categories (e.g. storm windows, insulation) .     Finally,   as

noted above, we can compute a measure of the tax price for
conservation investment using TAXSIM.
      We merged tax data with data on energy prices from the
Department of Energy State Energy Price and Expenditure Data

System (SEPEDS).      This data set has detailed price and
expenditure information by state and year on the residential
sector for various energy sources.      In the regression results

reported below, we use the price for petroleum14. We divide this
price by a price index for insulation to obtain our measure of
P
—       Note   that the index varies across states but not
Kit
individuals within the state. Sample statistics for the data set

are provided in table 4.

      Sefore turning to the reduced form logit results, there are

several modifications of the estimating equation that we make.

First we note that the theory suggests that the probability of


14 We have also experimented with using alternative price series.
Results are not in any way significantly altered by which set of
prices we use.
                                20
investing depends on the price ratio net of the state tax
incentive.      Let U be the tax price of investment.             For those
states which offer a credit, U equals 1 —          c,   where c is the state

credit.      For states which offer a deduction, U equals            1 —

where t is the individual's marginal tax rate.                Then we could
                          p
redefine the price as —        .     Since the federal tax credit is in
                         nl<

effect the entire time of our analysis, we may ignore that
credit. The alternative approach and the one that we prefer is
to include U separately in the regression. We do this to account

for the possibility that the existence of the state level tax
incentive itself may have some positive effect on investment.
Alternatively, the incentive may not be fully understood or may
require complicated record keeping. In the former case, ws would
expect a strong effect of U on the probability of investing,
whereas in the latter case we'd expect a weak effect. We use the

NBER TAXSIM State Tax Calculator to compute t for individuals in
states with tax deductions.15

     Our model allows for differences in                across individuals.
We include two variables -         heating   degree days and homeownership
status -   to   control for some of the determinants of .            Energy
savings may be greater for individuals in colder states leading
to a positive correlation between heating degree days and the



     We also zero out the federal deduction for the residential
energy tax credit when computing r with TAXSIN.    This ensures
that there is no endogeneity between the computed tax rate and
the error term in the logit regression.

                                      21
probability of investing in conservation capital.16 We include a

homeownershiP variable since complete capitalization assures that
homeowners will appropriEIte the entire future stream of energy

savings whether they stay in the house or not.               Even if
capitalization is incomplete, they will receive more of the
savings than renters who receive none of the savings once they
inove.7 Thus we argue that homeowners should be more likely to

invest than renters.

     A third factor which we account for in the regression is the

observation that previous studies find an inverse relationship
between income and the estimated discount rate (e.g. Hausmari
(1979)) .   This   could occur because of incomplete capital markets

for example.       We include adjusted gross income (AGI) in the
regression with the expectation that it will have a positive
effect on the probability of investment.

     We also include a dummy variable for California in the
regression. As noted above, California offers a generous credit
for conservation activity (40% of costs net of the federal
credit) .   This   fact indicates that California residents should be

less likely to claim the federal credit. In addition, we include

year dummies to control for business cycle effects -        important
given the recessions of 1980 and 1981.


16 Data on heading degree days by state and year are from the
U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
17    Moreover, if demand for rental housing is sufficiently
inelastic, then renters may receive little gain while renting as
the landlord may simply raise rents on the now more energy
efficient rental unit.

                                   22
     Finally, we exclude observations on individuals with AGI
less than $10,000 in the regressions. Many individuals in this
group are not "life cycle" low income people but rather
"transitory" low income     due to large business losses.     It is
difficult to measure their tax price accurately; moreover, this
group may be most likely to take advantage of carry forward
provisions in the federal tax code which confounds our
measurement of the appropriate tax price driving their
investment.

     Our first regression result is for the pooled sample, and is

reported in Table 5.        The dependent variable is the dummy
variable indicating the presence of a credit for conservation
expenditures. We first discuss the non—price variables as their
effect is relatively stable across regressions. The probability
of investing goes up with income. Homeowners are more likely to
take a credit as are residents of states with colder climates

(more heating degree days).           Each of these variables is
statistically significant with p-values less than .01.          The

coefficient on the dummy variable for California is consistently

negative though not always statistically significant.         These

results are consistent with results in earlier studies (e.g.
Dubin and Henson (1988) and Walsh (1989)).
     Turning to the price and the tax price variables, we note
that both     have the wrong sign in the levels regression.     One
reason that the price variables may not be explaining investment
very well is the presence of correlated individual effects in the

                                 23
error term.    The conditional logit fixed effects regression
allows us to estimate the price effects consistently in the
presence of correlated fixed effects.     We now turn to these
estinates. The price variable continues to have the wrong sign
but is now not significantly different from zero at the 5% level.
However, the tax price variable now has the correct sign and is
significant at the 5% level with a coefficient estimate of —2.39.

A decline in the tax price leads to an increase in the
probability of investment.     Below we discuss how one should
interpret the economic importance of this coefficient estimate.

     The last two regressions test for the robustness of the tax
price coefficient estimate.     We begin by dropping the year
dutiies to ensure that important tax price information is not
being "soaked" up in the time effects. We note the statistical
importance of the time dummies as well as their economic
importance; business cycle effects are controlled for by these
variables.    There is no appreciable change in the tax price
coefficient estimates and it appears that the year effects are
now being captured by the price variable which now becomes highly

significant (p value less than .01).
     The last column tests for the possibility that the tax price
effect is a spurious result.    One explanation for the negative
relationship between the tax price and the probability of
investment is that people anticipate the beginning of a new
program and delay investment until the program goes into effect.
While the net change in investment would be zero with the

                                24
implementation of a program, the estimated coefficient on the tax

price variable would be negative. To test for this possibility,
we constructed a dummy variable equaling one if a state had a
program in effect the following year and zero otherwise.        If

investment shifting were occurring, we should anticipate a
negative coefficient on this variable.       The last regression
includes this variable.   The estimated coefficient on the lead
tax variable is positive with a t statistic about 1 indicating
that tax timing is not driving our result.

     How do we interpret the coefficient estimate on the tax
price variable? Based on the coefficient estimate of -2.39 and a
probability of investing equal to the mean of the data set
(.057), a 10% point decrease in the tax price leads to a 25%
increase in the probability of investing (.071).      However, the
point made in the simulation section still stands: Tax credits in
the face of uncertain price may contribute to a large change in
the log odds of the probability of investing. However this does
not lead to a substantial increase in the probability itself,
given the small amount of investment to begin with.

     We conclude from these regression results that state tax
incentives have an effect on the probability of investment which

is statistically significant. However the economic importance of
the programs is slight - a result consistent with the simulations

based on the model of irreversible investment with price
uncertainty.
     Both the simulation results and the empirical estimates cast

                                25
doubt on the effectiveness of energy tax credits in stimulating

energy conservation investment in the presence of substantial
energy price uncertainty. In addition, the coefficient estimates
on the income and home ownership variables suggest that the
benefits of the credit accrue most to higher income individuals.

                           VI. Conclusion

     In this paper, we've argued that residential energy
conservation investment should be treated as a form of
irreversible investment in the face of stochastic prices. Doing
so leads to a natural explanation of the low energy conservation

investment that occurred in the 1970s and l980s in response to
the residential energy conservation tax credit.         Simulation

results show that price uncertainty of the magnitude observed
during the 70s and 80$ can drive conservation investment down to
levels approaching zero. A tax credit of the size given by the
federal residential energy tax credit will increase investment by

very small amounts over a ten to twenty year horizon.

     We then consider a data set on roughly 38,000 individuals
followed over a three year period and find that the conservation

incentive programs offered by state governments in addition to
the federal program have a statistically significant effect on
investment once we control for individual (fixed) effects. Based
on our preferred estimate of the tax price coefficient, a 10
percentage point change in the tax price for energy investment
would lead to a 24% increase in the probability of energy
conservation investment.      Bowever, given the low level of

                                26
investment due to price uncertainty, the actual change in
investment is quite low - on the order of a 1.5% increase in the

probability of investment.    These results suggest that a tax
credit is not an effective tool for promoting conservation
investment.    Put differently, the expiration of Residential
Energy Tax Credit in 1985 had very little effect on the overall

energy improvement adoption rate.   If the rate of conservation
investment is suboptimal from the societal perspective, then the

challenge to policy makers now is to construct a more effective
policy instrument to encourage conservation in the face of energy

price uncertainty.

                   Optimal Investment       Prices
                   Follow Geometric Brpwnipn Motion
        We solve the problem of choosing the optimal investment time

to maximize energy savings when the price of energy and capital
investment follow geometric Brownian motions.                   First, we note
that we can apply Ito's Lemma to determine the stochastic motion
of the ratio P/K. Letting F(P,K) = P/K,

(Al)              dF=FdP + FdK     +   .5(F   (dp)2 +

                                              +

where F refers to the partial derivative of F with respect to i.

substituting in the expressions for dP and dK (noting that
dz1dz=dt if i=j and pdt otherwise), we obtain the result that
(A2)              dF =   (A-M+o2   -
                                       poo)   (P/K)dt +

                                            a(P/K)dz—o(P/k)dz.
F = P/K follows a geometric Brownian motion process with trend

(o) equals (p_k+o - P0P0k)             and variance (o) equal to (o+a
- 2poo').
        Once the investment is made, the value of the investment

(conditional on energy price P), V, will equal P/(7—1) — K.
The investment is only made if P/K exceeds a trigger level h*.
                            *
At values of P/K below h , the only value of the energy
investment is in its option value, V(P,K) ,             that   is

To     determine the functional form of V1 we can construct the

                                       28
Bellman equation for the dynamic optimization problem described

in equation (5).               Alternatively, an arbitrage argument requires
that:

(A4)                                     iVdt=E(dV)
Homogeneity of degree 1 in prices allows us to rewrite the value
equation in terms of P/K and K. That is

(A5)                                     V(P,K) =    Kv(P/K).
           If we rewrite V as a function of x              P/K, we can apply Ito's

Lemma to dV and obtain

(AG)                             dV =   Kv'dx   + .5Kv"(dx)2 + vdK

Substituting in (A4) above, taking expectations, dividing by dt
and letting dt go to zero gives us the differential equation

where a is the drift for dx/x and o the variance of the

a solution exists for values of b which satisfy

If Q(1)        a —   (i   —       is    also negative, the second root (b2) is

greater than 1.               Therefore, a general solution to the

(A9)                            v = A1xbl + A2xb2
However, we can determine that A1 equals zero by the following

argument.        Since x follows a geometric Brownian motion, if it

must equal 0 as the option to invest is now worthless. However,

since b1 C 0, the first term in (A9) will be infinite unless A1

equals zero. Hence

(AlO)                      v = Axbl   b >    1

We can use the smooth pasting and value matching conditions to
solve for h*.   Value matching requires that the two expressions

for V in (A3) equate at h* and smooth pasting requires that they
meet smoothly at h* (see Dixit (1991)).            Incorporating these
conditions yields the value of
