Democracy by mistake
Daniel Treisman
NBER Working Paper No. 23944
October 2017
JEL No. K00,N20,P16

                                         ABSTRACT

How does democracy emerge from authoritarian rule? Influential theories contend that
incumbents deliberately choose to share or surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution,
motivate citizens to fight wars, incentivize governments to provide public goods, outbid elite
rivals, or limit factional violence. Examining the history of all democratizations since 1800, I
show that such deliberate choice arguments may help explain up to one third of cases. In about
two thirds, democratization occurred not because incumbent elites chose it but because, in trying
to prevent it, they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Common mistakes include:
calling elections or starting military conflicts, only to lose them; ignoring popular unrest and
being overthrown; initiating limited reforms that get out of hand; and selecting a covert democrat
as leader. These mistakes reflect well-known cognitive biases such as overconfidence and the
illusion of control.
