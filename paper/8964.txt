                                             ABSTRACT

        Nearly 60 percent of college students today are women. Using longitudinal data on a nationally
representative cohort of eighth grade students in 1988, I examine two potential explanations for the
differential attendance rates of men and women -- returns to schooling and non-cognitive skills. The
attendance gap is roughly five percentage points for all high school graduates. Conditional on
attendance, however, there are few differences in type of college, enrollment status or selectivity of
institution. The majority of the attendance gap can be explained by differences in the characteristics of
men and women, despite some gender differences in the determinants of college attendance. I find that
higher non-cognitive skills and college premiums among women account for nearly 90 percent of the
gender gap in higher education. Interestingly, non-cognitive factors continue to influence college
enrollment after controlling for high school achievement.

1. Introduction

         Today nearly 60 percent of college students are women (Bae, Choy, Geddes, Sable &

Synder 2000). Among low-income and minority students, young women are 25 percent more

likely than young men to enroll in some form of postsecondary education.1 While the enrollment

gap differential was first evident in the late seventies, it has recently begun to attract attention

from a broad spectrum of individuals including high school guidance counselors, college

admissions officers, and policymakers (Koerner 1999; Mortenson 1999; Sommers 2000). Given

that changes in the U.S. economy over the past two decades have significantly increased the

return to college and cognitive ability (Katz & Murphy 1992; Levy & Murnane 1992; Murnane,

Willet & Levy 1995), the relative decline in college enrollment among young men warrants

investigation.2

         While there has been an increasing recognition of this gap, there are no empirical studies

that specifically seek to explain the phenomena. Some commentators have suggested that the

predominance of young men in the military and prison explain the gap. However, in 1989 the

attendance gap among 19-21 year olds was roughly eight percentage points. If all boys in the

military or prison had attended college instead, the difference would still be roughly three

percentage points (Cenus 1990; Justice 1997).

         In this paper, I examine two potential explanations for the differential attendance rates of

men and women—returns to schooling and non-cognitive skills. Several studies have found that

the returns to college are higher for women, particularly among young workers (Murphy &

Welch 1989; Murphy & Welch 1992). Kane (1994) reports that, among African-Americans,

  While gender differences in college enrollment are commonly lamented in the media, it is not clear a priori that
this is a problem. If this finding simply represents different employment preferences or tastes for schooling, it may

college earnings differentials rose faster for women than men in the eighties. While women have

made considerable inroads into traditional white-collar male jobs, they have had significantly

less success moving into skilled blue-collar occupations (England & Farkas 1986; Reskin &

Roose 1990). For this reason, it is likely that a young man with high school diploma will have a

better chance than a comparable young woman of finding a relatively high paying construction

or manufacturing job.

        While boys and girls today score roughly the same on most measures of cognitive

ability,3 boys generally receive lower grades, have more disciplinary problems, are more likely to

be retained in grade and placed in special education, report lower school enjoyment and

attachment and believe their teachers are less likely to encourage them (Kleinfeld 1998). These

difficulties are often attributed to poor “non-cognitive” skills among boys, including the inability

to pay attention in class, to work with others, to organize and keep track of homework or class

materials and to seek help from others. In recent years, non-cognitive skills have received

increased attention among economists in trying to explain labor market success (Murnane &

Levy 1996; Duncan & Dunifon 1998). Low non-cognitive skills may reduce college attendance

rates indirectly by decreasing the likelihood that a student graduates high school or leading to

poor high school performance, which decreases the chance of being accepted to college or

receiving financial aid. In addition, low non-cognitive skills may increase the non-pecuniary or

“psychic” costs of college, thereby decreasing the likelihood of enrollment.

        Using longitudinal data on a nationally representative cohort of eighth grade students in

1988, I find that the attendance gap is roughly five and ten percentage points for all high school



not be a matter for great societal concern. Moreover, women are still disproportionately represented in non-
technical fields and continue to lag behind men in earnings (Blau 1998).

  In the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), boys scored higher in math and science while
girls scored higher in reading and writing (Sommers 2000).

graduates and lower-income graduates respectively. Conditional on attendance, however, there

are few differences in type of college, enrollment status or selectivity of institution. The

majority of the attendance gap can be explained by differences in the characteristics of men and

women, despite some gender differences in the determinants of college attendance. I find that

higher non-cognitive skills and college premiums among women account for nearly 80 percent

of the gender gap in higher education. Interestingly, non-cognitive factors continue to influence

college enrollment after controlling for high school achievement.

         The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out a simple model of

college attendance. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and empirical strategy used in this paper.

Section 5 presents some descriptive statistics on the differences between men and women in

terms of postsecondary experience including the type and selectivity of college attended.

Sections 6 and 7 present the main findings and Section 8 concludes.



2. A model of college attendance

         The following model highlights several possible factors underlying the gender gap. To

begin, assume that an individual has graduated high school and has only one period, k, during

which to attend college. Further assume that students who decide to attend college will

graduate.4 The primary motivation of the model is the view that an individual will attend college

if the benefits exceed the costs. Here we consider only the financial benefit of college measured

in terms of lifetime earnings. Denote the earnings of a high school graduate in each period, t, as:

Yht,                       t= k, k+1, . . . T

Denote the earnings of a college graduate in period t as:


4
 Altonji (1993) presents an interesting model that explicitly addresses the uncertainty inherent in the college
attendance decision.


                                                           5
Yct                             t= k, k+1, . . . T

The earnings benefit of college attendance, often referred to as the college premium, may now be

written as:

Πct = Yct – Yht                 t=k+1. . . T

Assume that college takes one period to complete and that credit markets are perfect so that the

individual can borrow or lend at interest rate r. The net expected present value of this premium

is then:

  T − k Yc , k + j T − k Yh , k + j       T − k Π c , k + j 
E ∑                 − ∑               = E ∑                j
   j =1 (1 + r )      j =1 (1 + r )        j =1 (1 + r ) 
                   j                j




The costs of college attendance consist of three components: (1) direct costs, d, such as tuition

and fees net of financial aid; (2) forgone earnings during the period, Yhk, referred to as

opportunity costs and (3) “psychic” costs, h, that depend on a student’s non-cognitive skills (i.e.,

the higher a student’s non-cognitive ability, the more easily she is able to navigate college life

and the less effort she must put forth to succeed). Given these costs and benefits, a utility

maximizing decision-maker will attend college (C=1) when the net expected present value of

college attendance is positive.

                T − k Π cj                        
C=1,       if E  ∑               − d − Yhk − h ≥ 0
                 j =1 (1 + r )
                                j
                                                   

C=0,       otherwise.

If we allow all costs and premiums to differ by gender and assume that Πc,t is constant in all

periods and T is large, then we can write the structural model of college attendance as

                                                          Πg                          
                                          Pr ( C ) = Pr  c − d g − Yhg, k − h g ≥ 0 
                                                          r                           




                                                                   6
where the superscript g represents male or female. However, because I am primarily interested

in the marginal impacts of various characteristics on the probability of college attendance, I will

estimate the reduced form

                                                  (
                                     Pr (C i ) = F X i β       g
                                                                   )+ ε   i


where C is an indicator of college attendance, X is a vector of observable characteristics that

includes the college premium, opportunity costs, direct costs and psychic costs, ε is a stochastic

error term and g subscripts male (m) and female (f). If one assumes that college attendance

follows a linear probability model and restrict the coefficients β to be the same for men and

women, but allow the intercepts to differ, then the reduced form can be rewritten as

                                Pr (C i ) = (Female   i   )α   + X iβ + εi

where Female is an indicator variable and α measures the “gender gap.”




3. Data

       Student enrollment information is drawn from the National Educational Longitudinal

Study (NELS), a nationally representative sample of eighth graders in 1988 that were re-

surveyed every two years until 1994. NELS contains detailed information on family

background, cognitive ability, school achievement and attitudes toward school as early as junior

high. The 1994 survey includes detailed information regarding postsecondary schooling and

employment. For students who attended more than one college, I take the type, enrollment status

and selectivity of the institution that the respondent attended for the longest period.

       As a proxy for the college premium of individual i in state s with gender g, I use the

earnings differential for 25-34 year old, full-time workers (at least 35 hours per week) of gender



                                                  7
g in state s. The differential is computed as the log difference between the median weekly

earnings of college graduates (B.A. or higher) and high school graduates. These measures are

constructed using census data drawn from the 1990 PUMS. This state level measure may be

thought of as an average premium for individuals in the state.

        I utilize four measures of non-cognitive ability. Two measures—middle school grades

and the number of hours spent on homework per week in eighth grade—reflect effort and

achievement in school. Grades are measured on a scale of zero to four, where a four indicates an

“A” average, a three indicates a “B” average, etc. The idea here is that, conditional on cognitive

ability, school achievement is determined by a variety of non-cognitive skills such as the ability

to follow directions, work in groups, pay attention in class, and organize materials. Student

behavior serves as another measure of non-cognitive skill because it reflects the ability to

successfully negotiate the school environment. I create a composite measure of disciplinary

incidents from a set of NELS questions that ask students to indicate how often during the last

semester they were sent to the office for misbehaving, received a warning about their attendance,

grades or behavior and got into a physical fight with another student.5 Finally, an indicator of

whether the child had ever been retained in grade during elementary school serves as a fourth

measure of non-cognitive skills insofar as retention decisions are largely based on teacher

perceptions of a student’s social maturity and behavior.

        Among the 12,585 students in the NELS 1988-94 panel sample (i.e., students with survey

data for all four waves), 67.3 percent of women had some postsecondary education by 1994 in

comparison to only 62.3 percent of men. These attendance rates are somewhat higher than those

documented in other national samples. For example, in the 1990 Census, nearly 51.4 percent of


5
 Principal components analysis was used to create a single composite from the NELS items BYS55A-F described
above.


                                                      8
19-21 year old women had attained some postsecondary experience compared with only 43.4

percent of males. The comparable figures for the 1993 October Current Popular Survey are 54.3

percent and 48.7 percent. One possible explanation for this difference involves sample attrition

in NELS—i.e., those least likely to attend college have dropped out of the study and would not

be included in the 1988-94 panel. In addition, it is possible that the detailed nature of the NELS

survey questionnaire identified schooling experiences that individuals would not have self-

reported in the simpler Census or CPS surveys. However, the magnitude of the gap closely

resembles the numbers one obtains from other sources and a more detailed breakdown of

differential attendance patterns by demographic group is consistent with data on the distribution

of undergraduates nationally (Horn & Berktold 1998).

       I delete 1,660 cases (13 percent of the total) because of missing data in one or more key

variables such as student demographics, college attendance, high school graduation, non-

cognitive skills and college premiums.6 This leaves a total of 10,925 students, of which 9,734

graduated high school and 6,877 were high school graduates in the bottom three quartiles of the

SES distribution (based on the entire NELS sample). While this reduced sample appears slightly

more advantaged than the full panel sample, the differences do not seem unreasonably large. For

example, 82 percent of the full panel graduated high school and 65 percent attended some

college by 1994 in contrast to 86 percent and 68 percent in the reduced sample. Similarly, the

students in the full sample came from families at the 51th percentile of the SES distribution while

the average in the reduced sample was at the 53nd percentile. In order to estimate models that

include measures of high school achievement, labor force participation in high school and family

formation after high school, I imputed values for cases with missing data on these variables. In




                                                 9
the estimation, I include dummy variables to indicate whether the value of each variable was

imputed.7

         Summary statistics for men and women in the sample are shown in Table 1. There are

few differences between boys and girls in terms of cognitive ability or family background. In

contrast, boys and girls have considerably different non-cognitive skills. For example, 18

percent of boys were retained in elementary school compared with 12 percent of girls. Forty

percent of boys have demonstrated some type of behavior problem compared with only 20

percent of girls. Boys are disproportionately represented in remedial classes, get lower grades,

and spend less time on homework than girls. These differences carry over into high school

where girls have higher grades and are more likely to be in an academic track. There are also

differences in the college premiums earned by young men and women. Young female college

graduates earn roughly 55 percent more than female high school graduates in contrast to male

graduates who earn only 40 percent more than their less educated peers.




6
  Cases with missing data in the following variables were discarded: race, gender, college attendance, urban/rural
location, high school graduation, middle school grades, homework, retention and behavior problems, state, tuition,
unemployment, college density, college premiums and employment shares.
7
  Values are imputed using predictions from a linear regression that includes student demographics, standardized test
scores, parental education and income, state and other measures of academic achievement. While subsequent
estimates using imputed values may still be biased, it is often preferable to simply deleting cases with missing data
(Little & Rubin 1987).


                                                         10
4. Empirical strategy

           The gender gap could be due to differences in either the characteristics of young men and

women or the way in which men and women respond to these characteristics. For example,

women may be more likely to attend college because they have greater cognitive ability than

men, or because cognitive ability is a stronger determinant of college attendance for women than

for men.

           I first examine whether there are significant gender differences in the determinants of

college attendance for men and women by estimating the following the following linear

probability model8 separately for men and women:

(1)                                    C ig = X ig β g + ε ig

where the i and g subscripts reflect individuals and gender groups, C is an indicator of college

attendance, X is a vector of college determinants including cognitive ability, family background,

non-cognitive skills, college costs and returns to schooling, and ε is a stochastic error term.

           While this comparison can determine whether there are statistically significant

differences between the magnitude of various determinants for men and women, it does not tell

how large a role such coefficient differences play in explaining the gap. To do so, I decompose

the gender gap into the proportion that can be attributed to differences in observable

characteristics between boys and girls and the remaining proportion. Such decompositions have

a long history in studies of wage discrimination, beginning with the work of Oaxaca (1973) who

decomposed the wage differential between men and women into a component due to differences

in observable characteristics and a component due to unexplained differences in the returns to

these characteristics, which he interpreted in terms of discrimination (Blinder 1973; Jones 1983;


8
    Probit models yield virtually identical results so a LPM was used for ease of interpretation.


                                                             11
Reimers 1983; Cotton 1988; Neumark 1988; Oaxaca & Ransom 1994; Oaxaca & Ransom 1999).

In the case of college attendance, we can begin by writing the difference between males and

females in the average probability of attending college

                                ′          ′
(4)               C f − Cm = X f βˆ f − X m βˆm

where the βˆ f and βˆm are taken from (3). This attendance difference can be separated into two

components—one due to differences in observed characteristics and one due to differences in the

estimated coefficients of the two groups. To do this decomposition, however, one must choose

which set of coefficients to use (male or female). Following Neumark (1988) and Oaxaca and

Ranson (1994), I use common coefficients estimated from a pooled regression of males and

females, β̂ p ,


(5)                   [      ′
                                 ]        ′
                                               (         )  ′
                                                                  (
         C f − Cm = X f − X m βˆ p +  X f βˆ f − βˆ p − X m βˆm − βˆ p 
                                                                      
                                                                            )
In this decomposition, the first term can be interpreted as the part of the attendance differential

due to differences in characteristics. The second term can be interpreted as the part due to

differences in coefficients.9

         Finally, I examine the role of characteristics by estimating a variation of (1) that includes

both men and women (assuming that the “prices” are equal across genders) and includes a

dummy variable for female:

(6)               Ci = α ( Femalei ) + X i β + ε i




9
 Persell et. al. (1992) describe student characteristics as assets and the coefficients as measures of “asset
conversion,” emphasizing the role of societal forces such as discrimination in determining college attendance
differences. Alternative explanations might focus on differences in preferences or opportunity costs.


                                                         12
In this model, the coefficient on Female reflects the magnitude of the gender gap. By entering

covariates one-by-one, we can examine which observable characteristics (if any) mediate the

relationship between gender and college attendance.



5. The postsecondary experiences of young men vs. women

       To begin, one might ask to what extent the college gender gap can be explained by high

school graduation rates. For example, it may be the case that boys are simply less likely to

graduate high school but, conditional on graduation, boys are equally (or more) likely to attend

college. Table 2 shows that this is not the case.10 While boys are slightly less likely to graduate

high school than girls, the college attendance gap is roughly five percentage points among all

high school graduates. Conversely, boys are more likely to be employed and in the military.

Roughly the same number of boys and girls are neither in college, working nor in the military.

       Conditional on attending college, women are equally likely to attend a four-year college.

Women are roughly 33 percent more likely to attend a vocational or trade school, largely due to

the predominance of women in programs for clerical workers. There are no significant

differences between men and women in terms of full-time versus part-time enrollment status.

Finally, conditional on attending a four-year college, men appear to enroll in slightly more

selective institutions. Most notably, men attend colleges in which students score about ten points

higher on the math portion of the SAT. Assuming the ability distribution of high school

graduates is roughly equivalent for men and women, this slight advantage for women merely

reflects the fact that males who attend college come from a somewhat higher point on the ability

distribution on average. It is likely that the more noticeable advantage in math SAT scores also




                                                 13
reflects the preference for men to enroll in schools that are more heavily oriented towards math,

science and engineering.



6. The Determinants of College Attendance for Men and Women

         As mentioned above, the gender gap could be due to differences in either the

characteristics of young men and women or the way in which men and women respond to these

characteristics. This section explores the latter. The reasons that boys and girls in the NELS cite

for not attending college suggest that they approach the college attendance decision differently.

For example, 37 percent of boys cite a “dislike of school” compared with 26 percent of girls.

Similarly, 49 percent of boys say that they would rather work and earn money than go to college

compared with 41 percent of girls and 23 percent of boys claim that they will not need more

school for their jobs compared with 16 percent of girls.

         In order to provide a more formal examination of the college enrollment decision, Table

3 presents the results from the linear probability model shown in equation (1), estimated

separately for men and women. Note that the asterisks indicate whether the male and female

coefficients are statistically different from each other. In general, the traditional determinants of

college attendance appear significant and in the expected direction. Among women, for

example, a 25 percentage point increase in the SES distribution (roughly one standard deviation

in this sample) results in a 7.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of attending college

while a one standard deviation increase in math achievement coincides with more than a three

percentage point increase in the probability of college attendance. Non-cognitive skills appear to

have effects on college enrollment that are of the same magnitude as traditional determinants

10
  As described above, the NELS sample I use here is likely not representative of more marginal students due to
sample attrition and missing data. It is possible that high school graduation may account for more of the gender gap



                                                         14
such as family background and cognitive ability. For example, a one standard deviation increase

in middle school grades is associated with a 7.7 percentage point increase in the probability of

enrollment for boys. Male high school graduates who repeated a grade during elementary school

are roughly seven percentage points less likely than their peers to attend college. The measures

of direct and opportunity costs and returns to schooling have less pronounced effects.

         There are also some interesting differences between men and women. It appears that

family background is a stronger determinant of attendance for men whereas cognitive ability

(particularly reading ability) is a stronger determinant for women. While growing up in single

parent household decreases the probability of college attendance by roughly three percentage

points for boys, it does not have a significant impact on enrollment for girls. This is consistent

with the literature that emphasizes the importance of male role models for boys’ development

(Hetherington, Bridges & Insabella 1998).

         Finally, Table 3 provides some tentative evidence regarding the importance of

opportunity costs in college enrollment. Insofar as manufacturing and construction are still

largely male dominated industries, one would expect that the importance of these industries in a

local economy would provide greater economic opportunities for low-skilled men than low-

skilled women. If we believe that opportunity costs play an important role in the college

attendance decision, we might expect the gender gap to be larger in states with a strong

construction or manufacturing base. Similarly, the gender gap may be larger in rural areas where

agricultural or other “male” jobs are more common. Consistent with this view, the point

estimates for living in a rural area or in a state with a larger construction base are larger for boys

than girls.



among this group. However, since this study focuses on high school graduates, this is not a significant concern here.


                                                         15
         While one can reject the equivalence of the separate male and female regressions

(F=5.84, p<0.000), the decomposition results presented in the bottom panel of Table 3 suggest

that differences in observable characteristics, rather than differences in how men and women

respond to these characteristics, explain the majority of the observed difference in college

attendance rates. Of the total 4.9 percentage point gap, only 0.2 percentage points cannot be

explained by differences in observable characteristics.



7. The role of non-cognitive skills and college premiums in the college gender gap

         Having demonstrated that the gender gap is due primarily to differences in observable

characteristics, we now examine which of these characteristics explain the enrollment

differential. Table 4 presents OLS estimates from equation (6). The Column 1 shows the

unconditional gap, which is roughly five percentage points among all high school graduates and

seven percentage points among lower SES graduates. In Columns 2 to 5, we add in potential

explanatory variables. As expected, family background and cognitive ability do not substantially

affect the gap. However, when we add measures of non-cognitive skills in Column 4, the gap

drops almost three percentage points—roughly 40 percent—among all high school graduates.

When we control for the college premium and other economic factors, the gap drops another two

percentage points and is no longer statistically significant.11 This suggests that among students

with similar family background, cognitive ability and non-cognitive skills, in states with

comparable college premiums for men and women, there is no appreciable difference between

the college attendance rates of male and female high school graduates.



11
  Note that the college premium is driving the effect on the female coefficient because it is the only one of the
economic variables that is correlated with gender and, in this model, the effect of explanatory variables is
constrained to be identical for men and women.


                                                          16
       The final two columns of Table 4 include controls for high school achievement, work

experience, marriage and fertility. While these factors are clearly endogenous to the schooling

decision, the results provide a useful description of the college attendance process. High school

achievement is positively related to college attendance and working 20 hours a week or more

during high school is negatively related to enrollment. Since girls have generally higher high

school achievement and are less likely to work during this time, when we control for these

factors, the gender gap shrinks even more. Marriage and fertility (before age 21) are negatively

associated with enrollment and higher among women, so when we control for these factors, the

gender gap increases.

       Note that when we control for high school achievement and work experience as well as

family formation, the influence of non-cognitive skill diminishes but remains significant. In fact,

conditional on a wide range of high school achievement measures as well as 12th grade

standardized test scores and work experience, the self-reported measure of middle school grades

continues to exert a substantial influence on college enrollment.



8. Conclusions

       While the gender gap in higher education has received increasing attention in recent

years, it has gone largely unexplained in the empirical research literature. The most common

explanations of “where the boys are,” military and prisons, cannot explain the college enrollment

differentials between men and women. This study suggests higher returns to college and greater

non-cognitive skills among women account for nearly 90 percent of the gap.

       Given the influence of non-cognitive ability on educational attainment, it would be

interesting to know whether certain school characteristics foster the development of such skills




                                                17
and if certain types of curriculum, pedagogy or learning environments are more effective for one

gender than the other.12 This would not only deepen our understanding of the differential college

enrollment, but also may provide ways in which schooling could be restructured to foster greater

success for boys. In addition, these findings raise questions about the differential trends in

college attendance over the past three or four decades. Male and female enrollment among new

high school graduates reached parity in the mid-to-late seventies, and female attendance has

since outpaced that of men. While a variety of potential explanations come quickly to mind,

including changes in marriage and fertility rates, labor force participation and returns to

schooling, the simultaneity of these changes make it is extremely difficult to identify

independent causal factors underlying the rise in female attendance.

        Finally, the findings presented suggest that non-cognitive factors may play a larger role in

other areas generally dominated by more concrete measures. Here we find that grades and

disciplinary incidents have a substantial impact on the probability of enrolling in college, even

after controlling for cognitive ability, family background, and high school achievement. The

effect of non-cognitive skill is comparable in magnitude to socio-economic status and cognitive

ability. Given the importance in college attendance decisions, it is likely that non-cognitive

factors influence employment, occupation choice, and a variety of other labor market outcomes.

  Prior studies have shown that communal school organization and small size are not only positively correlated with
achievement and engagement of middle and high school students (Lee & Smith 1993; Lee & Smith 1995),
but may influence gender differences in achievement (Lee, Chen & Smerdon 1996). Similarly, there is
evidence that Catholic schools are particularly effective for low-SES and African-American males (Bryk, Lee &
Holland 1993; Neal 1996).
