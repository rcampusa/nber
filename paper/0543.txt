                 The Economics of Tenure Choice, 1955-79


                                 ABSTRACT

     The aggregate homeownership rate in the United States has continued

to rise throughout the 1970s despite rising inflation and the rapid growth

of young and primary individual households with relatively low homeownership

rates. This appears to be a result of a decline in the cost of homeownership

relative to renting. The post 1965 decline in the real after-tax interest

rate has acted to reduce the costs of both types of housing. However,

inflation, and legislation induced increases in taxation of rental housing

have largely offset the decline in the net real financing rate. Depreciation

is based on historic cost and nominal capital gains are taxed. Moreover,

this taxation was increased in 1969 and 1976 with the introduction and

expansion of the minimum tax, the increased recapture of accelerated depre-

ciation, and the amortization, rather than expensing, of construction

period interest and property taxes.

     The decline in the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to rental

housing is estimated to have sharply increased hoineownership. In the

absence of this decline 1-- to 5 million fewer households would have been

homeowners at the end of 1978. That is, the homeownership rate would

have been 60 percent, rather than 6 percent.

       Substantial     concern arose      in the   1970s regarding the   "affordability"
of   owner-occupied housing.1 House price increases generally exceeded increases
in other prices, and          a   rising inflation premium was incorporated into mortgage
interest      rates. As a result, the ratio of the monthly mortgage payment on a

constant quality house to average household income rose sharply.2 In spite

of this increase,the homeownership rate in the United States climbed

throughout the 1970s. The climb was especially remarkable because the rapid

growth   in   both young and       primary   individual households tended to reduce the

homeownership rate tJaffee and           Rosen   (l979):I.

       The explanation of the continued rise in the homeownership rate is,

surprisingly,       the same increase in       inflation that purportedly has made owner-

ship unaffordable.3 The true real cost              of homeownership fell sharply between
the middle 1960s and late 1970s because the real after-tax financing rate

  Office      (1977) and Downs (1978).

  payment mortgage and the merits of alternative mortgage instruments at
     some length. For a briefer presentation, see Hendershott and Villani

  point.

declined. That is, the mortgage rate, after allowing for its deductibility

in computing one's taxable income, has risen by less than the expected rate

of appreciation in the purchased house. While the real after-tax financing

rate for rental housing has declined by even more because landlords tend to

be in higher tax brackets than homeowners, the taxation of rental housing is

less favorable than that of owner-occupied housing in inflationary periods.

More specifically, nominal capital gains are taxed at the point of sale at

both the capital gains and minimum (after 1969) tax rates, and tax depre-

ciation is based on historic, rather than replacement, cost. Because of these

factors, real rents have been roughly constant over the last quarter century.

Thus homeownership has become relatively nre attractive.

     The present paper is structured in the following manner. In Section I,

a framework is constructed for computing the real user cost of capital for

owner-occupied housing, and data are employed to calculate this user cost

quarterly over the 1955 to 1979 period. Section II does the same for rental

housing. Differences and changes in tax treatment are highlighted. The

relationship between the homeownership rate, adjusted for demographic changes,

and the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to rental housing is demon-

strated in Section III. A summary concludes the paper and an appendix lists

the real user costs and the data underlying their calculation.

                                 A. The General Framework

        As Is well-known, the decision to invest depends on whether the present

 value of the expected future cash flows generated by the investment exceeds

 the value of the initial equity investment and in equilibrium the two will

 be equal. For partially debt-financed owner-occupied housing, the gross

 revenues (positive cash flows) consist of an implicit flow of net rental

 services over time and a lump sum at the selling date (asset price net of

 selling costs and the outstanding mortgage on that date). The costs

 (negative cash flows) include mortgage and property tax payments, after

 allowance for their income tax deductibility..4 Assume that


          (i) inflation Is expected to generate increases in net revenues
               at the quarterly rate p and housing prices at rate q,

         (ii) the house, and thus the implicit rent, deteriorate at the
               quarterly rate d,

       (iii) the fraction, a', of the purchase price is financed with a
              mortgage at rate 1.

        (Iv) the house is expected to be sold after N periods, at which
              point a percentage realtor's fee, ,      will
                                                       be paid.

 The equilibrium condition Is then

1'inc1usion of property tax payments In the cost of housing needs explanation.
   One may rightfully argue that property taxes are but payments for better
  counIty  services (e.g., a better public school system), and for    this
 reason  should not be included as a cost of housing. This would be a valid
 criticism if our primary concern were with the choice of location of housing.
 Indeed, in areas where property taxes are higher, counity services are
 better, other things being equal. On the other hand, our main concern is
 the cost of one more square foot of space when a house is being built (or
 remodeled). The additional property tax paid on this cquare foot is unlikely
 to render additional community services and thus is appropriately viewed as
  a   cost of housing.

       The real   user cost of capital is a simple concept in theory; the user

cost is the real rental rate that an economic unit would           pay to rent a unit
of real capital. In a world without taxes and          inflation and with    perfect

capital markets, the user cost would equal "the" rate of interest plus the

 depreciation rate. For owner-occupied housing the real user cost is obtained

 by substituting (1.2) Into (1.1), employing the general finite sum rule

        The rather complicated expression on the right-hand side of equation

 (1.3) is the hurdle rate that the real imputed rent from additional housing

 investment must exceed in order for the investment to be undertaken. The

 equilibrium real imputed rent or user cost, then, can be computed from the

depreciation and expected inflation rates (d, p, and q), the structure-value

ratio (v5),   the terms of the mortgage (,                    I,   and M), the property tax rate

and realtor's fees (r and ), and the homeowner's expected holding period (N),

 income tax rate ('Ty) and required rate of return (e).

         finite holding period, in conjunction with and the multiple expected
        The

inflation and financing rates, makes (1.3) a complicated expression. A series of
                                                                                 6



assumptions can transform (1.3) into a more familiar relationship that better
illustrates the primary determinants of R/P. If the required after-tax rate

of return equals the after-tax mortgage rate itself, i.e., e =
                                                                  (i-r)i   the

expected housing inflation rates are equal (p =    q) and there are no selling
costs (   = 0),   then one obtains1


       R/P =                  +
               [(1-i)i-q-5d       (1_Ty)rp]PK/P.                                 (i.li)



The right side of (1.14) is a simple real user cost of capital expression that

reflects the current tax treatment of housing (no taxation of implicit rents

but deduction of property taxes and mortgage interest and no deductibility

of depreciation expense) and of interest income (taxation at rate ¶y)• As

can be seen, the higher the tax rate, the lower is the cost of capital.

Further, insofar as the mortgage rate does not rise by a multiple of increases

in expected inflation, the reduction in the cost of capital owing to taxation

is greater the higher is the expected inflation rate.


                                   B. The Data

     There are two housing prices series in the model: the price of implicit

rents (the rent component of the consumer price index) and the price of houses

(the NIA deflator for residential structures before 1963 and the Bureau of

Census constant 197)4 quality price thereafter). The price of other goods is

represented by the consumer price index net of shelter. These price series

are listed in the appendix. All indices are set equal to unity in the fourth

quarter of 196)4; thus the real imputed rent equals the gross marginal product

(R/Pk) in that period.




     is also assumed that q -           < e.

                                                                                             7


        The calculation of the expected inflation rates is explained in detail
in    Hendershott and     Hu (1980) and the expected rates are listed in the data
appendix.         The general expected inflation rate is a 16 quarter distributed

lag    on current and     past   rates of change    in   the deflator for nonfood business

product net of energy and            the   impact of the 1971-75 price controls. The

lagged    weights were obtained from a regression explaining an eight-year
U.S. government bond rate. The expected inflation rates in rents and house
price are averages of the general expected inflation rate and a distributed
lag    on own past     inflation rates where the lag       weights are the same as those
employed in computing the general inflation rate. The general and house price

expected inflation rates are plotted in Figure 1. The rental expected inflation

rate is similar to the general rate.

       The required after-tax return on equity, e, for taxpayers in low to

medium marginal tax brackets is taken to be the after-tax mortgage rate

because taxable bonds and mortgages are reasonable investment alternatives.

For taxpayers in higher tax      brackets, tax-exempt securities offer         a superior

return.       Because the long-term exempt rate has generally equalled         70 percent

of    the yield on comparable taxable bonds, it           is assumed that


          e   =   0.7i for IT> 0.3
          e = (i-IT )i                0.3.

                                 I
For           0.3, the costs of debt and own financing are the same and thus the

cost of capital       is independent of the method of        financing. The house purchase

is   assumed to be 75 percent         financed with a 25 year, fixed-rate mortgage.

The   mortgage yield series utilized is the .FHA-HUD series for 1955614, FHLB's
effective rate series for the 1965-72 period and. the FHLB'S effective rate on
75-25 year new home commitments for the 1973-79 period (FHLBB Journal,               June

1978).

         Lastly, annual depreciation and property tax rates are assumed to be

0.017 and 0.018, respectively, the structure-to-value ratio is set at 0.83,

realtor's fees (B) at 6 percent of the value of the house, and the expected

holding period is 8 years. Calculations are made for households in the

0.15, 0.3 and 0.115 tax brackets.

         Figure 2 plots the real user costs for households in the three tax brackets

(the series are also listed in Table B in the appendix). The user costs all

rise in the second half of the 1950s, plateau in the early 1960s, and then

trend downward into early 1979. The user costs are lower in 19611 for those

in higher tax brackets, owing to the greater tax savings on their property

taxes and interest payments, and the decline since then is greater because

their tax saving on interest payments is larger. The real user cost for those

in high tax brackets was, in fact, roughly zero in late 1978 and early 1979,

implying that optimal behavior of these households consisted of owning marginal
                6
unused rooms.

                                     II. Rental Housing

     The user cost of capital for rental housing differs from the user cost

of capital expression for owner-occupied housing in many respects. Rents

received from rental housing are subject to tax whereas the imputed rents

from owner-occupied housing are not, and depreciation is tax deductible for

rental housing while it Is not tax deductible for owner-occupied housing.

In addition, the calculation of the user cost is complicated by the longer

construction   period and      the changing tax treatment of construction period

interest   and property taxes, tax preference items and capital gains induced
by tax legislation in 1969, 1976, and 1978. All of these factors are accounted

for and discussed     below.

Jde Leeuw and Ozanne (1979) provide an illuminating discussion of this tax
 legislation and how       it has
                            affected the returns on investment in rental
 housing. The study of Brueggexnan (1977) and various issues of the Standard
 Federal Tax Reporter were also useful in measuring the rental user cost.

                   amortized for tax purposes,

                   is the tax depreciation rate the t th period the investment

 Equation (2.1) takes       into   account construction period outlays on interest    and property

 taxes (cipr)     and   their tax deductibility, a four quarter delay in getting the
 investment on line (thus the sununation of the basic flows         begins   in period t=5),
 the deductibility of tax depreciation (the dx1ts), and the treatment of

mimimum taxes on accelerated depreciation (Acc), recapture provisions (RCAP),

 and taxable capital gains (cGAIN). These factors and variables are discussed

 in some detail below.

      The real user cost is obtained by solving (2.1) for R and dividing by P.

The parameters that differ from those employed in the calculation of the user

cost for owner-occupied housing are: d = 0.0111, N = 13 years (52 quarters),8
  =   0.8    (rental housing is slightly more debt financed), I =      the   home mortgage



'de Leeuw and Ozanne (1979) obtained the profit-maximizing holding period by
 calculating the present value of assumed cash flows associated with a typical
 investment in real estate for many different holding periods and choosing the
 one with the highest demand price (they assume a value for R/Ph and calculate
 rather than R/Ph). They found that the optimum holding period was equal to 13
 years and varied only slightly as conditions changed. In future research we
 propose to expand on this problem of determining an optimum holding by explicitly
 taking into account returns on alternative investments to rental real estate.
 Detailed attention will be given to the taxation of rental housing and its
 effects on the optimum holding period and on the calculation of rental user
 costs of capital.

rate plus 0.005, 'r =   0.5   and e =   0.71 + 0.03.   The latter implies that the

after-tax opportunity cost of equity financing for high tax-bracket investors

is the tax-exempt rate plus 3    percentage points. Thus rental housing is
assumed to be a more risky investment than       owner-occupied housing. Finally
the weights given general inflation and housing-specific inflation in cal-

culating the expected housing inflation rate are 2/3 and 1/3, respectively.

The general inflation rate is given a larger weight than for owner-occupied

housing because the expected holding period, 13 years, is longer. The longer

the holding period, the more likely are all Inflation rates to converge to a

common value.

                B. Special Tax Considerations for Rental Housing

Tax Depreciation

     Since 19514 tax depreciation of new rental housing      maybe based on appli-
cation of the double-declining balance method to the initial cost of the

structure. According to this method, investors are allowed initially to

deduct the fraction 2/n of the undepreciated balance of the structure, where

n is the allowable annual tax life, and to switch to the straight line method

whenever doing so would give higher depreciation charges on the undepreciated

balance over the remaining tax life. The straight-line method in this case

is simply the remaining undepreciated balance divided by the remaining tax
                                                                                  13




         The optimal switch over point with n=35 is the 18th

 Recapture
                                         accelerated depreciation or the difference
        Recapture provisions relate to

 between depreciation based on the double-declining balance and straight line

 methods. Thus accelerated depreciation (ACC) in period t is

  sufficiently small. If the structure were held for the full tax life, then
  accumulated accelerated        depreciation would, of course, be zero.

        Recapture provisions relate to the percentage (PER) of accumulated

  accelerated depreciation that is taxed at the income tax rate at time of

  sale. Thus

                         N+ii

                         t=5
  Before   1963, no recapture provisions existed, i.e., PER =         0.   The Tax Reform

  Act of 1962 required that for new rental property held less than 20 months

  all accumulated acceleration depreciation or the amount of the capital gain

  at point of sale, whichever was less, had to be treated as ordinary income)Pi

  For each month in excess of 20 months the property was held, the percentage

  of excess depreciation treated as ordinary income declined by one percent.

  So, if property were held for 10 years, then none of the gain was ordinary

  income. Beginning in 1970, the number of months property had to be held

  before   complete recapture occurred was increased from 20 to 100. If the

  property were held for a full 200 months (16 2/3 years), then no recapture

  occurred. The Tax Reform Act of 1976          mandated   full recapture regardless of

  the holding period.

        Table 1 summrizes the impact of the changes legislation on PER.

Taxation at      the Capital Gains Rate

        The   capital gains tax rate equalled one-half the rate of taxation of
ordinary      income,   up to a maximum of 25 percent, for many decades prior to
late    1978. The 1978 Tax Reform         Act lowered the fraction of the income tax
rate to 14.0 percent. Thus


                                after September 1978

                                prior to October 1978.
                      5r
       The capital gains tax rate on rental property applies to the net (of

sales commissions) sale price less the undepreciated purchase price and the

accelerated depreciation subject to recapture provisions. Thus



                                                     stJk

                                                  t=5

It   is worth noting that this tax applies to nominal, rather than real, capital

gains.


Min:imum   Tax
       The    tax   treatment of accelerated depreciation and capital gains was

increased in        the l970s   through the   application of a new "minimum"    tax rate

to certain tax        preference   items. Starting       in 1970, tax preference   items
were   taxed provided that        they   exceeded the sum   of   $30,000, regular income
tax      credits, and tax carryovers. The tax preference items that relate
       less

specifically to investment in rental housing are (1) one-half of the excess
of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital gains and
(2) accelerated depreciation in excess of straight line depreciation taken
each year.
                                                                                                      17



        The Tax   Reform Act of 1976 increased the mininnun tax rate from 10 percent
to    15 percent. Also, in place            of   the existing exemption of $30,000       plus   the

regular income      taxes for the year, individuals were allowed an exemption

equal to the greater of $10,000             or   one-half the regular income taxes for

the year. But,          changes   occurring      in 1978 loosened these revisions to some
degree.     The    1978 Tax Reform Act removed the untaxed portion of capital gains from
the   calculation of the "regular"           minimum tax. Instead,        the capital gains deduction

is subject to a complex alternative minimum tax                   beginning   in 1979.   Because
this alternative applies to only             a handful of       taxpayers, it is ignored below.

Construction Period Interest and             Property   Taxes

        Property   taxes and interest are assumed to be paid on one-half of the
total investment during the period of construction. Thus

         CIPT = (T+i)o.5Pk,

where      is the construction loan rate and is approximated by the prime
commercial paper rate plus one and a half percentage points.

     Traditionally, construction period interest and property taxes were
 deductible during the construction period by investors in rental housing)
 With   the passage of the Tax           Reform   Act of 1976, construction period interest
 and taxes are        required   to be capitalized into the asset price in the beginning
 of 1978. The minhimim allowable amortization period was                14   years in 1978   and

  increases   by one year each succeeding year thereafter until the minimum
 amortization period becomes 10 years in 19814..               Thus the amortization variable

                                  C. Rental User Costs

        The real user cost of capital for rental housing is the solid schedule

 plotted in Figure 3 (and is listed in Table B th the appendix). As can

 be seen, the user cost has no discernable trend

 over the past 25 years, although there is a slight bulge in the early 1960s.

 The failure of the user cost to decline sharply between 1964 and late 1978

  in the face of a 5 percentage point fall in the real after-tax mortgage rate,

  (1-r)i-q., follows from two factors: the tax reform legislation of 1969 and

  1976 and the acceleration of actual, and thus expected, inflation. The

 reform legislation created a minimum               tax,   increased the proportion of

accelerated depreciation subject to recapture, and lengthened the minimum

interval over which construction period interest and property taxes               can be
amortized. In order to obtain a rough estimate of the impact of this

legislation, we recomputed the rental user cost with ¶fl              0.0,   PER =   0.0,   and C =4

throughout.    The    difference   between the user cost in Figure 3 and the recal-

culated user cost was 65 basis points in 1969, rose gradually to 80 basis

points in 1975,   jumped to 125      basis   points in 1976   and   1977, and on to 175

basis   points in late 1978 when the minimum       amortization     period for construc-

tion property taxes     and interest was lengthened. This difference fell in
1979 when the taxation of capital gains was reduced.

     An increase in expected inflation affects the rental user cost adversely

relative to the owner-occupied user cost in two ways.1?' First, an increase

in expected inflation creates expected capital gains that will be subject

to taxation. Second, the increase intensifies the expected understatement

of true economic depreciation owing to the use of historic cost accounting.

A rental user cost that eliminates these effects is obtained by adjusting

equation (2.1) in the following ways: (1) setting the coefficient on CGAIN

equal to zero, (2) redefining tax depreciation as

                  2
              =        (1 -   l(l+qyd)t_5
and (3) recomputing accelerated depreciation as


        ACCt =    rdX - (l÷q_y$d)t_Sq3P.

1The user costs for investments by other businesses are also adversely
   affected.
The "inflation-adjusted" rental user cost is the hatched series in Figure 3.

     Comparison of the actual and "inflation-adjusted" rental user costs

reveals that the adjusted cost was less than 1 percentage point lower

throughout the 1960-65 period when expected housing inflation was less than

13- percent. As expected housing inflation changes over time so does this

difference. The acceleration of expected inflation and reform legislation

in the second half of the 1970's continually decreased the "inflation-

adjusted" user cost relative to the actual user cost through 1978. By mid

1978, when expected housing inflation equalled 8   percent,   the difference

between actual and adjusted was about 5 percentage points. In late 1978

and 1979 the difference falls back to 33- percentage points even though

expected inflation rises slightly because taxation of capital gains had

decreased (the capital gains tax rate was cut in 784 and the minimum tax

was no longer applied to capital gains beginning in 791) and thus the

impact of inflation was less.

                            III. The Homeownership Rate

        As Jaffee and Rosen (1979) have emphasized, households with different

demographic characteristics have sharply different homeownership rates. For

example, in 1970 only one-quarter of families with a head under age 25 owned,

while over hali' with a head in the 25 to 31 age group and three-quarters of

those with even older heads did. Also, primary individual households, espe-

cially younger ones, had far lower ownership rates than family households with

heads in the same age span. Demographic specific ownership rates will vary over

time with the economic attractiveness of ownership relative to renting.

However, the aggregate economy-wide homeownership rate will vary with changes

in the demographics of the population, as well as with changes in the economic

variables. While demographics undoubtedly respond to economic variables, the

response is likely to be limited, at least in the short run. Thus it would

appear to be useful to isolate the impact of demographic variables prior to

attempting to identify the effect of economic variables. This is the purpose

of the Jaffee-Rosen calculation of the adjusted homeowrAership rate.

        The adjusted (for demographic changes) level of homeowners in period t

is defined as
                        8
                  =
                        1=1
where         the total number of households in period t, hit is the proportion

of total households in class i in period t and o is the homeownership rate

for class i in a given base period (1970 for Jaffee and Rosen). The variation

over time in the ratio HJ.t/1IHt depends solely on changes in the portion of

households in the different demographic classes. The homeownership rate

can be defined as

         HOWN - HOWN HADJ
          HH    HADJ HFL
                                                                                   23




If we take HADJ/HH as predetermined by demographic factors, then the deter-

mination of the adjusted homeownership rate, HOWN/HADJ, provides a complete

explanation of the homeownership rate.

      The adjusted homeownership rate should depend largely on the attractive-

ness of homeownership relative to renting. The measurement of this attrac-

tiveness is complicated by the determination of expected inflation, transaction

costs, estimates of a probable holding period, and. the effects of existing

and potential federal tax policy. At least for homeownership, it appears

reasonable to assume that the user cost of owning is the appropriate price

to be considered in determining the overall attractiveness of owning.

However, even this measurement is not totally satisfactory because of the

time horizon for which the decision to own is being made.        The primary tax

advantage     of owner-occupied housing -- zero   taxation of capital gains as long

as   the   gain is rolled over into another house until, at least age 55 -- means

that the individual household is faced with significant transaction costs

if it decides to switch back to renting. So, once households decide to

own in actuality they are making the      decision to remain homeowners for a
considerably longer time than     is   reflected in the assumed value for the
holding     period in calculating the user cost. Nonetheless,because expecta-

tions of interest rates, inflation, etcetera beyond the assumed 8 year

holding period are likely not dissimilar to those over the 8 years, the

calculated user cost is probably a quite adequate measure of the relevant

expected cost of owning.

      For the cost of renting, investigators e.g., Rosen and Rosen (1980)]

generally employ an observed rental index such as the CPI rent component.

The above discussion suggests that the relevant rental cost is that expected
                                                                                    23a.




to prevail over a generally lengthy time horizon. Thus it appears to us

that the above calculated rental user cost, the value to which actual rents

will adjust over time, is a better measure. In fact, a possible criticism

is    that the measure fails to take into account anticipated changes in the
tax law (implicitly no changes are anticipated).
        The ratio of the above-calculated user costs for owner-occupied      and

rental housing is employed as the measure of the attractiveness of homeowner-

ship relative to renting. An increase in the ratio of user costs should

lead to a reduction in the adjusted rate, with an uncertain lag, while a

fall in the ratio should lead to an increase in the adjusted rate. We test

the user costs for households in both the 15 and 30 tax brackets, denoting

the ratio of the former to the rental user cost by CO15CR and the ratio of

the    latter to the rental by CO3OCR. The other variable tested is "permanent"
real   disposable income per household where permanent is approximated by an

average of current and observed income during the previous 11 quarters. This

variable, denoted by YDA/HH, could capture increases in either taste for or

"affordability" of homeownership as real income rises. Tastes could, of

course, move in the opposite direction.

       The adjusted homeownership rate rose aiinost monotonically from 0.9l5 in

the second quarter of 1960 to 1.077 at the end of 1978) Our user cost ratios

trend downward from 0.8 in 1959 to 0.5 in 1978 for the 15 percent bracket, and

0.7 to 0.2 for the 30 percent bracket. Thus the general movement in the ratios

is broadly consistent with the behavior of the adjusted homeownership rate.

The movement in the real income, too, is broadly consistent; real permanent

income per household rose from 9       thousand   (1972 dollars) In 1960 to 12 thousand

in   1978.

     It   is reasonable to expect a substantial lag in the adjustment of the

homeownership rate to changes in the user cost ratio. An increase in the

economic attractiveness of homeownership must be perceived by the household,

a decision must be made regarding the explicit form and location of the house,

and the house must be constructed (Or          converted    from a rental unit).    The first
two lags might be short for some households and a small increase in the home-

ownership ratio could          be achieved through a drop in unsold or vacant existing
houses,   but the full response to a significant decline in the cost of home-
ownership is undoubtedly not completed for a number of years.
     In the estimation the distributed lag weights were assumed to lie along
a third degree polynomial (with no end point constraints) and the length of
the lag was extended as long as the expected negative relationship held.
Because initial estimates over the 1960-2 through 197'8-14 period             indicated
substantial   autocorrelatjon of the residuals, the Cochrane-Orcutt semi-difference

transformation was employed. The results of this estimation are:

-'These equations still appear to suffer from substantial autocorrelation, but
  this is deceiving. Examination of the residuals from equations (3.1) and
  (3.2) reveals a distinct a.nnual clustering, i.e., the residuals for 1960-2
  through 1961-i are similar, a jump occurs in 1961-2, and the pattern is
  repeated.  (This phenomenon follows from the construction of the data.
  Only annual data are available for both the number of homeowners and the
  adjusted homeowners; this ratio is calculated for the second quarter of the
  year and interpolated linearly between second quarters.) We have averaged
  the residuals for each of the 18 annual clusters and computed Durbin-Watson
  statistics based upon these. The result is statistics of 2.3 and 2.8.

where the numbers in parentheses are t-statistics and RHO           is   the semi-difference

parameter. The income variable is statistically significant in the second

equation only; the user cost variables perform as expected in both equations.

       The weights on the lagged user cost ratios in equations (3.1) and (3.2)

are summarized by year in Table 2. The average t-ratios for the quarters in

the year are also listed, Both the humped weight pattern and the nearly 5

year period for complete adjustment are generally consistent with our expec-

tations. The estimated response to CO15CR is somewhat more rapid with 26

percent occurring within two years rather than the              percent response to

CO3OCR.

       The magnitude of the user-cost coefficients in equations (3.1) and (3.2)

indicate large and similar effects from observed changes in the user cost

ratios. The estimated impact of the observed decline in CO15CR accounts for
66 percent of the observed increase in the adjusted homeownership rate between

early    1960 and the end of 1978, while the impact of the decline in CO3OCR
explains 6 percent of the increase.           If the ratio of   the user costs had not
fallen over this period, then 3 to 1         million fewer households would have been

homeowners at the end of 1978 than the observed 50 million. Put another way,

the homeownership rate would have been about 60 percent, rather than the

observed 65 percent.

       These results are roughly comparable to those of Harvey and Kenneth

Rosen (1980). The Rosens related the homeownership rate annually over the

19149_71& period to the ratio of the user costs, per capita real consumption

(a   proxy for   permanent income), a credit availability variable (the real

growth   rate   in thrift   deposits),   and demographic variables (their dependent

variable   is the "observed" homeownership rate, not the adjusted rate). The

greatest difference in our results relates to demographic variables.

Through construction of the adjusted homeownership ratio, demographic

factors are "forced" in our analysis to cause a reduction in the unadjusted

ratio from 0.62 in 1960 to 0.58 in 19711. The Rosens, in contrast, find no

impact for such factors. They do find income to be a significant determinant

[as we did in equation (3.2)] and credit availability to be insignificant

(t-ratio   of   1.3). Most striking is the similarity in our results regarding

the   user cost ratio. They, too, find a significant, much delayed response
(the   peak adjustment occurs in the third year following a change in the

user cost ratio). To provide a feel for the magnitude of their estimated

response, they compute the long-run value of the homeownership rate in 19714.

on the assumption that property taxes and interest were not tax deductible.

The calculated value is 0.60 as opposed to the observed value of o.61i. We

have attempted to perform the same experiment which consists of recomputing

Cl5 and C30 without the deductions, obtaining the impact of these changes

on HOWN/HADJ in equations (3.1) and (3.2) and transforming these changes into

impacts on HOWN/HH, the observed ownership rate. The results are 0.59

(tax rate equals 0.15) and 0.575 (tax rate equals 0.3). These calculations

suggest roughly the same sensitivity of tenure choice to relative prices

as that obtained by Rosen and    Rosen)1

                                      IV. Summary

        Our goal has been to explain why     the aggregate homeownership rate in

the    United States has continued to rise throughout the 1970s despite
rising inflation and      the   rapid growth of young and   primary   individual house-
holds with     relatively low homeownership    rates. In order   to do this it was

first necessary to compute the real user costs of capital for owner-occupied

and    rental housing.   The decline in the real after-tax interest rate

associated    with equal increases in nominal interest rates and expected infla-
tion    has acted to reduce the user costs for both types of housing.             However,

inflation and legislation induced increases in taxation of rental housing

have largely offset the decline in the net real financing rate.            Depreciation
is   based   on historic cost and nominal capital gains are taxed. Moreover,

this   taxation was increased in 1969 and 1976 with the introduction and             expan-
sion   of the minlimim   tax,   the increased recapture of accelerated depreciation,

and the amortization, rather than expensing, of construction period interest

and property taxes.

       The decline in the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to rental housing

is estimated to have sharply increased homeownership. The             empirical   results

suggest that 4 to 5 million fewer households would have been homeowners

at the end of 1978 in the absence of the estimated decline in the relative

cost of homeownership. That is, the homeownership rate would have been 60

percent, rather than 6 percent.

     The first three variables listed in Table A are the commodity-specific

expected inflation rates for the rent, house price, and general price indexes.

These expectations were constructed as 16 quarter distributed lags on

the current and past rates of inflation of the indexes listed in the next three

columns, respectively. The weights, going from the current period to the

lagged 15 period, are 0.]A7, 0.131, 0.117, 0.103, 0.091, 0.079, 0.068, 0.058,

0.011.9, 0.1iOLi, 0.033, 0.026, 0.020, 0.OlLi., 0.010, 0.006. [The estimation of

these weights is described in Hendershott and Hu (1980).] Column        is the

rent component of the consumer price index; column 5 is the price of houses

(see page 6 in the text); and column 6 is the rate of change in the deflator

for nonfood business product, net of energy and the impact of price controls

for the 1971-75 period. Column 7 lists the price of other goods, F, and

equals the consumer price index net of the shelter component. Finally,

the last two columns give the mortgage interest rate variable (RN) and the

interest rate on commercial paper (RCP).

     The underlying expected housing and rent inflation rates were constructed

as weighted averages of the expected general inflation rate [column (3)] and

the good-specific expected inflation rates [column (1) or (2)]. The weights

employed were .5/.5 for owner-occupied housing and .67/.33 for rental housing.

     Table B lists the real user costs of capital for owner-occupied housing

and rental housing. The first three columns give the user costs for owner-

occupied housing based upon marginal income tax rates of .15, .30, and .145,

respectively. Column 14 is the real user cost of capital for rental housing.
