         FORECASTING PRICES AND EXCESS RETURNS IN THE HOUSING MARKET



                                   ABSTRACT

     The U. S. market for homes appears riot to be efficient.    A number of

information variables predict housing price changes and excess returns of

housing relative to debt over the succeeding year.   Price changes observed

over one year tend to continue for one more year in the same direction.

Construction cost divided by price, the change in per capita real income,

the change in adult population are all positively related to price changes

or excess returns over the subsequent year.

     The results are based on time-series cross section regressions with

quarterly data 1970-1 to 1987-3 and for cities Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and

San Francisco.

     In an earlier paper [Case and Shiller, 1989] we performed
weak-form tests of the efficiency of the market for single family

homes.     The tests were based on a set of price indexes
constructed from micro data on nearly 40,000 homes that were sold
more than once during the period 1970-1986 in four metropolitan
areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco (Alameda

County).

         In that paper we found evidence of positive serial

correlation in real housing prices.      A change in the log real

price index in a given year and a given city tends to be followed
by a change in the same direction the following year between 25

percent and 50 percent as large.       We also found evidence of

inertia in a crude measure of excess returns estimated for each
of the four metropolitan areas.
     This paper takes the analysis several steps further.          First,

we construct a more detailed estimate of excess returns to
investment in single family homes in each of the four cities that

is sensitive to changes in the market value of housing services
and to changes in marginal personal income tax rates.       Second, we

perform strong-form efficiency tests by exploring the
forecastability of excess returns and house prices with a number

of forecasting variables.

The WRS Index
     The biggest problem faced by analysts of the residential
real estate market is a lack of good time series on house prices.
The most commonly used series is the National Association of

                                   1
Realtors' "median price of existing single family homes."         While

the MAR generates this series for a large number of metropolitan
areas quarterly and for the U.S as a whole monthly, they are not
useful for our purposes.     First, they are only available since
1981.     Second, changes in the median home price in an area depend
both on changes in house prices and on changes in the mix of
homes that happens to sell.
        In an earlier piece (Case and Shiller [19871) we discuss
the problems associated with the MAR data and construct an

alternative based on microdata using a technique that we call the
Weighted Repeat Sales (WRS) method.     The method used is a

modification of one first proposed by Bailey, Muth and Nourse
[1963) (hereafter BMN).    The method uses observations on
individual houses that sold more than once during the sample
period.    Specifically, the change in log price for each
observation is regressed on a set of simple dummy variables.         The

duinmys are set to -1 for the period of the first sale and to +1

for the period of the second sale and to 0 otherwise.       The

resulting coefficients are the values of the log price index

(WRS).     Sally, Muth and Nourse argued that if individual log

house price changes differed from the city-wide log house price
changes by an independent, identically distributed noise term,
the BMN method produces the best linear unbiased estimate of the

city-wide log price index.

        In our earlier piece we argue that the house-specific
component of the change in log price is not likely to be

                                   2
homoscedastic, but that the variance of the error is likely to
increase with the interval between sales.     Specifically we
assumed that the log price P of the ith house at time t is:
(1)

where C is the log of the city-wide level of housing prices at
time t, H is a Gaussian random walk (where AH has zero mean and
variance ah2) that is uncorrelated with CT and HJT for all P and

      and N is an identically distributed normal noise term
(which has zero mean and variance UN2) and is uncorrelated with

CT and HJT for all j   and T and with NJT unless i=j and t=T
      In equation (1) N11 represents the truly random component of

sales prices around true value resulting from random events in

the search process, the behavior of real estate agents and other
imperfections.   H1 represents the individual drift in house value
through time.

      These assumptions led us to a three step weighted
(generalized) least squares procedure.     The BMN procedure was

followed precisely in the first step, and the residuals were
stored. The squared residuals from the first step regression were

then used as the dependent variable in a second step with a

constant term and the time interval between sales on the right
hand side.1   The constant term is the estimate of UN2, and the

      1
        Observations in which the time interval between sales is
larger are likely to have larger errors. As a result, we used a
weighted regression that downweighted the observations
corresponding to large time intervals. As we mentioned in the
text, the regression was run separately for each quarter using
only information available in that quarter.   For earlier quarters
that meant that the coefficients were calculated with only a

                                   3
coefficient on the time variable is the estimate of a.      In the

third step, the first step was repeated after first dividing each
observation by the square root of the fitted value in the second

stage regression.

     The above procedure was used to create two log price

indexes, WRSa and WRSb.   In each city, houses were randomly

allocated to two samples, a and b, each with half the available

observations, and the price indexes were estimated separately

with these samples.   In our regression results below, WRSa was

used for left-hand (dependent) variables, and WRSb was used for

right-hand (independent) variables.   This method was adopted as a

simple expedient to prevent the same measurement error from
contaminating both sides of the equation; See Case and Shiller

[1989].

The Data
     Table 1 contains a list of the variables used in
constructing the estimate of excess returns for each metro area
and in the forecasting equations later in the paper. Most of the

variables and their sources listed in Table 1 are self

explanatory.   Two, however, deserve some discussion: RENTINDEX, a

metro area specific rent index, and MTR, a national marginal
individual income tax rate series.
     A critical component of the return to investment in owner


small number of observations. In instances where the estimated
coefficient of the interval between sales has the wrong sign, it
was set to zero, and the procedure reduces to OLS in step three.

occupied housing is the value of housing services that accrues to
owners.   This "imputed rent" is in essence the dividend component
of the return.     Since there are no transactions involved, this
component of the yield must be estimated and is problematic.

    The only measures of rent available on a consistent basis for

specific metropolitan areas is the "residential rent" component

of the Consumer Price Index produced by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.   In constructing the index, the BLS repeatedly
surveys the same units from year to year to control for quality.

A number of authors [Lowry (1982), Apgar (1987), DiPasquale and
Wheaton (1989)) have criticized the index because it ignores the
depreciation that takes place over time and thus tends to
underestimate the level of rents controlling for unit quality.
Some of the observed decline in real rents observed during the
1970's can be attributed to this downward bias.    The BLS last
year acknowledged the problem and introduced a correction into
the index beginning in 1988.    However, no changes were made in
the historical series.     Some of the authors critical of the
series have suggested increasing rents annually from 0.5 to 0.9

percent [see again Lowry (1982), Apgar (1987) and DiPasquale and
Wheaton (1989)].

     For purposes of constructing an index of returns to
homeowners, the unadjusted index that fails to adjust for
depreciation is the appropriate one.    It is reasonable to assume
that owner occupied housing depreciates physically over time at
about the same rate as rental housing with appropriate


                                  7
expenditures on maintenance and repair.    The WRS index discussed

above is based on repeat sales of the same unit. An individual
home—owner will find that the market value of the housing
services that he/she consumes declines slightly with the age of

the unit as will the market value of the unit itself. Since this
small decline is part of the net yield to owners, we do not
adjust the BLS rent index nor do we attempt to wash depreciation
out of our WRS index for purposes of estimating excess returns to

investment.

         Clearly, the decision to invest in owner occupied
housing is likely to be influenced by the tax treatment of its

yield.    This has changed in complicated ways over time. First of

all, net imputed rent has never been subject to taxation.
Second, property tax payments and mortgage interest payments have

always been deductible.    The value of a deduction, of course,

depends on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.
         The recent tax acts, specifically ERTA in 1981 and the Tax

Reform Act of 1986, have changed the tax system in fairly

dramatic ways.    The change that has had the most significant
direct effect on owner occupied housing has been the sharp
decline in marginal tax rates, particularly at the top end.
     The most significant indirect effect has come through the

dramatic changes in depreciation rules, the ITC, and changes in

passive loss rules that worked in favor of rental housing during

the early 1980's and against it in the late 1980's.



                                   8
     To calculate excess returns to investment in owner            occupied
housing, a time series on an appropriate marginal tax rate is
needed.   The marginal tax rate series used was constructed by the
researchers at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.
It was constructed by looking at the income profile of first time
home buyers and calculating the average marginal rate, given the
laws in effect in each year, for that group.           The argument for
using first time home buyers is that they can be thought of as
the "marginal" investors.      Those with higher incomes face higher
marginal rates and will earn higher excess returns.            Higher tax
rates mean a lower opportunity cost of capital and lower net
property taxes and mortgage payments.

      It is important to note that both the rent series and the
marginal tax rate series chosen will result in conservative
estimates of excess returns.

Estimating Excess Returns

    Two basic approaches were taken to estimating excess returns.
The first assumes that the home is bought outright, no
leveraging.     The second assumes the purchase is financed with an
80% mortgage.     Both are after—tax rates of return, and they
assume that neither capital gains nor imputed rent are taxed.

                      — 5 —   (l_MTR+i)*TBILLt+Il00

        The WRS index is defined above, and RENTINDEX, PTAX, MTR

and NMTG are defined in Table 1.      Of critical importance are

PRICE7O, the base period house price, and RENT7O, the base period
value for imputed rent. The derivation of PRICE7O and RENT7O is

shown in Table 2.    The baseline house price i-s assumed to be the

median value of owner occupied units from the 1970 Census.         The

figures are available separately for each of the four SMSA's.

For the Alameda County series, we used the San Francisco/Oakland

SMSA.
        Estimating baseline imputed rent was not as easy.      While

median contract rent (which excludes utility payments) is
available for each SMSA, rental units on average are smaller and

of lower quality than owner occupied units.       Thus, median rent

will understate the market value of the housing services

generated by the median owner occupied house.         A rough correction

was thus made to rent based on the number of rooms.         The Census

has data on the median number of rooms in renter occupied and

owner occupied housing units and the median rent for each city

was simply stepped up in proportion to the larger number of rooms

in owner occupied units.

Table 3 presents the figures assuming that the property was

purchased  outright (EXCESS)   Table 4 assumes that the
investment was leveraged with an SO percent mortgage at the going

     The tables confirm the conventional wisdom that housing was

the baseline imputed rent figure is at all suspect end it coul4
be halved and these series would show extraordinary excess
returns.

       As expected the highest returns are achieved in California
and   Texas during their respective price booms. The Dallas boom
occurred in 1977-19, while the California boom was longer,

starting in 1978    and running into early 1980. In both Dallas     and

Oakland,    leveraged returns of over 100 percent per year were

achieved during those years.      Home owners in Chicago and Atlanta
also did extremely well during the 1970's.

         Leveraged buyers suffered large percent losses during the
early 1980's in every city but Dallas.     Chicago had the longest
string of negative returns from 1980-1984.

         Several things can be seen in the raw numbers.    First, if
these numbers are correct, and there is no reason to believe that

they are not, it is extraordinary that excess returns of this

magnitude could persist for so long a period of time.        In one
sense, we now know a "buy rule" that will consistently earn an
extraordinary return: simply buy housing.     The puzzling question
is, why didn't housing prices     rise even further and more rapidly
during the decade?

        Second, it is apparent that there is a substantial degree of
positive serial correlation in the data.     Positive signs and
negative signs are clumped and there are clear "waves" in the
data.     Some of this is, of course, explained by the fact that
these are returns for the previous four quarters estimated with
quarterly data so that the returns periods overlap.       In our
earlier paper (Case and Shiller [1989)), however, we concluded

that positive serial correlation goes beyond what is explained by
overlapping intervals.     A substantial degree of quarter-to-
quarter noise is still present.
Estimation Procedure

        This section attempts to forecast house prices and excess
returns using a set of forecasting variables.     The tables below

                                  17
give time—series—cross—Section regression results, pooling the
four cities to reduce standard errors of the estimates.          Pooling

the data from the four cities can reduce standard errors because
it increases the number of observations in the regression and
also because it may increase the variance of independent

variables by including cross—city variance.          The estimated

coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates          =   (X'XY'X'Y
where the vector I of observations of the dependent variable

equals [11'    Y2'   13' 14']' where Y is the matrix of dependent

variables for city i, and the matrix X of observations of
independent variables equals [X1' X2' X3' X4']' where X1 is the

matrix of independent variables for city i.         These are "stacked"

ordinary—least squares regressions, effectively ordinary least

squares regressions for each city but constraining all

coefficients to be the same across cities.         The estimated

standard errors of the estimated coefficients take account of the

overlap in one-year forecasts with quarterly data using a method

of Hansen and Hodrick [1980] modified to allow time—series-cross-

section regression.        The estimated variance matrix of estimated

coefficients was (X'X1X'SX(X'X)-l and S is an estimated

covariance matrix of the error terms in the ordinary least

squares regression.        In composing S it was assumed that

cov(u1,1,u) = c1L(t1—t2) where u1 is the error term for city i at
time t and c1 equals the sample variance of the residuals,

var(Y — X/3)    if i =   j, and   equals the average covariance of
contemporaneous residuals across all pairs of cities if i does


                                       18
not equal j.     Thus two parameters were estimated to compose S.
L(t1—t2) equals 1 -    tl—t2/4   if t1—t2   <   4, and zero otherwise,
so that L(t1-t,)   is the degree of overlap between the forecast

intervals.



Results
        In discussing the results we will often refer to the

"expected" sign of a coefficient.       Of course, if markets are

efficient there is no expected sign: all coefficients should be

zero.     If, however, information tends to be incorporated with a

lag into housing prices, then the expected sign of a coefficient

may tend to be the same as the expected effect on housing value
of a change in the variable indicated.
        We first observe [Table 5] that price changes show the
positive serial correlation at short horizons and negative serial
correlation at longer horizons that has been observed for other
assets (Cutler, Poterba and Summers [1990]) and that is

consistent with notion of "excess volatility" in prices.        The

results show that if prices once go up in a given year, they tend
also to go up the next year, but by about a third as much.
Moreover, this upward movement appears partly to be• reversed in

succeeding years, although the negative coefficients are not

statistically significant.

        The R2s in Table 5 are not very high.     We sought to improve

our forecasting ability by including the other forecasting

variables, in Table 6.     Table 7 uses the forecasting variables to

is estimated mortgage payment divided by per capita personal income, time t.
Rows 5-8: CONCOST/Pb is a construction cost divided by price, time t. Since
the construction cost index is the same for all cities in the base year by
construction, it cannot be used for inter-city comparisons. Therefore, the
variable for each city appears multiplied by a dummy which is 1.00 only for
that city.  Row 9: Percentage change in employment, t-4 to t, Row 10:

T-statistics (in parentheses) take account of overlap of observations of
dependent variable and cross-section-time-series structure of data. Data
are quarterly starting in 1970, first quarter.  Data end in 1986, second
quarter for each city except San Francisco, where data end in 1986, third
quarter.

The regression reported in Column 2 included as well city dununies for
Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. (Their coefficients are not reported here.)

forecast excess returns by definition A on page 9, and Table 8

uses them to forecast excess returns by definition B on page 9.
There was only modest improvement in the R2 for the price

changes, to about a third.    The excess returns are more

forecastable since the real interest rate on the alternative

asset which is used to compute the excess return is fairly

forecastable.
     Columns 1 and 2 in Tables 6,       7, and 8 use all of our

forecasting variables as independent variables.        Columns 3 and 4

drop some of the less significant variables to achieve a simpler

forecasting relation.   Columns 5, and 6 show some extremely

simple forecasting relations.
     The forecasting variables we consider include two that are

measures of fundamental value relative to price:        rent divided by

price and construction cost divided by price.        These are

analogous to the dividend—price ratio that has been found to
forecast stock market returns (see for example Shiller [1989] and

Fama and French [1988)).     When both of these are in the

regression together (columns 1 and 2) the rent divided by price

has the "wrong" sign, possibly reflecting multicollinearity

problems.   Thus, the rent divided by price was omitted from the

regression reported in column 3.        However, rent divided by price

has a positive estimated coefficient (statistically significant
in the excess returns regressions) in regressions with it as the
only forecasting variable for price.



                                   25
     The estimated mortgage payment divided by per capita
personal income variable is supposed to be an index of
affordability, reflecting the difficulty that people face in
carrying a mortgage.    High values indicate that housing costs are
out of line with income.     Thus, we expect this variable to be
negatively correlated with subsequent price changes.     However, it
was not significant in the regressions with price change as the
dependent variable.     It has the expected negative sign in the
regressions with excess returns as dependent variable, though
perhaps just because it is an interest-rate—related variable
which is correlated with the interest rate on the alternative
asset used to compute excess returns.

     The change in employment and change in income variables had
the expected positive signs, high values of these indicators of
the strength of the economy portending price increases or high
excess returns.   But the former was never statistically
significant, the latter only marginally so.

     The change in construction cost variable was not
statistically significant.    The change in the adult population
variable had a positive sign and was often significant.    This

variable is related to one used by Mankiw and Weil [1989] to
predict housing prices in the United States.
     Changes in the marginal income tax rate facing the marginal

buyer is an important variable, but its sign in these equations
is ambiguous ex ante.    First, a decrease in marginal tax rate
actually increases the cost of owning since property taxes and

                                  26
mortgage interest payments are deductible.     But most statutory

changes in marginal personal tax rates are accompanied with other
tax provisions that may change the attractiveness of owner
occupied housing relative to other assets.     For example, the

marginal rate reductions in the 1986 Tax Reform Act were

accompanied by provisions that significantly curtailed the
ability of taxpayers to shelter income with passive losses making
home ownership one of the last commonly available "shelters."
Similarly, ERTA of 1981 contained lower marginal rates and a host
of provisions (ACRS, Safe Harbor Leasing, extension of the ITC,

etc.) that changed the relative attractiveness of other assets.
Finally, a cut in marginal rates may have an income effect; as
disposable income increases, so will the demand for housing.

     The variable   MTR has a negative coefficient and is mildly

significant in all equations.     This indicates that the impact of

marginal tax rates on the after tax cost of housing seems to be

offset by other provisions.     There is one other possible reason

for the negative sign.    The largest cut in tax rates (1981) took

place at the same moment that interest rates were at extremely

high levels (21% prime in the summer of 1981).     These very high

interest rates may have put sharp downward pressure on house
prices at exactly the same moment that ERTA was cutting marginal

rates.

    Housing starts divided by population also has also the

expected negative sign.    High housing starts represent new supply




                                  27
on line that will tend to depress prices with a lag.   However,

the housing starts variable was not significant.
