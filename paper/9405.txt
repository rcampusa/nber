                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper presents the first national estimates of the effects of the SCHIP expansions on

insurance coverage. Using CPS data on insurance coverage during the years 1996 through 2000, we

estimate two-stage least squares regressions of insurance coverage. We find that SCHIP had a small,

but statistically significant positive effect on insurance coverage. Our regression results imply that

between 4% and 10% of children meeting income eligibility standards for the new program gained

public insurance. While low, these estimates indicate that states were more successful in enrolling

children in SCHIP than they were with prior Medicaid expansions focused on children just above

the poverty line. Crowd-out of private health insurance was estimated to be in line with estimates

for the Medicaid expansions of the early 1990s, between 18% and 50%.

Introduction

        The State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was signed into law as part of

Title XXI of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. The goal of the legislation was to increase the

insurance coverage of children in the United States by extending eligibility for public insurance

to children in families earning too much to qualify for Medicaid yet too little to afford private

health insurance. Touted as the largest expansion in health insurance since the enactment of

Medicaid in 1965, the SCHIP legislation apportioned more than $40 billion in federal matching

funds over ten years beginning in fiscal year 1998. States are allowed to use these funds to

expand Medicaid eligibility, develop new insurance programs, and to increase outreach for

children already eligible for public coverage.

        The efficacy and cost of public insurance expansions depend critically on two factors:

program take-up and the possible substitution of public coverage for private coverage—i.e.,

“crowd-out”. A number of recent studies find low take-up rates for individuals who became

eligible for public insurance through the Medicaid expansions of the late 1980s and early 1990s

(Cutler and Gruber 1996; Dubay and Kenney 1997; Shore-Sheppard 1997; Yazici and Kaestner

2000; Blumberg et al. 2000; Ham and Shore-Sheppard 2001; Card and Shore-Sheppard 2001).1

Previous studies also suggest that the Medicaid expansions contributed to a decline in private

insurance, though the estimated magnitude of this effect varied considerably.

        Low take-up might be an even greater problem for SCHIP as many of the families made

eligible for the program had little prior experience with public insurance programs, and therefore

may lack good information about the program. Negative perceptions of the quality of public



        1
          Low take-up is not unique to health insurance, but is a problem with most public programs. See Remler et
al. (2001) for a recent review.



                                                        2
health insurance and stigma related to public assistance also represent potentially serious barriers

to enrollment. Evidence from the Medicaid expansions suggests that take-up falls as coverage is

extended to relatively higher income families. For example, Currie and Gruber (1996) find that

take-up was higher among women who gained eligibility from expansions that were targeted at

families in poverty than for those who gained coverage from broader expansions. Similarly,

Card and Shore-Sheppard (2001) find that expansions targeting children under the federal

poverty line (FPL) led to a 10 to 15% increase in Medicaid coverage, whereas legislation

extending eligibility to children with incomes up to 133% of the FPL had essentially no effect.

         Since private insurance coverage increases with income, crowd-out is potentially a

greater problem for SCHIP than for prior expansions of public insurance. However, in response

to research showing large crowd-out effects for Medicaid, SCHIP programs were designed with

explicit mechanisms intended to keep newly eligible families from dropping private coverage in

favor of public insurance. Thus, whether crowd-out is more or less of a problem in the case of

SCHIP as compared to the earlier Medicaid expansions is an empirical question.2

         Because the program is relatively new, research on the effects of SCHIP is quite limited.

Two recent studies present evidence on trends in insurance coverage for children in the early

years of SCHIP implementation (Zuckerman et al. 2001; Rosenbach et al. 2001). They show that

the percent insured fell slightly for children in families with incomes above 200% of FPL, while

remaining relatively constant for lower income children who were more likely to be affected by

SCHIP. Since coverage had been previously falling for children in the SCHIP target population



         2
           The anti-crowd-out provisions of SCHIP may seem to render this question moot. However, research on
legislation designed to prevent the substitution of Medicare for private insurance by workers over the age of 65
suggests that those rules were largely ineffective (Glied and Stabile 2001). Even if SCHIP were implemented in a
way to limit direct transitions from private to public insurance, crowd-out can still occur if the program inhibits
transitions from uninsurance or public insurance to private coverage.



                                                          3
(incomes between 100 and 200% of the FPL) this suggests a positive, if small, effect of the

program. Neither study attempts to calculate rates of take-up or crowd-out. Kronick and Gilmer

(2001) study the effect of four state-level programs implemented prior to SCHIP on the

insurance coverage of adults. They estimate that these programs were successful in enrolling

between 6 and 24% of the target population. Estimates of crowd-out vary across states and,

interestingly, are larger for two states (Minnesota and Tennessee) whose programs included

greater explicit protections against crowd-out. As expected, Kronick and Gilmer find greater

evidence of crowd-out for adults with incomes above the FPL as compared to those below.

       Our study is the first to estimate the effect of SCHIP eligibility on public and private

insurance coverage of children. We use 1997-2001 data from Current Population Survey (CPS)

and econometric techniques similar to those used in previous research on the Medicaid

expansions (e.g., Currie and Gruber 1996; Cutler and Gruber 1996; Ham and Shore-Sheppard

2001). Specifically, we use an instrumental variables approach that relies on variation in the

timing and extent of coverage expansions to identify the effect of SCHIP on insurance coverage.

In addition to estimating the overall effect of SCHIP eligibility on coverage by public insurance

(take-up), private insurance (crowd-out), and uninsurance, we test for differences between states

that implemented SCHIP by expanding Medicaid eligibility and those that established new stand-

alone programs.

       We find that the enactment of SCHIP led to a small, but statistically significant reduction

in the rate of uninsurance for children. The program take-up rate implied by our results is lower

than comparable estimates for the Medicaid expansions of the 1980s and 1990s as a whole,

though larger than estimates pertaining to Medicaid expansions that, like SCHIP, were targeted

at children above the poverty line. We find no statistically significant difference across types of




                                                 4
SCHIP programs. Estimation of take-up and crowd-out effects in our data are complicated by

the fact that some public health insurance plans, particularly newly created non-Medicaid

programs, could be mistaken by CPS respondents for private health insurance plans. Indeed, our

results provide evidence that is suggestive of such errors in reporting. Treating the CPS

insurance data as accurate results in small and statistically insignificant estimates of crowd-out.

In contrast, models that account for potential misreporting suggest that crowd-out represents

between one-fifth and one-half of the increase in public coverage.



The State Children’s Health Insurance Program

       Like Medicaid, SCHIP is a joint federal-state program, though SCHIP offers states more

flexibility with respect to eligibility criteria, program design, and benefits. States had three

broad options for implementing SCHIP. They could expand their Medicaid programs by either

increasing income eligibility thresholds or extending coverage to age groups that were not

eligible for Medicaid previously, create a new separate health insurance program for children, or

do both. At the time of implementation, a key argument for expanding Medicaid was that states

could build on existing infrastructure for administration, enrollment, and process of claims. The

main disadvantages of this approach were that it required conforming to existing federal rules

that some states consider burdensome as well as the effect of any negative reputation associated

with Medicaid (Hill 2000). The main argument for creating a new insurance program for

children was that doing so would allow greater flexibility to design a program that better meets

the needs of children in a particular state. However, a separate program must contend with

potentially high costs associated with start-up and outreach.




                                                  5
        Table 1 summarizes how the implementation of SCHIP and the program’s effect on

public insurance eligibility varied across states. As of March 2001, 19 states expanded

Medicaid, 15 states created a separate SCHIP program, and 17 states implemented a combination

program. There was variation across states in both the extent and timing of the increases in

eligibility. In addition, it is clear from Table 1 that states differed in their initial pre-SCHIP

eligibility criteria and that within states eligibility rules were more generous for younger

children. Prior to SCHIP, states were required to cover children 6 years of age and under up to

133% of poverty and were allowed to expand coverage up to 185% and still receive federal

matching dollars. As of 1996 several states had used their own funds to expand eligibility

beyond 185% of the FPL. Most states implemented their Title XXI SCHIP expansion programs

in 1998. States that implemented both Medicaid expansions and a separate SCHIP program were

able to start each component at different times, usually expanding Medicaid eligibility first.

Since eligibility increases were larger in states that previously had lower eligibility limits for

Medicaid, the SCHIP expansions have reduced the cross-state variation in public insurance

eligibility standards (Ullman and Hill 2001; Cunningham 2001). However, it is clear from

Table 1 that cross-state variation still exists, but within-state variation in eligibility across age

groups has been largely eliminated.

        Title XXI specifically states that any already-insured children, including those insured

under Medicaid, are not eligible to enroll in SCHIP. In order to prevent states from shifting

enrollees from Medicaid to SCHIP to take advantage of more generous Federal matching rates,

the legislation requires that children who apply for SCHIP be screened for Medicaid eligibility,

and those found to eligible can only enroll in Medicaid instead. Because of this rule, it is

possible that SCHIP “marketing” may have indirectly increased the Medicaid enrollment of




                                                   6
children who were already eligible for but not covered by that program (U.S. GAO 2000).

Because nearly 60% of children made eligible by the SCHIP expansions already had private

health insurance, there was great concern about the potential substitution of public for private

coverage. Strategies taken by states to reduce crowd-out include requirements that children must

be without insurance for some period (typically three to twelve months) prior to enrolling, the

use of sliding-scale premium contributions for families with incomes above 150% of the FPL

and subsidies to encourage parents to take-up employer-based coverage when it is available.



Data and Descriptive Evidence

       Our analysis is based on data from the March CPS for the years 1997 through 2001. The

March CPS is the most commonly used source of data on the insurance coverage of American

families. The advantages of the CPS data for our analysis include large sample sizes afforded

and the fact that there is information on insurance coverage for every year during, prior to and

subsequent to the enactment of SCHIP. In addition, the March CPS includes identifiers for all

states and data on family income, which are necessary for imputing eligibility for public health

insurance, as well as family demographic variables.

       All our data are from years after 1995, when the CPS survey was redesigned to improve

the quality of the health insurance data (Swartz 1997). However, even after this redesign, some

problems with the insurance variables are likely to remain. While the questions refer to coverage

during the prior calendar year, a number of analysts have concluded that many responses in fact

reflect coverage at the time of the interview (Swartz 1986; Berger et al. 1998). Nonetheless, we




                                                 7
treat the insurance variables as pertaining to the prior year.3 In addition, some research has

shown that the CPS undercounts the number of people enrolled in Medicaid (Lewis, et al. 1998).

        A measurement issue that is not specific to the CPS arises from the fact that the

implementation of SCHIP and the growth of Medicaid managed care have blurred the distinction

between public and private health insurance. Many state Medicaid programs contract with

commercial health plans and it is increasingly common for insurance entities that serve only

publicly insured individuals to be designed to resemble a private health plan. In addition, as

noted, some states require some enrollees to pay premiums. Because of these design features

many CPS respondents who are enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid programs may legitimately

consider themselves to have private insurance. The greater the extent of such misclassifications,

the lower will be our estimates of both take-up and crowd-out. In an attempt to mitigate this

problem, we explore two alternate dependent variables in our regressions: coverage by

employer-sponsored (group) private insurance, which should be more easily distinguished from

SCHIP programs that “look like” private plans, and private non-group insurance coverage, which

could potentially be mistaken for some states’ SCHIP expansions.4

        Table 2 displays descriptive statistics for the five years of CPS data. The first three rows

report the percentage of children determined to be eligible for public insurance (Medicaid or

stand-alone SCHIP programs) according to the eligibility standards and their family income


        3
          Starting with the 2000 March CPS, a verification question was asked of people who did not acknowledge
having any insurance coverage throughout the previous year. The verification question resulted in 8% of apparently
uninsured respondents reported that they in fact had some coverage (Nelson and Mills 2001). By including year
dummies in our regression model we will be able to control for the effect of this change.
        4
           Since March, 2000 the CPS survey questions concerning public insurance use the names of state-specific
programs rather than generic terms like Medicaid or SCHIP. While this should improve the accuracy of responses,
substantial ambiguity is likely to remain. Take the example of California. The CPS survey asks about enrollment in
Medi-Cal (as the state’s Medicaid program is called) and Healthy Families (California’s SCHIP program).
However, since both programs contract with a number of private health plans, parents could legitimately consider
their children to be enrolled in a private plan.


                                                        8
(adjusted by state appropriate income disregard rules) as reported in the CPS. The fact that

roughly one-fifth of the children with public insurance are recorded as ineligible for such

coverage indicates that there is some measurement error in our eligibility determination method.

The measurement problem is likely to be caused by the fact that eligibility is determined based

on monthly income while the CPS reports annual income. Thus, a family whose annual income

makes them appear ineligible could have experienced a period of eligibility during the year.5 As

expected, eligibility for public coverage is lowest for children with private coverage. However,

the fact that the percentage of this group who meet the income eligibility standards for Medicaid

or SCHIP is fairly high—21%—underscores the fact that the potential for crowd-out is a

significant concern.

        Several other differences across insurance categories are apparent. Relative to the

uninsured and publicly insured, children with private coverage are much more likely to be in

two-parent families, to be white, to have fewer persons in the household in fair or poor health,

and to be born in the United States. In terms of labor market variables, private coverage is

positively associated with the number of adult workers in the household and having at least one

adult who works for a large firm. The latter variable is important given the strong relationship

between firm size and employer provision of health benefits.

        Figures 1 through 4 summarize key time trends in insurance coverage and eligibility.

Figure 1 shows that, nationally, the percentage of children eligible for public insurance increased

by 12 percentage points between 1996 and 2000, from 30% to 42%. The percent without

insurance fell from 15.1% to 12% over this period. Since public coverage decreased slightly

over the period (from 21.3% to 19.9%), these data would suggest that the decline in the


        5
          Our estimate corresponds to the estimate reported by Cutler and Gruber (1996) indicating that 21% of the
children made eligible by the Medicaid expansions were already publicly insured prior to the expansions.


                                                        9
uninsurance rate was caused mainly by the increase in private coverage (from 66.4% to 70.6%),

caused perhaps by the strong economy.

       However, these aggregate figures mask important differences in trends across income

levels. Figure 2 reports data for children in families with incomes below the FPL. In 1996, over

90% were eligible for Medicaid, and by 2000 virtually 100% were eligible. Medicaid coverage

for this group actually fell between 1996 and 1998, before leveling off. The decline likely

reflects the effect of welfare reform, which was implemented over this period. After 1998,

insurance coverage increased for poor children. Since essentially all poor children were already

eligible for Medicaid over this period, this trend cannot be considered a direct effect of expanded

eligibility for public insurance. Public coverage could have increased due to a “spillover” effect

of SCHIP enrollment efforts, though such an explanation is not obvious from the figure, as the

decline in uninsurance coincides with an increase in private coverage.

       Children in families with incomes between 100 and 200% of the FPL were much more

likely to be directly impacted by SCHIP. As shown in Figure 3, public eligibility for this group

increased nearly fourfold from nearly 22% to slightly over 82%. Public insurance coverage also

increased, but by a much smaller amount: 7 percentage points, from 19% to about 26%. The rate

of uninsurance in this group fell from 22% to 16%, while private coverage fell by one percentage

point. This suggests that SCHIP was associated with an increase in public coverage with a small

degree of crowd-out.

       Figure 4 presents the corresponding trends for children in families earning between 200

and 400% of FPL, a group that was not the primary target of the SCHIP expansions and was not

directly affected in most states. Public insurance eligibility and enrollment was quite low

throughout this period, each reaching a high of roughly 8% by 2000. Private coverage fell by




                                                10
roughly the same amount that public coverage increased (2%), leaving the percent uninsured

virtually constant during the period at nearly 9%. These trends suggest that the limited growth in

public enrollment due to SCHIP came from the ranks of the privately insured.

       Of course, even when stratifying by income, it is difficult to draw precise inferences from

such aggregate figures, as they obscure large differences across states and do not control for

other factors that may have influenced insurance coverage over this period. Because there was

significant variation across states in the timing of SCHIP implementation and the extent to which

changes in income eligibility limits varied both across and within states, it is possible to identify

the effects of SCHIP on public and private coverage in the context of a multivariate regression

model that allows for long-run differences across states and national trends. The next section

describes our model.



Econometric Specification

       We use the repeated cross-section data from the CPS to estimate several versions of the

following regression model:



       COVERAGEci = αc PUBELIGi + βcXi + γcSTATEi + θcTIMEi + εci,                            (1)



where the dependent variable COVERAGEci represents the type of health insurance under which

the child is covered (c = public, private, or uninsured). The regressor of primary interest is

PUBELIG, an indicator for public insurance eligibility, which is imputed using the child’s age,

family income and the eligibility standards effective in the child’s state of residence at that time.

The vector X contains demographic variables, including the child’s gender, race, age, the number




                                                 11
of people in the family, the number of workers in the household, and the characteristics of the

household head. We include a full set of year and state dummies to account for national trends

in health insurance coverage and long-standing differences across states, such as state health

insurance regulations and state policies subsidizing healthcare for the uninsured, for example.

       As noted, the period of our analysis follows the enactment of Federal welfare reform.

Like previous legislation concerning Medicaid, the welfare reform bill included provisions to de-

link public health insurance and cash assistance. While the correlation between eligibility for the

two programs has in fact declined over the past several decades, it remains quite strong and the

decline in caseloads caused by welfare reform has contributed to a fall in Medicaid enrollment

(Ku and Garrett 2000; Kronebusch 2001; Currie and Grogger 2002). A concern for our analysis

is that our estimates of the effect of SCHIP will be confounded by the impact of the concurrent

changes in welfare caseloads. The inclusion of year dummies in our model will capture the

national average trend in caseloads. To account for additional state-year variation we also

include in our model the AFDC/TANF participation rate (i.e., number of beneficiaries divided by

population) in each state in each year.

       The two quantities in which we are interested are the marginal take-up rate and the

crowd-out effect. The marginal take-up rate is the percent of children who gain eligibility from

the SCHIP expansions, and is given by the public eligibility coefficient in a regression with

public insurance coverage as the dependent variable (αPUB). Crowd-out is commonly defined as

the decline in private insurance that can be attributed to the public program relative to the

increase in public coverage. That is:



       Crowd-Out1 = ∆Private/∆Public = αPRIV/αPUB,




                                                 12
where the numerator on the right-hand side is the coefficient on PUBELIG from the private

insurance regression and the denominator is the corresponding coefficient from the public

insurance regression. Since the change in private coverage, public coverage and uninsurance

must sum to zero, the degree of crowd-out can also be expressed as



       Crowd-Out2 = 1 – ∆Uninsured/∆Public = 1 – αUNIN/αPUB,



where the numerator of the second term comes from the regression in which the uninsured

dummy is the dependent variable. The two crowd-out measures would be equal given the

identical right-hand side variables if the insurance categories were mutually exclusive. However,

because respondents can report both private insurance and public coverage at some point during

the year the crowd-out measures will differ.

       The specification in equation (1) assumes that the effect of expanding eligibility for

public coverage on a given insurance outcome is the same for states that chose to expand

Medicaid as for those that established new stand-alone programs. Given the considerable debate

concerning the relative merits of these different approaches, it is important to test for differences

between them. This can be done by replacing PUBELIG with two variables, one that represents

eligibility for Medicaid and one pertaining to eligibility for new stand-alone programs:



       COVERAGEci = αc1MELIGi +αc2SELIGi + βcXi + γcSTATEi + γcTIMEi + vci. (2)




                                                 13
With this specification, we can then test whether expanding traditional Medicaid or creating a

new stand-alone program was more effective in reducing uninsurance and increasing coverage.

The Medicaid eligibility measure (MELIG) varies from the baseline (1996) period because more

than half of states expanded Medicaid eligibility either with or without a separate program to

insure children. Prior legislation also contributes to changes in Medicaid eligibility over this

period. For example, between 1997 and 2000 a certain number of teenagers gained eligibility as

a result of OBRA 1990, which required states to cover all poor children up to the FPL born after

September 1983. The stand-alone program eligibility measure (SELIG) is zero for all

observations prior to the implementation of states’ new insurance programs.6

        A problem with ordinary least squares estimation of these models is that public eligibility

is likely to be endogenous because unobserved factors that are correlated with eligibility are

likely to affect the demand for and availability of health insurance. One source of bias is

unmeasured local economic conditions that lead to both higher rates of public eligibility (through

an effect on income) and lower rates of private insurance coverage. This will lead to a spurious

negative correlation between public insurance eligibility and private insurance coverage. It is

also possible that poor health, or having a child who is in poor health, decreases labor supply and

income and increases the demand for public insurance. In addition, as mentioned earlier, our

eligibility variables are measured with error because income is measured imperfectly.

Regressions that do not correct for endogeneity and measurement error will yield biased

estimates of α, the coefficient for public eligibility.




        6
           Note that this approach does not rely on the ability to distinguish enrollees of Medicaid versus new
separate programs, which is difficult in survey data (Dubay and Kenney 2000). Instead we attempt to decompose
the respective effects of Medicaid versus new separate program eligibility on insurance coverage.

        To address this problem, we adopt the instrumental variables strategy used in several

previous studies to estimate the effects of earlier Medicaid expansions (Currie and Gruber 1996;

Cutler and Gruber 1996; Ham and Shore-Sheppard 2001). This approach instruments for public

eligibility using a “simulated eligibility” measure, which represents the percentage of a

nationally representative sample of children that would be eligible for public insurance in each

state in each year. Specifically, we draw a random national sample of 300 children of each age

from 0 through 18 and for each member of the random sample impute eligibility in each state-

year combination. We define our simulated eligibility measure as the mean imputed eligibility

for each state-year-age combination. This variable represents a valid instrument because its

variation is driven entirely by differences across states and years in eligibility rules. Since we

condition on year and state fixed effects, our models are identified by variation in the extent and

timing of SCHIP-related eligibility expansions.7

        It is clear from Figures 1 through 4 that the SCHIP expansions had a strong impact on the

public insurance eligibility of children in families with incomes between 100% and 200% of the

FPL (hereafter, the target group) and relatively little effect on the eligibility of poorer children,

who were for the most part already eligible for Medicaid, or higher income children, the vast

majority of whom are still not eligible for public coverage. When equations (1) and (2) are

estimated using a sample of all children, these lower and higher income children essentially

serve as control groups for those in the target group. However, to the extent that the experience

of children outside the target group do not represent good a counterfactual for children whose



        7
           As noted above, one difference between SCHIP and Medicaid is that in order to limit crowd-out, states
use prior insurance status as a factor in determining SCHIP eligibility. It is not possible to incorporate these
provisions in our empirical eligibility algorithm. Thus, the children we classify as being eligible for SCHIP are
those meeting income-related standards. Below we present rough estimates of the take-up rate measured relative to
the number of uninsured children meeting the income standards.



                                                       15
eligibility status changed as a result of SCHIP, this identification strategy is flawed. For

example, even controlling for cash welfare participation rates, welfare reform may be a

confounding factor for analyses that include children below the poverty line. Similarly, it may

be inappropriate to assume that in the absence of SCHIP the secular trends for children in the

target group would be the same as for children with much higher incomes.

       To mitigate this potential problem, in addition to estimating equations (1) and (2) using a

full sample of children, we also estimate models using data for children with family incomes in

the 100% to 200% of FPL range. In both cases, the variation in our eligibility variables is

coming mainly from children in the target group. However, when we limit the estimation sample

to this group we do not restrict the effect of state and year effects (or the effects of any other

variables) to be the same across the entire income distribution.



Regression Results

       Linear probability model results for the full sample are displayed in Table 3. The panels

correspond to three different dependent variables: indicator variables for no insurance, public

insurance and private insurance. We present results for models using a single measure of public

insurance eligibility (column 1, which corresponds to equation 1) and ones that allow the effect

of eligibility for Medicaid and stand-alone SCHIP programs to differ (column 2, corresponding

to equation 2). For the sake of brevity we do not report the coefficients on the control variables,

which conform to the results of previous studies. In addition, although not reported, in the first

stage regressions the effects of the simulated eligibility variable(s) on PUBELIG (or MELIG and

SELIG) were highly significant with coefficients ranging from .86 to .88.




                                                  16
       The coefficient for public eligibility indicates that the eligibility expansions of the late

1990s were associated with a small, but statistically significant reduction in the probability of

children being uninsured (first row, first panel). The magnitude of the coefficient estimate

implies that gaining eligibility for public insurance reduced a child’s probability of being

uninsured by 7.5 percentage points. When the dependent variable is public insurance coverage

(second panel) the coefficient on PUBELIG has the opposite sign and roughly the same

magnitude, implying that eligibility raises the probability of public coverage by 8.1 percentage

points. The results in column 2 suggest there was little difference between Medicaid expansions

and new insurance programs in terms of the effect on insurance coverage. When the outcome is

uninsurance the coefficient for new programs is slightly larger in magnitude than the coefficient

for expanded Medicaid programs (–0.079 vs. –0.068), while in the public insurance coverage

regressions the opposite is true (0.067 vs. 0.083). In both cases, however, the coefficients on

MELIG and SELIG are not significantly different from each other. When the dependent variable

is private insurance coverage (third panel) the effect of public eligibility, either pooled or

separated into Medicaid and SCHIP, is effectively zero.

       Table 4 reports the IV results for children in the SCHIP target group, those with incomes

between 100% and 200% of FPL. The results are broadly similar to those for the full sample,

though there are a few differences worth noting. As in the full sample, the coefficients on

PUBELIG in the uninsurance and public insurance regressions are opposite in sign but are nearly

identical in magnitude and significance. However, the estimated coefficients in the target group

regressions are less than half as large in magnitude as the corresponding coefficients for the full

sample: –0.035 and 0.035 compared to –0.074 and 0.081. Compared to the full sample, the

results for the target group are more suggestive of differences between the effect of Medicaid




                                                  17
expansions and new stand-alone programs. In particular, the effect of expansions on the

uninsurance rate suggests that the effect operated primarily through stand-alone programs.

However, the effect of Medicaid expansions and new stand-alone programs did not have

statistically different impacts on public insurance take-up. The finding that is most similar

across the two samples that eligibility for public insurance, whether measured with a single

variable or separate variables for each type of program, does not have a significant effect on

private insurance coverage.8

           Taken together, the results in Tables 3 and 4 would suggest that the new public

enrollment came entirely from the ranks of the uninsured—i.e., there was no crowd-out.

However, as noted, there is reason to suspect that insurance coverage is mis-measured in such a

way as to bias estimates of take-up and crowd-out. To the extent that parents of children

enrolled in SCHIP report their coverage as private insurance, increases in SCHIP eligibility will

be associated with spurious gains in private coverage, which will offset true crowd-out effects.

One way to test for this type of bias is to compare the estimated effect of public insurance

eligibility on two different types of private coverage: group coverage and non-group coverage.

The logic of this test is that although new forms of public coverage may resemble or even by

provided by private health plans, there should be less ambiguity as to whether or not the

coverage is provided through the workplace. Thus, to the extent that SCHIP did crowd out

private coverage but this effect was obscured by parents reporting SCHIP coverage as private,

we would expect to see a positive effect of eligibility on non-group private insurance and a

negative effect on group coverage.



           8
               Our results are robust to the inclusion of state-time interaction effects, though we do not present these
results.



                                                               18
       This is exactly what we observe. Table 5 presents results for non-group private coverage

and group coverage. For both the full sample (columns 1 and 2) and the target group subsample

(columns 3 and 4), eligibility for public insurance has a positive and statistically significant

effect on non-group private coverage. Because there is no reason why being made eligible for

public insurance should increase the probability a child has non-group private insurance, we

interpret this result as reflecting an increase in (misreported) public coverage. Indeed, because

SCHIP is a less expensive substitute for private non-group coverage, the true impact of SCHIP

on private non-group should be less than or equal to zero. Our models imply that,

conservatively, there was an additional 2 percentage point increase in public enrollment

associated with the SCHIP expansions on top of that captured by the measured change in public

coverage.

       When the dependent variable is group insurance, the coefficients on the public eligibility

variables are all negative. In the full sample, the estimated coefficient on PUBELIG is –.019,

with a t-statistic = 1.35. The coefficients on MELIG and SELIG have comparable magnitudes

and p-values. When we limit the sample to children in the target group, the coefficients are

slightly larger and achieve conventional levels of significance. These models imply that being

made eligible for public insurance reduces the probability that a child is covered by group

insurance by between 2 and 3 percentage points.

       These measurement problems make it difficult to precisely calculate the take-up rate or

the crowd-out effect. Nonetheless, under certain assumptions we can construct several measures

of take-up and crowd-out associated with the SCHIP expansions and the associated changes in

the number of children with particular coverage types. Table 6 displays these estimates. The

estimates in the first panel correspond to the regression results reported in Tables 3 and 4, and




                                                 19
are based on the assumption that insurance coverage is measured accurately in the March CPS.

Using our public eligibility variable, we estimate that 12.7 million children were made income-

eligible for public insurance because of the SCHIP expansions. Thus, the 8.1% take-up rate

estimated for the full sample implies that just over 1 million children gained public insurance

coverage because of SCHIP. When we use the results from the target group subsample, the

lower take-up rate means that the estimated number of children gaining coverage is less than half

as large. These figures are low relative to the 20 to 24% marginal take-up rates for the Medicaid

expansions estimated by Shore-Sheppard (1997) and Cutler and Gruber (1996), and closer to the

range of estimates provided by Ham and Shore-Sheppard (2001). However, our estimates are

larger than the zero take-up found by Card and Shore-Sheppard (2002) for expansions targeted at

a population that is similar to the SCHIP population.

       Of course, because SCHIP eligibility was also tied to prior insurance coverage, not all

children meeting the program’s income eligibility standards were truly eligible. Thus, these

take-up rates are somewhat misleading as they overestimate the number of children foregoing

public coverage for which they qualify. While it is not feasible with the CPS data to incorporate

the insurance-related eligibility standards in our regression models, we can calculate a rough

estimate of take-up among children meeting all eligibility requirements. This is done by

removing from the denominator in the take-up calculation children meeting the SCHIP income

eligibility standard who had private insurance in 1996. This adjustment yields take-up rates that

are closer to those of Cutler and Gruber (1996) and Shore-Sheppard (1997). Dividing the

increase in public enrollment of 1.03 million by the estimated 3.1 million uninsured children who

gained SCHIP eligibility produces a hypothetical take-up rate of roughly 33%. Using the lower

estimated enrollment increase from the target group regressions yields a take-up rate of 14%.




                                                20
        When we treat the insurance variables as accurate, the point estimates for the share of

new public enrollment accounted for by children who previously had private insurance ranges

from 0% to 20%, depending on the estimation sample and whether the ratio is calculated using

the uninsured or privately insured regression results. The largest of these estimates corresponds

to a total of 76,000 children.

        In the second panel of Table 6 we adjust the take-up and crowd-out estimates for the

possibility that the increase in non-group private insurance associated with the SCHIP eligibility

expansions actually represents an increase in public coverage. To calculate an adjusted take-up

rate among the income eligible we sum the effect of public eligibility on public coverage with

the estimated effect on non-group. The latter effect is roughly 2 to 3 percentage points, yielding

adjusted take-up rates of 5 to 10%, depending on the sample used. The higher of these two

estimates corresponds to a total of roughly 1.3 million children. Our adjusted measure of crowd-

out is based on the estimated effect of public eligibility on employer-sponsored group coverage.

When we incorporate the coefficients reported in Table 4, we obtain crowd-out estimates of

between 18 and 50%.9 This is similar to the range of the estimates found by Shore-Sheppard

(1997) and the largest of our point estimates is similar to Cutler and Gruber’s (1996) estimate.

In the full sample, the crowd-out estimates correspond to a range of 241,000 to 381,000 children

who enrolled in public insurance who otherwise would have been enrolled in private insurance in

the absence of the SCHIP expansions.




        9
           These measures assume that true non-group coverage was not affected by SCHIP. If in fact some families
substituted SCHIP coverage for non-group insurance, our adjusted take-up and crowd-out estimates will be
understated.



                                                       21
Discussion

       This paper presents the first national estimates of the effects of the SCHIP expansions on

insurance coverage. Several key findings emerge from our analysis. First, we find that SCHIP

had a small, but statistically significant positive effect on insurance coverage. Our regression

results imply that between 4% and 10% of children meeting income eligibility standards for the

new program enrolled in public insurance. Take-up rates calculated for children who were both

income-eligible and previously uninsured are considerably higher and are in line with estimated

take-up rates for the Medicaid expansions of the 1980s and early 1990s. These adjusted take-up

rates are probably too large, as they implicitly assume that all the new SCHIP enrollment came

from the ranks of the uninsured, which our crowd-out results suggest was not the case.

Nonetheless, even our lower estimates based only on income eligibility rules indicate that states

were more successful in enrolling children in SCHIP than they were with prior Medicaid

expansions focused on children just above the poverty line.

       One possible explanation for SCHIP’s greater success relative to earlier Medicaid

expansions is that newly established SCHIP expansion programs were viewed more favorably by

low income families than Medicaid. However, when we distinguish between states that

implemented SCHIP by expanding Medicaid and those that started new programs, we find little

support for this argument. Our point estimates indicate that eligibility for stand-alone SCHIP

programs has a slightly more negative effect on the probability of being uninsured, but the

differences between the two types of programs are not statistically significant. An alternative

explanation is that as states enacted SCHIP they devoted considerable resources to outreach and

marketing, and streamlined many enrollment procedures (US GAO, 2000). It is not possible

with our data to assess the impact of these efforts or to compare the strategies taken by different




                                                 22
states. A recent study by Aizer (2002) finds that outreach through community-based

organizations and a television advertising campaign increased Medicaid take-up in California.

More research in this area would be valuable.

       One factor limiting SCHIP enrollment is the various policies that were enacted to prevent

crowd-out, such as waiting periods and premium contributions. It is perhaps surprising that

despite these policies, our results indicate that perhaps as much as half of the new SCHIP

enrollment was offset by declining private coverage. There are several, overlapping explanations

for this apparently counterintuitive result. First, it is important to understand that crowd-out, as

measured in the repeated cross-section data we use, does not consist entirely of direct transitions

from private to public coverage. Crowd-out can also be said to occur if the availability of SCHIP

reduces the number of transitions in the other direction (i.e., children going off Medicaid as their

family income increases), or reduces transitions from being uninsured to having private

coverage. In addition, there is some evidence that state concerns regarding the initially low

enrollment levels in SCHIP outweighed crowd-out concerns, in some cases resulting in states

weakening their crowd-out controls (Lutzky and Hill 2001). The tension between achieving high

rates of take-up for public insurance programs and limiting the substitution of public for private

coverage remains an important policy issue and comparisons of alternative strategies for

balancing these objectives is an important topic for future research.

       Finally, our results point to a serious data problem facing researchers in this area. State

efforts to make public insurance programs more attractive to eligible families and increased

contracting with private health plans has blurred the line between public and private health

insurance. The finding of a positive relationship between SCHIP eligibility and private non-

group coverage suggests that some CPS respondents whose children are insured through SCHIP




                                                 23
report that coverage as private insurance. This ambiguity in distinguishing private and public

coverage makes it difficult to use these data to track changes in type of insurance and to

accurately estimate rates of take-up and crowd-out.

a
  Hypothetical calculation assuming that the increase in public enrollment came from children who were uninsured.
b
  Crowd out is computed two alternative ways: once as the ratio of the decrease in private coverage to the increase in
public coverage, and again as the portion of the increase in public coverage not accounted for by the decrease in
uninsurance.
c
  Take-up calculations assume the increase in non-group coverage associated with SCHIP expansions represent
public enrollment; group insurance coverage is used as the basis for crowd-out calculations.
