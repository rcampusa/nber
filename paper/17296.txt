We present a model for the equilibrium movement of capital between asset markets that are distinguished
only by the levels of capital invested in each. Investment in that market with the greatest amount of
capital earns the lowest risk premium. Intermediaries optimally trade off the costs of intermediation
against fees that depend on the gain they can offer to investors for moving their capital to the market
with the higher mean return. Those fees also depend on the bargaining power of the investor, in light
of potential alternative intermediaries. In equilibrium, the speeds of adjustment of mean returns and
of capital between the two markets are increasing in the degree to which capital is imbalanced between
the two markets.

1       Introduction
We present a model for the equilibrium movement of capital between markets. Equi-
librium conditional mean rates of return vary across markets according to the levels of
capital invested in the respective markets. As a matter of supply and demand within each
market, that market with the greater amount of capital earns lower conditional mean re-
turns. Given a suÔ¨Écient disparity in the capital levels in the markets, intermediaries Ô¨Ånd
it optimal to search for investors in the market with ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù capital and oÔ¨Äer them the
opportunity to move their capital to the other market, which oÔ¨Äers higher risk premia.
Intermediaries charge investors a fee that is based on their gain from the move and based
on the degree of competition in the market for intermediation. The equilibrium behavior
of intermediaries is solved analytically, and characterized. Competition among intermedi-
aries can in some cases reduce intermediation in equilibrium, relative to the monopolistic
case.
    This paper is motivated by empirical evidence, some of which is reviewed in the last
section, that supply or demand shocks in asset markets, in addition to causing an im-
mediate price response, also lead to adjustments over time in the distribution of capital
across markets and adjustments over time in relative conditional mean asset returns, in
a way that reÔ¨Çects delays in the adjustments of investors‚Äô portfolios. We are particu-
larly interested in how those adjustments are aÔ¨Äected by the endogenous behavior of
intermediaries.
    In our equilibrium model, the greater the relative diÔ¨Äerence in capital levels across the
markets, the more intensive are intermediaries‚Äô eÔ¨Äorts to re-balance the distribution of
capital across the markers, and the greater is the rate of convergence of the mean rates of
return of diÔ¨Äerent assets toward a common level. We study the impact on capital mobility
of search costs, discounting, asset volatility, and other parameters.
    An example is the limited mobility of capital into reinsurance markets, documented
by Froot and O‚ÄôConnell (1999), who write: ‚ÄúOur results suggest that capital market
imperfections are more important than shifts in actuarial valuation for understanding
catastrophe reinsurance pricing. Supply, rather than demand, shifts seem to explain
most features of the market in the aftermath of a loss.‚Äù In subsequent work, Froot
(2001) continues: ‚ÄúWe . . . Ô¨Ånd the most compelling (evidence) to be supply restrictions
associated with capital market imperfections and market power exerted by traditional

                                              2
reinsurers.‚Äù
   We are particularly interested in the impact of competition among intermediaries on
the equilibrium degree of capital mobility, through two channels. First, an intermediary
does not internalize the entire impact of its search activity on leveling the distribution
of capital across markets because each intermediary gets only a fraction of aggregate
intermediation fees. This prompts intermediaries to search more as the number of inter-
mediaries increases, all else equal. Competition among intermediaries has a second and
potentially oÔ¨Äsetting eÔ¨Äect on capital mobility through the impact of fee bargaining on
incentives to intermediate. In the simplest setting that we analyze, the second eÔ¨Äect can
in dominate, so that in some cases increasing the number of intermediaries reduces capital
mobility.
   A signiÔ¨Åcant body of theory examines the implications of search frictions for asset
pricing. For example, diÔ¨Äerences in search frictions across diÔ¨Äerent asset markets are
treated by Weill (2008) and Vayanos and Wang (2007). DuÔ¨Ée, GaÃÇrleanu, and Pedersen
(2005) study the implications of search frictions in a single asset market with market
making. In the context of a single asset market, DuÔ¨Ée, GaÃÇrleanu, and Pedersen (2007)
and Lagos, Rocheteau, and Weil (2008) model recoveries in mean returns after a shock
to the preferences of investors, corresponding to a gradual re-allocation of the asset to
more suitable investors, rather than by cross-market capital dynamics as here. Earlier
search-based models of intermediation include those of Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1987),
Bhattacharya and Hagerty (1987), Moresi (1991), Gehrig (1993), and YavasÃß (1996).
   Related work on the implications of capital market frictions for asset pricing dynamics
includes the models of Basak and Croitoru (2000) and He and Krishnamurthy (2007). In
terms of some objectives and model features, independent work by Gromb and Vayanos
(2009) is closely related to ours. Common to our models, local hedgers are immobile,
while arbitrageurs can work across markets, driving returns toward fundamental levels,
subject to frictions that prevent them from perfectly equating returns in the two markets.
Our respective approaches, however, are quite diÔ¨Äerent. We focus on the dynamics of
intermediation, capital movements, and risk premia.
   Section 2 describes the market setting. Sections 3 and 4 analyze the monopolistic and
oligopolistic intermediation cases, respectively. Section 5 summarizes the implications of
our model for asset-price dynamics and provides some evidence regarding the premise


                                            3
         or implications of our model. Proofs and several extensions of the model are found in
         Appendices. Appendices F through K are located in DuÔ¨Ée and Strulovici (2011), a
         supplement to this paper.



         2      The Market Setting
         This section presents a stylized model for the endogenous adjustment of capital and risk
         premia across markets. There are three types of agents: (i) local hedgers; (ii) investors
         who provide risk-bearing to hedgers in each of two local markets; and (iii) intermediaries
         (such as asset managers) who provide the fee-based service to investors of moving capital
         from the ‚Äúover-capitalized‚Äù market to that market with less capital, thereby allowing
         them to earn a higher premium for the same risk.
             We Ô¨Åx a probability space (Œ©, ‚Ñ± , ùëÉ ) and a common information Ô¨Åltration {‚Ñ±ùë° : ùë° ‚â• 0}
         satisfying the usual conditions.1
             In each of two Ô¨Ånancial markets, labeled ùëé and ùëè, a continuum (a non-atomic measure
         space) of local risk-averse agents own short-lived risky assets that they are willing to
         sell at or above their respective reservation prices. Equivalently, they are willing to buy
         insurance contracts against the risks to which they are exposed. These ‚Äúhedgers‚Äù are not
         mobile across markets. They can be viewed in this respect as relatively unsophisticated
         in the use of cross-capital-market transactions, or as having high transactions costs for
         trading outside of their local markets. A continuum of investors that supply capital have
         access to cross-market trading, subject to intermediation frictions to be described. These
         suppliers of capital are risk-neutral, oÔ¨Äering to bear the risk that hedgers desire to shed
         in return for any strictly positive risk premium. In an insurance context, one might think
         of these suppliers of capital as stylized versions of the ‚ÄúNames‚Äù that supply risk bearing
         capacity to the insurance market known as ‚ÄúLloyd‚Äôs of London.‚Äù
             The total levels of capital available in the two markets at time ùë° are ùëãùëéùë° and ùëãùëèùë° ,
         respectively. Capital can be reinvested continually at the discretion of each investor, that
         is, ‚Äúrolled over‚Äù in the short-lived assets that are continually made available for sale by
         hedgers. Each unit of capital that is currently invested in market ùëñ at time ùë° is paid cash
   1
       See, for example, Protter (2004) for the usual conditions and for other standard properties of stochastic processes
to which we refer.



                                                             4
at the equilibrium dividend rate ùúã(ùëãùëñùë° ), where ùúã( ‚ãÖ ) is a strictly decreasing continuous
function. The dividend rate ùúã(ùëãùëñùë° ) is continually reset in double auctions at which the
supply and demand for the asset in market ùëñ are matched at each point in time. As the
amount of capital available to invest in the asset is increased, the market-clearing dividend
rate declines. In Appendix F, we provide an example in which ùúã(ùë•) is the equilibrium
insurance premium in a market with ùë• units of insurance capital.
   In return for the dividend rate ùúã(ùëãùëñùë° ), the provider of each unit of capital in market
ùëñ agrees to absorb losses of capital in proportion to the increments of a LeÃÅvy process ùúåùëñ .
(That is, ùúåùëñ has independently and identically distributed increments over non-overlapping
time periods of the same length. Examples include Brownian motions, Poisson processes,
compound Poisson processes, and linear combinations of these.) The idea is that the short-
lived risky asset promises 1 + ùëëùúåùëñùë° + ùúã(ùëãùëñùë° ) ùëëùë° at time ùë° + ùëëùë° per unit of capital invested at
time ùë°, in the instantaneous sense. More precisely, each unit of capital invested in market ùëñ
at any time ùë†, and rolled over continually in that market until some time ùúè > ùë° accumulates
to ùëäùúè units of capital according to the stochastic diÔ¨Äerential equation ùëëùëäùë° = ùëäùë°‚àí ùëëùúåùëñùë° ,
and in the meantime generates cash Ô¨Çows at the rate ùëäùë°‚àí ùúã(ùëãùëñùë° ). (The notation ‚Äúùëäùë°‚àí ‚Äù
means the left limit of the path of ùëä at time ùë°, that is, the level just before any jump at
time ùë°.)
   In the illustrative case of an insurance market, we can take ùúåùëñ to be a compound
Poisson process that jumps down at the arrival times of loss events, and is otherwise
constant. In this case, one unit of capital invested at time ùë° pays the supplier of capital
1 + ùúã(ùëãùëñùë° ) ùëëùë° at time ùë° + ùëëùë° (in the above instantaneous sense) if there is no loss event,
and if there is a loss event, has a recovery value of 1 + Œîùúåùëñùë° , where Œîùúåùëñùë° is the jump size.
The jumps of ùúåùëñ are bounded below by ‚àí1, preserving limited liability. If the loss events
have mean arrival rate ùúÇ and a loss-size distribution ùúà with mean ùúà, then the mean loss
rate is ùúÇùúà. The risk-neutral investors therefore optimally supply all of their local capital
inelastically so long as the mean rate of return ùúã(ùë•) ‚àí ùúÇùúà is strictly larger than their time
preference rate ùëü. This necessary condition on an equilibrium cash payout function ùúã( ‚ãÖ )
is satisÔ¨Åed in the cases that we examine, as indicated in Appendix A.
   As with typical asset-management contracts used by private-equity partnerships, cash
payouts are not re-invested into the capital pool. For us, this assumption is merely a
modeling convenience.


                                              5
   We assume that ùúåùëé = ùúñùëé + ùúñùëê and ùúåùëè = ùúñùëè + ùúñùëê , where the market-speciÔ¨Åc processes ùúñùëé
and ùúñùëè as well as the common component ùúñùëê are independent LeÃÅvy processes. We assume
that ùúñùëé and ùúñùëè have the same distribution, so that the two markets have identically and
symmetrically distributed risks. This symmetry simpliÔ¨Åes the calculation of an equilib-
rium and has the further illustrative advantage that any diÔ¨Äerences in the conditional
expected returns in the two markets are due solely to diÔ¨Äerences in the capital levels of
the markets. We brieÔ¨Çy discuss the asymmetric case in Section 5.
   If there were no capital-market frictions, investors would instantly move capital be-
tween the markets so as to obtain the higher dividend rate, and in doing so would equate
the dividend rates ùúã(ùëãùëéùë° ) and ùúã(ùëãùëèùë° ), and thereby equate ùëãùëéùë° and ùëãùëèùë° at all times. In-
deed, given the symmetrically distributed returns of the two markets, investors would do
so even if they were risk-averse, provided that they have no other hedging motives.
   Frictions in the movement of capital may, however, lead to unequal levels of capital
in the two markets. If, for example, ùëãùëéùë° < ùëãùëèùë° , then the conditional excess mean rate of
return of the risky asset in market ùëé exceeds that in market ùëè by ùúã(ùëãùëéùë° ) ‚àí ùúã(ùëãùëèùë° ), despite
the identical idiosyncratic and systematic risks of the two assets. Whichever market has
‚Äútoo much capital‚Äù receives the lower risk premium.
   An investor chooses how to deploy re-invested capital between the two markets, subject
to the available trading technology. Letting ùê∂ùë° denote the net cumulative amount of
capital moved by a particular investor from market ùëé into market ùëè through time ùë°, this
investor‚Äôs capital levels, ùëäùëéùë°ùê∂ in market ùëé and ùëäùëèùë°ùê∂ in market ùëè, thus satisfy

                                 ùëëùëäùëéùë°ùê∂ = ùëäùëéùë°‚àí
                                          ùê∂
                                              ùëëùúåùëéùë° ‚àí ùëëùê∂ùë°

and
                                 ùëëùëäùëèùë°ùê∂ = ùëäùëèùë°‚àí
                                          ùê∂
                                              ùëëùúåùëèùë° + ùëëùê∂ùë° .

   Capital can be moved only when in contact with an intermediary, as will be explained.
A model for a proportional intermediation-fee process ùêæ will be determined in equilib-
rium. An investor is inÔ¨Ånitely-lived, and thus has a utility of
                 (‚à´ ‚àû                                                     )

                     0

where ‚à£ùê∂‚à£ùë° denotes the total variation of ùê∂ up to time ùë°. A minor alteration of the model



                                             6
         that allows for randomly timed exit and entrance of investors would be equally tractable.2
         For simplicity, we have assumed that transactions costs are paid directly by investors, and
         not deducted from the capital moved from market to market.
             Because there is a continuum of investors, each takes as given the total capital processes
         ùëãùëé and ùëãùëè of the respective markets.
             Intermediaries contact investors in order to proÔ¨Åt from fees for moving their capital
         from one market to another. In equilibrium, at any time, only investors in that market
         with greater capital agree to have any of their capital moved to the other market. Because
         an investor has linear preferences, it is optimal when contacted to move either no capital
         or to move all capital to the other market.3
             We let ùëäùëñùëó (ùë°) denote the level of capital in market ùëñ of investor ùëó at time ùë°. Condi-
         tional on the intensity process ùúÜ for contacts of investors by intermediaries, investors are
         contacted pairwise independently4 at the conditional mean rate ùúÜùë° . In a manner similar
         to that of Weill (2007), the exact law of large numbers allows us to calculate the aggregate
         rate of movement of capital. Letting ùëö( ‚ãÖ ) denote the non-atomic measure over the space
         of investors, the total rate at which capital is moved from market ùëé to market ùëè is almost
         surely5
                         ‚à´                                                       ‚à´
                             ùúÜùë° 1{ùëãùëéùë° > ùëãùëèùë° } ùëäùëéùëó (ùë°) ùëëùëö(ùëó) = ùúÜùë° 1{ùëãùëéùë° > ùëãùëèùë° }       ùëäùëéùëó (ùë°) ùëëùëö(ùëó)
                                                            = ùúÜùë° 1{ùëãùëéùë° > ùëãùëèùë° } ùëãùëéùë° .
   2
       For this, investors would exit at exponentially distributed times that are pairwise independent, and consume their
capital at exit. New investors would appear in proportion to the current levels of capital. Any diÔ¨Äerence between exit
and entrance rates would thus be subtracted from the proportional drifts of the capital accumulation processes ùëãùëé
and ùëãùëè .
   3
     If he or she has any capital in the market with more total capital, then all of this investor‚Äôs capital will be moved,
provided the proportional transaction-costs process ùêæ is not too large, and this is the case in any equilibrium for our
model, as we shall see once the model is completely speciÔ¨Åed. Thus, although we allow that a given supplier of capital
may initially have non-zero capital in both markets, all of his or her invested capital will optimally be held in just one
of the two markets at any time after the Ô¨Årst time of contact with an intermediary.
    4
      That is, conditional on the path {ùúÜùë° : ùë° ‚â• 0} of the intermediation intensity process, the times of contacts of any
distinct pair of investors, ùëñ and ùëó, are the event times of independent Poisson processes ùëÅùëñ and ùëÅùëó with the common
time-varying intensity process ùúÜ.
   5
     Sun (2006) shows that the probability space, the agent space, and the measurable subsets of their product can
be constructed so as to satisfy the exact law of large numbers. With this, the total quantity of contacts of agents by
                               ‚à´             ‚à´ùë°
intermediaries up to time ùë° is ùëÅùëñùë° ùëëùëö(ùëñ) = 0 ùúÜùë† ùëëùë† almost surely.



                                                             7
         Likewise, the rate at which capital moves from market ùëè to market ùëé is ùúÜùë° 1{ùëãùëèùë° > ùëãùëéùë° } ùëãùëèùë° .
             Our model can be generalized by supposing that each investor also has a personal
         technology by which opportunities to move capital to the other market arrive at random
         times, independent across investors, with a constant mean arrival rate. This would cause
         only minor modiÔ¨Åcations to the structure and solution of our model. We avoid it for
         simplicity. Increasing the mean arrival rates of these alternative capital-shifting opportu-
         nities reduces the average degree of imbalance of capital and the diÔ¨Äerence in risk premia
         between the two markets, and thus reduces the proÔ¨Åtability of intermediation. In Section
         5, we review some evidence of inattention by investors that presents an opportunity for
         proÔ¨Åtable contacts by intermediaries.
             An intermediary‚Äôs rate of cost for applying contact intensity ùúÜùë° is ùëêùúÜùë° , for some techno-
         logical cost coeÔ¨Écient ùëê ‚â• 0. For example, doubling the expected rate at which investors
         are contacted costs the intermediary twice as much.6 The maximum feasible contact
         intensity of the market is some constant ùúÜ > 0.



         3      The Monopolistic Case
         We begin with the case of a monopolistic intermediary. We restrict attention to the
         illustrative example of an insurance market in which each loss event aÔ¨Äects only one of the
         two markets and results in a total loss of capital (ùúà = 1). Appendices treat more general
         cases, including partial recovery, loss events that can aÔ¨Äect both markets simultaneously,
         as well as proportional losses and gains that are based on Brownian motion.


         3.1      Equilibrium
         We will deÔ¨Åne and characterize equilibria in which the intermediation intensity is of the
         symmetric Markov form ùúÜùë° = Œõ(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ), for some measurable policy function Œõ : ‚Ñù2+ ‚Üí
         [0, ùúÜ], where

                                                ùëãùë° = max(ùëãùëéùë° , ùëãùëèùë° )
                                                 ùëåùë° = min(ùëãùëéùë° , ùëãùëèùë° ).
   6
       This can be viewed as a contact technology in which the intermediary adjusts a ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù intensity, for example
adjusting the rate of purchase of advertisements or other forms of market-wide intermediation eÔ¨Äorts. This diÔ¨Äers
from a model in which, for example, contacting twice as many individuals at a given intensity costs twice as much.

                                                            8
The monopolistic intermediation fee is assumed to be a fraction ùëû of the gain in present
value to an investor associated with redeploying the investor‚Äôs capital from the over-
capitalized market, that with ùëãùë° , to the undercapitalized market. This fraction is endo-
genized in Section 4 for the case of multiple intermediaries. The continuation value of
an investor per unit of capital in the market with excess capital can be represented as
ùê∫(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ), for some ùê∫ : ‚Ñù2+ ‚Üí [0, ‚àû), and likewise for the present value ùêª(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) of each
unit of capital in the under-capitalized market.
   These values, deÔ¨Åned from primitive stochastic processes in Appendix A, include the
eÔ¨Äects of future movements of capital to a market that is under-capitalized and, once
that market becomes over-capitalized, back to the other market, and so on, net of fees.
Assuming diÔ¨Äerentiability, which we will verify in equilibrium, ItoÃÇ‚Äôs formula implies that
ùê∫ and ùêª are characterized as solutions to the coupled equations

ùëüùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùúã(ùë•) ‚àí ùê∫ùë• (ùë•, ùë¶)ùë•Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶) + ùê∫ùë¶ (ùë•, ùë¶)ùë•Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶)
                + (1 ‚àí ùëû)Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶)(ùêª(ùë•, ùë¶) ‚àí ùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶)) ‚àí ùúÇùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶) + ùúÇ(ùê∫(ùë•, 0) ‚àí ùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶)) (1)


ùëüùêª(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùúã(ùë¶) ‚àí ùêªùë• (ùë•, ùë¶)ùë•Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶) + ùêªùë¶ (ùë•, ùë¶)ùë•Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶)
                  + ùúÇ(ùê∫(ùë¶, 0) ‚àí ùêª(ùë•, ùë¶)) ‚àí ùúÇùêª(ùë•, ùë¶),                                      (2)

where subscripts denote partial derivatives. The Ô¨Årst of these equations states that, in
the over-capitalized market, the rate of loss in value due to time preference, ùëüùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶), is
equal to the total expected rate of net proÔ¨Åt to investment in that market. That rate of
expected proÔ¨Åt includes, Ô¨Årst of all, the dividend payout rate ùúã(ùë•). The next two terms
are the rates of change of ùê∫(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) due to intermediated Ô¨Çows of capital out of the over-
capitalized market and into the under-capitalized market, respectively. The following term
is the expected rate of gain (1 ‚àí ùëû)Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶)(ùêª(ùë•, ùë¶) ‚àí ùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶)), net of intermediation fees,
associated with the chance to switch to the higher-premium under-capitalized market.
The Ô¨Ånal two terms reÔ¨Çect the expected rate of impact of loss events. As the basic
version of the model assumes no recovery value at these events, ùúÇùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶) is the expected
loss in value due to the occurrence of these loss events in the investor‚Äôs market. The Ô¨Ånal
term ùúÇ(ùê∫(ùë•, 0) ‚àí ùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶)) is the expected gain to the investor associated with a loss event
in the other market. The second equation, for the total rate of investment return while
in the undercapitalized market, is similarly explained.

                                              9
    Fixing an intermediation policy Œõ, the gain in present value per unit of redeployed
capital at time ùë°, before the associated fee, is

                                  ùêπ Œõ (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) = ùêª(ùëãùë° , ùëå ) ‚àí ùê∫(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ).

Thus, at bargaining power ùëû, the intermediary‚Äôs fee per unit of redeployed capital is
ùëûùêπ Œõ (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ).
    If forced to accept the fees associated with a conjectured intermediation policy Œì, a
monopolistic intermediary‚Äôs optimal value for beginning with capital levels ùë• and ùë¶ in the
respective markets is
                                         (‚à´          ‚àû                                            )
                                                         ‚àíùëüùë°                   Œì
                   ùëâ (ùë•, ùë¶) = sup ùê∏                      ùëí     Œõ(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë°)(ùëãùë° ùëûùêπ (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) ‚àí ùëê) ùëëùë° .   (3)
                              Œõ                  0

If a policy Œõ that solves this problem is the same as conjectured policy Œì, then we say
that Œõ is an equilibrium. Thus, in equilibrium, fees are based on consistent conjectures
by investors of the monopolist‚Äôs future intermediation intensity process.
    We assume, and later verify, that the intermediary‚Äôs equilibrium initial value ùëâ (ùë•, ùë¶) is
Ô¨Ånite and diÔ¨Äerentiable. The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, when
fees are determined by a conjectured intermediation policy Œì, is

                            0 = sup                  {‚àíùëüùëâ (ùë•, ùë¶) + ùí∞(ùëâ, ùë•, ùë¶, ‚Ñì, Œì)},                  (4)
                                   ‚Ñì ‚àà [0, ùúÜ ]


where, by ItoÃÇ‚Äôs formula,

ùí∞(ùëâ, ùë•, ùë¶, ‚Ñì, Œì) = ‚àíùëâùë• (ùë•, ùë¶)‚Ñìùë•+ùëâùë¶ (ùë•, ùë¶)‚Ñìùë•+ ùúÇ[ùëâ (ùë¶, 0)+ùëâ (ùë•, 0)‚àí2ùëâ (ùë•, ùë¶)]+‚Ñì(ùë•ùëûùêπ Œì(ùë•, ùë¶)‚àíùëê).




Proposition 1 (HJB Equation) Given an assumed intermediation policy Œì, suppose
that ùëâÀÜ is a bounded diÔ¨Äerentiable function satisfying the HJB equation (4). Then ùëâÀÜ is
the value function ùëâ of the optimization problem (3) and any measurable policy (ùë•, ùë¶) 7‚Üí
Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶) which, for each (ùë•, ùë¶), attains the supremum (4) is an optimal policy.


The proof given in Appendix A.2 is by a traditional martingale veriÔ¨Åcation argument.




                                                                 10
             From the HJB equation, it is optimal for a monopolistic intermediary to search at
         maximal intensity for opportunities to move capital whenever it is strictly beneÔ¨Åcial to
         search at all, and this is precisely when

                                                                                       ùëê
                                 ùëûùêπ Œõ (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) ‚àí [ùëâùë• (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) ‚àí ùëâùë¶ (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° )] >      .                    (5)
                                                                                       ùëãùë°
         The left-hand side is the fee per unit of capital moved, net of the associated marginal
         loss in present value of future intermediation fees. This loss in future fees is caused by
         the associated reduction in heterogeneity of capital levels across the two markets, which
         always lowers the gain to investors of shifting their capital. The right-hand side of (5) is
         the cost of search per unit of capital that can be attracted.
             In order to obtain the simpliÔ¨Åcation associated with homogeneity,7 we suppose that
         the inverse demand function ùúã( ‚ãÖ ) is of the form ùëò0 + ùëò/ùë• for positive constants ùëò0 and
         ùëò. As explained in the insurance setting of Appendix F, this can be arranged by suitable
         assumptions on the cross-sectional distribution of hedgers‚Äô aversions to loss risk. Capital is
         therefore optimally reinvested locally, absent an opportunity to move capital to a diÔ¨Äerent
         market, so long as the mean rate of return to investment exceeds the discount rate. This
         is always the case if ùëò0 > ùëü + ùúÇ, which we assume throughout. Because the constant ùëò0
         is common to the two markets, however, it has no eÔ¨Äect on beneÔ¨Åts to switching capital
         and the analysis proceeds without loss of generality by ignoring ùëò0 (treating it as though
         equal to zero) from this point.8
             Because the intermediary has linear time-additive preferences and because of the ho-
         mogeneity of ùúã, it is natural to look for equilibria for which the ratio ùëç = ùëã/ùëå of total
         capital in the over-capitalized market to total capital in the under-capitalized market de-
         termines the optimal intermediation intensity, and we focus on such equilibria from now
         on. A loss event causes the capital ratio ùëãùë° /ùëåùë° to jump to +‚àû. While we allow this
         formally, the analysis can be done similarly in terms of the ratio ùëåùë° /ùëãùë° , which remains in
         [0, 1] almost surely, and our results apply with only notational changes.9
   7
       In Appendix A, some results are shown for the more general case ùúã(ùë•) = ùëò0 + ùëòùë•‚àíùõæ for where ùõæ is any positive
constant.
   8
     The present value of a marginal unit of capital includes the constant ùëò0 /ùëü, regardless of the intermediary‚Äôs and
investors‚Äô strategies.
   9
     Provided the initial conditions include a strictly positive amount of capital in at least one market, the probability
that ùëãùë° and ùëåùë° ever reach zero at the same time is 0. The partial-recovery case that we analyze in Appendix I has



                                                           11
           The homogeneity of the payout-rate function ùúã and policy Œõ implies that ùêª and ùê∫
       are homogeneous of degree ‚àí1. As a result, ùê∫(ùëß, 0) = ùëî0 ùëòùëß ‚àí1 for some positive constant
       ùëî0 to be determined. Letting ùëì (ùëß) = ùêπ Œõ (ùëß, 1)/ùëò and ùêø(ùëß) = Œõ(ùëß, 1), homogeneity of ùêπ Œõ
       and direct calculation from (1)-(2) implies that ùëì solves the ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equation

                     0 = ‚àíùëüùëì (ùëß) + (1 ‚àí ùëß ‚àí1 ) ‚àí ùëßùêø(ùëß)ùëì ‚Ä≤ (ùëß) + (‚àíùõæùëì (ùëß) ‚àí ùëßùëì ‚Ä≤ (ùëß))ùêø(ùëß)ùëß
                                   ‚àí(1 ‚àí ùëû)ùëì (ùëß)ùêø(ùëß) + ùúÇ[ùëî0 (1 ‚àí ùëß ‚àí1 ) ‚àí 2ùëì (ùëß)].                               (6)

       The relevant boundary condition is ùëì (1) = 0, corresponding to no gain from switching
       when the two markets have the same capital levels. Using (6), Appendix A.3 provides a
       proof of the following result that the switching gain ùëì (ùëß) is strictly positive when capital
       levels are unequal.

       Proposition 2 Given any intermediation policy Œõ, ùëì (ùëß) is strictly positive for ùëß > 1.
       That is, given any Œõ, investors in the over-capitalized market optimally accept the oÔ¨Äer to
       move all of their capital out of the over-capitalized market whenever given the opportunity.

           Taking ùêπ Œõ as given, the optimal present value ùëâ of intermediation proÔ¨Åts is homo-
       geneous of degree 0, that is, ùëâ (ùë•, ùë¶) = ùëâ (ùë•/ùë¶, 1) for ùë¶ > 0. In particular, the policy Œõ
       achieving the supremum of the HJB equation (4) must also be homogeneous of degree 0;
       that is, Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùêø(ùë•/ùë¶) for some ùêø( ‚ãÖ ). Because the switching-gain function ùëì depends
       on the policy function ùêø, the determination of equilibrium is reduced to a Ô¨Åxed-point
       problem: Find a pair (ùëì, ùêø) such that: (i) given ùëì , the policy ùêø is optimal, and (ii) given
       ùêø, the marginal gain function ùëì is that determined by ùêø through (6).
           In Appendix A.5 (Proposition 12), we show that any equilibrium must be of the
       ‚Äúbang-bang‚Äù form:

                                            Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶) = 0,            ùë• < ùëá ùë¶,
                                                       = ùúÜ,          ùë• ‚â• ùëá ùë¶,
strictly positive capital levels in both markets at all times after time zero, given a strictly positive level of capital in
at least one of the markets at time zero. In that context, the assumption that loss events strike only one of the two
markets at a time is without loss of generality because any common jump component would have no eÔ¨Äect on the ratio
of ùëã to ùëå . The sole exception is a case of common jumps with a jump-size distribution that supports ‚àí1, in which
case there is a non-zero probability that ùëãùë° and ùëåùë° can be zero simultaneously. For the same reason, it is without loss
of generality when characterizing equilibria that the return processes ùúåùëé and ùúåùëè have no drift, that is, a component
that is linear in ùë°. Any common Brownian component is likewise irrelevant to optimal intermediation behavior.

                                                            12
for some trigger ratio ùëá ‚â• 1 of the capital level in the over-capitalized market to the
capital level in the under-capitalized market. This is intuitive. Because the HJB equation
is linear with respect the intensity chosen by the intermediary, we anticipate the optimality
of switching from minimal to maximal intensity whenever there is suÔ¨Écient marginal gain
from moving capital from one market to the other. This occurs when the levels of capital
in the two markets are suÔ¨Éciently diÔ¨Äerent. Our problem is reduced to Ô¨Ånding an optimal
trigger ratio ùëá , which then completely determines equilibrium behavior.
   The diÔ¨Äerential equation (6) for ùëì now reduces to
                                                                  (      )

   For ùëß ‚àà [1, ùëá ], the solution is trivial:
                                                                    (     )

                                                  ùëü + 2ùúÇ                ùëß

In particular, we verify that ùëì (1) = 0, consistent with the observation that the net present
value of moving capital from one market to the other is 0 when the levels of capital in
the two markets are the same.
   We can re-write (7) as
                                                          (      )

   Appendix A.4 contains a proof of the following monotonicity and regularity of ùë£( ‚ãÖ ).
Monotonicity of the value ùë£(ùëß) in the capital heterogeneity measure ùëß is not an obvious
result, in particular because the switching gain ùëì (ùëß) is not in general monotonic. That
is, Ô¨Åxing the capital level ùë¶ = 1 in the market with less capital, the marginal gain ùëì (ùë•)
from switching capital from the over-capitalized market to the undercapitalized market
need not be monotone in ùë• even though the increase in payout rate ùúã(ùë¶) ‚àí ùúã(ùë•) is strictly
monotone in ùë•. This is the case because, as ùë• gets large, both ùëî(ùë•) and ‚Ñé(ùë•) ‚â° ùêª(ùë•, 1)/ùëò
go to zero, and so must therefore ùëì (ùë•) = ‚Ñé(ùë•) ‚àí ùëî(ùë•) go to zero. Intuitively, as ùë• gets
large, the global amount of capital is large, and although it can be intermediated from
one market to another, the value of being a capitalist is not attractive when there is ‚Äútoo
much‚Äù capital relative to the demand by hedgers to lay oÔ¨Ä risk.
   The intuition for monotonicity of ùë£(ùëß), however, is that, for any assumed trigger ratio
ùëá , optimal or not, the total rate of activated intermediation fees ùëûùúÜùëßùëì (ùëß), per unit of
capital in the over-capitalized market, is not relevant on [0, ùëá ] by deÔ¨Ånition of ùëá , and is
strictly increasing in ùëß above ùëá . In particular, even though ùëì (ùëß) need not be monotone
in ùëß, ùëßùëì (ùëß) is monotone in ùëß, as shown in Appendix A.4.

Proposition 3 (Value Function Monotonicity) For any trigger capital ratio ùëá ,
the solution ùë£ of (11)-(14) is bounded, increasing, and strictly increasing on [ùëá, ‚àû).

   The smooth-pasting condition ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëá ) = 0 implies the trigger capital ratio

                                              ùëê(ùëü + 2ùúÇ)

   In order to identify the constant ùëî0 , we use a conservation equation: The sum of the
value functions of all investors and of the intermediary must be equal to the present value
of all cash dividend payments net of the search costs incurred by the intermediary. After
calculations shown in Appendix A.3, this conservation principle is equivalent to

   A proof of the following result guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a trigger
strategy is found in Appendices A.6 (existence) and A.7 (uniqueness).

Proposition 4 (Existence and Uniqueness) There exists a unique trigger capital-
ization ratio ùëá satisfying (16), (7), (8), and (15).

   This analysis leads to the following characterization of equilibrium, which includes the
result that in the absence of search costs, the intermediary does not exploit his position
to restrict movement of capital, but rather provides maximal intermediation, nevertheless
generating fee income from his or her imperfect ability to instantaneously move capital
from one market to the other due to the upper bound ùúÜ on contact intensity. As ùúÜ becomes
large, the capital levels will be nearly equated across the two markets at all times, as in
a completely frictionless market, and in the limit there would be no intermediation rents.

Proposition 5 Suppose that the payout-rate function ùúã is of the form ùúã(ùë•) = ùëò0 + ùëò/ùë•.
Then there exists a unique equilibrium. In equilibrium, there is no intermediation (ùúÜùë° = 0)
whenever the ratio of capital levels in the two markets is between 1/ùëá and ùëá , for a uniquely
determined capital-ratio trigger ùëá . Otherwise, intermediation is at full capacity (ùúÜùë° = ùúÜ).
The trigger ratio ùëá is given by (15), where the constant ùëî0 is given by (16). If there is no
intermediation cost (ùëê = 0), then the intermediary always works at full capacity (that is,
ùëá = 1).

   Relation (15) also provides an upper bound on the equilibrium capital-ratio trigger
level:
                                              ùëê(ùëü + 2ùúÇ)
                                    ùëá ‚â§1+               .
                                                  ùëûùëò
This bound is useful for computing numerical solutions to the optimization problem. An
algorithm for computing the constant ùëî0 , and thus ùëá , is given in Appendix G.


3.2      How Intermediation Depends on Market Parameters
We turn to comparative statics, focusing on the behavior of the threshold capital ratio
ùëá . A higher trigger ratio ùëá corresponds to less intermediation, because the intermediary
waits until ùëãùë° /ùëåùë° exceeds ùëá before becoming maximally active. We therefore deÔ¨Åne


                                             15
capital mobility to be increasing whenever the equilibrium threshold ùëá is decreasing. We
will show that these comparative statics carry over to the oligopolistic case.

Proposition 6 (Comparative Statics for ùëê, ùëò, ùúÇ, and ùëü.) Capital mobility is decreas-
ing in the intermediation cost coeÔ¨Écient ùëê, increasing in the payout-rate coeÔ¨Écient ùëò, and
decreasing in the discount rate ùëü. Fixing the dividend payout rate function ùúã( ‚ãÖ ), capital
mobility is decreasing in the loss-event intensity ùúÇ.

   A proof is provided in Appendix H. It is intuitive that increasing the costs of interme-
diation, represented by ùëê, reduces the amount of intermediation provided in equilibrium.
Once the trigger ùëá is chosen, the costs of search intensity are borne entirely by the in-
termediary. Other things equal, raising ùëê therefore lowers the desire to search. The
coeÔ¨Écients ùëê and ùëò aÔ¨Äect the trigger ùëá only through the ratio ùëê/ùëò, explaining the com-
parative static for ùëò. The comparative statics for ùúÇ and ùëü are more subtle because, for
a given trigger ratio ùëá , both ùúÇ and ùëü have an eÔ¨Äect on the value functions of investors.
Equation (15) is the key to understand these comparative statics. Other things equal, a
higher after-shock continuation value for investors (that is, a higher ùëî0 ) results in a lower
ùëá and thus a higher capital mobility. As the discount rate ùëü goes up, the present value of
the intermediary‚Äôs future fees for moving capital are lower, Ô¨Åxing the fees, which increases
the incentive to wait before expending the costs of intermediation. However, a higher ùëü
also reduces investors‚Äô gain from switching capital and hence the fees that they pay to the
intermediary, with an unclear impact on their value function. As we show in our proof,
the former eÔ¨Äect dominates, so ùëá is decreasing in ùëü.
   Our proof likewise shows that ùëá is increasing in ùúÇ, holding ùúã Ô¨Åxed. Of course, increas-
ing the mean loss frequency ùúÇ would naturally raise the equilibrium loss insurance rate
ùúã(ùëãùëñùë° ), which on its own would tend to increase intermediation (lower ùëá ). To analyze
this eÔ¨Äect, we can write ùúã(ùë•) = ùëò0 (ùúÇ) + ùëò(ùúÇ)/ùë• in order to show the dependence of the
coeÔ¨Écients ùëò0 (ùúÇ) and ùëò(ùúÇ) on the mean loss rate ùúÇ. The coeÔ¨Écient ùëò0 (ùúÇ) plays no role in
intermediation gains. The impact on intermediation intensity of replacing ùúÇ with some
ùúÇ ‚Ä≤ > ùúÇ is thus equivalent to the eÔ¨Äect of leaving ùúã unchanged and replacing the cost
coeÔ¨Écient ùëê with ùëê‚Ä≤ ‚â§ ùëêùëò(ùúÇ)/ùëò(ùúÇ ‚Ä≤). This eÔ¨Äect can be small or large, depending on the
sensitivity of ùëò(ùúÇ) to ùúÇ, reÔ¨Çecting how the elasticity of hedging demand varies with the
expected loss frequency. Thus, the overall impact on intermediation intensity of a given


                                             16
increase in the loss-event intensity ùúÇ is to lower intermediation incentives (raise ùëá ) pre-
cisely when the impact on ùëò(ùúÇ) is suÔ¨Éciently small, and otherwise to raise intermediation
intensity.
   Increasing the bargaining power ùëû of the intermediary increases the fraction of the
gains to trade that goes to the intermediary, prompting the intermediary to search for
more investor capital to move, thus setting a lower trigger ratio ùëá , holding constant the
gains to investors for moving capital. Obviously, however, raising ùëû lowers the present
value of investors associated with future movements of capital, thus lowering the amount
of gain they have to share with the intermediary. The proof of the following result given
in Appendix H demonstrates that the direct eÔ¨Äect dominates the indirect eÔ¨Äect on the
investors‚Äô values, provided that ùëû remains below 1/2.

Proposition 7 (Comparative Statics for ùëû) Capital mobility is increasing in the
bargaining power ùëû of the intermediary, for 0 < ùëû < 0.5.

   The impact on capital mobility of the capacity ùúÜ for search intensity depends on other
parameters, and particularly on the discount rate. There are situations in which lowering
ùúÜ lowers the trigger ratio ùëá , leading intermediaries to work more often, albeit with a lower
capacity when they do work. We will provide examples and some intuition for the fact
that, depending on the discount rate ùëü, the threshold capital ratio ùëá can either increase
or decrease with capacity.
   We will argue by continuity from the case of ùúÇ ‚âÉ 0. Taking ùúã(ùë•) = ùëò0 (ùúÇ) + ùëò(ùúÇ)/ùë•, we
can create a family of economies that keep ùëò(ùúÇ) Ô¨Åxed at some ùëò¬Ø as ùúÇ varies near zero by
increasing the loss aversion of hedgers. With this, as ùúÇ approaches zero, the equilibrium
intermediation policy converges to a policy that moves capital until the threshold ùëá
is reached (with no changes in capital levels afterward), so the associated trigger ratio
converges to
                                                  ùëêùëü
                                        ùëá =1+        ,                                  (17)
                                                  ùëòùëû
which is independent of the capacity ùúÜ. Moreover, the associated gain functions converge
to a gain function ùëì with                     (     )
                                            1     1
                                   ùëì (ùëá ) =    1‚àí     .
                                            ùëü     ùëá
   Suppose Ô¨Årst that agents are patient (have a low discount rate ùëü). As ùúÜ goes up,
capital heterogeneity goes down, hence the value of moving capital is lower. Moreover,

                                             17
       a higher-capacity intermediary will more quickly run out of capital to be moved, and
       thus stop receiving fees earlier. Overall, this implies by continuity that we can construct
       example economies with small ùúÇ such that, as ùúÜ is reduced and other parameters are
       held constant, the intermediary receives more fees, and for longer, and hence the value
       function of investors is lower, resulting in a higher threshold.10
           Now, we consider the opposite case of nearly myopic investors (high ùëü). The previous
       argument breaks down: Investors do not care much about future heterogeneity; they care
       mainly about the immediate gain from switching, which depends on current heterogeneity.
       Moreover, the immediate fees are increasing with capacity. A higher-capacity interme-
       diary therefore receives higher immediate fees, which reduces investors‚Äô overall value of
       switching capital and increases the threshold.
          Numerical examples support this intuition. For ùëû = 0.5, ùëê = ùëò,  ¬Ø and ùëü = 0.04, for ùúÇ
       suÔ¨Éciently small and ùëò(ùúÇ) = ùëò¬Ø suÔ¨Éciently insensitive to ùúÇ, the capital trigger ùëá decreases
       with ùúÜ for 0.01 < ùúÜ < 0.5. For the same ùëû and ùëê but taking ùëü = 10, however, the trigger
       ratio ùëá increases with the intermediation capacity ùúÜ, over the same interval.



       4      Intermediary Competition
       We now solve for equilibria with oligopolistic or perfectly competitive markets for inter-
       mediation.
           There are two channels through which intermediary competition aÔ¨Äects the equilib-
       rium level of intermediation oÔ¨Äered by the market. First, an intermediary internalizes the
       impact of intermediation intensity on the heterogeneity of capital levels across the two
       markets, and thus the impact on the intermediary‚Äôs future proÔ¨Åts. A given intermediary
       does not, however, internalize the eÔ¨Äect of increasing it‚Äôs intermediation on reducing the
       proÔ¨Åt opportunities of other intermediaries. Through this Ô¨Årst channel, increasing the
       number of intermediaries should therefore weakly increase the total amount of interme-
       diation. In the benchmark case in which a loss event destroys all capital in the aÔ¨Äected
       market, there is nothing to internalize, because the after-shock situation is independent of
       the pre-shock heterogeneity level, and our upcoming Proposition 8 states that the thresh-
       old is independent of the number of intermediaries. In Appendix C, we explain why the
10
     See Equation (15), which shows that ùëá is decreasing in investors‚Äôs after-shock continuation value ùëî0 .



                                                          18
increase is strict whenever shocks are partial, so that post-shock heterogeneity depends
on pre-shock heterogeneity.
   Second, when in contact with an investor, an intermediary considers the ability of
the investor to compare the intermediation fee oÔ¨Äered with the fees oÔ¨Äered by other
intermediaries. This plays a role, in an extension of the model that is oÔ¨Äered later in this
section, in determining the eÔ¨Äective bargaining power of the intermediary, and through
that channel, has an impact on the proÔ¨Åtability of intermediation. We start by taking
bargaining power as Ô¨Åxed and then endogenize the fees received by the intermediary.


4.1      Intermediary Competition At Fixed Bargaining Power
For a given bargaining power ùëû, we show that equilibrium trigger policies for the oligopolis-
tic case can be translated directly from the case of monopolistic intermediation through
a simple inspection of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. From this, we
also obtain comparative statics directly from those of the monopolistic case.
   For the oligopolistic case, we take ùëõ identical intermediaries, each with an upper bound
ùúÜ/ùëõ on intermediation intensity, and with the same proportional cost ùëê of intermediation.
The monopolistic case (ùëõ = 1) is the special case considered in the previous section. Thus,
all cases have the same feasible market dynamics and costs.
   We consider only Markov time-homogeneous equilibria. Equilibrium incorporates the
degree to which intermediaries internalize the impact of their intermediation intensity
on the heterogeneity of capital levels across markets. For an oligopolistic equilibrium
in trigger strategies, each of the ùëõ intermediaries has a reduced value function ùë£, with
ùë£(ùëß) = ùëâ (ùëß, 1)/ùëò, that solves the reduced HJB equation, extending the monopolistic
version (11):
                     {              (                       )
                                        (ùëõ ‚àí 1)
      0 =    sup         ‚àí ùëüùë£(ùëß) + ‚àí            ùúÜ1{ùëß‚â•ùëá } ‚àí ‚Ñì ùëßùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëß)

                        ùëõ                                                      ùëò

reÔ¨Çecting the presumption by the given intermediary that the ùëõ ‚àí 1 other intermediaries
have adopted a speciÔ¨Åc trigger capital ratio ùëá . The equilibrium condition is that the same
trigger policy is optimal for the given intermediary. VeriÔ¨Åcation of the HJB solution as
the value function and of the optimality of the associated candidate policy function is as

                                             19
         for the monopolistic case.
            Thus, an equilibrium for the ùëõ-intermediary problem is again given by bang-bang
         control for all intermediaries, each exerting no eÔ¨Äort when ùëçùë° < ùëá and maximal inter-
         mediation intensity ùúÜ/ùëõ whenever ùëçùë° ‚â• ùëá , for a trigger capital ratio ùëá . We will show
         that optimality implies that there is no intermediation at or below the capital ratio ùëá
         satisfying the smooth pasting condition ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëá ) = 0. This, along with (18), implies that

                                                             ùëê
                                               ùëûùëá ùëì (ùëá ) ‚àí     = 0.                                 (19)
                                                             ùëò

            From (19), we see that an intermediary‚Äôs optimization problem in a setting with ùëõ
         intermediaries is equivalent to that of a monopolistic intermediary with maximum inter-
         mediation intensity ùúÜ. Indeed, for a given threshold ùëá , the monopolistic and oligopolistic
         cases yield the same function ùëì determining proportional intermediation fees, and hence
         the same smooth-pasting condition (19). In fact, this is actually the unique equilibrium,
         even allowing for the possibility of non-trigger strategies! To see this, consider any Markov
         equilibrium, not necessarily of the trigger-ratio form, and let ùëì denote the function de-
         termining the associated gain from switching. An intermediary‚Äôs HJB equation is of the
         form (18), except that (i) the aggregate of other intermediaries‚Äô contact intensities may
         be almost arbitrary, and (ii) the value functions may vary across intermediaries. Owing,
         however, to the form of the HJB equation, the indiÔ¨Äerence condition is nevertheless given
         by (19), and thus is the same for all intermediaries. This shows that any Markov equi-
         librium must be symmetric and of the trigger form.11 In fact, repeating arguments from
         the monopolistic case leads to the following proposition.

         Proposition 8 With ùëõ intermediaries, there is a unique Markov, homogeneous equilib-
         rium. This equilibrium is symmetric and determined by a trigger capital ratio equal to
         that of a monopolistic intermediary with the oligopolistic maximal contact intensity ùúÜ.

            When shocks lead to a partial recovery of capital, however, the intermediation trigger
         capital ratio ùëá is strictly decreasing in the number ùëõ of intermediaries, as shown in
         Appendix C.
  11
       The trigger form comes from showing, as in the monopoly case (Lemma 2), that the function ùëß 7‚Üí ùëßùëì (ùëß) is
increasing.

         4.2      Endogenous Bargaining Power
         Competition to supply intermediation may also have an impact on an intermediary‚Äôs share
         of gains from trade when in contact with an investor. We next consider the implications
         of market structure for the intermediary bargaining power ùëû. With ùëõ > 1 intermediaries,
         we suppose that some fraction ùúìùëõ of investors are ‚Äúwell connected,‚Äù meaning that as
         they prepare to switch capital from one market to another, they are in simultaneous
         contact with more than one intermediary. The number of intermediaries with whom a
         given investor is in contact could also be random, exploiting the law of large numbers,
         in which case ùúìùëõ can be taken to be the probability that an investor, when contacted,
         is in contact with more than one intermediary. Intuitively, a well-connected investor has
         more bargaining power than a ‚Äúcaptive‚Äù investor, one who is in contact with only one
         intermediary.
             When modeling this intuition with a bargaining game, an issue is whether the con-
         tacted intermediary is assumed to know whether the investor is in contact with other
         intermediaries. We take this case.12 Another modeling approach is a multilateral bar-
         gaining game with complete information, as in Stole and Zwiebel (1996).
             We consider a bargaining procedure aÃÄ la Rubinstein (1982), in which the investor
         and a particular intermediary alternate oÔ¨Äers. In our continuous-time setting, the times
         between oÔ¨Äer rounds can be treated as arbitrarily small, so the inter-round discount factor
         can be taken to be 1. In that case, the investor and intermediary agree immediately to
         split the surplus according to the Nash bargaining solution. The investor‚Äôs share depends
         on his outside option. If the investor is captive, his outside option is simply ùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶), the
         value of remaining in the over-capitalized market. Thus, the normalized Nash product
         associated with a proportional fee of ùë† is

                                          [ùë£(ùëß) + ùë† ‚àí ùë£(ùëß)][‚Ñé(ùëß) ‚àí ùë† ‚àí ùëî(ùëß)],

         which is maximal at ùë† = ùëì (ùëß)/2, corresponding to ùëû = 1/2, meaning an equal splitting of
         the gains with the intermediary.
  12
       It would be possible to allow for one-sided information. The fees derived could be obtained as equilibrium outcomes
of a bargaining process, although there may be additional equilibria. See, for example, Sutton (1986). For an
alternative approach to treating uncertainty about the degree to which an intermediary‚Äôs customer is in contact with
other intermediaries, see Green (2007).



                                                             21
             For a well-connected investor, the normalized Nash product is

                                [ùë£(ùëß) + ùë† ‚àí ùë£(ùëß)][‚Ñé(ùëß) ‚àí ùë† ‚àí ùëî(ùëß) ‚àí (1 ‚àí ùëû0 )ùëì (ùëß)],

         where ùëû0 is the conjectured proportion of the gain from trade that the investor would
         pay to another intermediary if this Ô¨Årst round of bargaining were to break down. The
         Nash product is maximized at ùë† = 0, for a proportional intermediary share of ùëû = 0,
         corresponding to the extraction of all surplus by the well-connected investor.13
             If the number of intermediaries in contact with the investor is known only by the
         investor, then ùëû is similarly obtained, and depends on the probability that the investor is
         captive.
             Assuming pairwise independence of the connectedness of individual investors, the av-
         erage of an intermediary‚Äôs share of gains across the inÔ¨Ånite population of investors is
         almost surely
                                                     1            1 ‚àí ùúìùëõ
                                      ùëû(ùëõ) = 0 √ó ùúìùëõ + (1 ‚àí ùúìùëõ ) =        .                              (20)
                                                     2               2
             In particular, ùëû(ùëõ) is decreasing in ùëõ if ùúìùëõ is increasing in ùëõ. Obviously, ùúì2 ‚â• ùúì1 .
         Going beyond the case of ùëõ = 2, it is somewhat intuitive that an investor is more likely to
         be well connected as the number of intermediaries increases. Appendix D brieÔ¨Çy outlines
         a model with this natural feature.
             Noting from (20) that ùëû(ùëõ) < 1/2, Proposition 7 hints that lowering ùëû(ùëõ) reduces an
         intermediary‚Äôs incentive to search, all else equal, because, for given capital dynamics,
         lowering ùëû(ùëõ) reduces intermediation proÔ¨Åts, and therefore lowers the marginal beneÔ¨Åt
         of raising intermediation intensity. We will next illustrate the second channel through
         which oligopolistic intermediation aÔ¨Äects capital mobility: By reducing each intermedi-
         ary‚Äôs bargaining power, the incentive to intermediate is lowered.
             Endogenous bargaining leads to complex dynamics, in which the number of interme-
         diaries actively searching for capital varies over time. In order to see this, consider a
         candidate equilibrium in which ùëõ intermediaries search at full capacity whenever ùëß > ùëá ,
         and no intermediary searches when ùëß ‚â§ ùëá . If a single intermediary deviates by searching
         for capital when ùëß is in a left neighborhood of ùëá , then his fee per unit of capital switched is
         that of a monopolist, not that of the ùëõ-intermediary case. This increases the value of this
  13
       Another way to obtain this prediction is to assume that intermediaries connected to a given intermediary post
prices and engage in Bertrand competition.

         deviation. Despite this added complexity, we now show that oligopolistic intermediation
         may reduce capital mobility.


         4.3      Reduced Capital Mobility With More Intermediaries
         A Markov strategy proÔ¨Åle for ùëõ intermediaries consists of functions ùêø1 , ùêø2 , . . . , ùêøùëõ on
                         ¬Ø
         [1, ‚àû) into [0, ùúÜ/ùëõ]. Here, ùêøùëñ (ùëß) denotes the search intensity of intermediary ùëñ when the
         heterogeneity of capital across the two markets is ùëß = ùë•/ùë¶. The associated aggregate
         capital mobility is
                                                              ùëõ
                                                              ‚àë
                                                   ùêø(ùëß) =           ùêøùëñ (ùëß).
                                                              ùëñ=1

         In order to exploit the fee share ùëû(ùëõ) derived above, we focus on simple strategies, for
                                     ¬Ø
         which ùêøùëñ (ùëß) is either 0 or ùúÜ/ùëõ. With this restriction,14 we can associate with any strategy
         proÔ¨Åle an increasing sequence ùëá0 , ùëá1 , . . . , ùëáùêΩ of capital-ratio thresholds with the property
         that, whenever the capital ratio ùëçùë° is in [ùëáùëó , ùëáùëó+1 ), a particular set ùëÅùëó of intermediaries
         is active. We let ùëõùëó = ‚à£ùëÅùëó ‚à£ denote the number of intermediaries in ùëÅùëó .
             Using our previous analysis of the oligopolistic case with Ô¨Åxed bargaining power, we
         say that a proÔ¨Åle of simple strategies is a Markov equilibrium if, for all ùëó and ùëß ‚àà [ùëáùëó , ùëáùëó+1 ),

                                                              ùëê
                                           ùëû(ùëõùëó )ùëßùëì ùêø (ùëß) ‚àí     ‚â• 0,        ùëñ ‚àà ùëÅùëó ,                        (21)
                                                              ùëò

         and
                                                                   ùëê
                                        ùëû(ùëõùëó + 1)ùëßùëì ùêø (ùëß) ‚àí          ‚â§ 0,     ùëñ‚àà
                                                                               / ùëÅùëó ,                       (22)
                                                                   ùëò
         where ùëì ùêø (ùëß) denotes the marginal gain to a investor from switching to the market with
         less capital, given an aggregate intensity policy ùêø.
             The Ô¨Årst inequality means that any intermediary searching at capital ratio ùëß does
         so optimally, given equilibrium fee share ùëû(ùëõùëó ). The second equation states that any
         intermediary not searching at capital ratio ùëß does so optimally, given the equilibrium fee
         share ùëû(ùëõùëó + 1) that he would get if he searched. We let ùëá = inf{¬Ø          ¬Ø ùëß ‚â• ùëß¬Ø}, the
                                                                          ùëß : ùêø(ùëß) = ùúÜ,
         smallest level of capital heterogeneity above which intermediaries search at full capacity.
         We denote by ùëá1 the monopolistic threshold. For the result to follow, recall that ùúÇ is the
         mean arrival rate of loss events and that ùëá depends, through ùêø, on the particular Markov
  14
       Extending the analysis to general Markov strategies would be possible if one computes, for any possible strategy,
the expected fee for each intermediary as a function of his search intensity and of the aggregate search intensity.


                                                              23
equilibrium under consideration. It is possible to show that in any equilibrium, ùëßùëì ùêø (ùëß)
is increasing in ùëß. (For this, see the proof of Proposition 11.) This and Equations (21)
and (22) imply that when ùëû(ùëõ) is decreasing in ùëõ (that is, a more connected investor pays
a lower fee), the number of active intermediaries is increasing in ùëß in any equilibrium.

Proposition 9 (Monotonicity) Suppose that ùëû(ùëõ) is decreasing in ùëõ. Then, ùëõùëó is
increasing in ùëó.

      The following result applies for all equilibria.

Proposition 10 Suppose the number ùëõ of intermediaries is at least 2. There exists
some ùúÇ¬Ø > 0 such that for any loss event intensity ùúÇ ‚àà (0, ùúÇ¬Ø) and any associated Markov
equilibrium trigger capital ratio ùëá , we have ùëá1 < ùëá .

      This results states that for suÔ¨Éciently infrequent loss events, the reduced bargaining
power caused by oligopolistic competition reduces the domain of maximal capital mobility
relative to that of the monopolistic case. Our assumption of a suÔ¨Éciently small mean
arrival rate ùúÇ of loss events exploits the fact that intermediation fees are generated from the
time of each loss event until capital is suÔ¨Éciently equalized across the markets. Although
there are technical steps in the proof of this proposition, found in Appendix E, the
argument relies on a bound on improvements in the present value of intermediation fees
as one changes from one market setting to another. A simple way to provide such a bound
is thus to control the speed with which new fee-generating loss events occur.
      Proposition 10 shows that oligopolistic competition results in less intermediation than
achieved by a monopolist, for some range of market heterogeneity. This does not, how-
ever, rule out intermediation by oligopolists at capital ratios below the monopolistic
trigger level. The next result shows that, provided that loss events are not expected too
frequently, oligopolistic and monopolistic settings lead to a cessation of intermediation at
approximately the same levels of market heterogeneity.
      For any ùëõ-intermediary Markov equilibrium with aggregate intermediation strategy ùêø,
let
                                     ùëÜùëõ = inf{ùëß : ùêø(ùëß) > 0},

the smallest heterogeneity level above which capital is mobile. A proof of the next propo-
sition may be found in Appendix E. We will rely on a suÔ¨Éciently small loss event intensity


                                                24
         for the same bounding eÔ¨Äect explained after the statement of Proposition 10.

         Proposition 11 For any ùúÄ > 0, there exists a strictly positive ùúÇ¬Ø such that for any mean
         loss event rate ùúÇ ‚àà (0, ùúÇ¬Ø) and any associated Markov equilibrium with ùëõ players, we have
         ùëÜùëõ ‚â• ùëá1 ‚àí ùúÄ.

              Propositions 10 and 11 together show that capital mobility is lower, at any levels of
         capital, with oligopolistic intermediation than with monopolistic intermediation, provided
         that loss events are suÔ¨Éciently infrequent.15



         5      Discussion and Concluding Remarks
         In a neoclassical model of asset markets, investors continually adjust their portfolios so
         as to achieve the highest possible mean return for a given type of risk. In equilibrium,
         an investor bearing a given type of risk is therefore compensated by a unique associated
         excess mean rate of return, no matter the asset that carries the risk. In practice, however,
         investors make portfolio adjustments with delays. In our model, the mobility of capital
         across diÔ¨Äerent investments is increased through the equilibrium eÔ¨Äorts of intermediaries.
         Our model has several implications for asset-price dynamics:

             1. With unexpected changes in the amount of capital that is available to bear the
               risk represented by an asset, risk premia adjust more severely to capital shocks
               than in a neoclassical (perfect-mobility) setting, and then revert somewhat over
               time as capital is redeployed. This time signature, present in essentially any setting
               with slow moving capital, is dampened to the extent that intermediaries are active.
               Consider for example our simplest setting in which capital levels change only at the
               times at which all capital in a given asset market is lost. Perfect capital mobility
               (ùëê = 0, ùúÜ = ‚àû) implies that ùëãùëéùë° = ùëãùëèùë° for all ùë°. A loss event at time ùúè in Market ùëé
               would cause half of the capital from Market ùëè to move instantly to Market ùëé, so risk
  15
       For the last two results, we have held constant the dependence of the dividend rate function ùúã(ùë•) on the capital
level ùë• as the mean rate ùúÇ of loss events is varied. We have the freedom, however, of varying the population of hedgers
as ùúÇ changes, so as to oÔ¨Äset the impact of variation of ùúÇ on ùúã(ùë•), thereby satisfying the stated comparison between
monopolistic and oligopolistic intermediation for each Ô¨Åxed economy.

                                                           ùëò
                                  ùúã(ùëãùëéùúè ) ‚àí ùúã(ùëãùëéùúè ‚àí ) =           ,

  and then remain constant until the next loss event. With imperfect mobility, how-
  ever, the risk premium in market ùëé would jump immediately to +‚àû and then decline
                     ùëò
  at the rate ùúÜùëçùë°   ùëãùëéùë°
                          until the capital heterogeneity ratio ùëçùë° = ùëãùëèùë° /ùëãùëéùë° drops to ùëá or
  until another loss event occurs.

2. The degree to which risk premia vary across assets, after controlling for other deter-
  minants of risk premia, is increasing in the degree to which capital is heterogeneously
  distributed across assets.

3. The speed of reversion of risk premia across assets toward common levels (after
  adjustment for other determinants of risk premia) is decreasing in the cost of in-
  termediation. Increasing intermediation capacity, however, can either increase or
  reduce capital mobility, depending on the setting, as explained in Section 3.2.

4. All else equal, increasing the fraction of gross gains from moving capital that accrue
  to intermediaries increases the speed of adjustment of capital and risk premia.

5. Lowering time discount rates increases the mobility of capital.

6. Increasing the volatility of asset returns, represented in our model by the mean fre-
  quency ùúÇ of loss events, can either increase or decrease the mobility of capital through
  intermediation, depending on the relative magnitudes of the eÔ¨Äects of: (i) raising
  neoclassical risk premia (thus increasing the rents available to intermediaries) and
  (ii) increasing the volatility of capital heterogeneity at a given level of intermediation,
  which lowers the incentive to intermediate.

7. Increasing the scope for intermediary competition by splitting the market among
  more intermediaries can increase or decrease the equilibrium provision of intermedi-
  ation, depending on the relative magnitudes of the eÔ¨Äects of (i) reducing the concern
  of an intermediary regarding the impact of its own activity on lowering capital het-
  erogeneity, and (ii) lowering the bargaining power of an intermediary vis-avis its
  customers because of increased competition with other intermediaries. As the num-
  ber of intermediaries increases, the former eÔ¨Äect raises intermediation incentives,
  while the latter eÔ¨Äect can lower intermediation incentives.

                                            26
             Our introduction uses the example of the market for catastrophe risk reinsurance.
         Froot and O‚ÄôConnell (1999), Zanjani (2002), and Born and Viscusi (2006) explain how
         premiums for catastrophe risk insurance typically increase dramatically when insurance
         and re-insurance Ô¨Årms suÔ¨Äer signiÔ¨Åcant damage claims after natural disasters, such as
         Hurricane Andrews in 1992. Then, over many months, premiums drop toward ‚Äúsoft-
         market‚Äù levels (absent other shocks to the capital of insurers) because the replacement of
         insurance capital is delayed by institutional barriers to capital raising, including the time
         spent searching for suitable new investors. According to Enz (2001), premiums swing up
         and down by as much as 50% over multi-year periods, and are closely linked with changes
         in the capital levels of insurers, regardless of whether these changes in capital are caused
         by damage claims or by unexpected returns to the asset portfolios of insurers. From this,
         we know that the dynamics of insurance premiums after a major natural catastrophe are
         not caused mainly by inference concerning the arrival rate of future such events. We
         also know that most of the observed price impacts are not caused by inference about
         losses because major changes over time in insurance premiums following shocks to capital
         levels are highly correlated across all major lines of property insurance covered by the
         same pools of capital covering catastrophe risk.16 These other lines cover, for example
         aviation, marine, motor, and proportional property. The link tying premium dynamics
         across the various lines of insurance is the level of capital commonly available to bear
         losses. Froot and O‚ÄôConnell (1999) emphasize the slow speed of capital replacement as
         the major cause of slow premium adjustments.
             That there is scope for intermediaries to mobilize dormant capital is apparent from
         a signiÔ¨Åcant body of evidence that, when left on their own, many individual investors
         adjust their portfolios remarkably infrequently. For example, Ameriks and Zeldes (2004)
         report that over a 10-year period, 44% of investors in their sample made no changes to
         their portfolio allocations, and that an additional 17% of these investors made a single
         re-allocation during this period. Mitchell, Mottola, Utkus, and Yamaguchi (2006) Ô¨Ånd
         that, of 1.2 million U.S. employees covered by over 1,500 401(k) investment plans, approxi-
         mately 80% initiated no trades over a two-year period, while an additional 10% made only
         a single trade.17 Based on our theoretical results, one presumes that investor inattention

       For further evidence on the slowness of individual portfolio adjustments, see Lusardi (1999), Lusardi (2003),
Brunnermeier and Nagel (2008), and Bilias, Georgarakos, and Haliassos (2009).

is more evident in the data when the cost of contacting individuals and deploying their
capital is large relative to the potential associated intermediation proÔ¨Åts. For example,
high-net-worth individual investors and institutional investors are likely to receive more
attention from intermediaries because of the amounts of capital they can deploy and the
associated higher total intermediation fees, than are most of the smaller investors whose
inattention is documented in this literature. This is consistent with evidence provided
by Bilias, Georgarakos, and Haliassos (2009) and FeldhuÃàtter (2009). Further, variation
across investors in Ô¨Ånancial sophistication (not captured in our model) may lead to a
negative correlation between the cost of achieving a given level of contact intensity and
the level of deployable capital. In our model, intermediaries cannot diÔ¨Äerentiate among
sub-classes of investors.
   Delays in processing information for purposes of investment decisions are also in ev-
idence from ‚Äúprice momentum‚Äù following fundamental news, as documented empirically
by Chan (2003), Engelberg, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2010), Dellavigna and Pollet (2009),
and Cohen and Lou (2010), among others. Given that most Ô¨Ånancial intermediaries are
themselves likely to receive and processes fundamental news quickly relative to the time
for price reactions documented in this literature, one presumes that there are limits on the
average speed with which they can attract potential investors to such investment opportu-
nities. This inference is also consistent with numerous examples of slow price adjustments
to supply shocks in equity markets, including those of Holthausen and Mayers (1990), Sc-
holes (1972), Coval and StaÔ¨Äord (2007), Andrade, Chang, and Seasholes (2008), Kulak
(2008); with respect to supply shocks caused by index re-compositions, Shleifer (1986),
Harris and Gurel (1986), Kaul, Mehrotra, and Morck (2000), Chen, Noronha, and Singhal
(2004), and Greenwood (2005); and with respect to the expiration of commodity futures
contracts, Mou (2011).
   In corporate bond markets, which are not traded on a central exchange, one observes
large price drops and delayed price recovery in connection with major downgrades or
defaults, as described by Hradsky and Long (1989) and Chen, Lookman, and SchuÃàrhoÔ¨Ä
(2008), when certain classes of investors have an incentive or a contractual requirement
to sell their holdings. Mitchell, Pedersen, and Pulvino (2007) document the eÔ¨Äect on
convertible bond hedge funds of large capital redemptions in 2005. Convertible bond
prices dropped and rebounded over several months. A similar drop-and-rebound pattern


                                            28
was observed in connection was the LTCM collapse in 1998. Newman and Rierson (2003)
show that large issuances of European Telecom bonds during 1999-2002 temporarily raise
credit spreads throughout the sector, evidence that it takes time for intermediaries to
locate long-term investors.
   In these examples, the time pattern of returns or prices after a supply or demand shock
reveals that the friction at work is not merely a transaction cost for trade. If that were
the nature of the friction, then all investors would immediately adjust their portfolios,
or not, optimally. The new market price and expected return would be immediately
established, and remain constant until the next change in fundamentals. In all of the
above examples, however, after the immediate price response, whose magnitude reÔ¨Çects
the size of the shock and the supply of immediately available capital, there is a relatively
lengthy period of time over which the price reverts in mean toward its new fundamental
level. In the meantime, additional shocks can occur, with overlapping consequences. The
typical pattern suggests that the initial price response is larger than would occur with
perfect capital mobility, and reÔ¨Çects the demand curve of the limited pool of investors that
are quickly available to absorb the shock. The speed of adjustment after the initial price
response is a reÔ¨Çection of the time that it takes more investors to realign their portfolios
in light of the new market conditions, or for the initially responding investors to gather
more capital.
   In our setting, as in practice, there can be substantial diÔ¨Äerences in mean returns
across assets that are due not only to cross-sectional diÔ¨Äerences in ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù cash-
Ô¨Çow risks, but are also due to unbalanced distributions of capital, relative to a market
without intermediation frictions. Empirical ‚Äúfactor‚Äù models of asset returns do not often
account for factors related to the distribution of ownership of assets, or related to likely
changes in the distribution of ownership. Exceptions include the recent work of Coval
and StaÔ¨Äord (2007) and Lou (2009), who note that the conditional mean returns of an
equity tend to be lower due to price pressure when mutual funds owning that equity
are experiencing liquidation-motivated outÔ¨Çows, and that the conditional mean returns
recover as price pressure abates. Similarly, Bartram, GriÔ¨Én, and Ng (2010) show that
divergent levels of ownership by national domiciles play a role in equity returns.
   In our model, delays in portfolio adjustments are due to the time that it takes for
intermediaries to locate suitable investors. This is only an abstraction, which can also


                                            29
proxy for other forms of delay, including time to educate investors about assets with which
they have limited familiarity (awareness), time for contracting, and time for investors to
dispose of their current positions, which could involve similar delays and price shocks, as
suggested by Chaiserote (2008).
   We could extend our model so as to treat asymmetric markets. Provided that the local
inverse demand function ùúã( ‚ãÖ ) of each market satisÔ¨Åes similar homogeneity assumptions,
intermediation would be characterized by two distinct thresholds of capital ratios, one for
movement of capital from market ùëé to market ùëè, and another for the reverse movement.
For example, if returns in market ùëé are riskier than those in market ùëè, then, all else
equal, capital will be less mobile toward market ùëé than toward market ùëè. Asymmetry, for
example, would allow a consideration of capital mobility from a low-risk ‚Äúmoney market‚Äù
into a high-risk market such as that for private equity. Many of the qualitative features
of our symmetric model, such as the dynamics of capital mobility and the impact of
intermediation competition, are anticipated to carry over to asymmetric settings, at least
under regularity conditions.
   Another natural extension concerns the case of three or more markets. Consider, for
example, three symmetric markets diÔ¨Äering only in their capital levels, and satisfying our
homogeneity conditions. We conjecture that capital will Ô¨Çow exclusively to the highest
premium market, with more mobility from the lowest-premium market than from the
mid-premium market one.

A      Equilibrium Analysis
Here, we provide a stochastic analysis of Markov equilibrium that is more complete and
general than that provided in the main text.
    Given an intermediation contact intensity process ùúÜ and initial conditions for capital
in each market, we let ùëãùëñùë°ùúÜ denote the total capital in market ùëñ at time ùë°. Given an
associated transaction-cost process ùêæ, the marginal value to a supplier of one additional
unit of capital in market ùëñ at time ùë° is
                     (‚à´ ‚àû                                                       )
              ùúÜ
                           ùëí‚àíùëü(ùë†‚àíùë°) ùëäùë† ùúã ùëãùê∑(ùë†),ùë†
                                   [     ( ùúÜ     )                  ]
             ùúÉùëñùë° = ùê∏                               ùëëùë† ‚àí ùëäùë†‚àí ùêæùë†‚àí ùëëùëÅùë†          ‚Ñ±ùë° ,           (23)
                         ùë°

where ùëÅùë† is the cumulative number of switches back and forth between the two markets
through time ùë† by the holder of this unit of capital, and the market indicator ùê∑(ùë†) is ùëé
or ùëè, depending on whether, at time ùë†, the accumulated capital ùëäùë† is currently located
in market ùëé or ùëè. This capital thus accumulates according to

                                    ùëëùëäùë† = ùëäùë†‚àí ùëëùúåùê∑(ùë†‚àí) (ùë†),

with initial condition ùëäùë° = 1. The market-indicator process ùê∑ is a marked point process
with an initial condition at time ùë° of ùê∑(ùë°) = ùëñ, and with an intensity of jumping from
market ùëñ to market ùëó at time ùë† of ùúÜùë† 1{ùëãùëñùë†ùúÜ >ùëãùëóùë†
                                              ùúÜ } . In the equilibrium that we shall describe,


the value of switching from market ùëñ to market ùëó is strictly positive if and only if ùëãùëñùë°ùúÜ > ùëãùëóùë°
                                                                                             ùúÜ
                                                                                                .
The marginal value of moving capital is thus

                              ùúôùúÜùë° = max(ùúÉùëéùë°
                                         ùúÜ     ùúÜ
                                            , ùúÉùëèùë°          ùúÜ
                                                  ) ‚àí min(ùúÉùëéùë°    ùúÜ
                                                              , ùúÉùëèùë° ).

    At each time ùë°, intermediaries charge investors some fraction ùëû ‚àà [0, 1] of the gain
ùúôùúÜùë° from switching each unit of capital. That is, the proportional intermediation fee is
ùêæùë°ùúÜ = ùëûùúôùúÜùë° .
    We restrict ùúÜ to be a progressively-measurable process so that, at each time, the in-
termediary chooses a contact intensity that depends only on information that is currently
available.

                                                31
   A monopolistic intermediary‚Äôs total rate of fee revenue is ùúÜùë° max(ùëãùëéùë° , ùëãùëèùë° )ùëûŒ¶ùë° , where
Œ¶ùë° = ùúôùúÜùë° is the gain from switching capital under policy ùúÜ. Given the initial conditions
 ùúÜ            ùúÜ
ùëãùëé0 = ùë•ùëé and ùëãùëè0 = ùë•ùëè , and given a gain-from-switching process Œ¶, the intermediary‚Äôs
utility for a contact intensity process ùúÜ is
                                      (‚à´ ‚àû                                  )
                                            ‚àíùëüùë°           ùúÜ     ùúÜ
                ùëà(ùë•ùëé , ùë•ùëè , Œ¶, ùúÜ) = ùê∏      ùëí ùúÜùë° [ùëûŒ¶ùë° max(ùëãùëéùë° , ùëãùëèùë° ) ‚àí ùëê] ùëëùë° .
                                        0

   We assume that the parameters are such that this utility is Ô¨Ånite, which is the case
in the equilibria that we analyze. We restrict attention to intermediation policies that
depend on the available information only through the current capital levels (ùëãùëéùë° , ùëãùëèùë° ).
The intermediary might otherwise prefer to commit once and for all time to a path-
dependent intensity policy that could, at some future time, be dominated by another
policy available at that time, given the current capital market conditions at that time.
   The inability to commit to an intermediation strategy may in principle be overcome by
sophisticated punishment threats, as in Ausubel and Deneckere (1989) and Mailath and
Samuelson (2006). In such equilibria, if the intermediary deviates, investors would update
their beliefs about the intermediary‚Äôs strategy in a way that harms the intermediary. Such
equilibria are based on sophisticated oÔ¨Ä-equilibrium-path investor beliefs, which are not
in the spirit of our assumption that investors are less sophisticated than intermediaries.
Another possible justiÔ¨Åcation for our focus on Markov equilibria is the fact that more
sophisticated equilibria unravel in Ô¨Ånite-horizon models where (possibly state-dependent)
stage games have a unique Nash equilibrium.
   Given the symmetry of the two markets, it suÔ¨Éces to characterize equilibrium behavior
in terms of

                                   ùëãùë° = max(ùëãùëéùë° , ùëãùëèùë° )
                                    ùëåùë° = min(ùëãùëéùë° , ùëãùëèùë° ).

The payoÔ¨Ä processes to investments in the ‚Äúlarger‚Äù and ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù markets are, respec-
tively,
                          ùëëùúåùëã
                            ùë° = 1{ùëãùëéùë° >ùëãùëèùë° } ùëëùúåùëéùë° + 1{ùëãùëéùë° ‚â§ùëãùëèùë° } ùëëùúåùëèùë°

                          ùëëùúåùëåùë° = 1{ùëãùëéùë° ‚â§ùëãùëèùë° } ùëëùúåùëéùë° + 1{ùëãùëéùë° >ùëãùëèùë° } ùëëùúåùëèùë° .

From the LeÃÅvy property, (ùúåùëã , ùúåùëå ) has the same joint distribution as the primitive payoÔ¨Ä
processes (ùúåùëé , ùúåùëè ).

                                               32
   Because we restrict attention to an intermediation intensity process ùúÜ that depends
only on current capital levels, and because of symmetry, we can suppose that ùúÜùë° =
Œõ(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) for some measurable policy function Œõ : ‚Ñù2+ ‚Üí [0, ùúÜ] with the property that
there is a solution to the associated stochastic diÔ¨Äerential equation

                             ùëëùëãùë° = ‚àíŒõ(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë°)ùëãùë° ùëëùë° + ùëãùë° ùëëùúåùëã
                                                           ùë°                            (24)



                              ùëëùëåùë° = Œõ(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° )ùëãùë° ùëëùë° + ùëåùë° ùëëùúåùëåùë° .                        (25)

   Letting ‚Ñí denote the space of intermediation intensity processes of this form, and
given an assumed gain-from-switching process Œ¶, the intermediary solves the problem

                                     sup ùëà(ùë•, ùë¶, Œ¶, ùúÜ).                                 (26)
                                     ùúÜ‚àà‚Ñí

An equilibrium is a pair (ùúÜ, Œ¶) consisting of an intermediation intensity process ùúÜ that
attains the supremum (26) given Œ¶, and such that Œ¶ùë° = ùúôùúÜùë° . This deÔ¨Ånition includes
consistency with the optimality for investors to move their capital, in exchange for the
marginal fee determined by Œ¶, when contacted by the intermediary, and includes con-
sistency between the conjectured and actual dynamics for capital movements and search
intensity.


A.1     Homogeneous Case
Allowing somewhat more generality than in the main text, we take the inverse demand
function ùúã( ‚ãÖ ) to be of the form ùëò0 +ùëòùë•‚àíùõæ for positive constants ùëò0 , ùëò, and ùõæ. Also without
loss of generality, in the following we take ùëò0 = 0 and, by re-scaling, we take ùëò = 1.
That is, the equilibrium behavior for (ùëò, ùëê) is the same as that for (1, ùëê/ùëò). Because the
intermediary has linear time-additive preferences and because of the homogeneity of ùúã,
and therefore of ùúôùúÜ , the ratio ùëç = ùëã/ùëå of total capital in the over-capitalized market
to total capital in the under-capitalized market determines the optimal intermediation
intensity. Thus, we can further assume the independence of ùúåùëé and ùúåùëè without loss of
generality because any common LeÃÅvy component would have no eÔ¨Äect on the ratio of ùëã
to ùëå . (The sole exception is a case of common jumps with a jump-size distribution that
supports ‚àí1, in which case there is a non-zero probability that ùëãùë° and ùëåùë° can be zero
simultaneously. We rule out this exception.)

                                             33
      Consistent with the insurance example, we suppose that ùúåùëé and ùúåùëè are of the form
ùúåùëñùë° = ùúáùë° + ùúñùëñùë° , where ùúá is a constant and ùúñùëé and ùúñùëè are independent compound Poisson
processes with common jump intensity ùúÇ and a given jump-size probability distribution
ùúà. The proportional payoÔ¨Ä processes processes ùúåùëé and ùúåùëè could also be given a common
Brownian component without aÔ¨Äecting our analysis, for this also has no eÔ¨Äect on the
relative proportions of capital in the two markets. Cases with market-speciÔ¨Åc Brownian
components are analyzed in Appendix K. Likewise, the constant drift rate ùúá plays no
role in the analysis of optimal intermediation, and can be taken to be zero without loss
of generality for purposes of determining equilibrium intermediation policies. The eÔ¨Äect
of non-zero ùúá on actual capital levels can be reintroduced later with the scaling by ùëíùúáùë° of
both ùëãùë° and ùëåùë° .
      The marginal gain from switching capital is

                             ùúôùúÜùë° = ùêπ Œõ (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) ‚â° ùêª(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) ‚àí ùê∫(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ),                           (27)

where, under our regularity, ùêª and ùê∫ satisfy the coupled equations (1)-(2). For general
ùõæ, letting ùëì (ùëß) = ùêπ Œõ (ùëß, 1) and ùêø(ùëß) = Œõ(ùëß, 1), the ODE (6) for ùëì generalizes to

      (ùëü + 2ùúÇ + ùêø(ùëß)(ùõæùëß + (1 ‚àí ùëû))) ùëì (ùëß) + ùëß(1 + ùëß)ùêø(ùëß)ùëì ‚Ä≤ (ùëß) = (1 + ùúÇùëî0)(1 ‚àí ùëß ‚àíùõæ ).                  (28)


A.2       VeriÔ¨Åcation of Optimality of HJB Solution
This appendix provides a proof that the HJB equation (4) characterizes optimality, al-

Because ùúÜ and ùëâÀÜ are bounded, this local martingale is in fact a martingale. From this
and the implication of the HJB equation that

                             ‚àíùëü ùëâÀÜ (ùëãùë°ùúÜ , ùëåùë°ùúÜ ) ‚àí ùí∞(ùëâÀÜ , ùëãùë°ùúÜ , ùëåùë°ùúÜ , ùúÜùë° , Œì) ‚â§ 0,

another application of ItoÃÇ‚Äôs formula implies that ùëÜ is the sum of a decreasing process
and a martingale. Thus, ùëÜ is a supermartingale. Because ùëâÀÜ is bounded, we have the
‚Äútransversality‚Äù condition that for any intermediation intensity process ùúÜ,

                                   lim ùê∏[ùëí‚àíùëüùë° ùëâÀÜ (ùëãùë°ùúÜ , ùëåùë°ùúÜ )] = 0.                  (29)

Thus, for any intermediation intensity process ùúÜ,

Let Œõ be a policy such that, for each (ùë•, ùë¶), Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶) attains the supremum (4). For each
ùë°, let ùúÜ‚àóùë° = Œõ(ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ). Then, the fact that

                             ‚àíùëü ùëâÀÜ (ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° ) ‚àí ùí∞(ùëâÀÜ , ùëãùë° , ùëåùë° , ùúÜ‚àóùë° , Œì) = 0

implies that ùëÜ is a martingale. Thus

                                     ùëâÀÜ (ùë•, ùë¶) = ùí±(ùë•, ùë¶, ùúÜ‚àó , Œì).                    (31)

Thus, for any intermediation intensity process ùúÜ,

                            ùëâÀÜ (ùë•, ùë¶) = ùí±(ùë•, ùë¶, ùúÜ‚àó , Œì) ‚â• ùí±(ùë•, ùë¶, ùúÜ, Œì),

proving the result.


A.3     Nonnegativity of the Gain From Switching ùëì
We now prove Proposition 2, allowing for general ùõæ. Because the righthand side of (28)
is strictly positive, ùëì or ùëì ‚Ä≤ must be strictly positive. This implies that ùëì cannot cross
0 from above. Hence, ùëì must be strictly positive on some interval of the form (ùëß, ‚àû),
and is non-positive on [1, ùëß] for some level ùëß. It remains to show that ùëß = 1. Because
ùëì (1) = 0, the intermediary does not search when the markets have equal levels of capital,
given that ùëê > 0. That is, ùêø(ùëß) vanishes on a neighborhood of 1. From (28), this implies
that ùëì is positive on that neighborhood, which concludes the proof.
   The total-present-value conservation equation is

                      ùëâ (ùë•, ùë¶) + ùë•ùê∫(ùë•, ùë¶) + ùë¶ùêª(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùëÖ(ùë•, ùë¶) ‚àí ùëÉùëá (ùë•, ùë¶),


                                                     35
where ùëÖ(ùë•, ùë¶) is the present value of the total future cash Ô¨Çows at rate ùëãùë° ùúã(ùëãùë° ) + ùëåùë° ùúã(ùëåùë° ),
to be divided among the intermediaries and the investors, and ùëÉùëá (ùë•, ùë¶) is the the in-
termediary‚Äôs expected discounted search costs over the inÔ¨Ånite horizon, given a trigger
ùëá.
     Because ùúã is homogeneous of degree ‚àí1, we have ùëÖ(ùë•, ùë¶) = 2/ùëü. The search-cost
present value ùëÉùëá (1, 0) solves

                                 ùëÉùëá (1, 0) = ùëù + ùê∏[ùëí‚àíùëüùúè ùëÉùëá (1, 0)],                       (32)

where ùëù is present value of search costs from time zero to the exponentially distributed
time ùúè of the next loss event. We now show that, for the case of no recovery at loss event,

where ùëé(ùëá ) = log(1 + 1/ùëá )/ùúÜ.¬Ø
     Starting with ùëã0 = 1 and ùëå0 = 0, for ùë° < ùúè we have

and

                      ¬Ø                     ¬Ø
This yields ùëãùë° = ùëí‚àíùúÜùë° and ùëåùë° = 1 ‚àí ùëí‚àíùúÜùë° , for ùë° < ùúè . The intermediary will stop searching

A.4     Proof of Proposition 3
That ùë£ is bounded follows from the fact that it is dominated by 2/ùëü. The monotonicity
result is based on two intermediate lemmas.
   First, given the function ùëì determining intermediation fees, let
                                            (        )
                                  (     ‚àíùõæ
                                           ) 1 + ùúÇùëî0
                           ùúö(ùëß) = 1 ‚àí ùëß                ‚àí ùëì (ùëß).
                                              ùëü + 2ùúÇ

The Ô¨Årst term of ùúö(ùëß) is the present value of switching capital to the under-capitalized
market if the intermediary arrests intermediation eÔ¨Äorts from the point at which the
capital ratio ùëçùë° is at ùëß until the next loss event occurs, given ùëî0 . (See (9).) Suppose in
particular, a given reduced policy ùêø(ùëß) = Œõ(ùëß, 1), and a particular ùëß at which ùêø(ùëß) = 0.
Then ùúö(ùëß) = 0. As a special case, ùúö(1) = 0 (which can also be checked directly from the
deÔ¨Ånition of ùúö and the fact that ùëì (1) = 0). We note that, since the Ô¨Årst term deÔ¨Åning ùúö is
strictly increasing in ùëß, ùúö‚Ä≤ (ùëß) must be positive whenever ùëì ‚Ä≤ (ùëß) is negative. Given a policy
ùêø, we will show that ùúö is nonnegative. In order to see this, we observe that for ùëß ‚â• 1,
(28) can be re-written as

                    ùêø(ùëß) [((1 ‚àí ùëû) + ùëßùõæ)ùëì + ùëß(1 + ùëß)ùëì ‚Ä≤ ] = (ùëü + 2ùúÇ)ùúö(ùëß).                (34)

We already know that ùúö(1) = 0. Since ùëì is positive from Proposition 2, this implies that
ùëì ‚Ä≤ (ùëß) is negative whenever ùúö(ùëß) ‚â§ 0, and hence that ùúö‚Ä≤ > 0 whenever ùúö ‚â§ 0. Therefore, ùúö
cannot cross 0 from above, which proves our Ô¨Årst lemma.

Lemma 1 For any policy, ùúö is everywhere nonnegative.

   This result is intuitive: other things equal, the expected gain from moving one‚Äôs capital
is larger if the intermediary immediately stops switching capital after that last movement,
since the diÔ¨Äerence between capital levels, and hence between premia, is larger in that case.
Lemma 1 has a crucial consequence for the case ùõæ = 1: The rate at which fees are paid
to the intermediary when he searches is strictly increasing in ùëß. The more heterogeneous
the markets, the higher is the intermediary‚Äôs immediate proÔ¨Åt from switching. Since this
rate of fee payment, net of search costs, is ùëûùëßùëì (ùëß) ‚àí ùëê, we must show that ùëßùëì (ùëß) is strictly
increasing in ùëß. We can re-write (34) when ùõæ = 1 as

                 ùêø(ùëß)(1 + ùëß)(ùëì (ùëß) + ùëßùëì ‚Ä≤ (ùëß)) = (ùëü + 2ùúÇ)ùúö(ùëß) + ùëûùêø(ùëß)ùëì (ùëß).

                                             37
Since ùëì is positive and ùúö is nonnegative, this implies that ùëì (ùëß)+ùëßùëì ‚Ä≤ (ùëß) is positive whenever
ùêø(ùëß) > 0, hence that ùëßùëì (ùëß) is strictly increasing in ùëß. On any interval on which ùêø(ùëß) = 0,
we have ùëì (ùëß) = (1 + ùúÇùëî0 )/(ùëü + 2ùúÇ)(1 ‚àí 1/ùëß), so ùëì is strictly increasing, and, a fortiori, so
is ùëßùëì (ùëß).

Lemma 2 For ùõæ = 1 and any policy, the revenue rate ùëßùëì (ùëß) is strictly increasing in ùëß.

   We can now show monotonicity of ùë£ for any trigger policy. From (13), ùë£ is constant
for ùëß ‚â§ ùëá . Starting with some capital ratio ùëç0 = ùëß > ùëá ,
                            [‚à´ ùúè                                       ]
                                  ‚àíùëüùë°                              ‚àíùëüùúè
                   ùë£(ùëß) = ùê∏      ùëí [ùëûùëì (ùëçùë° )ùëçùë° ‚àí ùëê]1{ùëçùë° >ùëá } ùëëùë° + ùëí ùë£0 ,

where ùúè is the time of the next loss event. The function ùëß 7‚Üí [ùëûùëì (ùëß)ùëß ‚àí ùëê]1ùëß>ùëá is non-
decreasing in ùëß from Lemma 2, and strictly increasing for ùëß > ùëá . For ùëá < ùëß < ùëß ‚Ä≤ , this
implies that ùë£(ùëß) < ùë£(ùëß ‚Ä≤ ) (because the event time ùúè has a distribution that does not
depend on ùëß or ùëß ‚Ä≤ ). This proves Proposition 3.


A.5      Optimality of a Trigger Policy
This appendix shows that for any equilibrium pair (ùëì, ùêø), the reduced policy function ùêø
must be a trigger policy. In fact, we will show that for any switching-gain function ùëì that
can arise as the result of an admissible intermediation policy, equilibrium or otherwise,
the optimal policy must be of the trigger form.
   From Appendix A.2, we know that, for a given ùëì , any bounded solution of the HJB
equation is the value to the intermediary of an optimal policy. We also know that ùëì is
continuous (and, in fact, diÔ¨Äerentiable) from (10). From Lemma 2, we also know that for
any admissible policy, ùëßùëì (ùëß) must be increasing. Finally ùëì must be such that the value
function ùë£ is bounded by 2/ùëü. These conditions deÔ¨Åne what we call ‚Äúadmissibility‚Äù of ùëì .
In particular, these conditions must be satisÔ¨Åed in any equilibrium.
   We Ô¨Årst show that there exists a solution to the HJB equation that is achieved by a
trigger policy. Then we verify that any policy that achieves the value function that solves
the HJB equation must be of the trigger form.
   For any equilibrium, the function ùëì is bounded, because

                                                                     2
                 ùëì (ùëß) = ‚à£‚Ñé(ùëß) ‚àí ùëî(ùëß)‚à£ ‚â§ ‚Ñé(ùëß) + ùëî(ùëß) ‚â§ ‚Ñé(ùëß) + ùëßùëî(ùëß) ‚â§ .
                                                                     ùëü

                                              38
Therefore, given any candidates for the capital trigger ratio ùëá and the constant ùë£1 , one
can integrate the HJB equation (14) on [ùëá, ‚àû). The smooth-pasting condition is satis-
Ô¨Åed if ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëá ) = 0, and this is equivalent to the condition that ùëûùëá ùëì (ùëá ) = ùëê. (For this,
see (11).) Given ùëì , this uniquely determines ùëá , because ùëá ùëì (ùëá ) is strictly increasing in ùëá
by Lemma 2. The only diÔ¨Éculty is to show the consistency condition ùë£1 = (2ùúÇ/2ùúÇ + ùëü)ùë£0
(see (13)), where ùë£0 = limùëß‚Üí‚àû ùë£(ùëß), noting that ùë£0 enters as a coeÔ¨Écient of ODE 14 (in
the constant ùëë). In order to show this, we exploit the linearity of the ODE (14). Making
the change of variables ùë¢(ùëß) = ùë£(ùëß) ‚àí ùë£1 , we have ùë¢(ùëá ) = 0. The dynamics of ùë¢ do not
depend on ùë£0 , in that
                               ùë¢(ùëß) + ùõºùëß(1 + ùëß)ùë¢‚Ä≤ (ùëß) = ùõΩ(ùëß),                            (35)
             ¬Ø
where ùõΩ(ùëß) = ùúÜ(ùëûùëßùëì                           ¬Ø
                   (ùëß) ‚àí ùëê)/(ùëü + 2ùúÇ) and ùõº = ùúÜ/(ùëü + 2ùúÇ) > 0 is positive on (ùëá, ‚àû).
Moreover, the limit ùë¢‚àû is by construction equal to ùë£0 ‚àíùë£1 . This allows us to re-express the
consistency condition as ùë¢‚àû = (ùëü/2ùúÇ + ùëü)ùë£0 . Therefore, having integrated ùë¢ over [ùëá, ‚àû),
one may simply read oÔ¨Ä the values ùë£0 and ùë£1 . The resulting function ùë£(ùë°) = ùë¢(ùë°)+ùë£1 solves
the initial HJB equation with a ùë£0 -dependent coeÔ¨Écient, and also satisÔ¨Åes the smooth
pasting condition.
   Thus, for any admissible ùëì , there is an optimal policy of the trigger form. To conclude,
we will show that there are no policies solving the HJB equation that are not of the trigger
form. This follows from the linearity in ‚Ñì of the HJB equation, implying a bang-bang
solution, which is strict because indiÔ¨Äerence is characterized by the equation ùëûùëßùëì (ùëß) = ùëê,
which has a unique solution by Lemma 2. This analysis is summarized as follows.

Proposition 12 Suppose that the payout-rate function ùúã is of the form ùúã(ùë•) = ùëò0 +ùëò/ùë•.
Then any equilibrium intermediation policy Œõ corresponds to a trigger capital ratio ùëá .
                  ¬Ø {ùë•/ùë¶ > ùëá } .
That is Œõ(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùúÜ1


A.6     Existence of Equilibrium
So far, we have shown that any equilibrium must be of the trigger form. In this appendix
we show that there exists such an equilibrium. Appendix A.7 shows uniqueness of such
equilibria.
   For any candidate trigger capital ratio ùëá , let ùëì (ùëß ‚à£ ùëá ) be the net expected gain from
switching capital across markets under the policy with trigger ùëá , given current market

                                             39
heterogeneity ùëß. We need to show that there exists some ùëá such that ùëûùëá ùëì (ùëá ‚à£ ùëá ) = ùëê, that
is, such that the intermediary ceases intermediation, given the switching gain function
ùëì ( ‚ãÖ ) = ùëì ( ‚ãÖ ‚à£ ùëá ), exactly when ùëß = ùëá . It suÔ¨Éces to show that ùëá ùëì (ùëá ‚à£ ùëá ) takes all values
between 0 and ‚àû as ùëá varies from 1 to ‚àû.
   Because ùëßùëì (ùëß) is increasing, equation (9) implies that

                                                 (ùëá ‚àí 1)
                                 ùëì (ùëß ‚à£ ùëá ) ‚â•              ,   ùëß ‚â• ùëá.
                                                ùëá (ùëü + 2ùúÇ)
This implies that ùëá ùëì (ùëá ‚à£ ùëá ) ‚â• (ùëá ‚àí 1)/(ùëü + 2ùúÇ). We note that the lower bound grows
linearly with ùëá . Because ùëá ùëì (ùëá ‚à£ ùëá ) = 0 for ùëá = 1, we know that ùëá 7‚Üí ùëá ùëì (ùëá ‚à£ ùëá ) goes
from 0 to ‚àû as ùëá goes from 0 to ‚àû. This function is continuous, so there exists some ùëá ‚àó
such that ùëá ‚àó ùëì (ùëá ‚àó ‚à£ ùëá ‚àó) = ùëê/ùëû.

Proposition 13 Suppose that the payout-rate function ùúã is of the form ùúã(ùë•) = ùëò0 +ùëò/ùë•.
Then, there exists an equilibrium with a trigger policy.


A.7      Trigger Uniqueness
Proof of Proposition 4.              Suppose that trigger levels ùëÜ and ùëá , with ùëÜ < ùëá , both
satisfy the equations of the proposition. Let ùúô(ùëß) = ùëì ùëá (ùëß) ‚àí ùëì ùëÜ (ùëß) denote the diÔ¨Äerence
between the gains from switching capital under policies ùëÜ and ùëá , as a function of ùëß.
(Throughout, we use superscripts to denote dependence on ùëÜ or ùëá .) From (15), ùëÜ < ùëá
implies that ùëî0ùëÜ > ùëî0ùëá . Optimality of ùëÜ (respectively ùëá ) with respect to ùëì ùëÜ (respectively,
ùëì ùëá ) implies that, for any ùëß in (ùëÜ, ùëá ],

                               ùëûùëßùëì ùëÜ (ùëß) ‚àí ùëê ‚àí ùëß(1 + ùëß)(ùë£ ùëÜ )‚Ä≤ (ùëß) > 0

and
                              ùëûùëßùëì ùëá (ùëß) ‚àí ùëê ‚àí ùëß(1 + ùëß)(ùë£ ùëá )‚Ä≤ (ùëß) ‚â§ 0.

Because (ùë£ ùëá )‚Ä≤ (ùëß) = 0 for ùëß in this interval (ùëÜ < ùëá ], while (ùë£ ùëÜ )‚Ä≤ (ùëß) ‚â• 0 by Proposition 3,
we know that ùúô(ùëá ) < 0. Subtracting the version of equation (7) for ùëá from the version
of the same equation for ùëÜ yields
                                                (      )

       Because ùúô(ùëá ) < 0, this18 implies that ùúô < 0 for ùëß > ùëá , so that ùúô is everywhere negative.
           By deÔ¨Ånition, ùëî0 is the marginal value of capital held by investors in the overcapitalized
       market, when ùë• = 1 and ùë¶ = 0 (that is, when no investor is initially present in the small
       market). Therefore,

       where Œ¶0 is the expected discounted value of all future fees that investors will pay to
       the intermediary. (Recall that 2/ùëü is the expected discounted stream of dividends paid
       on both markets. We have seen that ùúô < 0, that is, ùëì ùëÜ (ùëß) > ùëì ùëá (ùëß) for all ùëß > ùëá . This
       means that investors pay, for any ùëß, more fees with ùëÜ than with ùëá for ùëß > ùëá . Moreover,
       for ùëß ‚àà [ùëÜ, ùëá ], investors pay fees (which are positive, from Proposition 2) for trigger ùëÜ,
       whereas they pay nothing for trigger ùëá . Therefore, Œ¶ùëÜ0 > Œ¶ùëá0 , which implies from (37)
       that ùëî0ùëÜ < ùëî0ùëá , a contradiction.                                                           ‚ñ†



       B       Numerical Illustration with Partial Recovery
       We provide an illustrative example of equilibrium for the case of partial recovery, which
       is analyzed in Appendix I. We take the parameters ùëü = 0.04, ùúÇ = 1.5, ùëê = 0.04, ùúÜ = 0.1,
       ùëû = 1/30. We assume beta-distributed recovery (one minus proportion lost) on (0, 1),
       with parameters (5, 1). The equilibrium intermediation trigger ratio ùëá of capital in the
       over-capitalized market to capital in the under-capitalized market is found numerically
       to be 1.465.
           Figure 1 shows simulated sample paths of the capitalization ratio ùëçùë° = ùëãùë° /ùëåùë° and the
       immediate return ùëì (ùëçùë° )/ùëî(ùëçùë°) to a supplier of capital, before transactions fees, associated
       with switching capital into the under-capitalized market. Figure 2 shows the present
       values, with one unit of capital in the under-capitalized market, of future cash Ô¨Çows to a
       provider of one unit capital in the over-capitalized market (net of fees), to a provider of

     Indeed, ùúô(ùëß) = 0 implies that ùúô‚Ä≤ (ùëß) < 0, so ùúô cannot cross zero from below.

      level ùë¶ of capital in the under-capitalized market.



      C               Intermediary Competition with Partial Recovery
      Here, we discuss the case of oligopolistic competition with partial recovery.                               Recall
      from (59) the smooth-pasting condition for the monopolistic case:

                                                  ùëûùëá ùëì (ùëá ) ‚àí ùëê = ùëá (1 + ùëá )ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëá ).                                                      (38)

      One can see that the trigger capital ratio ùëá is determined not only by the function ùëì
      determining the marginal gain from moving capital, but also by the derivative ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëá ) of
      the intermediary‚Äôs value function. In order to understand the impact of oligopolistic

                                                                  42

      intermediation, suppose that intermediaries were to use, instead of the optimal trigger
      ratio ùëá , the equilibrium trigger ratio of a monopolist with the same aggregate capacity
      for intermediation. In that case, ùëì would be unchanged. Each intermediary, however,
      would receive only a fraction 1/ùëõ of the total intermediation fees. The righthand side
      of (38) is thus lowered, implying that intermediaries prefer to continue intermediating
      after the capital ratio exceeds the monopolistic trigger. This is the Ô¨Årst channel through
      which oligopolistic competition matters: Because an oligopolistic intermediary does not
      internalize the full impact of his search on intermediation fees, he has a greater incentive
      to intermediate. More precisely, an intermediary does not work for opportunities to move
      capital when the immediate net marginal beneÔ¨Åt of doing so, ùëûùëßùëì (ùëß) ‚àí ùëê, is below the
      marginal value ùëß(1 + ùëß)ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëß) associated with future capital heterogeneity. For a given
      trigger ratio ùëá , an intermediary‚Äôs value function ùë£ declines in direct proportion to the
      number ùëõ of intermediaries, and, hence, so does the derivative ùë£ ‚Ä≤ . This implies that the
      term ùëß(1 + ùëß)ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëß) diminishes with ùëõ, while the immediate marginal beneÔ¨Åt ùëûùëßùëì (ùëß) ‚àí ùëê


                                                          43
         is unchanged, keeping ùëá constant. Thus, as ùëõ increases, the incentive to intermediate
         at the given trigger ratio ùëá becomes strictly positive, prompting intermediaries to search
         more.19
             As ùëõ goes to inÔ¨Ånity, an intermediary‚Äôs value function goes to zero (because the size of
         the pie to be shared among intermediaries is uniformly bounded above by 2/ùëü), and the
         derivative ùë£ ‚Ä≤ (ùëá ) also goes to 0. The limit as ùëõ diverges is the competitive equilibrium, in
         which the trigger capital ratio ùëá is determined by

                                                   ùëûùëá ùëì (ùëá ) ‚àí ùëê = 0.

         With perfect competition, an intermediary has no impact on aggregate search activity,
         and thus cares only about the immediate net beneÔ¨Åt from switching.



         D       Connectedness
         In this appendix, we outline a model with the natural feature that an investor is increas-
         ingly likely to be in contact with multiple intermediaries at the point of bargaining as the
         total number of intermediaries is increased.
             Suppose that there is an advertising medium handling intermediary ads. An inter-
         mediary‚Äôs eÔ¨Äort corresponds to the probability ùëù that its advertisement will place the
         intermediary in contact with an investor at the time at which the investor checks the
         medium. We assume that ùëù is bounded by some capacity constraint ùëù¬Ø < 1. Each investor,
         pairwise independently across investors, has some exogenous intensity ùúí for the times of
         monitoring his capital and observing the advertising medium.20 This is consistent with
         the framework of our main model: The intensity of times at which an investor is contacted
         by least one intermediary is ùúíùúôùëõ (ùëù), where

                                                ùúôùëõ (ùëù) = 1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí ùëù)ùëõ .

         Then, ùúÜ = ùúíùúôùëõ (¬Ø
                        ùëù) is the intermediation capacity parameter of the basic model. Assuming
         that a well-connected investor initiates bargaining with a randomly selected intermediary
  19
       When there is zero recovery from a loss event, the after-event heterogeneity (which is inÔ¨Ånite) does not depend
of the pre-event heterogeneity. In that case, intermediaries already ignore the impact of their search activity on
heterogeneity and the monopolistic solution coincides with the competitive one.
  20
     At such times, the investor observes the medium and plays a bargaining game with advertised intermediaries. If
bargaining breaks down, the investor leaves his capital in the large market, until the next monitoring time.

                                                           44
         from among those contacted, each intermediary has maximal contact intensity ùúÜ/ùëõ. The
         probability that, when in contact with an intermediary, an investor is in contact with at
         least two intermediaries is

                                         ùúìùëõ (ùëù) = 1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí ùëù)ùëõ ‚àí ùëõùëù(1 ‚àí ùëù)ùëõ‚àí1 .

         For a Ô¨Åxed ùúô ‚àà [0, 1], let ùëù¬Øùëõ solve ùúôùëõ (¬Ø                 ¬Ø is independent of ùëõ, as in our

                                                                               ¬Ø ùëõ
                                                                          (1 ‚àí ùúô)ùëõùëù
                                  ùúìùëõ (ùëùùëõ ) = ùúô¬Ø ‚àí ùëõùëùùëõ (1 ‚àí ùëùùëõ )ùëõ‚àí1 = ùúô¬Ø ‚àí           ,
                                                                            1 ‚àí ùëùùëõ

         one can show that ùúìùëõ (ùëùùëõ ) is increasing in ùëõ.21 Therefore, keeping constant the Ô¨Çow of
         investors being contacted at any given time, the average number of intermediaries in
         contact with any given investor is increasing in ùëõ. As the number of intermediaries goes
         to inÔ¨Ånity, the probability that investor is well connected is:

                                          lim ùúìùëõ (ùëùùëõ ) = ùúô¬Ø + (1 ‚àí ùúô)
                                                                   ¬Ø log(1 ‚àí ùúô).
                                                                             ¬Ø
                                         ùëõ‚Üí‚àû


         The second term is negative. This speciÔ¨Åcation can be generalized to an arbitrary number
         of media, with the same result that ùúìùëõ is increasing in ùëõ.



         E       Proofs of Results in Section 4.3

         Proof of Proposition 10. As before, we let ùëî0ùêø = ùê∫(1, 0), under strategy ùêø. For any
         equilibrium with aggregate mobility ùëß 7‚Üí ùêø(ùëß) and fee ùëß 7‚Üí ùëû(ùëß), one can easily modify
         the proof of Lemmas 1 and 2 to show that

         is nonnegative and that ùëßùëì ùêø (ùëß) is increasing in ùëß. If ùëá ‚â§ ùëá1 , we have

       In order to verify this, one is to show that ùëõùëùùëõ /(1 ‚àí ùëùùëõ ) is decreasing. Expressing ùëùùëõ in terms of ùõº = (1 ‚àí ùúô)
and letting ùë• = 1/ùëõ, this is equivalent to showing that (ùõºùë• ‚àí 1)/ùë• is increasing in ùë•. This is easily done by checking
the positivity of the derivative, whose numerator is increasing in ùë¢ = ùõºùë• and vanishes for ùë¢ = 1.


                                                              45
where ùëì 1 and ùëî01 denote the corresponding quantities for the monopolistic case, since the
intermediary does not search at ùëá . Further,

from the nonnegativity of ùúöùêø (ùëá ). Therefore,

                                                            ùëî01 ‚àí ùëî0ùêø

Since ùëî0ùêø ‚â§ 2/ùëü for any policy, there exists, for any ùúÄ > 0, some ùúÇ¬Ø such that for all ùúÇ < ùúÇ¬Ø,
the righthand side of (39) is bounded in norm by ùúÄ whenever ùëá ‚â§ ùëá1 , since we also have
an upper bound on ùëá1 from (15). Choosing ùúÄ below (1/ùëû(ùëõ) ‚àí 1/ùëû(1))ùëê and setting ùúÇ¬Ø
accordingly, we have for any ùëá ‚â§ ùëá1 ,
                              ùëû(1) (                        ) ùëû(1)

                              ùëû(ùëõ)                             ùëû(ùëõ)

which shows that it is strictly optimal for the monopolist to search at ùëá , contradicting
the assumption that ùëá ‚â§ ùëá1 .

Proof of Proposition 11. At ùëÜùëõ , it cannot be strictly proÔ¨Åtable for an intermediary
to deviate by continuing to search and receive the net payoÔ¨Ä ùëû(1)ùëÜùëõ ùëì ùêø (ùëÜùëõ ) ‚àí ùëê per unit
of eÔ¨Äort, but it was proÔ¨Åtable to some intermediaries to search at a capital heterogeneity
just above ùëÜùëõ . This implies that ùëÜùëõ must satisfy the equation

                                       ùëû(1)ùëÜùëõ ùëì ùêø (ùëÜùëõ ) = ùëê.

In words, there is a single active intermediary just before ùëÜùëõ is reached. We recall from
the monopolistic case that ùëá1 satisÔ¨Åes the equation

                                        ùëû(1)ùëá1 ùëì 1 (ùëá1 ) = ùëê.

Therefore, it suÔ¨Éces to show that the roots of these two equations are arbitrarily close if
ùúÇ is arbitrarily small. We have
                                                1 + ùúÇùëî0ùêø

                                 1                              1
                                ùëì (ùëá1 ) =                    1‚àí      .

which may be rewritten as

Because ùëá1 is uniformly bounded from (15) and because both ùëî0ùêø and ùëî01 are bounded by
2/ùëü, the righthand side is less than ùúÄ if ùúÇ is chosen small enough. The Ô¨Årst factor of the

shows that ‚à£ùëÜùëõ ‚àí ùëá1 ‚à£ ‚â§ ùúÄ for any arbitrary ùúÄ > 0, provided that ùúÇ is small enough.
