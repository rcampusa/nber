                   Tariffs, Employment and the Current Account:
           Real Wage Resistance and the Macroeconomics of Protectionism



                                     ABSTRACT



           Using a standard complete specialization model of a small open

economy within a rigorous intertemporal optimization framework with contract—

based wage rigidity, we show that permanent tariffs may lead to a current

account deterioration and a fall in employment, contradicting most of the

literature of macro—economic effects of import tariffs. I show that this will

always be the case if the economy is small enough. The crucial factor in this

complete reversal of standard results is the impact of tariffs on domestic

real product wages via wage indexation. Temporary tariffs will have less of a

negative impact on the CA or potentially even a positive impact, because they

increase the consumption rate of interest (the ternis at which future

consumption can be traded for current consumption) and so increase private

savings.

           Extensions towards incorporating a more general production structure,

investment and the use of tariff revenues to provide wage subsidies are

presented.

1. Introduction

         The continued persistence of the post 1973 slowdown in world—wide

economic growth has led to increasing pressure in many countries to maintain

growth while preserving external balance by using commercial policy to protect

domestic production. Much of the existing literature on macro—economic

effects of tariffs seems to lend support to that approach (at least under a

fixed exchange rate regime). For a recent exposition, see Dornbusch (1980) or

Chalciolades (1978) who provide further references going all the way back to

Metzler (1949). See furthermore, Johnson (1958), Mussa (1974a) or Boyer

(1977). The argument is straightforward: higher tariffs (with revenues

rebated to consumers) have a pure substitution effect leading to a higher

demand for domestic goods which in turn leads to higher output, income and

therefore savings. Higher savings imply a current account improvement. Under

flexible exchange rates an appreciating currency may offset these effects (see

Mundell (1961) and Boyer (1977)).

         I will argue that implausible assumptions on wage behavior are

crucial to those results. Output will only go up if the increase in tariffs

succeeds in lowering the real product wage. Since the macro—economic

literature on tariffs usually assumed fixed nominal wages when discussing

employment effects, the results follow automatically if the tariff increase

succeeds in shifting domestic demand towards our goods.

        One problem with all this has to do with foreign retaliation.

Another problem arises because of the issue of real wage resistance. Often

real wage indexation is at the root of internal/external balance conflicts.

It is not clear why commercial policy would succeed in lowering the real wage

where other attempts have failed. It then becomes of interest to explore the
SV—039/SVD/04—17—87                      2




consequences of commercial policy when wage indexation is effective. I will

focus on tariffs in this paper.

         A further problem with the macroeconomic literature on tariff policy

is that its conclusions on CA effects are based on models incorporating

arbitrary static savings functions, not a very meaningful procedure in an

analysis of a clearly intertemporal issue such as current account behavior.

An elegant exception is the note by Razin and Svensson (1983) who however

assume market clearing real wages and, in another departure from the standard

Mundell framework, exogenous terms of trade.

         In what follows we will stick to the Mundell framework but introduce

contract based real wage rigidity and savings behavior derived from explicit

forward looking maximizing behavior. Section 2 derives the main results of

this paper in a two—period framework (the minimum needed to get a time

structure in). We assume contract—based real (consumption) wage rigidity in

response to unanticipated shocks. No second period shocks unanticipated at

the beginning of period two will be considered, so that period will be

characterized by full employment. In Section 3, I briefly discuss to what

extent the results depend on the special assumptions made. In particular,

introduction of aggregate investment and extension to incomplete

specialization are discussed. Section 4 discusses the possibility of using

some or all of the tariff revenues for wage subsidies to get around the wage

rigidity problem. Section 5 concludes.



2.   Tariffs, Employment and the Current Account

2.1 The Model

         Consider a two country Mundell—Fleming framework where each country

produces only one good. We make two alternative assumptions about output: in
 SV—039/SVD/ 04—17—87                         3




 the No Wage Indexation (NWI) case, output is always at its full employment

 level; in the Wage Indexation (WI) case, unemployment may result if wage

 indexation prevents real product wages to fall to their market clearing level.

            We assume utility 11 to be weakly homothetically separable in

 consumption today and consumption tomorrow while the period by period

 subutility indices are homothetic and identical in terms of functional form

and parameter values (the arguments may of course differ across periods).

This allows us to define unit utility expenditure functions

   and 112 which can be interpreted as aggregate price indices, and an

expenditure function:



     (1)         E =
                       E(111,II2,U)

                  *
where   iS=1/(1+r ),    one over one plus the world interest rate. By choice of

normalization foreign prices are set equal to one.            p indicates the relative

price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods in period i (the terms of

trade). Under the assumptions made so far,          11. =   1I.(p.,l)   with

 311.13p.   = C/Z.    with C. consumption of domestic goods by domestic residents

in period i and         real consumption expenditure in period i. By property of

expenditure functions, Z = 3E/aII.          so that C. =
                                                             aE/p.
            Wage indexation is introduced in a simple manner: wage contracts are

negotiated at the beginning of each period, incorporating all information

available at that time. They are set at a level that will lead to full

employment if no unanticipated shocks occur during the contract period, and

are indexed on the CPI (iIi).         Since we will not consider any shocks or policy

changes in the second period that are unanticipated at the beginning of that
SV—039/SVD/04—17—87                                              4



second period, full employment will obtain in that period. Accordingly the

goods market clearing equation for period 2 is:



    (2)
                   2
                           =    E        +E*
                                    p2      p2



with X2 being the full employment output level. Of course first period

disequilibrium will influence the second period goods market equilibrium via

the intertemporal budget constraint.

          In the first period, CPI indexation yields:




              w
               d        =
                                '1'D
                                       dp1 +
                                       p1
                                                 1D         df1
                                                            l+f1


We will for simplicity set the initial tariff at zero. This is, however, of

no consequence for any of the results. The period one wage equation can be

rearranged to give an expression for the real product wage in terms of

domestic goods:


                           dp                                        dp
    (3)                —   —i = (1—4                 )   (df 1   —   —i)
              w                                  D
                           p1                                        p1


(3) indicates that, in this Mundell—Fleming context, tariffs will push up the

real (domestic) product wage if the Metzler paradox does not obtain, i.e. if

the tariff inclusive price of the foreign good indeed goes up in terms of the

domestic good. We will assume that foreign demand elasticities are high

enough to rule out the Metzler paradox.

          Now that first period wages do not necessarily clear the labor

market, period 1. output will not necessarily be at its full employment

level. Capital in period 1 is inherited from the past, there are no
 SV—039/SVD/04—17—87                                   5




intermediate inputs, so output X1 and first period employment, L1, are a

functions of the real product wage only:



       (4a)         X1 =                L1 = L1 (w/p1)
                           X1(w/p1),


or, differentiating,


                    dX          d(w/p )
         b          —=—s
                    xl             wIpl

with           0.
              Under wage indexation, output and employment follow from the wage

indexation restraint (3) and the labour demand and aggregate supply functions

as listed in (4a, b).

              In the full employment version of the model, wages clear the labour

market:



       (4c)
                             L1 (w/p1), X1 =



with         the (exogenous) labour supply.

              The goods market equilibrium condition for period 1 then becomes:


                                               *
    'F
    (5              X1 (v/p) = E
                                   p1
                                        + E
                                              p1



              The budget constraint facing domestic residents is:



    (6)             p1X1 +         + t1Ef          +
                                                           Ef= E(r11(p1,l+t1), 6n2(p2,l+t2),U)
SV—039/SVD/04—17—87                                6




             Similarly for foreigners:



                               =
                      X + 6X       E*(rI,   611, u*)




where we assumed no trade interventions in the foreign country              (rj= 0).

Stars indicate foreign variables. Tariff revenues are redistributed, hence

the terms t1E1 and 6t2Ef               in the private budget constraint in the home
                      1            2
country.

             We will make one important simplifying assumption: we will assume

that the relative price of foreign goods tomorrow in terms of foreign goods

today (6) ,      is   fixed, allowing Hicks—aggregation of current and future foreign

goods. The market clearing equation for that Hicks—aggregate good is

redundant because of Walras' law. A true two—country model would of course

endogenize 6 (or, equivalently, the world rate of interest), leading to two

separate market clearing equations for foreign goods, one for period one and

the other for period two, only one of which would be redundant. The benefits

of extra generality that endogenizing 6 would yield do not seem to justify

the additional complexity it would also lead to, at least for the particular

issue we are looking at now (Appendix B does, however, provide an outline of

such a generalization).



2.2 Results

             One result is immediate: if the Metzler paradox does not obtain,

higher tariffs will lead to real wage pressure in the domestic goods sector.

Equation (3) says that nominal wage changes equal a weighted average of tariff

changes and domestic price changes; ruling out the Metzler paradox implies

that
       df1        — so
                 > dp1         the real (domestic) product wage goes up, and employment
             1      p1

 and firstperiod output go down after an increase in the tariff rate

 (equations (3 & 4)). Tariff increases would lower the real wage "ex ante";

real wage indexation will, to prevent that, lead to an increase in the real

domestic product wage and therefore to unemployment (qualifications to that

result due to relaxing the Mundell—Fleming complete specialization assumption

are discussed in the next section).

           Differentiation of equation (6) around the zero tariff equilibrium

indicates that:



    (6a)        dU =              )           +
                        E((X1—E       dp1         (X2—E)       6dp2) +       p1 X1 d(wIp1)



                   = E I(E*dP1+ E* dp2) +               E'   X1 w (l—aD)(dpl — dp1/p1)



           Similarly for foreign welfare:


                 *
                dUE*_l       *            *
                   U       (—E dp-E
                                1   &dp)
                                       2
                                          p2



           If this is substituted into (1), simple algebra gives expressions for

the terms of trade effects dp1 caused by changes in tariffs. We distinguish

the case with wage indexation (WI), and the case without (NWI);                  in   the latter,

all terms involving X1 drop Out. For the first period, terms of trade changes

induced by tariffs today and tariffs in the second period are:

            The   results          are fairly straightforward, higher tariffs today

(df1 >   0)    and higher tariffs tomorrow (df2 >                    0) will both put upward

pressure on today's terms of trade. The Metzler paradox corresponds to dp1/df1 > 1,

                  a possibility that cannot be excluded, although we will assume

that foreign demand elasticities are high enough to rule it out.

              Including wage indexation leads to similar expressions (see Appendix

the   latter inequality (d >       0)      is established in Appendix A.2. Comparing (7a,

paradox does not obtain (dp1/df1 <               1).       This is intuitive: with wage

indexation, aggregate supply of first period home goods falls, hence a larger

relative price increase is necessary to restore goods market equilibrium.

             Since we have ignored investment so far, current account effects of

tariffs can be derived by looking at private savings. To avoid uninteresting

ambiguities, we will make a symmetry assumption on flow variables across

periods: corresponding flow variables across periods (say, exports today and

exports tomorrow) are assumed equal per unit of time in both periods before

the changes in tariffs. This of course implies that their actual values may

differ since the periods may correspond to time spans of very different

length.

goods. (14) indicates that high but temporary tariffs (only in period 1) will

decrease the discount factor (increase the consumption rate of interest).

This is because they lead to a real appreciation in period 1 that will be

partially reversed later on (i.e. an anticipated depreciation over time after

the initial unanticipated appreciation). 2/ So temporary tariff increases in

period 1 will lead to a current account improvement both because of the

 favorable income effects of tariff induced terms of trade changes (the gains

 of which will be spread out over both periods) and because they lead to an

 increase in the consumption rate of interest favorably affecting private

 savings. It should be stressed that the CA improvement stems from the fact

that the tariff is temporary.

           The fourth term, (D), may reverse this result, since X1 < 0.              The

intuition is clear: higher tariffs cause first period unemployment and hence

low first period income in the presence of real consumption wage indexation.

Standard income smoothing arguments explain that this has a negative impact on

the first period current account.

           An expression similar to (14) can be derived for future temporary

tariff increases (df2 >          0).   It is straightforward to show that with the

assumptions made so far, future tariff increases will lead to a period 1

current account deficit. The story is similar: income effects via favorable

terms of trade changes come in the future but are partially spent today, and

the real consumption rate of interest falls.

           Taking the two results together to analyze a permanent increase in

tariffs df1 =         =    df,   we get that in the absence of real wage indexation a
                df2
permanent tariff leaves the current account unaffected:



               dCA                     =                  -          -

 Under the symmetry assumptions made the discount factor will not change:



    (16)

                          ''Ddf

                                                                    =0


while income effects are the same in both periods. Accordingly a permanent

tariff increase has no impact on the current account, independent of the type

of elasticity conditions that are usually claimed to be sufficient to

guarantee such an improvement (c.f. Dornbusch (1980)):



    (15a)
                r

                          NWI
                                             =0



           The reason for this is quite straightforward: a tariff changes

relative prices within the period in which it is levied, but a permanent

tariff does that both today and tomorrow, leaving the relative price of

consumption today in terms of consumption tomorrow (one plus the consumption

rate of interest) unaffected. Accordingly, savings will not change, which

explains the absence of a current account impact. The extension to endogenous

investment is discussed in Section 4.

           All these results are considerably modified however if real wage

resistance to the tariff induced increase in the cost of living is

introduced. Ignoring second round effects of real wage changes on the terms

of trade and via that on the consumption rate of interest and thus on saving

gives:


               dCA                     dCA                              dw/p

         Clearly the second term is negative, pointing to the possibility of a

negative current account response to permanent tariffs under real wage
                    dCA
indexation, since                =   0.   Second round effects however will lead to
                      df
                           NWI
a higher p1 response than obtains without wage indexation, therefore

increasing the terms of trade gains in period 1 and decreasing the discount


         —i— (increasing
factor                   the consumption rate of interest). Both these
           1
effects will improve the CA, so, although the possibility of a negative CA

response is now there, it does not follow unambiguously.

         A substantially stronger result can be obtained if we look at the

limiting case of a small country (fixed terms of trade exclusive of tariffs in

both periods). Then the only CA impact of a permanent increase in tariffs

will come via the fall in income induced by real wage pressure:

or a permanent increase in tariffs in a completely specialized price taker

will unambiguously lead to a fall in unemployment and a current account

deficit under CPI wage indexation.

         For a temporary tariff there is the offsetting effect of the direct

impact of the first period tariff on the real discount factor; but we can

still show that even if a CA surplus results it will be smaller than without

real wage indexat ion:

3. Some Qualifications

            We will briefly discuss the consequences of relaxing the complete

specialization assumption and of introducing investment.

            Incomplete specialization plays no role in the full employment —— NWI

case: all the conclusions will carry through although one expects smaller

relative price movements since these now also trigger resource shifts. The

case with wage indexation, WI, needs more qualifications. If both capital and

labour are mobile between sectors, Stolper—Samuelson tells us that market

clearing wages will fall or rise in terms of both goods (and therefore in

terms of the consumption price index        depending on whether the tariff is

levied on the capital or labour intensive good. Real wage indexation will

lead to results similar to those obtained in Section 3 if the tariff is levied

on the capital intensive good since the indexation scheme will prevent the

downward adjustment in real wages necessary to maintain full employment.

        The conditions under which unemployment will arise in response to

tariffs in a Ricardo—Viner sector—specific capital, mobile labor model with

real wage indexation are more complicated and will also involve consumption

 shares. Consider the small country case (p1= 0). We can use the results in

Mussa (1974b) to derive the condition under which a full employment

equilibrium would be characterized by a lower real consumpion wage after the

imposition of an import tariff:

relatively high capital share ((1_Of)/(l_OD) large).

           Consider now investment, while reverting to our Mundell—Fleming

context of complete specialization. The natural approach complementing our

optimizing savings behavior is to derive investment from a similar optimizing

but will do so because investment declines.

tariff being levied on the labor intensive good.

 4. Wage Subsidies Financed by Tariff Revenues

             At the root of the problems discussed in Section 3 is the fact that

 real wage indexatjon leads to an increase in the real domestic—product wage

 after an increase in tariffs. A natural response is to use the tariff

 revenues to drive a wedge between real product wages and real consumption

 wages via wage subsidies: this would allow the real consumption wage to

 remain constant without an increase in the real product wage.

            In what follows we take a slightly different approach: part of the

 tariff revenues is used to keep the utility of wage earners constant. 1/ A

 related analysis can be found in Dixit and Norman (1980); there however one of

 the two factors of production receives all tariff revenues, while we give wage

earners only as much as is needed to keep their utility constant.

            Consider a simplified one period version of the model of Section 2.

We now have to distinguish the incomes accruing to the two factors of

production in the home economy. Denote the expenditure function of domestic

wage earners as e and of capitalists as               .   Similarly u and i
represent utility of wage earners and capitalists respectively. Accordingly,
tariff revenues equal T =           +          A fraction X of T is handed out to
                             t(ef       ef).
wage earners. A is determined endogenously in such a way that u will not

be affected by the change in tariffs.

            The budget constraint of workers is:



    (24a)       e(p,f,u) = w +
                                 Xt(ef+   ef).




1/ This approach was suggested by Avinash Dixit.
SV—039/SVD/04—17—87                           20




Similarly, capitalists face the constraint


              (p,f,) =           — w + (1—X)
     (24b)                  pX               t(ef+ ef).


The foreign budget constraint is

               *        *        *
     (24c)    E (p,l,U ) = X


Finally goods market clearing implies

                       *
               e+e
                p p
                    +E
                       p
                                 X


A will be set in such a way that u =        u,   allowing the real product wage

u = w/p to remain at its full employment level. 1/ Clearly, domestic output

will not be affected under this set up. Simple differentiation of 24a,b,c

around the zero tariff equilibrium yields:



     (24d)     e du =
               u        (—e
                            p
                                )dp +   (xf—(1—A)e f)df

     (24e)
                u
                 d =    (X—w4 )dp + ((l—A)ef—        Xf )df
                                 p



So an increase in tariffs is good because you get reimbursed for outlays you

did not make (Af for wage earners and (l—A)ef for capitalists) and bad

because you are only incompletely reimbursed for costs you do incur

(—(l—A)ef for wage earners and —A for capitalists). If




1/   Keep in mind we are once again in the complete specialization framework.

1/ In deriving 24d we also used homogeneity properties of e and e
 SV—039/SVD/04—17—87                                    21




               (21d) tells us that wage earners utility will not be affected by the

 tariff (du/df = 0)                if they receive a share of tariff revenues equal to:



                         *    e (1—cr)
       (25a)         A

                              ef+ ef

where          =             . The   Metzler effect corresponds to     >   1.   Accordingly in

the case of normal tariff incidence a positive share smaller than one will

suffice to maintain workers utility at the pre—tariff level.

               What will happen to capitalists welfare? We can define A             as the

wage earners share that would keep capitalists' utility constant:



       (25b)        x=
                              e+e
                               ef+   ef


               Clearly            is decreasing in A (since A is the wage earners share);

also      >    A   from (22a,b). Therefore if A is set at A*, capitalists welfare

will always increase (as long as c> 0; see below).

              Another way of seeing this is by assigning equal weight to welfare

gains and looking at national income (in terms of foreign goods) for any
                                                        *

                     udf       +
                                     udf
                                           = (X—e — ) + (Af—(l—A)e f+(].—A)ef —A f)

                            dii                     d

which of course is a familiar result. Since A is set to make e            = 0
                                                                 u   df         ,


(23) immediately gives us the expression for capitalists' welfare: This

establishes my claim that capitalists' welfare will always increase as long as

    O


         So using part of the tariff revenues to finance wage subsidies does

provide a way around the problems of Section 3. Extension to two periods is

straightforward and will show a positive CA response. Before jumping to

conclusions however, a cautionary note is in order. Affecting the current

account calls for intervention to change the terms of trade between goods

today and goods tomorrow (the real interest rate). Achieving this end by also

introducing within period relative price distortions such as a temporary

tariff is clearly suboptimal under the assumption made.



5. Conclusions

         The main purpose of this paper is to show that the traditional

analysis of current account and employment effects of tariffs in the "open

economy model" literature is very sensitive to arbitrary assumptions

habitually made about wage and savings behavior. Section 2 analysed the

current account response to temporary and permanent tariffs under savings

behavior derived from intertemporal. optimization rather than arbitrary

consumption functions; wages follow a contract theory type real wage

indexation rule. We kept the structure of the Mundell—Fleming model

traditionally used in macro—oriented discussions of tariffs to facilitate

comparison with that literature.

         In the case of labour market clearing real wages a permanent increase

in tariffs is shown to leave the current account unaffected under reasonable

symmetry assumptions, since the income effects caused by tariffs induced terms
 SV—039/SVD/04--17—87                   23




 of trade changes are the same (per unit of time) in both periods and the

consumption rate of interest does not change. A temporary tariff increase

"today" however leads to a stronger term of trade induced income effect today

than tomorrow; moreover, the current period apreciation caused by a temporary

tariff is larger than the second period terms of trade improvement, leading to

an increase in the consumption rate of interest. Both factors lead to a CA

improvement as a consequence of temporary first period tariffs.

          Real wage indexation is shown to potentially modify these results.

In the Mundell—Fleining context of complete specialization, tariffs are shown

to increase the domestic real product wage if wages are indexed on the CPI.

This in turn implies that an increase in tariffs, if unanticipated at the time

first period wage contracts were concluded, will inevitably lead to

unemployment via the resulting upward pressure on the real domestic product

wage. This holds for both temporary and permanent increases in tariffs. As a

consequence first period output and therefore income declines, contributing a

negative element to the current account response. In the limiting case of an

infinite foreign demand elasticity (small country assumption) this negative

element is shown to dominate: in that case a permanent increase in tariffs

will lead to more unemployment, a fall in first period real output and a

current account deficit.

         Temporary first period increases in tariffs will under real wage

indexation also lead to more unemployment and less first period real output,

but the increase in the real consumption rate of interest they also cause may

(or may not) offset the negative effect on the current account of the fall in

first period income associated with the increase in unemployment. Even if the

CA response is positive it will always be less than the corresponding CA

response to temporary tariffs without real wage indexation.

                            Endogenizing the World Interest Rate



          Endogenizing the world interest rate r (or, equivalently, the world

discount factor 6) is straightforward. We will provide only a sketch of the

results one should expect; a full discussion of the interaction between

commercial policy and world interest rates can be found in van Wijnbergen

(1986).

          If current and future goods are imperfect substitutes, we need to

 incorporate one of the two commodity market clearing conditions for foreign

 goods. We choose the one for current (as opposed to future) foreign goods:



 (B.1)    X =E +E
           1
                f1     1

 Manipulation of B.1, budget constraints and the first period home goods

 equilibrium equation yields an equivalent condition that the first period

world current account has to equal zero: 1/



(B.2)    CA1 + CA1 = 0



Or:




(B.3)    P1X1+t1Ef —        E       +X— *E* =0
                       1        l    1
                                         11   11


         A straightforward result follows from (15a). If a permanent tariff

changes p1 as much as it changes p2, it will leave both CA1 and CA1

unaffected for given world interest rates. But then, if B.2 held before the

change in commercial policy, it will also hold after the change in commercial

policy. Hence, in that case, the world interest rate will be unaffected.

         A second simple result emerges in the case where current domestic and

foreign goods are close substitutes, so that the tariff change does not affect

the terms of trade very much. Equation (18) shows an ex ante CA decline for




1/       Private budget constraints at home an abroad guarantee that, if B.2
         holds, the world CA will also equal zero in period two.

given world interest rates in that case; to restore equilibrium in world

capital markets (so that B.2 holds again), the world interest rate needs to

rise. Unbalanced initial CA (and offsetting CA*) positions will add income

effects in a predictable manner.
