                                         ABSTRACT

We provide the first evidence on the relationship between disability programs and markers of
financial distress: bankruptcy, foreclosure, eviction, and home sale. Rates of these adverse
financial events peak around the time of disability application and subsequently fall for both
allowed and denied applicants. To estimate the causal effect of disability programs on these
outcomes, we use variation induced by an age-based eligibility rule and find that disability
allowance substantially reduces the likelihood of adverse financial events. Within three years of
the decision, the likelihood of bankruptcy falls by 0.81 percentage point (30 percent), and the
likelihood of foreclosure and home sale among homeowners falls by 1.7 percentage points (30
percent) and 2.5 percentage points (20 percent), respectively. We find suggestive evidence of
reductions in eviction rates. Conversely, the likelihood of home purchases increases by 0.86
percentage point (20 percent) within three years. We present evidence that these changes reflect
true reductions in financial distress. In our model of optimal disability benefits, considering
these extreme events increases optimal disability benefits and potentially shortens waiting times.

More than 6 percent of working-age adults in the United States receive disability bene-
fits through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program or the Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) program. The expansion of these programs over the past decades
has prompted a public debate about their costs and benefits. On the cost side, disability
programs can distort decisions about work and human-capital investment. On the benefits
side, disability programs can provide protection against major consumption shocks such as
disability.
    Research on disability programs has focused mostly on the costs of these programs, espe-
cially on their labor-supply e↵ects, which are often interpreted as moral-hazard costs. Several
studies have found that allowance onto disability insurance reduces labor force participation
by about 30 percentage points.1 If interpreted as moral hazard, these labor supply e↵ects
suggest that disability programs involve some disincentive costs.
   Yet there is little evidence on the other side of the analysis, the benefits of disability
programs. To our knowledge, there are no quasi-experimental studies that assess the e↵ects
of US disability programs on outcomes other than labor supply and mortality.2 In the
absence of such studies, evidence on how disability programs a↵ect quality of life, residential
stability, and consumption is mostly anecdotal. In Evicted, Matthew Desmond writes of a
recipient of the SSI program that “her $754 monthly [SSI] check was more reliable than any
job she could get,” and explains that landlords seek out SSI recipients because their stable
income makes them reliable tenants (Desmond, 2016). These hypotheses have yet to be
tested in empirical research.
    This paper presents the first evidence on the e↵ect of disability programs on financial
outcomes. We link administrative records from the Social Security Administration’s (SSA)
SSDI and SSI programs to records on bankruptcy, foreclosure, eviction, home purchases, and
home sales.3 These financial outcomes are not direct measures of consumption or well-being.

       Bound (1989) uses the labor supply of denied disability-insurance applicants as an upper bound for
allowed applicants, concluding that employment among disability-insurance recipients would be, at most, 30
percentage points higher had they been denied. Updating Bound’s analysis, von Wachter et al. (2011) find
similar e↵ects for older cohorts and larger e↵ects for younger cohorts. Chen and van der Klaauw (2008) find
smaller employment e↵ects for more-recent applicants. Maestas et al. (2013) and French and Song (2014) use
examiner- and judge-based fixed-e↵ects instruments to estimate labor-supply e↵ects of around 30 percentage
points. Moore (2015) estimates similar e↵ects for disability recipients whose eligibility based on drug and
alcohol addiction was terminated as part of the 1996 welfare reform law.
     2
       Autor et al. (Forthcoming) study the e↵ects of disability benefits receipt on consumption in Norway,
and Gelber et al. (2018) study the e↵ect of disability benefits on mortality in the US. Meyer and Mok (2018)
study di↵erences in the consumption drop surrounding disability for those who receive disability benefits
and those who do not. Low and Pistaferri (2015) model the role of disability benefits and their interaction
with other welfare programs in insuring the consumption of disability recipients.
     3
       All of the non-SSA data we study exist in the public domain. Gross and Trenkamp (2015) were the
first to link bankruptcy data to SSA administrative data.


                                                     1
They are rather “tail events,” events that occur infrequently and are associated with large
drops in consumption. In the absence of administrative data on consumption, studying these
extreme events sheds light on fluctuations in consumption that would otherwise be entirely
unobservable.
    Using this novel dataset, we document three descriptive facts. First, rates of bankruptcy,
foreclosure, and eviction among applicants are higher than in the general population, sug-
gesting that disability applicants are more likely to experience financial distress. Second,
for disability applicants, rates of these adverse financial events increase leading up to the
application date and peak around the application date. This trend indicates that disability
applicants apply for disability programs when they are in relatively high financial distress.
Third, these adverse financial events become less common after the disability decision, even
for initially denied applicants, suggesting that applicants find other margins of adjustment.
    This evidence of selection e↵ects and time e↵ects points to the need for causal identifica-
tion of the e↵ect of disability programs on financial outcomes. To identify the causal e↵ect,
we exploit an administrative rule that governs how the SSA evaluates applicants. During the
fifth step of the initial determination process, SSA examiners decide whether an applicant
can work in some capacity given his or her disability as well as vocational factors such as age,
education, and experience. SSA guidelines require examiners to use more-lenient standards
for older applicants. Applicants who are older than age 55 at the time of decision are judged
using more-lenient standards than applicants between ages 50 and 55, who in turn are judged
using more-lenient standards than applicants below age 50. These age-based rules, first used
by Chen and van der Klaauw (2008) to estimate the e↵ect of disability insurance on labor
supply, allow us to isolate the causal e↵ect of disability receipt on financial outcomes.
    The results suggest that being allowed onto disability programs at the initial level (before
appeals) results in large declines in rates of bankruptcy, foreclosure, and home sale. Initial
allowance reduces the likelihood of filing for bankruptcy by a statistically significant 0.81
percentage point, or 30 percent, in the next three years. For homeowners, the likelihood
of experiencing foreclosure in the three years after initial decision falls by 1.7 percentage
points (30 percent) and the likelihood of selling a home falls by 2.5 percentage points (20
percent), both statistically significant at conventional levels. We find suggestive evidence
that eviction rates also decline as a result of disability allowance, though the estimates
are imprecise. Allowance onto disability programs also increases home purchases by 0.86
percentage point (20 percent). Most of the change in housing transactions is driven by
allowed applicants becoming first-time homeowners or being less likely to sell their home
overall, not by a change in the likelihood of moving from one home to another. These results
suggest that some program recipients use their benefits to purchase homes or to stay in


                                               2
homes that they might otherwise have sold or lost to foreclosure.
    Of course, these financial outcomes are not direct measures of recipient welfare. We out-
line the assumptions required to interpret the declines in adverse financial events as a “wealth
e↵ect:” true reductions in financial distress due to the transfer of cash and health insurance,
and therefore improvements in recipient welfare. We consider alternative mechanisms, such
as changes in access to credit and demand for credit. We conclude based on evidence from
several sources that they are unlikely to drive the results and, if anything, would lead us to
underestimate the wealth e↵ect.
    To consider the welfare implications of these results, we use our estimates to extend
the standard calculations of optimal-benefit levels in two ways. First, we incorporate tail
consumption risk into optimal-benefits calculations. Standard calculations of optimal-benefit
levels use the di↵erence between mean consumption in the good state of the world and mean
consumption in the bad state of the world as a sufficient statistic for the welfare gains
from insurance. However, risk-averse agents care about the likelihood of extreme losses in
consumption in addition to mean consumption. We map the “tail events” that we observe
into consumption changes using survey data. Foreclosure, for example, is associated with an
annual $6,300 drop in consumption, based on an event-study analysis using the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics. We find that the optimal annual benefit increases by several hundred
dollars when we use these estimates of tail consumption risk in optimal-benefits calculations.
This increase would likely be even larger considering e↵ects along the entire consumption
distribution.
    Second, we extend the standard calculations of optimal-benefit levels to consider spillovers
to third parties from disability programs. We focus on higher property values for neighboring
property owners from the reduction in foreclosures, though there could be other spillovers
from disability programs. We find that the optimal annual benefit amount increases by ap-
proximately one hundred dollars when considering spillovers to neighboring property owners.
Another way to put the property-related spillovers in context is to compare them to the e↵ect
of the disability programs on earnings. Disability allowance reduces labor market earnings by
$3,300 over three years; it increases housing values due to an averted foreclosure by roughly
$2,400, which is 70 percent of the decrease in earnings.4
    Finally, we consider the implications of our results for the optimal timing of disability
benefits. Descriptively, we find that disability applicants apply for the program when they
are in high financial distress, both relative to the general population and relative to their own

   4
      We quantify this positive externality and incorporate it into calculation of the marginal value of pub-
lic funds (MVPF) for disability programs (Hendren, 2016). The positive spillovers due to reductions in
bankruptcy and foreclosure increase the MVPF of disability programs from 0.99 to 1.04.

                                                     3
histories. Causally, we find that disability benefits reduce financial distress substantially. All
else equal, these facts together make the case for shorter wait times, though they must be
weighed against the administrative costs and potential selection e↵ects of shorter wait times.
      The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 describes the datasets and data-merge proce-
dures. Section 2 presents descriptive facts on financial outcomes for the disability-applicant
population. Section 3 describes the age-based eligibility rule, presents preliminary visual
evidence of the causal e↵ect, and presents IV estimates of the e↵ect of disability programs
on financial outcomes. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications for recipient and social
welfare and presents optimal benefit calculations, and Section 6 concludes.


1       Institutional Background and Data

1.1     Background on Disability Programs and the Financial Outcomes We Study

SSA administers the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security
Income (SSI) programs. SSDI and SSI have the same medical requirements but di↵erent
non-medical requirements. SSDI requires an earnings history.5 SSI requires applicants to
have low income and low assets. Individuals can apply for and receive benefits from both
programs concurrently if they meet both sets of requirements. If applicants are allowed onto
both programs, the SSI benefit is reduced by approximately the amount of the SSDI benefit.
   The non-medical eligibility of both disability programs also requires applicants not to
engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA). The SGA threshold for 2017 was $1,170 per
month, which means that applicants will be denied for benefits if they earn more than
$1,170 a month on average. The average monthly benefit for SSDI in 2017 was $1,197 and
the maximum monthly benefit for SSI for an individual was $735.6 Program rules prohibit
disability recipients from performing SGA and receiving disability benefits at the same time.
     Bankruptcy is a legal procedure available to debtors overwhelmed by their debts. Bankruptcy
filers can either file for Chapter 7 and have their debts discharged entirely, or file for Chap-
ter 13 and commit to a repayment plan. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act (BAPCPA) of 2005 imposed a means test for Chapter 7 discharge, and the
number of bankruptcy filings, particularly Chapter 7, plummeted after 2005 as a result of
this reform.7 Filing for either type of bankruptcy is expensive; bankruptcy attorney fees

widower applies based on their spouse’s earnings history.

     Before 2005, consumers could choose under which chapter they wanted to file. Filers faced a tradeo↵:
under Chapter 7, their “non-exempt” assets would be divided among their creditors, while under Chapter 13,


                                                    4
typically cost at least $1,000, and many households must thus “save up” for bankruptcy
(Gross et al., 2016).
   In contrast to bankruptcy, the foreclosure process is initiated by a lender in response to
a borrower who has become delinquent on a secured loan. The mortgage lender first issues
a precaution notification and only then may choose to pursue a forced home sale in order to
recover the remaining mortgage debt. Depending on state law, the time required to complete
a foreclosure process varies from six months to eighteen months. In some cases, lenders and
homeowners can reach an agreement or negotiate a settlement plan so that the debtors can
keep the home.
     Eviction is a legal process that landlords use to remove tenants for failing to pay rent or
breaking other terms of the lease.8 After an initial grace period, a landlord can choose to
file a request with the court and the tenant will be served. If the judge grants the landlords
request, an order is placed with the sheri↵ and the sheri↵ evicts the tenant. Depending on
jurisdiction and case backlogs, the entire eviction process varies from 30 days to more than
six months.

1.2    Merging Social Security Disability Records to Financial Records

We link administrative records from the Social Security Administration to records on bankrupt-
cies, foreclosures, evictions, and home transactions. Figure 1 summarizes the data merges.
We start with an extract of the SSA 831 Disability File (F831) that includes the universe
of disability applicants who received a disability decision between 2000 and 2014. The F831
files provide identifiers, including Social Security number (SSN), first name, last name, mid-
dle initial, and ZIP Code of residence; application history, including the dates of application
and initial decision and the reason for the decision; and demographic information, including
body system code, specific diagnosis, and, for those who are allowed, medical diary reason,
which determines the frequency of continuing disability reviews. For the purposes of the
quasi-experimental analysis, we use the classification of regulation basis codes in the F831
files developed by Wixon and Strand (2013). We then link the F831 extract to extracts
of several other SSA datasets. The Master Beneficiary Record (MBR) provides the final

they would not lose their assets. Social Security benefits are excluded from the means test, and so allowance
onto a disability program does not mechanically a↵ect the choice of bankruptcy chapter (Social Security
Rulings 79–4).
    8
      “Formal” eviction involves both removing the tenant and recovering back rent, while “summary” eviction
involves only removing the tenant. Both processes involve legal filings with a court, but many landlords prefer
summary eviction as it is relatively easy to file without the assistance of an attorney and the procedure is
shorter. There are also “informal eviction” cases where tenants are forced to end their lease due to difficulties,
such as large increases in rent, created by landlords. As these cases do not involve any court filing, we are
not able to observe these cases in our data.

provides annual earnings for all workers. The Structured Data Repository (SDR) provides

  Notes: This figure describes the identifiers we use to link the administrative records. We start with
  Social Security Administration records: disability-program applications from 2000–2014 from the 831
  Disability File (F831), disability-program decisions from the Master Beneficiary Record (MBR) and
  Supplemental Security Record (SSR), and earnings from the Master Earnings File (MEF). We then
  link the SSA data to bankruptcy records compiled by Gross et al. (2016), to foreclosure records from
  CoreLogic, to deeds records from CoreLogic and Zillow, and to eviction records obtained from AIRS.
  We use the CoreLogic and Zillow data to establish a sample of homeowners for the foreclosure sample
  and non-homeowners for the eviction sample. “SSN4” indicates the last four digits of Social Security
  number. “FN” indicates first name, “LN” indicates last name, and “MI” indicates middle initial.



    We link the SSA data to public records on several financial outcomes: bankruptcies,
foreclosures, evictions, and home deeds. We summarize the merge procedures here and
provide more detail in Appendix A. Bankruptcy records, collected by Gross et al. (2016),
consist of a near-census of personal bankruptcies for a majority of bankruptcy districts from
the mid-1990s through 2009 (2011 for some districts). The bankruptcy records list the names
and last four digits of SSN of the filers, date of filing, chapter, and address. We link SSA
records to these bankruptcy records using primarily the last four digits of SSN, first name,
last name, middle initial, and state.9
    We combine records on home transactions from two sources, CoreLogic and Zillow, so as
to ensure that the coverage is as comprehensive as possible. The combined data covers home

   9
     To account for potential variations in the first name (such as “Tom” versus “Thomas”), we also use
alternative merges based on the last four digits of SSN, last name, ZIP Code, and state.


                                                                                      6
purchases and sales across the United States from 1983 to 2016.10 These records include seller
and buyer names, transaction dates and amounts, property ZIP Code, and characteristics of
the house.11 We remove blank entries, duplicate transaction records, commercial properties,
and intra-family transfers.
   The housing records do not include unique individual identifiers such as SSN. For that
reason, we merge the SSA records to housing transactions based on first name, last name,
middle initial, and ZIP Code. These merge variables could be problematic if di↵erent resi-
dents of the same ZIP Code have the same name. For that reason, we drop individuals with
more than six transactions associated with their names and ZIP Codes, which consist of
less than 1 percent of the sample population for most states. We use this merge to identify
homeownership, home sales, and home purchases.
    We use CoreLogic foreclosure records from 2004 to 2016. We remove blank entries,
duplicate records, commercial properties, records with missing or invalid names, and records
in which cases were settled without the properties being auctioned. In addition, we drop ZIP
Codes from our initial record linkage process if defendant names are missing in more than 10
percent of the foreclosure records. Our main foreclosure sample comes from the population
of homeowners identified in the CoreLogic-Zillow deeds data. As a validity check, we link
the foreclosure records to the home deeds and find that 82 percent of the foreclosure records
link to a deeds record. We link the SSA disability records to the foreclosure records using
first name, last name, middle initial, and ZIP Code.
    We use eviction records from American Information Research Services (AIRS), which
collects public-record eviction court filings covering nearly 40 percent of the U.S. residential
areas for various time periods. In addition, we collect eviction court filings in Harris County,
Texas, from the county court’s website. Each eviction court filing provides defendant names,
filing date, and judgment information. We drop blank records and records with invalid
names or ZIP Codes. In addition, we remove eviction filings that have been dismissed or
settled. Our main eviction sample comes from the population of non-homeowners identified
in the CoreLogic-Zillow deeds data. We map ZIP Code to FIPS county code to address high
mobility among the renter population, and we merge eviction records from 2005 to 2016 to
  10
      Data provided by Zillow through the Zillow Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX). More
information on accessing the Zillow data can be found at http://www.zillow.com/ztrax. The results and
opinions are those of the authors and do not reflect the position of Zillow Group. Based on conversations
with sta↵ at CoreLogic and Zillow Research, the availability and quality of deeds varies across counties and
time. To avoid analysis on small cells or areas with poor coverage, we keep ZIP Codes with an average of at
least fifteen home purchases or fifteen home sales per year between 2000 and 2014.
   11
      We observe sales dates in most cases and some other dates such as filing dates and signature dates.
These dates are usually the same or within 10 days of each other. In our data harmonization process, we
use the earliest dates as transaction dates. We provide more details on the construction of home transaction
data in Appendix A.

available.12
   Appendix A discusses the reliability of each merge. The bankruptcy merge is the most
reliable because it involves full name and last four digits of SSN, a near-unique combination.
Using the bankruptcy data, we simulate the foreclosure and deeds merges by dropping the
last four digits of SSN as an identifier, and we simulate the eviction merge by additionally
dropping middle name. Dropping those identifiers results in some attenuation of the causal
estimate, but does not substantially reduce the quality of the merge.
      With the exception of the bankruptcy data, each of the merges between the SSA records
and financial records requires using ZIP Code or FIPS county code as a key linking variable.
The SSA records provide the applicant’s ZIP Code of residence at the time of application;
if the applicant moved before or after applying, we do not observe the other ZIP Codes in
which that applicant lived. Of course, not observing all ZIP Codes of residence will a↵ect the
number of financial events that we observe. Appendix B shows that this issue likely causes
attenuation of the estimates of the causal e↵ect of disability allowance on home purchases,
eviction, and foreclosure. As long as disability allowance does not shift home purchases
(or evictions or foreclosures) that would have occurred anyway (i.e., inframarginal home
purchases) from the application ZIP Code to other ZIP Codes, then this data issue will solely
bias us against finding an e↵ect. However, if disability allowance does shift inframarginal
home purchases from within- to outside-ZIP (or vice versa), then the sign of the bias cannot
always be determined. The same conclusions apply to merges using FIPS county codes.

1.3     Sample Statistics

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction samples.
The first column for each outcome corresponds to the full sample, and the second column to
the sample we use for the quasi-experimental analysis in Section 3. The bankruptcy sample
includes disability-program applicants who have an initial decision date between 2000 and
2009 and reside in a ZIP Code with an average of at least five recorded bankruptcies per
year over the 1992–2011 period covered by the bankruptcy data. The average applicant in
this sample has less than a high school education (11.5 years) and annual earnings of $14,300
prior to the initial decision. Thirty-five percent of the sample is allowed at the initial level
and 54 percent is eventually allowed after all appeals. Bankruptcy rates are high: 12 percent
ever file for bankruptcy between 1992 and 2011, with 10 percent ever filing for Chapter 7
and 2 percent ever filing for Chapter 13.
  12
    The availability of middle names is substantially lower in the eviction data (15 percent) than in the
deeds (70 percent) or foreclosure records (55 percent).

    Notes: This table presents summary statistics for the bankruptcy, foreclosure (conditional on homeownership), and eviction (conditional on non-
    homeownership) samples, and within each of these samples for the “full sample” and for the “quasi-experimental sample” used in Section 3. The
    “bankruptcy sample” consists of disability-program applicants who have an initial decision date in 2000–2009. The “foreclosure sample” consists
    of disability-program applicants who appear in the deeds records (homeowners) and who have an initial decision date in 2005–2014. The “eviction
    sample” consists of disability-program applicants who do not appear in the deeds records (non-homeowners) and who have an initial decision in
    2005–2014. Samples involving “foreclosure” and “bankruptcy” outcomes exclude ZIP Codes of residence at application that have an average of
    fewer than five recorded events per year during the corresponding period; samples involving “eviction” outcomes exclude FIPS county codes of
    residence at application that have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded events per year during the corresponding period. “Reaching step 5”
    denotes reaching step 5 of the disability determination process as depicted in Appendix Figure A.3. “Pre-decision annual earnings” are average
    annual earnings in the three years before the decision date. “Ever experience financial event” and “experience event before/after decision” are
    indicators for filing for bankruptcy, experiencing foreclosure, or experiencing eviction. “Number of states” includes the District of Columbia for
    the foreclosure sample.
   The foreclosure sample consists of applicants who have an initial decision date between
2005 and 2014 and reside in a ZIP Code with an average of at least five recorded foreclosures
over the 2005–2014 period covered by the foreclosure data. Because we condition the foreclo-
sure sample on homeownership, the applicants in the foreclosure sample are more-educated
and higher-income than the applicants in the bankruptcy sample. The average applicant in

  Notes: This table presents summary statistics for the home-sale and home-purchase samples, and within
  each sample for the “full sample” and for the “quasi-experimental sample” used in Section 3. The home-
  sale sample consists of disability-program applicants who appear in the deeds records (homeowners) and
  who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014. The home-purchase sample consist of disability-program
  applicants who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014. Each sample excludes ZIP Codes of residence
  at application that have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded events per year during 2000–2014.
  “Reaching step 5” denotes reaching step 5 of the disability determination process as depicted in Ap-
  pendix Figure A.3. “Pre-decision annual earnings” are average annual earnings in the three years before
  the decision date. “Ever experience event” and “experience event before/after decision” are indicator
  functions for home purchases or sales. “Number of states” includes the District of Columbia.



this sample is a high school graduate (12.3 years of education) and average annual pre-
decision earnings are $20,800. SSDI applicants are disproportionately represented relative
to SSI applicants, and applicants are less likely to have mental conditions and more likely
to have musculoskeletal conditions compared to the bankruptcy sample. Foreclosure rates
among these home-owning applicants are high: 13 percent of the sample ever experiences a
foreclosure between 2004 and 2016.13

  13
       In the foreclosure sample that is unconditional on homeownership, roughly 3 percent applicants ever


                                                        10
    The eviction sample consists of applicants who do not appear in homeowner records and
who apply from the 16 states for which we have eviction records. Average annual pre-decision
earnings are lower than in the bankruptcy sample since the eviction sample is conditioned
on non-homeownership. Eighteen percent of applicants ever experience eviction over the
2005–2014 period covered by the eviction data.
   Table 2 presents summary statistics for the home-sale and home-purchase samples. The
home-sale sample is conditioned on homeownership and therefore looks similar to the fore-
closure sample. Nearly one-half of home-owning applicants sell a home over the 1986–2015
period for which we have deeds data. The home-purchase sample consists of applicants who
have an initial decision date between 2005 and 2014 and reside in a ZIP Code with at least
fifteen home purchases over the 2000–2015 period. Since it is not conditioned on homeown-
ership, this sample looks more similar to the bankruptcy sample, with relatively low incomes
and low education levels. Of this sample, 18 percent of applicants ever purchase a home
between 1983 and 2016.


2    Descriptive Facts on Disability Applicants and Financial Outcomes

Fact 1: Disability applicants have higher rates of adverse financial events than
the general population.

We first compare rates of adverse financial events in the disability-applicant population to
rates of adverse financial events in the general population. Figure 2 plots annual bankruptcy
rates, foreclosure rates, and eviction rates for disability-program applicants and the general
population. Unconditional rates are given by the opaque bars, and rates conditional on
homeownership (for foreclosure) and non-homeownership (for eviction) are given by the
translucent bars.
    Bankruptcy rates are slightly higher in the disability-applicant population relative to the
general population in the year that applicants apply for disability benefits; they are slightly
lower three years before application, which could be mechanical since bankruptcy is a rare
event. For foreclosure, disability applicants have lower rates when we do not condition on
homeownership, since disability applicants are less likely than the general population to be
homeowners. Conditioning on homeownership, however, we find that foreclosure rates peak
in the year of disability application at twice the rate of the general population. Eviction
rates are much higher in the disability-applicant population than in the general population
when we do not condition on non-homeownership, especially in the year of the disability

experience foreclosure. Foreclosure rates unconditional on homeownership are substantially lower, since
applicants are less likely to be homeowners.


                                                  11
application. Conditioning on non-homeowner (renter) status makes the eviction rate in the
disability-applicant population and general population comparable.
    The spike in adverse financial events in the year of disability application has several
possible interpretations: disability applicants may apply for disability benefits in response
to a financial shock, or a health shock or other type of shock may lead to both disability
application and financial distress. To investigate the timing of financial shocks and dis-
ability application more closely, we next estimate event-study regressions around disability
application and disability decision.

 Notes: This figure presents bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction rates among the general population
 and the disability-program applicants across di↵erent application cohorts. Unconditional rates are in
 opaque bars, and conditional foreclosure (homeowners) and eviction (non-homeowners) rates are in
 translucent bars. The unconditional bankruptcy sample consists of disability-program applicants who
 have an initial decision date in 2000–2009. The unconditional foreclosure and eviction sample consists of
 disability-program applicants who have an initial decision date in 2005–2014. The conditional foreclosure
 sample consists of disability-program applicants who appear in the deeds records (homeowners) and who
 have an initial decision date in 2005–2014. The conditional eviction sample consists of disability-program
 applicants who are non-homeowners at the time of experiencing evictions and who have an initial decision
 in 2005–2014. Samples involving bankruptcy and foreclosure outcomes exclude ZIP Codes of residence
 at application that have an average of fewer than five recorded events per year during the corresponding
 period; samples involving eviction outcomes exclude FIPS county codes of residence at application that
 have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded events per year during 2005–2014. The denominator of
 the bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction rates for the general population is calculated using the 2010
 Census population for individuals 18 years or older.


Fact 2: Rates of adverse financial events exhibit an “Ashenfelter’s peak” around
the time of disability application.

In Appendix Section C, we develop the following event-study specification to explore how the
risk of bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction evolve around the time of disability application

Here, Yct is a financial outcome for cohort c in month t, where cohort is defined by appli-

an indicator functions for being approved for disability benefits at initial decision. The ⌧d
coefficients give the financial outcome in initial-decision event time for the denied, controlling
                                              0
for application event time; the sum ⌧d + ⌧d gives this value for the allowed. Similarly, the
  0                                                                                              0
µ⌧a give the financial outcome in application event time for the denied and the sum µa⌧ + µ⌧a
give this value for the allowed, controlling for initial-decision event time.
    This specification is a standard event-study specification that we adapt to control for
both application event time and decision event time. Since the initial decision usually occurs
within a year of application, it is important to separate time trends around the two dates.
If, for example, there is selection into the timing of application, we might mis-attribute a
pattern that is associated with the application to the decision instead. This strategy exploits
variation in examiner decision time to identify the patterns around application and decision
separately.
   Figure 3 presents the application-event-time coefficients and decision-event-time coeffi-
cients from equation (1), with the mean of the outcome at event month 0 added to all event
months. For all three adverse events, the application-event-time coefficients (left-hand side
of Figure 3) suggest that financial distress peaks around the time of application and then
falls, even after controlling for decision event time. In other words, applicants apply for
disability benefits after a period of increasing financial distress. It could be that a deteriora-
tion in health increases financial distress and drives disability-program application, or that
high financial distress drives application. The peak in bankruptcy filings is just after the
application date while the peak in foreclosures is a few months later, likely because there are
multiple steps between default and foreclosure.14

Fact 3: Rates of adverse financial events decline for both allowed and denied
applicants after the initial disability decision.

The decision-event-time coefficients (right-hand side of Figure 3) suggest a downward trend in
bankruptcies, foreclosures, and evictions for both allowed and denied applicants preceding

  14
    The fall in bankruptcies, foreclosures, and evictions after the application date could reflect households
making other adjustments in consumption and saving. Or it could be a mechanical decline if most of the
households at risk for these events have already experienced them.

sample consists of disability-program applicants who do not appear in the deeds records (non-homeowners)
and who have an initial decision in 2005–2014. Samples involving “foreclosure” and “bankruptcy” outcomes
exclude ZIP Codes of residence at application that have an average of fewer than five recorded events per
year during the corresponding period; samples involving “eviction” outcomes exclude FIPS county codes of
residence at application that have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded events per year during 2005–2014.

the decision, controlling for application date. After the initial decision, bankruptcy rates
continue falling for the denied, but they decline further for the allowed. This is suggestive
evidence that allowance onto disability programs reduces the risk of bankruptcy relative
to denials. However, the graph also makes clear that considering only the trend for the
allowed would lead to an overestimate of the decline in bankruptcies attributable to disability
allowance, since bankruptcy risk also declines for the denied.15 Denied applicants may find
other margins of adjustment that reduce their financial distress following their denial from
the program. For foreclosures and evictions, the rates of these events exhibit a sharper drop
for the allowed relative to the denied immediately after the initial decision, though the trends
eventually converge.

Interpreting the descriptive facts

Where do these descriptive facts lead us? First, they suggest that applicants apply to
disability programs when they are facing substantial financial distress, both relative to the
general population and relative to their own histories. This peak in financial distress at
application means that the cash transfer from disability benefits could potentially produce
large reductions in financial distress. Indeed, the trends around disability decision provide
suggestive, though not conclusive, evidence that disability programs reduce financial distress.
Second, these facts indicate that application timing is non-random and that even denied
applicants experience declines in financial distress following their initial decision. Given this
evidence of selection and trends in event time, we conclude that estimating the causal e↵ect
of disability programs on financial outcomes requires a quasi-experimental strategy. We turn
to such a strategy next.


3        Quasi-Experimental Estimates of the E↵ect of Disability Receipt
         on Financial Outcomes

To estimate the causal e↵ect of disability programs on financial outcomes, we use age-based
variation in eligibility for disability programs.16 SSA evaluates disability applicants with a
five-step process, described in Appendix Figure A.3. During the first two steps, examiners
deny applicants if they have engaged in substantial gainful activity since onset of their
disability (step 1) or if their impairment is not considered severe (step 2). During step 3,
    15
      This is true even after controlling for final decision date, in which some of the initially denied are allowed
on appeal.
   16
      Chen and van der Klaauw (2008) originally used the age-55 threshold, along with data from the Survey
of Income and Program Participation linked to SSA application and award data, to study the e↵ect of
receiving disability benefits on labor supply.

                                                        15
applicants with listed medical impairments are allowed onto the program. During step 4,
applicants are denied if the examiner deems that they could still do the work that they had
done before the disability onset.
    Finally, during step 5, examiners evaluate whether the applicants who cannot do past
work can adjust to another type of work. Examiners first determine the individual’s maxi-
mum work capability (e.g., sedentary, light, heavy, etc.) and then divide applicants in these
groups into cells based on age, education, previous work experience, and the nature of their
past work.17 We exploit SSA guidelines instructing disability examiners to use more-lenient
standards for applicants who are above ages 50 and 55 relative to those below ages 50 and
55 at step 5.18

  Notes: This figure plots the initial allowance rate by disability-program applicant age at step 5 of the
  disability determination process. This figure is based on the home-purchase sample: applicants who
  reach step 5 of the disability determination process, who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014, and
  whose ZIP Code of residence at application has an average of at least fifteen recorded home purchases
  per year during this period.


    Figure 4 plots initial allowance rate by age at decision and so describes the age-based
variation that we exploit to identify the e↵ects of disability benefits. The initial allowance
rate jumps at ages 50 and 55 because examiners are instructed to use the more-lenient
standards at these cuto↵s.19 There exists a trend break six months before the cuto↵, with
increasing initial allowance rates up to the threshold. This trend break is driven by the
SSA’s “borderline age rule,” which allows examiners discretion in applying the more-lenient
standards to applicants near the cuto↵. The rule tells examiners: “If a claimant is within

       We use the classification of Wixon and Strand (2013) to map the “regulation basis code” in the F831
files into steps.
    19
       There also exists a threshold at age 45, but in practice the discontinuity in allowance rates at age 45 is
close to zero.


                                                                                    16
a few days to a few months of reaching a higher age category and using the chronological
age results in a denial, consider using the higher age category if it results in a favorable
determination, after you evaluate all factors.”20
   The approximately 130 disability determination services (DDS) offices exercise discretion
in implementing the borderline age rule. Some offices ignore the rule entirely and treat
applicants in the “borderline” period the same as the other applicants below the cuto↵. Other
offices fully implement the borderline age rule such that an increasing fraction of applicants
in the borderline period are allowed. Still others partially implement the borderline age rule
such that there is an increasing fraction of applicants allowed in the borderline period but
still a jump in allowance rates at the age cuto↵. We take advantage of the variation across
offices in the implementation of the borderline age rule in our estimation strategy.
      Who are the applicants a↵ected by this quasi-experiment? The least-severe applicants
are denied in earlier steps of the process and the most-severe applicants are allowed in earlier
steps of the process. As a result, the applicants who are evaluated in step 5 have conditions
that do not meet the medical listings but are still potentially severe and often hard-to-verify.
Tables 1 and 2 suggest that relative to the full samples, the quasi-experimental samples have
higher earnings and are more likely to have a musculoskeletal condition and less likely to
have a mental condition.

3.1     Estimation Strategies

The borderline age rule makes this age-based variation similar to but distinct from a stan-
dard regression discontinuity design. We deal with this unconventional feature of the quasi-
experiment by using three alternative estimation strategies and we find that they lead to
similar estimates. The first is a standard regression discontinuity design. We present esti-
mates from a standard RD specification that stacks the age 50 and age 55 cuto↵s:

                 Yi = ↵ +       {Agei > 0} + Agei +          {Agei > 0} ⇥ Agei + "i .                  (2)

In this specification, Yi is an outcome for applicant i, Agei is the applicant’s age at decision,
and {Agei > 0} is an indicator for applicant’s age at decision being greater than the age
cuto↵ (either 50 or 55 years, normalized to zero).
    The second estimation strategy is a “donut” regression discontinuity that excludes ap-
plicants with a borderline age. Since the applicants in the five months before the cuto↵ are
partially treated, the donut specification drops them from the estimation of equation (2).
  20
     SSA guidance (DI 25015.006) does not give a precise cuto↵ for what constitutes a borderline age, other
than that the adjustment not exceed 6 months: “We do not have a more precise programmatic definition
for the phrase ‘within a few days to a few months.’ We define the term ‘a few’ using its ordinary meaning,
a small number. Consider a few days to a few months to mean a period not to exceed six months.”

                                                    17
    The third estimation strategy, which is our preferred approach, exploits the heterogeneity
across DDS offices in their implementation of the borderline age rule. We classify DDS offices
into three types based on how they implement the borderline age rule. Figure 5 presents
examples of each type. “RD offices” are offices that ignore the borderline age rule entirely;
we name as such because a plot of initial allowance rates for those offices looks like a typical
RD. “Spline offices” are offices that fully implement the borderline age rule such that there
is no discontinuity at the cuto↵ at all, only trend breaks six months before the cuto↵ and at
the cuto↵. “Hybrid offices” are offices that partially implement the borderline age rule: there
is a trend break in the initial allowance rate six months before the cuto↵, but also a jump
at the cuto↵.21 Appendix E discusses di↵erent ways of classifying offices and demonstrates
that the results are robust to alternative classification methods.
   In Appendix D, we start with standard regression specifications for each type of office:
RD, Spline, and Hybrid. We then develop the following main specification for the endogenous
variable and financial outcome by combining the specifications for each office type:
                            X    X                                     X

                                 X            X
                         +                         Spline1j,T Agei   ⇥ {Agei > T    6} ⇥ Type ji
                             j2{TypeSpline,    T 2{50,55}
                              TypeHybrid}                                                              (3)
                                 X            X
                         +                         Spline2j,T Agei   ⇥ {Agei > T } ⇥ Type ji
                             j2{TypeSpline,    T 2{50,55}
                              TypeHybrid}
                                X
                         +             5,T Agei   ⇥ {Agei > T } ⇥ TypeRDi + "i ,
                                  T 2{50,55}

where Yi is a financial outcome for applicant i, Agei is the applicant’s age at decision relative
to age T 2 {50, 55}, {Agei > T } is an indicator for being above than the age cuto↵ at
the decision date, and {Agei > T 6} is an indicator for being above the threshold six
months before the age cuto↵. The coefficients RDj,T give the e↵ect on financial outcomes
of being above the age T cuto↵ for type j 2 {TypeRD, TypeHybrid}, like standard RD
coefficients of interest. The coefficients Spline2j,T give the e↵ect on the trend in financial
outcomes of being above the age T cuto↵ for office type j 2 {TypeSpline, TypeHybrid}, like
standard regression kink coefficients of interest. The coefficients Spline1j,T measure the kink
at the minus-six-month cuto↵. We use the variables corresponding to the coefficients RDj,T ,
 Spline1j,T , and Spline2j,T as instruments in the IV estimation.



  21
    “RD offices” make up 20 percent of total offices, and so RD estimates based solely on those offices are
imprecise.

                                     Notes: These figures plot initial allowance rates at step 5 of the disability determination process relative
                                     to the disability-program applicant’s age at the initial decision date for specific DDS offices. The left-
                                     hand-side graph is an example of an RD office; the middle graph is an example of a Spline office; and
                                     the right-hand-side graph is an example of a Hybrid office. Age is calculated as months from age 50 or
                                     age 55, whichever threshold is closer. These figures are based on all disability-program applicants who
                                     reach step 5 of the disability determination process and who have an initial decision date in 2000-2014.


                               3.2          Tests of Validity

                               In a standard RD design, the identifying assumption requires that assignment to treatment
                               is as good as random around the threshold. This assumption could be violated if some
                               applicants strategically wait until age 50 or 55 to apply, or if there is di↵erential sorting for
                               other reasons. We follow the standard approach and test for a discontinuity in the density
                               of applicants and in applicant covariates across the age thresholds (McCrary, 2008).

                                        Notes: This figure presents a histogram of age at initial decision for disability-program applicants
                                        in the bankruptcy sample: applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process,
                                        who have an initial decision date in 2000–2009, and whose ZIP Code of residence at application
                                        has an average of at least five recorded bankruptcies per year during this period. Age is calculated
                                        as months from age 50 or age 55, whichever threshold is closer.

   Figure 6 plots the number of applicants by age relative to the nearest age threshold. The
number of applicants jumps by 4 percent at the threshold.22 Although this discontinuity in
the density of applicants is not large relative to changes in the density at other ages, it is
statistically significant and suggests that some applicants defer their application until they
reach age 50 or 55. Public SSA documents, including the vocational grid, discuss the age
thresholds and it is possible that some applicants understand that they are more likely to
be allowed onto the program if they wait to apply until they are older.
   Manipulation is a concern to the extent that di↵erent types of applicants end up on ei-
ther side of the cuto↵. We test for discontinuities in applicant covariates using equation (2)
for the combined age-50 and age-55 samples. Table 3 reports discontinuities in applicant
characteristics across the age-50 and age-55 cuto↵s for the bankruptcy and foreclosure sam-
ples.23 The discontinuities are statistically significant, with a joint F -test rejecting random
assignment across the cuto↵. However, the discontinuities are small. Applicants above age
55 have annual earnings $215 higher (1.3 percent) than those below age 55, have 0.02 fewer
(0.2 percent) years of education, and are 0.5 percentage points (1.3 percent) more likely to
apply with a musculoskeletal condition and 0.5 percentage points (3.0 percent) less likely
to apply with a mental condition. These estimates suggest that applicants who knowingly
defer their applications until ages 50 or 55 are not a random sample, but they di↵er only
slightly on observable dimensions compared to those who do not defer their applications.
    In principle, di↵erences in unobservables could bias RD estimates of the e↵ect of disability
benefits on financial outcomes: discontinuities in financial outcomes at the age thresholds
might be driven not by disability benefits but by selection into which applicants defer their
application past the age thresholds. Although the magnitude of the discontinuities is small,
we probe the direction and magnitude of the potential bias by predicting bankruptcy and
foreclosure for each applicant based on pre-determined characteristics. We then test for a
discontinuity in predicted bankruptcy and foreclosure at the age thresholds, with the results
at the bottom of Table 3. For both the bankruptcy and foreclosure sample, we find that
the discontinuities in the predicted outcomes are statistically significant but economically
small estimates, at just 0.2 and 0.1 percent of the means, respectively, and go in opposite
directions.
    Another potential confounder is di↵erential mortality. If individuals on one side of the
  22
      Chen and van der Klaauw (2008) study a sample of approximately 1,000 applicants from the 1990s and
find that the standard RD assumptions are satisfied—they estimate no discontinuous change in the density
of applicants or applicants’ covariates in their sample. By contrast, we detect violations of the standard RD
assumptions in our sample, which includes the several million applicants that reach step 5 between 2000 and
2014.

  (2) and report with standard errors in parentheses. The table reports the p-value on the F test for
  the joint significance of all covariates. Pre-application earnings are average annual applicant earnings
  in the three years prior to the year of application, from the Master Earnings File. Years of education
  is self-reported years of education from the 831 Disability File. Body system codes (musculoskeletal,
  respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurological, mental, special/other) come from the 831 Disability
  File. “% of mean” denotes point estimate as a percent of control mean, where control means are the
  average value of the variable for applicants who are under age 50 or 55 by 6 to 10 months. For “predicted
  adverse financial outcome,” we first regress an indicator for having the adverse financial outcome prior to
  the initial decision date on a set of covariates (pre-application earnings, years of education, male, body
  system code dummies, and ZIP dummies). We then put “predicted adverse financial outcome” on the
  left-hand-side of the RD specification in equation (2) and report estimates of . The bankruptcy sample
  consists of disability-program applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process and
  who have an initial decision date in 2000–2009. The foreclosure sample consists of disability-program
  applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, who appear in the deeds records
  (homeowners), and who have an initial decision date in 2005–2014. Each sample excludes ZIP Codes
  of residence at application that have an average of fewer than five recorded events per year during the
  corresponding period. Standard errors in parentheses. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1.

cuto↵ are more likely to die, then they are mechanically less likely to appear in financial
records. This might lead us to conclude, erroneously, that rates of financial distress are lower
on the side of the cuto↵ with higher mortality. Gelber et al. (2018) find that disability income
reduces mortality. If true for this population, then their finding implies that individuals just
above the age threshold are less likely to die than those just below. This would bias us in
the direction of finding a positive e↵ect of disability allowance on adverse financial outcomes.
We instead find a negative e↵ect, implying that our estimate is a lower bound for the true
e↵ect.

3.3     Visual Evidence Based on the Standard and Donut RD Strategies

We first present visual evidence based on the standard and donut RD strategies, starting
with initial allowance and moving to the financial outcomes of interest. Figure 7 combines
the age-50 and age-55 thresholds and plots the average initial-allowance rate against age in
months relative to the nearest age threshold. The share of applicants initially allowed onto
disability programs jumps by about 15 percentage points from 6 months before the cuto↵
to immediately after the cuto↵. The six months leading up to the cuto↵, shown in hollow
markers, reflect the borderline age rule. The jump in final allowance rate, shown in Appendix
Figure A.4, is smaller, about 7 percentage points.

  Notes: Figure plots initial allowance rate at step 5 of the disability determination process relative to
  the disability-program applicant’s age at the initial decision date for applicants in the home-purchase
  sample: applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, who have an initial decision
  date in 2000–2014, and whose ZIP Code of residence at application has an average of at least fifteen
  recorded home purchases per year during this period. Age is calculated as months from age 50 or age
  55, whichever threshold is closer.


      Figure 8 presents the reduced-form pattern for bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction

                                                                          22
within the three years after the decision (left-hand side) and, as a falsification test, within
the three years before the decision (right-hand side). The lines are fitted using a “donut”
strategy, excluding the hollow markers that correspond to the borderline age period. For
bankruptcy, the pattern three years after the decision looks similar to the first-stage initial
allowance pattern. Bankruptcy risk increases in age up to six months before the cuto↵, falls
over those six months, and falls further at the cuto↵. Rates of foreclosure display a similar
pattern in the three years after the initial decision: they increase up to six months before
the cuto↵, fall in those six months, and fall further at the cuto↵. For eviction, the graph
is noisy and there does not appear to be a drop at the cuto↵. Turning to the falsification
figures on the right-hand side, there is no discontinuity for any of the outcomes in the three
years before the decision.
   Figure 9 shows the reduced-form pattern for “net” home sales and home purchases. We
define a “net” home sale as a home sale that is not accompanied by a home purchase within six
months before or after the sale, and analogously for net home purchase. By limiting to “net”
home sales, we are less likely to pick up moves, which are difficult to interpret normatively,
and more likely to pick up distressed sales.24 As described by Lusardi et al. (2011), the sale
of a home is one of the main coping mechanisms to which households turn when facing a
financial shortfall. Although the graph for home sales is noisier than those for bankruptcy
and foreclosure, the same pattern is evident: increasing up to the six months before the
cuto↵, falling for those six months, and falling at the cuto↵. There is no discontinuity for
net home sale at the cuto↵ prior to the initial decision.
    Conversely, there is a clear jump in the likelihood of net home purchase at the cuto↵
in the three years after the initial decision. This means that some disability applicants use
their disability benefits to purchase a home. As with the other outcomes, there is no jump
in the three years before the decision.
    Appendix Figure A.6 presents the reduced-form pattern for earnings in the three years
after the initial decision. The graph is a mirror image of the first stage, with earnings
declining before the cuto↵, dropping at six months before the cuto↵, and falling further
at the cuto↵. This pattern is consistent with the findings of Chen and van der Klaauw
(2008), who find that labor supply decreases at the age thresholds. There is no apparent
discontinuity in earnings at the cuto↵ before the initial decision.

     A drawback to this approach is that “net” sales and purchases are more prone to bias than other
outcomes as a result of unobserved transactions in ZIP Codes other than the application ZIP Code. Appendix
B discusses this bias. Appendix Figure 9 shows the reduced-form pattern for “gross” home sales and home
purchases.

Notes: These figures plot the bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction rates within three years after initial
decision (left-hand side panel) and before initial decision (right-hand side panel) relative to the disability-
program applicant’s age at the initial decision date. Age is calculated as months from age 50 or age
55, whichever threshold is closer. Figures are based on quantile spaced binning, allowing each bin to
have the same number of observations. Dashed lines are fitted using a donut strategy, excluding the hollow
markers that correspond to the borderline age period. The bankruptcy sample consists of disability-program
applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process and who have an initial decision date in
2000–2009. The foreclosure sample consists of disability-program applicants who appear in the deeds records
(homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, and who have an initial decision
date in 2005–2014. The eviction sample consists of disability-program applicants who do not appear in the
deeds records (non-homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, and who have
an initial decision in 2005–2014. Samples involving “foreclosure” and “bankruptcy” outcomes exclude ZIP
Codes of residence at application that have an average of fewer than five recorded events per year during
the corresponding period; samples involving “eviction” outcomes exclude FIPS county codes of residence
at application that have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded events per year during 2005–2014.

  Notes: These figures plot the net home-sale and net home-purchase rates within three years after
  initial decision (left-hand side) and the net home-sale and the net home-purchase rates within three
  years before initial decision (right-hand side) relative to the disability-program applicant’s age at the
  initial decision date. Age is calculated as months from age 50 or age 55, whichever threshold is
  closer. Figures are based on quantile spaced binning, allowing each bin to have the same number
  of observations. Dashed lines are fitted using a donut strategy, excluding the hollow markers that
  correspond to the borderline age period. A “net” home sale is defined as a home sale that is not
  accompanied by a home purchase within six months before or after the sale, and analogously for net
  home purchase. The “net home-sale sample” consists of disability-program applicants who appear in
  the deeds records (homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, and who have
  an initial decision date in 2000–2014. The “net home-purchase sample” consists of disability-program
  applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process and who have an initial decision
  date in 2000–2014. Each sample excludes ZIP Codes of residence at application that have an average
  of fewer than fifteen recorded events per year during the corresponding period.


3.4    Reduced-Form and IV Estimates Across Estimation Strategies

We use the three estimation strategies discussed above—standard RD, donut RD, and the
office classification strategy—and find that they produce similar estimates. In this section,
we focus on the results from our preferred strategy, the office classification strategy. Ap-
pendix Tables A.9 and A.10 present estimates for the standard RD and donut RD strategies.
Appendix Figure A.7 shows that the point estimates across the three estimation strategies
are almost identical, though the estimates are less precise for the standard RD and donut
RD strategies.

                                                                                                                      25
(3), are presented in Appendix Tables A.6, A.7, and A.8. These results are consistent with
the visual patterns in the corresponding graphs. The probability of initial allowance jumps
by 7–12 percentage points for RD offices and 5–7 percentage points for Hybrid offices at the
age-50 cuto↵. The jumps are higher at age-55 cuto↵: 12–14 percentage points for RD offices
and 6–9 percentage points for Hybrid offices. For RD and Hybrid offices, the trend break at
the minus-six-month cuto↵ is positive and at the zero cuto↵ is negative, as we would expect
from the first stage figures. The estimates for final allowance have the same sign but are
smaller in magnitude. The joint F -test on the RDj,T , Spline1j,T , and Spline2j,T coefficients of
interest yields a p-value of less than 0.0001, indicating strong instruments.
    For bankruptcy, foreclosure, eviction, and home sale, the reduced-form estimates largely
have the expected sign, the opposite of the first-stage sign. For example, at both age cuto↵s,
bankruptcy rates decrease when the initial allowance rate jumps at the cuto↵ for RD and
Hybrid offices; they decrease when the initial allowance rate trend increases at the minus-six-
month cuto↵ for Spline and Hybrid offices; and they increase when the initial allowance rate
trend drops at the zero cuto↵ for Spline and Hybrid offices. Although some reduced-form
estimates are individually statistically significant at conventional levels, most are imprecise
on their own.
    Table 4 presents the IV estimates using the two-stage-least-squares estimator with initial
allowance rate as the endogenous variable.25 We find that initial disability allowance reduces
the bankruptcy rate by a statistically significant 0.81 percentage point (30 percent). Among
homeowners, the likelihood of experiencing foreclosure falls by 1.7 percentage points (30
percent) and the likelihood of a net home sale falls by 2.5 percentage points (20 percent)
within three years. These estimates are statistically significant. Net home purchases increase
by 0.86 percentage point (20 percent) within three years. We also find suggestive evidence
that initial disability allowance reduces eviction, though the estimates are imprecise. If taken
at face value, they suggest that initial allowance reduces eviction rates by 0.49 percentage
point (10 percent) within three years.
    To verify that selection does not drive these results, Table 4 presents falsification tests
for the the same outcomes in the years before the initial decision. As we would expect from
the falsification graphs on the right-hand-side of Figures 8 and 9, none of the pre-decision
estimates is significant.
    In order to recover an IV estimate, we treat initial allowance as the endogenous variable
of interest. There are, however, other ways in which we could specify the first stage. For
instance, we could specify the endogenous variable as final allowance onto disability programs

  25
    Appendix Table A.10 presents analogous estimates using the standard RD specification, equation (2).
The estimates in that table are similar though less precise.

  Notes: This table reports instrumental-variable estimates of the e↵ect of disability benefits on financial
  outcomes. The “bankruptcy” regressions are based on the bankruptcy sample: disability-program appli-
  cants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process and who have an initial decision date in
  2000–2009. The “foreclosure” regressions are based on the foreclosure sample: disability-program appli-
  cants who appear in the deeds records (homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination
  process, and who have an initial decision date in 2005–2014. The “eviction” regressions are based on the
  eviction sample: disability-program applicants who do not appear in the deeds records (non-homeowners),
  who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, and who have an initial decision date in 2005–
  2014. The “net home-sale” regressions are based on the home-sale sample: disability-program applicants
  who appear in the deeds records (homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination process,
  and who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014. The “net home-purchase” regressions are based on
  the home-purchase sample: disability-program applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination
  process and who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014. A “net” home sale is defined as a home sale
  that is not accompanied by a home purchase within six months before or after the sale, and analogously
  for net home purchase. Samples involving “foreclosure” and “bankruptcy” outcomes exclude ZIP Codes
  of residence at application that have an average of fewer than five recorded events per year during the
  corresponding period; samples involving “eviction” outcomes exclude FIPS county codes of residence at
  application that have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded events per year during 2005–2014; samples
  involving “net home-sale” or “net home-purchase” outcomes exclude ZIP Codes of residence at applica-
  tion that have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded corresponding events per year during 2000–2014.

or the number of months on the program. We focus instead on initial allowance because it
captures both the allowance itself and also the timing of allowance. Figure 3 suggests that
the financial distress of applicants peaks very close to the date of their application. For
applicants in severe financial distress, we would expect initial allowance to have a larger
e↵ect on consumption than allowance on appeal months later.26 Indeed, Table 4 suggests
that most of the e↵ect we observe appears in the first year after the initial decision.
   We next evaluate the pattern of the IV estimates over time in Figure 10. The top graph
shows the likelihood of receiving disability benefits in each event year. In addition to the
extensive margin of allowance, the intensive margin—how many more months of disability
benefits those applicants receive—is relevant for interpreting our findings. The top graph
in Figure 10 plots the IV estimate of the likelihood of receiving disability benefits for each
year relative to the initial decision year. As expected, there is minimal di↵erence between
control (below age threshold) and treatment (above age threshold) groups in the likelihood of
receiving disability benefits before the initial decision. In the year of the decision, the initial
disability allowance leads to an 80 percentage point di↵erence in the likelihood of receiving
disability benefits. The likelihood of receiving benefits then attenuates rapidly, falling to
about 40 percentage points the year after the decision and then stabilizing around 20 per-
centage points. This attenuation is driven by two phenomena: denied applicants reapplying
for benefits in later years and then being allowed onto the programs, and allowed appli-
cants (particularly those receiving SSI) leaving the program in future years (see Appendix
Figure A.8).
    The pattern of attenuation in the top panel of Figure 10 is important in interpreting our
main results. The figure reveals that the “treatment” coming from this quasi-experiment is
not the e↵ect of receiving disability benefits indefinitely, but rather the e↵ect of receiving
disability benefits earlier than the applicant otherwise would have. On average, including the
zeros, applicants above the age cuto↵ receive disability benefits for 1.6 additional months
relative to those just below the cuto↵. The e↵ects that we estimate may still reflect the
belief on the part of the applicant that they will receive disability benefits indefinitely, but
the e↵ects are expected to dissipate mechanically over time as the first stage attenuates.
    The remaining graphs in Figure 10 present IV estimates by event years for bankruptcy,
foreclosure, net home sale, and net home purchase. Not surprisingly for uncommon events,
the individual-year estimates have large confidence intervals. However, the time path of
the treatment e↵ects generally mirrors the first stage pattern: no treatment e↵ect before
  26
      Alternatively, we would focus on final allowance as the endogenous variable of interest if only allowance
itself, and not the timing of the allowance, matter for outcomes. Scaling the reduced-form estimates by final
allowance would result in IV estimates that are often larger than the control mean, though the confidence
intervals include reductions smaller than the control mean.

Notes: Figures present instrumental variable estimates of the e↵ect of disability-program allowance on fi-
nancial outcomes by event year around the initial decision date. The top graph plots estimates of the
likelihood of receiving disability benefits in each event year. This sample is the same as the sample for“net
home-purchase”: disability-program applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process and
who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014. The “bankruptcy” regressions are based on the bankruptcy
sample: disability-program applicants who reach step 5 of the disability determination process and who
have an initial decision date in 2000–2009. The “foreclosure” regressions are based on the foreclosure sam-
ple: disability-program applicants who appear in the deeds records (homeowners), who reach step 5 of the
disability determination process, and who have an initial decision date in 2005–2014. The “eviction” regres-
sions are based on the eviction sample: disability-program applicants who do not appear in the deeds records
(non-homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, and who have an initial decision
date in 2005–2014. The “net home-sale” regressions are based on the home-sale sample: disability-program
applicants who appear in the deeds records (homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination
process, and who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014. A “net” home sale is defined as a home sale that
is not accompanied by a home purchase within six months before or after the sale, and analogously for net
home purchase. Samples involving “foreclosure” or “bankruptcy” outcomes exclude ZIP Codes of residence
at application that have an average of fewer than five recorded events per year during the corresponding
period; samples involving “eviction” outcomes exclude FIPS county codes of residence at application that
have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded corresponding events per year during 2005–2014; samples
involving “net home-sale” or “net home-purchase” outcomes exclude ZIP Codes of residence at application
that have an average of fewer than fifteen recorded corresponding events per year during 2000–2014.

Notes: This table reports instrumental-variable estimates of the e↵ect of being 50 years or older and
55 years or older at the initial decision date on reduced-form financial outcomes by subgroups. The
“bankruptcy” regressions are based on the bankruptcy sample: disability-program applicants who reach
step 5 of the disability determination process, and who have an initial decision date in 2000–2009. The
“foreclosure” regressions are based on the foreclosure sample: disability-program applicants who appear
in the deeds records (homeowners), who reach step 5 of the disability determination process, and who
have an initial decision date in 2005–2014. The “net home-sale” regressions are based on the home-sale
sample: disability-program applicants who appear in the deeds records (homeowners), who reach step 5
of the disability determination process, and who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014. The “net
home-purchase” regressions are based on the home-purchase sample: disability-program applicants who
reach step 5 of the disability determination process and who have an initial decision date in 2000–2014.
A “net” home sale is defined as a home sale that is not accompanied by a home purchase within six
months before or after the sale, and analogously for net home purchase. Samples involving foreclosure or
bankruptcy exclude ZIP Codes of residence at application that have an average of fewer than five recorded
events per year during the corresponding period; samples involving net home-sale or net home-purchase
outcomes exclude ZIP Codes of residence at application that have an average of less than fifteen recorded
corresponding events per year during 2000–2014. Control means are the average value of the variable for
applicants who are under age 50 or 55 by 6 to 10 months. Standard errors in parentheses. *** p < 0.01,

the year of the initial decision, an immediate e↵ect in the year of the initial decision, and
then dissipating e↵ects in future event years. The estimates are too imprecise to determine
whether the e↵ects dissipate because of first stage attenuation or because of actual changes
in the treatment e↵ect.
   Finally, we consider heterogeneity in the IV estimates by subgroup. Table 5 presents
IV estimates by education, gender, and program (SSDI or SSI). The table suggests strong
bankruptcy e↵ects for women: a decline of 1.7 percentage points, compared to 0.2 percentage
points for men, within three years. By contrast, the e↵ects for foreclosure, home sale, and
home purchase are much stronger for men than women, and stronger for DI applicants as
compared to SSI applicants. Since DI applicants have higher incomes than SSI applicants
and are more likely to be homeowners, they may be more likely to be on the margin of
experiencing foreclosure, selling a home, or purchasing a home.


4        Understanding the Channels through which Disability Benefits
         A↵ect Financial Outcomes

We find that initial disability allowance leads to large reductions in bankruptcies, foreclo-
sures, and home sales. In order to assess the implications of these results for recipients’
welfare, we must consider the mechanisms through which disability benefits a↵ect household
financial outcomes. One possible channel is a wealth e↵ect: disability programs relax the
recipient’s budget constraint by increasing income, reducing income volatility, and providing
access to health insurance. If the reduced-form results reflect primarily a wealth channel,
then we can interpret the reductions in bankruptcy and foreclosure as reductions in financial
distress and therefore as improvements in recipient welfare.27
    There are, however, alternative mechanisms through which disability benefits might a↵ect
financial outcomes, and those mechanisms have more ambiguous implications for recipient
welfare. For example, if disability benefits change access to credit or demand for credit,
then benefits could a↵ect bankruptcy rates and foreclosure rates mechanically by changing
either the number of disability recipients who use credit or the amount of credit they use.
We discuss these alternative mechanisms and the expected direction and magnitude of their
e↵ects. A combination of empirical evidence and institutional details suggests that a wealth
e↵ect is the most likely channel through which disability benefits a↵ect financial outcomes.

    27
    In the short term, the wealth channel could actually increase bankruptcy filings by providing households
with enough money to pay bankruptcy fees. Bankruptcy attorney fees typically cost at least $1,000, and
many households must thus “save up” for bankruptcy (Gross et al., 2016), filing only when they have the
funds to do so. If so, this would make our reduced-form estimates an under-estimate of the wealth e↵ect
operating through lower financial distress.


                                                    31
If so, we can interpret the reduced-form results as a reduction in financial distress and an
improvement in recipient welfare.

Credit access and credit demand. Disability benefits could a↵ect either the supply of
credit or demand for credit. On the supply side, benefits could increase access to credit,
prompting lenders to o↵er more credit cards, bank loans, and mortgages in response to
the higher incomes of disability recipients. This increase in access to credit could have
two potential e↵ects. First, it could mechanically increase bankruptcy and foreclosure rates
since individuals can only default if they have access to credit. Indeed, we find that benefits
increase home purchases, which likely means they increase mortgage underwriting. But
overall we find that disability benefits lead to a decline in bankruptcies and foreclosures, so
such an “access to credit” e↵ect would lead us to under-estimate the wealth e↵ect.
   Second, greater access to credit could lead households to roll over debt onto credit cards
or other new products and thus avoid default. If this were the case, we would expect the
additional loans to postpone bankruptcy but not to eliminate it entirely. Yet the 5-year
estimates in Table 4 do not suggest a reversal in the e↵ects on bankruptcy, foreclosure, or
home sale in later years. Although we cannot rule out a later increase in adverse financial
events entirely, we think that is unlikely based on the long-term estimates of Table 4.
   Disability benefits could also a↵ect demand for credit through an income e↵ect. We find
that disability benefits increase recipient income (see Appendix Table A.11). If credit is a
normal good, then disability benefits will increase demand for credit, which could mechan-
ically increase bankruptcies and foreclosures. However, as with greater credit access, this
mechanical increase would lead us to under-estimate the wealth e↵ect. On the other hand,
if credit is an inferior good, then disability benefits will decrease demand for credit, which
could mechanically reduce bankruptcies and foreclosures. Although this is possible, we think
it is unlikely that demand for credit is decreasing in income for households with such low
levels of income—recall that average annual pre-decision earnings are less than $20,000. Cal-
culations based on the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that, for the lower part
of the income distribution, applications for credit are increasing in income.

Incentive E↵ects. Another way that disability benefits could mechanically a↵ect financial
outcomes is by changing the incentive to file for bankruptcy or repay debts. Suppose, for
instance, that disability-program rules (e.g., income or asset tests) either impose restrictions
on or encourage recipients to file for bankruptcy, default on a mortgage, or buy or sell a
home. Or suppose that the bankruptcy process (or foreclosure or home-transaction process)
treats disability recipients di↵erently than other individuals. In either case, benefits could

then a↵ect the rates of these financial events.
    To the best of our knowledge, however, disability program rules do not a↵ect the incen-
tives to file for bankruptcy or default on a mortgage. Disability benefits are not contingent
on bankruptcy or foreclosure and adjudicators at the SSA are not supposed to consider
financial markers like bankruptcy or foreclosure when deciding whether to continue a recipi-
ent’s benefits.28 In terms of home transactions, the SSI asset test exempts one home, so one
might hypothesize that some recipients purchase homes to shift assets from non-exempt to
exempt categories in order to maintain eligibility. In practice, however, we find e↵ects on
home purchases only for the DI population, not for the SSI population.
    Turning to bankruptcy, Social Security benefits are exempt from the Chapter 7 means
test, meaning that allowance onto disability programs does not reduce the ability to file
for Chapter 7. For Chapter 13, Social Security benefits may help recipients create a debt
repayment plan that a court is more likely to approve, but we would consider this a wealth
e↵ect rather than an incentive e↵ect. Federal disability benefits are protected in bankruptcy,
which might increase the incentive to take on debt and file for bankruptcy, but this incentive
would work in the opposite direction of the reduced-form results.29
    Considering foreclosure, regulations prohibit lenders from garnishing disability benefits
to cover mortgage debt not covered by the foreclosure sale, which could increase the incentive
to default on a mortgage. But this too would lead to an increase in foreclosure rates after
allowance, which would lead us to under-estimate the wealth e↵ect.30
    Finally, turning to home transactions, some public lending programs treat disability
recipients di↵erently than other potential homeowners.31 This could mean that SSI recipients
get better loan terms and therefore are more likely to purchase a house than disability
applicants who are denied. However, rates of homeownership among SSI applicants are low
and these lending programs are small in scale.

Summary. Although we cannot rule out these alternative mechanisms, we conclude from
the evidence and institutional details that, for the most part, they either work in the opposite
direction of the results or would likely be small in magnitude. The most likely channel then
is the wealth channel: allowance onto disability programs increases applicants’ wealth and
   28
      Initial examiners do not interact with the recipient in person during a continuing disability review.
Administrative law judges do interact with disability applicants and recipients in person, so it is possible
that they consider financial distress. Official agency guidelines require adjudicators to restrict their attention
to only medical and vocational criteria.

thus they become solvent. Newly allowed applicants can meet their financial obligations,
and this wealth leads to a decrease in bankruptcies, foreclosures, and home sales.
   Why does disability allowance have such a large e↵ect on financial distress? One reason
is that disability applicants are in severe financial distress at the time of application. Fig-
ure 2 suggests that applicants’ risk of bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction is much higher
than the general population, and Figure 3 shows that it is high relative to the applicants’
lifetime risk, peaking just after they apply for benefits. For this population, then, it is per-
haps unsurprising that a monthly disability check and health insurance has a large e↵ect on
financial outcomes. Indeed, the monthly disability check represents an increase in income for
applicants. Appendix Table A.11 presents IV estimates for earnings and income. Disabil-
ity allowance causes earnings to decline by $400 and total observed income—earnings plus
disability income—to increase by $1,300 in the year after the decision.
   Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that the social safety net can
have a large e↵ect on these same outcomes. Hsu et al. (2018) study unemployment insurance
and foreclosure and find that increases in benefits drastically reduce foreclosures. Their
estimates suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in unemployment-insurance benefits
cuts a layo↵-related increase in foreclosures by more than half. Similarly, in studying the
Oregon Health Insurance Lottery, Baicker et al. (2013) find that Medicaid “nearly eliminates”
catastrophic medical debt, reducing its incidence by 81 percent. Gallagher et al. (2019) find
that households eligible for A↵ordable Care Act marketplace subsidies experienced a 25
percent decline in mortgage delinquency rates.


5        Welfare Implications

In this section, we consider the welfare implications of our estimates of the e↵ect of disability
programs on financial distress. We incorporate our estimates into standard optimal-benefits
calculations from the public finance literature. Typically, optimal-benefits calculations only
consider mean consumption, and, in particular, the simple di↵erence between mean con-
sumption in the good state of the world and mean consumption in the bad state of the
world.32 Such an approach is appropriate if mean consumption is a sufficient statistic for
the welfare gains from insurance. In that case, one could simply turn to publicly available
surveys to measure mean consumption and evaluate the welfare e↵ects of the program.
    But that approach would be problematic for two reasons. First, risk-averse disability-
program applicants care not only about mean consumption but also about the likelihood of

    32
      For instance, Gruber (1997), Bronchetti (2012), and Lawson (2017) all approximate average marginal
utility with the marginal utility of average consumption.


                                                  34
extreme losses in consumption. Second, standard optimal-benefits calculations focus only
on the transfer from individuals in the good state to individuals in the bad state, ignoring
potential spillovers to those in the good state. For these reasons, we extend standard wel-
fare calculations in two ways. First, we adapt optimal-benefits calculations to capture the
e↵ect of disability programs on tail consumption risk, under assumptions that we outline
below. Second, we incorporate into optimal-benefits calculations our estimates combined
with existing estimates of the spillover e↵ects of foreclosure to neighboring property owners.

5.1      Adapting Optimal-Benefit Calculations to Consider Tail Consumption Risk

We use our estimates to illustrate that tail consumption risk, as proxied by the financial
events we observe, can play an important role in the calculation of optimal benefits. We
make several assumptions to illustrate this point. First, we assume that these tail events—
foreclosure, bankruptcy, eviction, and home sale—represent risk, which is uncertain from
the agent’s perspective, rather than heterogeneity, which is known to the agent. Second,
we assume that there are no other forms of formal or informal insurance, such as spousal
labor supply. Third, we consider only the ex-post value of disability benefits conditional
on becoming disabled, not the ex-ante insurance value of the disability system prior to
becoming disabled. We also abstract away from the ex-ante moral-hazard incentive problem
that considering financial distress in the calculation of optimal benefits might encourage
financial distress or applications from financially distressed individuals.
      Consider the following adaptation of the Baily-Chetty (Baily, 1978; Chetty, 2006) frame-
work, in which a social planner sets the benefit amount b and tax t to balance risk protection
for the agent against the e↵ect of moral hazard on the government budget. In this adap-
tation, agents face a small risk of a large consumption loss and the risk for disabled agents
depends on b:


        max             (1    p)[(1     qa )u(cha ) + qa u(cla )] + p[(1        qd (b))u(chd ) + qd (b)u(cld )] + (p)
      cla ,ch   l h
            a ,cd ,cd

               s.t.     cha = Aa + w       t,    cla = Aa + w      t       L,
                        chd = Ad + b,      cld = Ad + b      L,
                        t(1   p)      pb    0.

Here, p is the likelihood of disability, cla (cha ) represents low (high) consumption in the able-
bodied state (including assets Aa and wages w), cld (chd ) represents low (high) consumption
in the disabled state, qa is the likelihood of a large consumption loss L associated with an
extreme financial event in the able-bodied state, and (p) reflects the leisure value of not


                                                            35
working. The parameter qd (b) is the likelihood of loss L in the disabled state and depends
on the benefit b. Making qd endogenous reflects the evidence from our IV estimates that
disability programs not only increase consumption through the cash transfer but also make
the worst states of the world (those with large consumption losses) less likely to arise.
    Rewriting the problem in terms of b yields the following first-order condition:
                                                                        dt
                     (1     p)[ (1      qa )u0 (cha )   qa u0 (cla )]
                                                                        db
                + p[(1        qd (b))u0 (chd ) + qd (b)u0 (cld )        qd0 (b)u(chd ) + qd0 (b)u(cld )] = 0.

Totally di↵erentiating the balanced budget constraint yields
                                            
                                      dt               1

substituting terms yields the following condition at the optimal b⇤ :

We parameterize the probability of loss in the disabled state as follows:

                                                qd (b) = a0        a1 b,

where a0 is the baseline probability of consumption loss for the disabled population from
our descriptive estimates, and a1 is the scaled causal e↵ect of benefits on likelihood of an
extreme consumption loss from our causal estimates. This parameterization assumes that
the e↵ect of disability benefits on the likelihood of the loss is linear—in other words, that
the first dollar of benefits has the same e↵ect as the ten-thousandth dollar.
    We calculate L from survey data. Note that L need not be the causal e↵ect of bankruptcy
or foreclosure on consumption. Instead, we seek to measure the consumption drop associated
with the financial distress for which these events are proxies. In order to estimate L, we
calculate the average household food and housing expenses within three years of an adverse
event based on households experiencing foreclosure or bankruptcy in the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID). We find an annual drop of $6,300 in average household food and
housing expenses within three years of a foreclosure.33


  33
     We use the PSID-provided measures on household expenses since 1999 and calculate annual household
expenses using the sum of food and housing expenses. Due to data limitations, we apply the estimated
consumption drop associated with foreclosure to all adverse financial events: foreclosure, bankruptcy, and
distressed home sales. Questions on bankruptcy were only added to the survey in 1996, so we have insufficient
power to estimate the consumption drop associated with bankruptcy alone. Appendix Figure A.9 presents
the event-study plot.


                                                          36
Baseline: a0 6= 0, a1 = 0, approximate average marginal utility with marginal
utility of average consumption. We first establish a baseline in which a0 6= 0 and
a1 = 0, meaning that we temporarily ignore the causal e↵ect of b on tail consumption
risk qd . This baseline corresponds to the standard Baily-Chetty condition, which is usually
implemented by approximating average marginal utility with the marginal utility of average
consumption. In our context, this approximation is:
                            "p,b   Eu0 (c⇤d ) Eu0 (c⇤a )   u0 (c̄⇤d ) u0 (c̄⇤a )
                                 =                       ⇡                       ,                              (5)
                           1 p           Eu0 (c⇤a )                u0 (c̄⇤a )
where

                         c̄d = qd cld + (1      qd )chd = Ād + b      qd L,
                         c̄a = qa cla + (1      qa )cha = Āa + w̄       t(b)    qa L.

To establish the baseline, we take the current average annual disability benefit of $13,000
to be the optimal benefit amount, b⇤ , under a utility function with constant relative risk
aversion (CRRA) and a coefficient of relative risk aversion, , of 2. Using our estimates of
"p,b , qa , and qd and an estimate of Āa + w̄ from survey data, we solve for the value of Ād that
rationalizes the current benefit level as optimal. We use these parameters in our calculations.
Table 6 reports the baseline optimal benefit amount for = 2 and = 4 using the empirical
approximation in equation (5). Note that this column simply reflects the assumption that
$13,000 is optimal under = 2. Using the parameter values that rationalize this assumption,
the optimal benefit is slightly larger for        = 4.

Scenario 1: a0 6= 0, a1 = 0, use exact average marginal utility. The approximation
in equation (5) is less accurate when agents are more prudent (i.e., non-linear marginal
utility of consumption) and when they face larger consumption losses or a higher likelihood
of consumption loss. The exact implementation of equation (4) when a1 = 0 is
   "p,b   Eu0 (c⇤d ) Eu0 (c⇤a )   [(1       qd )u0 (chd ) + qd u0 (cld )] [(1 qa )u0 (cha ) + qa u0 (cla )]
        =                       =                                                                           .
  1 p               0 ⇤
                Eu (ca )                                  (1 qa )u0 (cha ) + qa u0 (cld )
Scenario 1 in Table 6 shows optimal benefit calculations using this parameterization. De-
pending on the value of and the baseline risk, the optimal benefit increases by $50 to $170
relative to the Baseline.34 The optimal benefit is higher using the exact formula because
the increase in marginal utility from the consumption loss is larger than the decrease from

  34
     We consider three scenarios for baseline risk: one based on foreclosure risk only (2 percent for the
able-bodied, 5 percent for the disabled); one based on foreclosure plus bankruptcy risk (3 percent for the
able-bodied, 8 percent for the disabled); and one based on foreclosure plus bankruptcy plus net-home-sale
risk where we assume that 50 percent of net-home sales are distressed (5 percent for the able-bodied, 14
percent for the disabled).


                                                     37
a comparable consumption gain. Note that this increase is likely an underestimate of the
true increase in the optimal benefit amount we would obtain were we able to consider the
full distribution of consumption. We observe only certain extreme events, but if disability
benefits shift mass from bad states to good states more generally, then considering e↵ects
on the full distribution of consumption could increase the optimal benefit amount under
Scenario 1 substantially.

Scenario 2: a0 6= 0, a1 6= 0, use exact average marginal utility. Finally, we consider
the implementation of equation (4) when a0 6= 0 and a1 6= 0, so that qd (b) depends on b.
Making qd endogenous has an ambiguous e↵ect on optimal benefits. On the one hand, a
higher benefit level has even more value to the agent than before, in that it reduces the
likelihood of extreme consumption loss. This e↵ect is reflected in the additional term in
equation (4): qd0 (b)[u(c⇤h
                         d )   u(c⇤l
                                  d )]. On the other hand, by reducing the likelihood of extreme
consumption loss, a higher benefit level means more equal consumption between the able
and disabled states. This o↵setting e↵ect is reflected in the term Eu0 (c⇤d ) = qd (b)u0 (cld ) +
(1 qd (b))u0 (chd ), which is smaller, and therefore closer to Eu0 (c⇤a ), when b is larger. From
Scenario 2 in Table 6, making qd endogenous increases the optimal benefit by about $100
relative to Scenario 1 when = 2 and decreases it by about $40 when = 4.
    This exercise illustrates that incorporating the risk of an extreme consumption loss, as
proxied by financial events like foreclosure, can change optimal benefit calculations substan-
tially. In our calculations, the annual optimal benefit amount increases by up to $250, or
around 2 percent. This number is likely a lower bound for the true increase if we were to
consider the entire distribution of consumption.

5.2   Adapting Optimal-Benefit Calculations to Consider Spillovers

In addition to tail risk, we adapt optimal-benefit calculations to consider the spillovers asso-
ciated with allowance onto disability programs. Previous research on foreclosures, evictions,
and bankruptcies suggests that these events impose negative externalities on third parties.
For example, Campbell et al. (2011) extrapolate from their di↵erence-in-di↵erence estimates
and forecasting models to calculate that each foreclosure during the Great Recession lowers
neighborhood property values by $148,000 to $477,000.
    Consider the Social Planner’s problem in the previous subsection. We model the spillovers
related to property values by assuming that the program benefit, b, produces some fraction
s 2 [0, 1] in aggregate spillovers to property values. In other words, benefits not only increase
consumption in the disabled state, but also increase consumption in the able-bodied state,
through the reduction in nearby foreclosures. The aggregate spillover amount, s ⇥ b, is

                                               38

  Notes: This table presents the optimal benefit in di↵erent scenarios, assuming a constant relative risk
  aversion (CRRA) utility function and a risk of becoming disabled of p = 0.06. The parameter qa (a0 )
  denotes the baseline risk of experiencing an adverse event in the able-bodied (disabled) state. In the
  first two rows of both panels, we consider the probability of experiencing foreclosure only; in the next
  two rows, we consider the probability of experiencing foreclosure or filing for bankruptcy; in the last two
  rows, we consider the probability of experiencing foreclosure, filing for bankruptcy, or selling a home in
  distress (assuming 50 percent of net home sales are distressed). For the optimal benefit calculation, we
  assume Aa + w = $40, 000 based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Under the assumption
  that the current disability benefit level $13,000 is optimal based on equation (5) under CRRA with
     = 2, we obtain Ad = $31, 690 under qa = 0.02 and a0 = 0.05, Ad = $32, 000 under qa = 0.03 and
  a0 = 0.08, and Ad = $32, 225 under qa = 0.05 and a0 = 0.14. foreclosure. We estimate L = $6, 300 from

  probability of experiencing an adverse event in the disabled state under the optimal disability benefit.

    To determine a reasonable value for s, we use our estimates of the e↵ect of initial dis-
ability allowance on foreclosure combined with estimates from the literature of the decline
in neighboring property values from foreclosure. We find that initial disability allowance re-
duces the likelihood of foreclosure by 1.7 percentage points. Campbell et al. (2011) estimate


                                                    39
a decline of at least $148,000 in neighboring property values for each foreclosure. Multiplying
these two numbers, we approximate that 6.3 percent of the disability benefit amount accrues
to neighboring property owners through the reduction in foreclosures.
      We use this value of s to determine how the optimal benefit changes. As shown in Table 6,
considering property-value spillovers increases the optimal benefit by approximately $130 for
  = 2 and by $90 for = 4 relative to Scenario 1. The increase is smaller for a larger degree
of risk aversion because the consumption of able-bodied agents is valued less at higher levels
of risk aversion. Disability programs may also create other spillovers that we do not consider
here.35

5.3      Considering Optimal Benefit Timing

In addition to the optimal benefit level, this analysis can also inform the optimal timing of
disability benefits. Figure 3 suggests that applicants, on average, apply for disability benefits
when they are in peak financial distress and have a high marginal utility of consumption
relative to their lifetime average. In addition, our causal estimates suggest that initial
disability allowance, which occurs several months after application, dramatically lowers rates
of financial distress. Based on those two findings, it is likely that awarding disability benefits
sooner would avert a substantial amount of financial distress among applicants. Of course,
awarding benefits sooner also involves higher administrative costs and could change the
composition of the applicant pool. Determining the optimal wait time requires weighing
these considerations against the benefits suggested by our estimates.


6        Conclusions

This paper provides the first evidence of the e↵ect of disability programs on financial out-
comes. We merge the universe of Social Security disability applicants to nationwide records
on bankruptcies, foreclosures, evictions, home sales, and home purchases to create the first
sample of disability applicants linked to financial records. We produce three descriptive
findings. First, rates of bankruptcy, foreclosure, and eviction are higher among disability
    35
     Another way to put the real-estate-related spillovers in context is to compare it to the e↵ect of the
disability programs on earnings. We find that disability allowance reduces labor market earnings by $3,300
over three years, and it increases housing values due to an averted foreclosure by roughly $2,400, which
is 70 percent of the decrease in earnings. We also calculate the marginal value of public funds (MVPF),
which is the ratio of the marginal benefits of a policy to its marginal cost (see Jacobs (2018) for a review).
In Appendix F, we use our estimates to calculate the MVPF, as derived by Hendren (2016) and Hendren
(2017), incorporating spillovers to third parties and fiscal externalities. We calculate an MVPF of 1.04 for
disability programs when considering e↵ects on foreclosure and bankruptcy. The ratio is smaller, 0.99, when
we ignore these e↵ects because of the large positive spillovers to third parties and to the government from
reductions in foreclosures and bankruptcies.

applicants than the general population. Second, rates of these adverse financial events in-
crease steadily and peak around the application date, suggesting that applicants apply for
these programs after a period of increasing financial distress. Third, these financial events
become less common, even for denied applicants, after the initial decision, suggesting that
applicants find other margins of adjustment.
   We use this data linkage in combination with a quasi-experiment created by the dis-
ability determination process to identify the impact of disability programs on bankruptcy,
foreclosure, eviction, home sales, and home purchases. We find that allowance onto disability
programs leads to large reductions in bankruptcies, foreclosures, and home sales, and to in-
creases in home purchases. We consider the mechanisms through which disability programs
can a↵ect financial outcomes, including wealth, credit access, credit demand, and incentives
from program rules. The evidence indicates that most of the reduction in adverse financial
events reflects a true reduction in financial distress and an increase in recipient welfare.
   Our findings inform both the optimal magnitude and the optimal timing of benefits. Re-
garding the magnitude of benefits, the estimates suggest that disability programs confer large
welfare gains to recipients and to third parties. The reduction in the likelihood of an extreme
consumption loss is more valuable than the increase in average consumption alone would
suggest. Under certain assumptions regarding the relationship between financial events and
consumption, incorporating the reduction in tail consumption risk increases the optimal ben-
efit by at least several hundred dollars. The estimates also suggest sizable spillovers from
disability programs to non-recipients, especially neighboring homeowners whose property
values increase as a result of the reduction in foreclosures. Determining the optimal generos-
ity of disability programs requires weighing these benefits against the moral-hazard costs of
these programs.
    Regarding the optimal timing of benefits, the findings suggest that disability programs
could avert even more financial distress if awarded earlier. The argument for long wait
times is that they reduce administrative costs and could, in theory, improve the targeting
of disability programs. However, we find that applicants apply for disability programs when
they are in peak financial distress, and that benefits reduce financial distress substantially
when they are awarded several months later. These findings suggest that awarding benefits
sooner could avert a substantial amount of financial distress. Determining the optimal wait
time requires weighing these gains against potential administrative and targeting costs.
