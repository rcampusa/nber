                                           ABSTRACT

Non-primary care physicians earn considerably more than primary care physicians in the United
States. I examine a number of explanations for the persistent high rates of return to medical
specialization and conclude that barriers to entry may be creating an economic shortage of non-

primary care physicians. I estimate that medical students would be willing to pay teaching
hospitals to obtain residency positions in dermatology, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and

radiology rather than receiving the mean residents’ salary of $34,000. In the simulation, the
quantity of residents in these four specialties would increase by an estimated six to 30 percent,
rates of return would fall substantially, and teaching hospitals would save an estimated $0.6 to
$1.0 billion per year in labor costs.

I. Introduction

           Physicians who practice in the primary care specialties of general internal medicine, family

practice, and pediatrics earn substantially less than physicians in non-primary care specialties. If one

controls for the one to two years of additional residency training required in non-primary relative to

primary care specialties, there are still substantial rates of return to specialization. In 1998, for example,

the estimated rates of return to specializing in radiology, orthopedic surgery, general surgery,

obstetrics/gynecology, and anesthesiology relative to entering family practice, exceeded 25 percent.1

These rates of return are considerably larger than empirical estimates of the real discount rate, which is

about three percent (Gramlich, 1990).

           In theory these relatively high rates of return could be consistent with an equilibrium

characterized by equalizing differences, variation in returns to ability by specialty, and/or liquidity

constraints. Although these supply-side factors may be relevant, they cannot fully explain the high rates

of return to specialization, because throughout the 1990s there have consistently been more medical

students seeking entry into specialties with high rates of return than there are residency positions

available. This implies that barriers to entry in the market for residents, a demand-side (for residents)

factor, affect the realized supply and price of physician services, and help create rents for non-primary

care physicians. The normative perception among many policymakers and health service researchers, on

the other hand, is that there are too many non-primary care physicians, or specialists, in the United States

(Physician Payment Review Commission, 1995). I propose in this paper that barriers to entry may be

creating an economic shortage of non-primary care physicians. This suggests that welfare could possibly

be improved if the number of non-primary care residency positions were allowed to increase, thereby

increasing the supply of non-primary care physician services and reducing the price of those services.2

        In Section II of this paper I estimate cross-section rates of return in six non-primary care

specialties over the 1986-1998 time period using data from the American Medical Association’s (AMA)

annual physician survey. Although rates of return to specialization have fallen over time, they are still

strikingly large. In the third section of the paper I examine a number of explanations for the persistence

of high rates of return to specialization related to the supply of medical students to residency programs in

different specialties, and teaching hospitals’ demand for residents.

        I offer three explanations for why the market for residents fails to clear. Residency Review

Committees (RRCs), private organizations that consist primarily of physicians from a particular specialty,

essentially have complete control over the number of residents who train in each specialty, and therefore

control the flow of new physicians to a specialty. Like utility-maximizing labor unions that negotiate

with firms in order to maximize employment and rents (Pencavel, 1984; MaCurdy and Pencavel, 1986), I

show that RRCs could set the flow of residents in order to achieve their desired combination of licensed

physicians and physician rents. In 2002 a group of physicians filed a class action lawsuit against seven

medical organizations, including the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME),

which oversees the 26 different RRCs. The lawsuit contends that the ACGME has created anti-

competitive standards that restrict medical students’ access to residency programs (Jung, 2002).3

        I also offer two more benign explanations why the market for residents may not clear. The

ACGME historically has required that teaching hospitals pay residents a reasonable wage and pay

residents in all specialties the same amount. However, the wage that clears the market for residents in

 The welfare implications of removing the barriers to entry are ambiguous if physicians induce demand for their
services in response to an increase in the supply of physician services. McGuire (2000) examines the theoretical
and empirical aspects of physician-induced demand.
                                                                                                                   4




pediatrics or family practice may be too high to clear the market for surgical residents. Finally, the

market for residents may fail to clear if there is insufficient clinical raw material (patients) to train the

number of non-primary care physicians who seek entry into these specialties and hospitals are unable to

increase patient supply. I show that these later two explanations -- minimum wage regulation and scarcity

of teaching material -- could have the same effect as conscious rent-seeking behavior by RRCs.

        In the fourth section of the paper I simulate the set of residents’ wages that would allow the

market for residents to clear, and examine the implications of market clearing on the quantity of residents

in each specialty, the rates of return to specialization, and teaching hospitals’ labor expenses. I estimate

that medical students would be willing to pay teaching hospitals for residency training in dermatology,

general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and radiology. Since teaching hospitals currently pay residents about

$34,000 per year, on average, this would result in $0.6 to $1.0 billion in annual savings for teaching

hospitals, depending on the supply and demand parameters used in the simulation. Furthermore, the

quantity of residents would increase by an estimated six to 30 percent, and the rates of return would fall

substantially in these four specialties, toward empirical estimates of the real discount rate.



II. Rates of Return to Medical Specialization

        Consider a medical student who graduates from medical school in year t=0 and expects to work

for T years. Her expected present value of lifetime earnings in primary care (specialty j), which requires

three years of residency training, will be:

                       3                                T
      (1) E[Y j] =    ∑ (1 + r ) −( t -1) w res jt +
                      t =1
                                                       ∑ (1 + r )
                                                       t =4
                                                                    − ( t −1)
                                                                                y jt ,




3
  The lawsuit also claims that these seven organizations and teaching hospitals exchange information in the National
Resident Matching Program in order to pay residents lower wages and require more hours worked than would occur
in a competitive labor market, and the Match itself removes students’ ability to negotiate wages.
                                                                                                                   5




where r is the discount rate, wresjt is a resident’s salary in specialty j in year t, and yjt is the expected

earnings from practicing medicine in specialty j in year t. A similar expression could be written for the

expected present value of lifetime income in non-primary care (specialty k), which requires four or five

years of residency training. The rate of return to the incremental training in specialty k, relative to

specialty j, is the discount rate rk that equates the expected net present values in the two specialties. That

is, rk solves the following equation:

                                    T
                             (2)   ∑ (1 + r
                                   t =1
                                              k   ) −(t −1) ( y kt − y jt ) = 0


        If students’ earnings expectations are rational, one could measure the expected rate of return to

specialization using a panel data set that contains the mean income that a cohort of physicians actually

received throughout their careers. To analyze changes in expected rates of return over time, one would

need panel data sets for successive cohorts of students. Panel data sets for even a single cohort of

students are rare, and these data sets usually span only a small portion of a medical career. I adopt the

more practical empirical strategy of estimating rates of return using repeated cross-section data sets that

contain the earnings of physicians with different experience levels at a point in time. If students expect

the contemporaneous experience-earnings profile of practicing physicians to remain constant in real terms

in the future, the cross-section rate of return will be an accurate representation of medical students’

expected returns to specialization.4

        In order to calculate returns to specialization, one needs to establish a reference specialty that

requires a minimum amount of training. I use family practice as the reference, benchmark specialty

because it involves a relatively short residency period, is chosen by a large number of medical students,

and the clinical training is general in nature. Eleven percent of U.S. medical students who entered the

Although students do condition their expectations on contemporaneous physician income in the specialty they plan
to enter, they find that students also anticipate, to some extent, subsequent changes in specialty income.

2001 National Residency Matching Program (“the Match”) received a position in family practice.

Although internal medicine was a more popular specialty (25 percent of U.S. medical students), many of

these individuals will eventually practice in an internal medicine sub-specialty such as cardiology or

gastroenterology. Burstein and Cromwell (1985) define general practitioners as the baseline specialty,

and Marder and Willke (1991) define the baseline specialty to be physicians with one or two years of

years of experience who are not board certified and are practicing in a primary care specialty.5 Although

most states allow physicians with at least one year of residency training to obtain a license, almost all

physicians receive at least three years of residency training. In the 1998 Community Tracking Study

Physician Survey, for example, only 3.9 percent of physicians received fewer than three years of

residency training.

        Self-reported data on physician earnings and hours worked are available from the American

Medical Association’s (AMA) Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS) survey for 1986 to 1998. Each

year the AMA surveys about 4,000 practicing physicians who are nationally representative by specialty,

experience, board certification status, and membership in the AMA.6 The AMA reports the mean income

from medical practice, after medical expenses but before taxes, by specialty for the following age groups:

physicians under 36 years old, between 36 and 45, between 46 and 55, between 56 and 65, and over 65

years old. I make a number of assumptions in order to estimate the cross-section age-income profile for

specialty in each year. First, I assume that the mean practice income for an age category corresponds to

physicians at the midpoint of each age range. For example, the mean income of a 50-year old pediatrician

is set equal to the reported mean income of pediatricians between 46 and 55 years of age. Second, I

linearly interpolate between age-specific observations. Third, prospective physicians are assumed to

graduate from medical school when they are 26 years old, spend the number of years as a resident that is

required for board certification, begin practicing medicine immediately after completing residency

training, and retire when they are 65 years old.7 The mean number of hours that physicians work per year

ranged in 1997 from 2,300 in radiology to 3,100 in obstetrics/gynecology.8 I perform a Laspareyes-type

adjustment to account for differences in work effort. Specifically, the mean income in specialty k (Yk) is

multiplied by (Hj/Hk) to standardize leisure at the observed level in the benchmark specialty (specialty j).9

         The discounted present values of lifetime earnings between 1986 and 1998 are presented in Table

1 for nine specialties.10 I assume the real discount rate is three percent and I convert the earnings to 1998

dollars using the urban consumer price index. In 1986 the net present value of lifetime income ranged

from $2.6 million in family practice, pediatrics, and general internal medicine to $5.7 million in

orthopedic surgery. Physician lifetime income increased in real terms in all specialties between 1986 and

1992, and increased more substantially in the non-primary than primary care specialties (second to last

column of Table 1). The net present value of lifetime income fell by at least seven percent in every non-



physicians based on a nationally representative sample from the AMA Masterfile, which is a census of all
physicians (whether or not they are members of the AMA).
7
  Data on the average residents’ salary is available from surveys conducted by the Association of American Medical
Colleges. I assume that the residents’ salary does not differ across specialties, which is almost always the case
within a teaching hospital and is very nearly true in national data. The number of years of residency training
required in each specialty is taken from the Graduate Medical Education Directory, 1996-1997.
8
  I derive the mean hours worker per year in a specialty by multiplying the mean number of weeks worked per year
by the mean number of hours worked in a typical week, as reported in the AMA surveys.
9
  Lindsay (1973) demonstrates that a Laspareyes-type adjustment may over or understate the rate of return to
specialty training. However, if an investment in training in specialty j is worthwhile with a Laspareyes-type
adjustment, it will always be worthwhile.
10
   The AMA reports combined data on earnings by age group for general internists and internal medicine sub-
specialists, and combined earnings data for general surgeons and surgical sub-specialists. These two groupings
include specialties that require different amounts of residency training. For example, cardiologists,
gastroenterologists, and general internists are all included in the internal medicine category although they require
different amounts of residency training. The AMA does report the mean earnings of general internists and general
surgeons (without any sub-specialists includes), but not mean earnings by age group for these two specialties. To
estimate the age-specific mean earnings of general internists, I multiply the ratio of the general internist to overall
internal medicine (including sub-specialists) mean earnings by the age-group mean earnings for all internal
medicine physicians. I assume, therefore, that the age-earnings profile of general internists has the same shape as
the combined internal medicine physicians, but is shifted up or down. The same method is used to derive the age-
group mean earnings for general surgeons.
                                                                                                                8




primary specialty between 1992 and 1998. The incomes of family practitioners and general internists

continued to increase in real terms during this time period, although the increases were modest. If the

age-earnings profile remains constant in the future, medical students who entered radiology and

orthopedic surgery in 1998 will earn almost $6 million during their careers, almost twice as much as

students entering family practice, general internal medicine, and pediatrics.

        I report rates of return to specialization in Table 2. In every year between 1986 and 1998 there

was a positive return to an investment in specialized training, where family practice represents the

benchmark specialty with only three years of residency training. The rates of return are strikingly large,

especially between 1986 and 1992, and have persisted for a longer time period than could be explained by

the lag between an income shock and an increase in the supply of newly trained physicians. The rates of

return in anesthesiology and radiology, specialties that require only one additional year of training

relative to family practice, often exceeded 100 percent. The rates of return in orthopedic and general

surgery, specialties that require two extra years of training, were greater than 38 percent. Cross-section

rates of return have fallen in all specialties since 1992 but still greatly exceed the empirical estimates of

the real discount rate (Gramlich, 1990).

        Investments in specialty training appear to have become more lucrative over the last two decades.

Using income data from 1967 to 1980, Burstein and Cromwell (1985) estimate a cross-section rate of

return for obstetricians/gynecologists and general surgeons of between 10 percent and 15 percent. Marder

and Willke (1991) also estimate large cross-section rates of return to training in the non-primary care

specialties using data from 1987: radiology (47 percent), anesthesiology (40 percent), ob/gyn (26

percent), psychiatry (24 percent), and general surgery (22 percent). These rates of return are smaller than

the ones I estimate for 1986, probably because their benchmark specialty consists of primary care

practitioners with fewer than three years of residency training, whereas my benchmark is dominated by

board-certified family practitioners with three years of residency training.
                                                                                                                9




III. Explanations for Persistently High Rates of Return to Specialization

        I now examine reasons why the rates of return to specialization presented in Table 2 are so high.

If medical students have the same preferences, ability, discount rates, and there are no liquidity

constraints and barriers to entering specialties, the rate of return in each specialty should be equal to the

discount rate (Willis, 1986). If any of these assumptions does not hold, the rate of return to specialty

training could vary across specialties and differ from the discount rate.

        I begin by examining four explanations why the rates of return to specialization might be so large

that all relate to the supply of medical students to specialties: equalizing differences, heterogeneous

ability, liquidity constraints, and the nature of medical students’ income expectations. I then examine

three explanations that relate to the demand for residents: restrictions on the number of residents due to

cartel behavior, scarcity of teaching material, and restrictions on the residents’ wage imposed by a private,

accrediting organization.

        When medical students choose a specialty they clearly care about more than just income and

leisure. In a 1992 survey, medical students were asked to identify specialty attributes that had a strong or

major influence on their specialty decision. The attributes receiving the largest number of affirmative

responses were the intellectual content of the specialty (61 percent), the existence of challenging

diagnostic problems (60 percent), and the degree of emphasis on people skills (39 percent). Only seven

percent of the students indicated that the relative income of the specialty had a strong or major influence

on their choice. Predictable working hours, prestige, and the presence of research opportunities were all

considered to be more important than income.

        When preferences for non-monetary attributes are heterogeneous, the compensating differential

of the marginal student — the student exactly indifferent between family practice and an alternative

specialty -- will determine the rate of return for that specialty. The larger is the compensating differential
                                                                                                                   10




of a particular specialty relative to family practice, the higher will be the rate of return to that specialty

because students will require “extra” compensation in order to enter. Large rates of return to

specialization will exist if medical students believe that non-primary care specialties have relatively

undesirable non-monetary attributes, such as inflexible work schedules or a higher incidence of

malpractice suits.

          A second possible explanation for large rates of return to specialization is the presence of

liquidity constraints. A medical student who wants to maximize his lifetime income and smooth

consumption over his lifetime might decide to forego a non-primary care specialty with a high rate of

return for a primary care specialty if he is unable to borrow sufficient funds while a resident. If this

occurs on a wide scale, non-primary physicians’ incomes will be driven up. Smoothing consumption

becomes more challenging when residents have substantial debt payments. The mean amount of debt

among U.S. medical school graduates in 2001 was $82,000, up from $45,000 in 1992.11

          A third possible explanation for high rates of return to specialization is that there are returns to

ability in medicine, and these returns are particularly large in non-primary care specialties. In such a

scenario, high-ability students would self-select into non-primary care specialties and low-ability students

would become primary care physicians. When estimating cross-section rates of return, I assume

implicitly that the returns to ability do not differ across specialties. If the returns to ability are higher in

non-primary than primary care, the observed mean income of family practitioners would understate what

a high-ability student would expect to earn in primary care, and I would estimate too high a rate of return

to specialization.

          Bhattacharya (2000) estimates a model where a student’s choice of specialty and her specialty-

specific income are endogenous. A student’s debt and age at the completion of medical school are

assumed to affect her specialty choice but not her income conditional on the choice of specialty. Using


11
     Data on indebtedness is from the AAMC Medical School Graduation Questionnaire.
                                                                                                               11




data from 1990, Bhattacharya estimates the income that physicians in specialty A would make if they had

chosen specialty B instead, and compares this estimated income with the actual incomes of physicians

practicing in specialty B. Although he finds evidence that students who select non-primary care

specialties would earn more as primary care physicians than primary care physicians actually earn, the

annual wage premiums are usually less than five percent. If Bhattacharya’s result from 1990 can be

generalized, self-selection on the basis of ability does not appear to be the primary explanation for high

rates of return to specialty training.12

        A final supply-side explanation is that the cross-section rate of return calculation assumes that

medical students have static income expectations; they expect the contemporaneous age-earnings profile

in each specialty to remain constant in real terms. If students have forward-looking income expectations,

then medical students’ expected returns from training might diverge sharply from the cross-section rates

of return. For example, although practicing radiologists and anesthesiologists are currently receiving

large incomes, medical students might believe that managed care, technological changes such as digitized

radiology, and the increased supply of nurse anesthetists will drive down physician incomes in these

specialties in the future. In this case, the expected rate of return that is influencing students’ specialty

choices might be substantially lower than the 83 percent (radiology) and 47 percent (anesthesiology)

figures reported in Table 2. Nicholson and Souleles (2002) find evidence that medical students do, to

some extent, incorporate future trends in specialty income into their own income expectations.

        If students consider ability, debt, and equalizing differences when selecting the specialty that

maximizes utility, and if a large number of students choose primary care as a result, then rates of return to

specialization could certainly vary across specialties and exceed the discount rate. However, collectively

these factors cannot fully explain the observed high rates of return. If supply-side considerations were the


12
  Nicholson and Souleles (2002) also find some evidence of selection according to ability; students who chose non-
primary care specialties expected to earn more in those specialties than students who actually chose primary care
specialties.
                                                                                                              12




sole cause of high rates of return, the supply of medical students to each specialty would equal the

demand for residents in that specialty. This is not the case; there is a persistent excess supply of residents

to most specialties that have high rates of return, which indicates that medical are trying unsuccessfully to

capture the perceived rents in non-primary care.

        The method by which medical students choose residency positions offers a rare opportunity to

separately observe the desired and realized supply of labor, and therefore to observe a market in

disequilibrium. More than 80 percent of the students who graduate from a U.S. medical school apply for

a residency position through the National Resident Matching Program (“the Match”). Each applicant

ranks residency positions in the Match in descending order of his preference; each residency program

ranks applicants in descending order of its preference; and a computer algorithm makes binding

assignments. Ratios of the supply of to the demand for residents between 1991 and 2002 are presented in

Figure 1 for nine specialties. The supply of residents to a specialty is defined as the number of applicants

who rank a residency program from that specialty as their first choice in the Match; the demand for

residents is defined as the number of first-year residency positions offered in the Match by teaching

hospitals.

        In 1991 there was an excess supply of residents in radiology, ob/gyn, and orthopedic surgery --

specialties with high rates of return according to Table 2 (column 3 and 4). In dermatology, which began

offering residency positions through the Match in 1997, there are almost twice as many applicants as

positions available. These ratios probably understate the imbalance between the number of students who

want to get into specialties with high rates of return and those who are actually accepted. Nicholson

(2002) argues that there are costs of not receiving a position in the Match, so risk averse students with a

relatively low probability of entering their desired specialty may choose an alternative as their first choice

in the Match. Due to the excess supply of residents, forty percent of the U.S. medical graduates who
                                                                                                             13




ranked an orthopedic surgery program first in the Match did not receive an assignment in that specialty.13

The unmatched rates in radiology (23 percent) and ob/gyn (17 percent) were smaller but still substantial.

According to Figure 1, specialties with relatively low earnings such as family practice, internal medicine,

pediatrics, and psychiatry were experiencing an excess demand for residents.14

           Since disequilibrium in the market for residents may create an economic shortage of non-primary

care physicians in the physician services market and create rents for non-primary care physicians, I now

examine more closely how the market for residents functions. In 2002, residency programs were offered

in 26 different specialties by over 1,200 U.S. teaching hospitals. Medical students must receive at least

one year of residency training in order to practice medicine in the United States, and if a medical student

wishes to become licensed to practice, he must attend an accredited residency program. Therefore, the

market for residents is an intermediate market that largely determines the number and distribution of

physicians in the United States, much as law schools are an intermediate market for determining the

number of lawyers.

           Consider a well functioning market for residents and physicians in the simple case where there is

a single primary care (PC) and a single non-primary care (NPC) specialty. Consumers’ aggregate demand

for primary and non-primary care physician services is depicted in Panel B of Figure 2 as a downward

function of the price of physicians’ services, or the physicians’ fee (PNPC and PPC). Residents are an input

into the production of hospital patient care and perhaps also an argument in the utility function of a non-

profit hospital. Teaching hospitals’ aggregate demand for primary and non-primary care residents,

depicted in Panel A of Figure 2, is negatively related to the residents’ wage (wPC and wNPC), as with all

factors of production. Conditional on the residents’ wage, the supply of physician services in a specialty

(SNPC and SPC in Panel B) is an increasing function of the price of physicians’ services in that specialty

13
     Data on match rates are from the NRMP (National Resident Matching Program) Data Book.
                                                                                                                   14




because more medical students will enter the specialty as expected lifetime earnings increase; conditional

on the price of physicians’ services, the supply of residents (SrNPC and SrPC in Panel A) is an increasing

function of the residents’ wage in a specialty for the same reason.15

        The markets for residents and physicians are depicted in long-run equilibrium in Figure 2. Each

year teaching hospitals hire Qr*NPC non-primary care residents and Qr*PC primary care residents and pay

them wages WNPC and WPC, respectively. This flow of residents just offsets the number of physicians

retiring in the two specialties each year, such that the supply of physician services remains unchanged at

Q*NPC and Q*PC. The residents’ wages and prices for physicians’ services are such that the marginal

medical student is indifferent between the two specialties. In this well-functioning market, non-primary

and primary care residents may receive substantially different wages in equilibrium unless they are

perfect substitutes in the hospital production function and the desired supply to the two specialties are

identical.

        According to Figure 1, in many specialties with high rates of return the supply of residents

exceeds teaching hospital’s demand for residents. In a well-functioning labor market, medical students

who wanted to enter orthopedic surgery, radiology, ob/gyn, and dermatology -- specialties with high rates

of return relative to family practice and an excess supply of residents in the Match -- would bid down the

residents’ wage in those specialties. As the cost of hiring these residents falls, teaching hospitals would

move down their demand curve and offer more residency positions in these specialties. Over time, as

more residents complete training in non-primary care specialties, the supply of non-primary care

physician services in Panel B of Figure 2 would shift out, and the price of non-primary care physician


14
   Although it had a high rate of return, anesthesiology also had an excess demand for residents. As mentioned
above, however, during this time period medical students probably expected future anesthesiology incomes to be
below their contemporaneous levels due to the advent and growth of nurse anesthetists.
15
   In Figure 2 the supply curves are upward-sloping rather than perfectly elastic because I assume there are
heterogeneous preferences among medical students for the non-monetary attributes of the two specialties; it will
take a large increase in the primary care fee, for example, to induce a student who places a high value on the
prestige associated with non-primary care to switch specialties.
                                                                                                               15




services and the rate of return to non-primary care would fall as well. Likewise, teaching hospitals would

be expected to raise the residents’ wage when necessary to fill vacancies, such as occurred in pediatrics,

family practice, and internal medicine in the early 1990s.

        I offer three possible explanations for why the market for residents does not clear. One

explanation is that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), a private

organization responsible for overseeing residency training, may purposefully limit residency positions in

order to secure rents for practicing physicians. The ACGME is sponsored by five organizations: the

American Medical Association, the American Board of Medical Specialties Specialties (e.g., American

Board of Dermatology), the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Hospital

Association, and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies (e.g., American Academy of Dermatology)

(Graduate Medical Education Directory, 1996). The ACGME sets overall policies and allows a separate

Residency Review Committee (RRC) to review and accredit residency programs in each of the 26

specialties. Each of the five sponsoring organizations appoints four representatives to an RRC and the

government appoints one non-voting representative.

        A teaching hospital that wants to open a new residency program or increase the number of

residents in an existing program must apply to the relevant RRC.16 A RRC considers a number of factors

when deciding whether to approve a program and how many residents may be trained at each program:

“Those numbers (of residents who may be trained by a program) will be based primarily on the number,

qualifications, and commitment of the faculty; the volume and variety of the patient population available

for educational purposes; the quality of the educational offering; and the totality of the institutional

resources” (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, 1996). The current approval process


16
  The RRCs also periodically review established programs to ensure they are in compliance with the standards.
Programs may be placed on probation and eventually closed if they do not address concerns of the RRC. For
example, the Thoracic Surgery RRC reviewed 43 vascular surgery programs in 1990 and 1991. Twenty-six percent
of the programs were cited for inadequacies in continuity of care, and 16 percent were cited for a lack of formal
periodic evaluation of the residents (Barnes, 1993).
                                                                                                                 16




for residency positions has the appearance of a “fox guarding the chicken coop.” A Residency Review

Committee consists primarily of physicians from the same specialty, and its decisions affect the future

supply of physicians and physician income in that specialty.

        A RRC essentially has complete control over the flow of physicians into a specialty because

medical students who attend residency programs that are not certified by the ACGME are not eligible to

take the licensing exam, and thus are not able to practice in the United States. In this sense, a RRC has

the same power as a labor union that is the sole source of a certain type of labor and negotiates

collectively with a firm or set of firms. Economists have modeled labor unions as maximizing a utility

function whose arguments are the quantity of union members employed and either the workers’ rents or

the total wage bill, subject to the firms’ labor demand (Pencavel, 1984; MaCurdy and Pencavel, 1986).

The union chooses the wage and firms respond by hiring a quantity of union workers such that the

marginal product equals the wage.

        The relevant constraint for a RRC is consumers’ aggregate demand for physician services (DNPC

in Figure 3 for the non-primary care RRC). The RRC’s utility function is tangent to the demand curve at

Point J. Whereas a union chooses the wage and allows a firm to choose the profit-maximizing quantity of

labor conditional on that wage, a RRC would choose the flow of residents (QrNPC) that will in the long run

produce the desired, utility-maximizing quantity of physician services (QNPC) and price of those services

(PNPC).17 In order to ensure that the optimal quantity of non-primary care services will be supplied, the

RRC could place a cap of QrNPC on the number of residency positions that could be approved. In Panel A

of Figure 3, the effective demand for non-primary care residents would be truncated at QrNPC.




17
  Although a residency review committee can control the number of physicians in a specialty, it cannot control the
number of hours physicians work once they are licensed, and therefore cannot precisely determine the quantity of
services supplied.
                                                                                                                       17




         Whether a RRC’s imposition of restrictions on residency positions reduces welfare depends on

whether physicians can induce demand for their services.18 In Panel B of Figure 3, the shaded rectangle

represents the rents that non-primary care physicians receive, where P*NPC is the price of physician

services that would prevail if the market for residents cleared.19 These rents represent a transfer from

consumers to physicians and therefore do not represent a loss of social welfare. At Point J there will not

appear to be a shortage of non-primary care physician services because supply equals demand at the

prevailing price PNPC. However, if the RRC allowed the market for non-primary care residents to clear

and physicians were not able to or were unwilling to affect the demand for their services, the price for

non-primary care physician services would fall to P*NPC, and the quantity of services would increase.

Therefore, the black triangle in Figure 3 would represent the loss in consumer surplus due to the

restrictive behavior of the RRC. The more elastic is the demand for physician services, the greater would

be the welfare loss. If physicians are able to induce demand for their services, on the other hand, then

increasing the flow of non-primary care residents from QrNPC to Qr*NPC may actually reduce welfare

because the physicians would perform services whose costs exceed their benefit.

         If cartel behavior by RRCs explains the rents enjoyed by non-primary care physicians, then a

logical question is why the primary care RRCs don’t further reduce the flow of residents to increase the

income of primary care physicians closer to the levels experienced by non-primary care physicians.20

One explanation is that the demand for primary care services may be more elastic than for non-primary

care services, so the rents available to a primary care RRC would be much lower than for a non-primary

care RRC. That is, a primary care RRC facing a flatter demand curve would choose a higher quantity of

18
   See McGuire (2000) for an extensive review of the role of physicians as agents, and their ability to induce
demand for their services.
19
   Kleiner (2000) finds that workers in professions that require licensing, such as dentists, earn rents relative to
workers of comparable human capital.
20
   It is possible that primary care physicians are capturing rents relative to students who enter a non-medical
occupation. Weeks et al. (1994), however, find that primary care physicians experience lower rates of return to
                                                                                                                18




physicians and lower rents than a non-primary care RRC facing a steep demand curve if the two

committees have the same preferences. It seems plausible that there are more substitute providers for

primary than non-primary care, and therefore that the primary care demand curve will be relatively

elastic.21 A second explanation is that the primary care specialties are relatively populous, and it may be

more difficult for a RRC representing a large constituency to restrict entry than one representing a small

constituency. There are between 50,000 (pediatrics) and $98,000 physicians (general internal medicine)

in each of the three primary care specialties, whereas the non-primary care specialties displayed in Table

1 have between 23,000 (orthopedic surgery) and 45,000 physicians (psychiatry). A third explanation is

that primary care RRCs may have different preferences; they may place a greater weight on the quantity

of physicians in the specialty relative to the rents received than non-primary care RRCs.

         There is a second, more benign possible explanation for why the market for residents does not

clear. In many procedural specialties, the RRCs have established a threshold for the minimum number of

procedures that residents must complete during their training.22 The RRC for Thoracic Surgery, for

example, requires vascular surgery residents to perform at least 70 “major” cases (Barnes, 1993). A

teaching hospital applying to expand an existing residency program or open a new program must show

that there is a sufficient volume and variety of patients such that residents will meet these thresholds.23 A

minimum volume threshold could have the same impact on the market for residents as cartel behavior. In

Figure 3, teaching hospitals’ demand for non-primary care residents would be truncated at QrNPC if that is

the maximum number of residents that can be trained given the existing quantity of non-primary care

patients at teaching hospitals.




educational training than students who receive a masters in business administration from a highly-ranked school and
attorneys – people who arguably face the same occupational choice sets as medical students.
21
   Nurse practitioners and specialists, for example, can perform many of the functions of a primary care physician.
22
   According to personal correspondence with Dr. David Leach, Executive Director of the ACGME, in April 2001.
23
   Most RRCs do not report the volume thresholds to the public.
                                                                                                               19




         One benefit of licensing is that when there is asymmetric information about the product or

service, such as exists between a patient and a physician, licensing assures the patient that the physician

has been adequately trained and will provide services exceeding some minimum acceptable (to the

licensing organization) quality (Leland, 1979). It is possible, of course, that the minimum volume

thresholds are a way of camouflaging cartel behavior. However, a RRC could conceivably enhance rather

than decrease social welfare if the marginal benefit of an additional case on a physician’s skill is large,

and physicians would under invest in these skills without regulation because consumers cannot detect

quality differences between physicians. However, if non-primary care RRCs are restricting residency

positions to ensure a competent labor force, why don’t teaching hospitals increase the number of patients

available to residents? This could be achieved by either rotating residents through multiple hospitals in

the course of their training, which already occurs to some extent, or by centralizing scarce types of

patients at a single facility.

         A third possible explanation for why the market for residents does not clear is that the ACGME

has established a minimum wage for residents and requires teaching hospitals to pay all residents the

same wage, regardless of specialty. Until recently, the ACGME had established the following policy

related to residents’ salaries: “Financial support of residents is necessary to ensure that residents are able

to fulfill the responsibilities of their educational programs. All residents at similar levels of experience

and training in all of an institution’s programs should receive a comparable level of financial support.

Exceptions must be justified to the institution’s Graduate Medical Education Committee” (Accreditation

Council of Graduate Medical Education, 1996). Teaching hospitals have adhered to the ACGME’s

policy. The mean residents’ salary nationally was almost constant across specialties in 1992, ranging

from $28,200 in family practice to $29,300 in radiology. Anecdotal data and an analysis of a small

sample of New England teaching hospitals indicates that almost all teaching hospitals paid residents the

same salary, regardless of their specialty.
                                                                                                                20




          The Federal Trade Commission interpreted the ACGME’s policy on residents’ wages as a

restraint of trade, so the ACGME recently added “adequate” to the beginning of the policy statement

quoted above, and dropped the second and third sentences: “Adequate financial support of residents is

necessary to ensure that residents are able to fulfill the responsibilities of their educational programs.”24

The principal objective of the current ACGME policy is to ensure that residents are paid enough so they

will not feel compelled to take a second job, such as working a 24-hour shift in a hospital emergency

room.25 Moonlighting when a resident is already working 60 to 80 hours a week is perceive to endanger

patients’ lives and/or reduce the quality of the residency training.

          The ACGME has not specified what the minimum wage is. However, one could imagine that a

teaching hospital seeking permission to open or expand a program would risk rejection by the RRC if it

proposed to pay its residents substantially less than the prevailing mean wage. The imposition of a

minimum wage for residents could create abnormally high rates of return to specialization. In Figure 3,

say the minimum wage is set at W. QrNPC residents would be hired, the same number as under the cartel

model and the situation with limited clinical “teaching material.” Therefore, each of the three potential

explanations for why the market for residents does not clear could result in the same number of realized,

observed non-primary care residents, and thus the same number of non-primary care physicians. Since it

is difficult to distinguish empirically which of these three explanations is the principal cause of market

failure, I focus in the next section on simulating the impact of allowing the market for residents to clear,

without specifying the specific policy that would achieve this objective.



IV. Simulating the Clearing of the Market for Residents

          In this section I estimate the set of specialty-specific residents’ wages that would equate the

supply and demand of residents, and examine the implications of market clearing on the quantity of

24
     http://www.acgme.org
                                                                                                              21




residents in each specialty, the rates of return to specialization, and teaching hospitals’ labor expenses.

Designing the policy that would allow the market to clear requires knowing what is preventing the market

failure. If RRCs were purposefully restricting residency positions to gain rents, the relevant policy would

be the establishment of an objective, unbiased organization to approve residency programs. If there is

insufficient teaching material in certain specialties, then the implicit action behind the simulation is a

centralization of scarce patient types at teaching hospitals. If market failure is due primarily to the

minimum residents’ wage, the relevant policy is the elimination of this rule.

          Panel A of Figure 3 depicts a specialty with an excess supply of residents. QrNPC residents are

hired at wage W. QMNPC, the number of applicants who rank the specialty as their first choice in the

Match, is also observed. Let W*NPC be the wage that equates the supply of and demand for residents, and

Qr*NPC the quantity of residents employed under such circumstances. My goal is to estimate, for

specialties that are currently experiencing an excess supply of residents, the market clearing wage and

quantity (W*NPC and Q*r). That is, I am trying to identify where the unrestricted supply and demand

curves for residents intersect (Point K in Panel A of Figure 3). I simulate a partial rather than a general

equilibrium model, because I do not allow medical students’ income expectations to be affected by

changes in the flow of residents, or medical students’ subjective expectation of entering a specialty to

depend on the number of residency positions offered.

          If one knows the percentage change in the quantity of residents demanded associated with a one

percent increase in the residents’ wage (0d), and the percentage change in the quantity of medical students

who wish to enter a specialty associated with a one percent increase in the residents salary in that

specialty (0s), then one can solve the following two equations for W* and Q* -- the wage and quantity of

residents that would clear the market at Point K:

          (3)      Q* = Qs (1 + ηs (W* - W) ; Q* = Qd (1 + ηd (W* - W) ,
                                     W                           W

     According to personal correspondence with the Executive Director of the ACGME in April 2001.
                                                                                                               22




where Qs is the observed number of students who currently rank a specialty first in the Match (supply), Qd

is the observed number of residency positions offered in the Match (demand), and W is the prevailing

residents’ salary, which is the same in both specialties.

        I use an estimate of 0d (-0.08) from Nicholson and Song (2001). This parameter is identified by

cross-sectional variation (across hospitals) in the change in the price of residents caused by a revision in

1986 of the government subsidization of residents.26 The dependent variable in this analysis was the

change in the number of residents hired by a teaching hospital between 1986 and 1991. One reason

teaching hospitals may be unresponsive to changes in the price of residents is that they are constrained,

either by residency review committees or by the lack of patients, in how many positions they can offer. If

there were constraints on the demand for residents during this time period, the –0.08 demand elasticity

would be biased toward zero; if teaching hospitals had been unconstrained when the policy altered the

financial incentives to hire residents, they would have responded more aggressively to the change. Based

on aggregate data, the barriers to entry were weaker between 1986 and 1991 than they are now. In the

1986-1991 period, for example, there was an average of 110 fewer residency positions available in the

Match per year than there were applicants, whereas in the 1997-2002 period, there was an average of

4,800 fewer positions available per year than applicants. Nevertheless, in the simulation I also examine a

scenario where the demand elasticity is twice as large in absolute value (-0.16) as that estimated in

Nicholson and Song (2001).

        Since I am simulating the residents’ wage that will clear the market for residents, ideally I would

like 0s to be an estimate of how responsive medical students’ specialty choices are to the residents’ wage.

There is, as mentioned above, little cross-sectional variation in the residents’ wage between specialties, so

it is difficult empirically to measure such an elasticity. Therefore, I estimate 0s as the responsiveness of


26
 In 1986 Medicare made indirect medical education payments less generous and allowed teaching hospitals in
Massachusetts and New York to receive these payments.
                                                                                                                  23




medical students to the mean income of a practicing physician in a specialty, and then convert this

estimate into a comparable measure in terms of the residents’ wage.27 Specifically, I estimate the

following regression equation using ordinary least squares:

         (4)      log(Qsj,t) = β0 + β1Specialtyj + β2log(Yj,t-1) + εj,t ,

where Qs is the number of Match applicants who rank specialty j as their first choice in year t. Qs is the

number of students who desire to enter a specialty rather than the number who successfully enter a

specialty, and should therefore be a reasonably good measure of the supply of residents if there were no

constraints on the number of positions available. The above equation is estimated using aggregated data

on all Match applicants from 1986 and 1991-1999 for 12 specialties.28 Mean physician income in

specialty j (Yj,t-1) is lagged one year because most surveys of physician income, including the AMA

survey data that are used here, are published and available to medical students one year after the survey is

conducted.29

         Specialty indicator variables are included in equation (4), so the coefficient β2 is identified by

variation over time within a specialty in the mean income of practicing physicians. It is evident from

Figure 4 that during the 1990s there was substantial variation between specialties in the growth rate of

physician income. When the contemporaneous mean income rises in a specialty that already has an

excess supply of residents, the rents associated with the specialty will increase, but the probability of

27
   I use the mean income of a specialty rather than the cross-section net present value of lifetime income because
age-specific income data are not available in dermatology and emergency medicine. β2 (in equation 4) measures the
percentage change in the number of medical students who rank a specialty first in the Match in response to a one
percent increase in the mean income of physicians in that specialty. In order to simulate residents’ wages that will
clear the market for residents, I want to know how medical students’ specialty choices respond to changes in the
residents’ wage rather than the change in the mean income of practicing physicians. A general surgeon will practice
for about 30 years but serve as a resident for only five years. Using general surgery as a representative non-primary
care specialty, a one percent increase in the annual income of a practicing physician has the same cumulative impact
on a surgeon’s present value of lifetime earnings as a 27 percent increase in the annual salary of a resident. In the
simulation, therefore, I divide β2 by 27 when analyzing how a change in the residents’ wage affects specialty
choices.
28
    Data on the number of Match applicants who rank a specialty first were not available for 1987-1990.

   Income is adjusted for differences in hours worked between specialties using a Laspareyes-type adjustment based

entering the specialty will remain less than one. Since there are costs associated with failing to receive an

assignment in the Match (Nicholson, 2002), the increased rents may convince fewer students to rank the

specialty first in the Match than if there were no barriers to entry. In a specialty that is not demand-

constrained, on the other hand, an increase in contemporaneous income may overstate the change in

students’ expected lifetime income if students forecast that the supply of physicians in that specialty will

increase, which will eventually drive down the price of physician services.30 Since β2 may be biased

downward, in the simulation I include a scenario where the supply elasticity is 50 percent larger than the

elasticity derived with β2.

         I estimate equation (4) separately for U.S. and international medical school graduates (IMGs)

because these groups may respond differently to income variation between specialties. I use the β2

coefficient estimate from the U.S. medical school regression in the simulation below. I include year

indicator variables in the IMG regression because immigration policy may affect the total number of non-

U.S. citizens allowed to enter the Match.

         Results from the specialty choice regression are presented in Table 3. The coefficient on income

in the U.S. medical school graduate regression (column 1) is positive and significant. A one percent

increase in a specialty’s contemporaneous income is associated with a 1.35 percent increase in the number

of U.S. medical school graduates who rank that specialty as their first choice in the Match.31 The

coefficient on income is also positive in the international medical graduate (IMG) specification but is not

significantly different from zero at the 10-percent level. The monotonically increasing coefficients on the

year dummies in the IMG regression indicate that the total number of foreign-trained physicians entering

the U.S. for residency training increased throughout the 1990s.

   Siow (1984) presents a model where only a single cohort of lawyers expect to receive rents following a shock to
expected income because future cohorts will arbitrage away the rents.
31
   This supply elasticity is similar to the 1.42 estimated by Nicholson (2002). Using a cross-sectional data set of
medical students who graduated in 1992, he accounts for entry barriers by allowing a student’s expected lifetime
earnings in a specialty to depend on his likelihood of entering the specialty.
                                                                                                                  25




        In Table 4 I present the simulation results for the wage that would clear the market for residents

in four specialties where there is currently an excess supply of residents. In most specialties in the 2001

Match there were more U.S. and international students who ranked a specialty as their first choice than

there were positions available in that specialty. For purposes of the simulation, I adopt a more

conservative definition of a specialty that has an excess supply of residents: a specialty where the number

of U.S. medical school graduates (international medical graduates are omitted) who rank that specialty

first in the Match exceeds the number of available positions. U.S. medical students are generally

perceived by residency programs to be better qualified than students trained internationally, as evidenced

by the much higher acceptance rate of U.S. students relative to IMGs in the Match.32 If teaching hospitals

have a minimum quality threshold for residents, the effective supply of residents will be less than the

observed supply. Four specialties were experiencing excess supply in the 2001 Match according to this

stricter definition: dermatology, general surgery, radiology, and orthopedic surgery.

        The first column of Table 4 reports the number of residency positions offered in the 2001 Match

(Qd). The excess supply of residents is reported in the second column, where “excess supply” is defined

as the number of U.S. medical students who ranked a specialty first in the Match but did not receive a

position in that specialty in the Match. This is an underestimate of the true excess supply because some

international students who did not receive a position in the Match would be hired by teaching hospitals at

some wage, and the figure is an overestimate because some of the U.S. students who rank the specialty

first would not be hired by teaching hospitals regardless of the wage.

        The top panel of Table 4 presents results of the simulation using the -0.08 elasticity of demand

from Nicholson (2002) and the elasticity of supply estimated above (1.35), converted into an elasticity

with respect to the residents’ wage rather than the mean income of a practicing physician. As mentioned


32
  In the 2001 Match, for example, 79 percent of U.S. medical school graduates who ranked orthopedic surgery as
their first choice received a position in that specialty in the Match, versus 25 percent of the IMGs who ranked
orthopedic surgery as their first choice (NRMP Data, 2001).
                                                                                                              26




previously, in a market with no or fewer barriers to entry, teaching hospitals might be more price-

responsive than they have been in the past. Therefore, in the bottom panel of Table 4 I report simulation

results with an elasticity of demand for residents, which is twice as large in absolute value as in the top

panel (-0.16) and an elasticity of supply that is about 50 percent larger than that of Table 3 (2.0).

        Using the relatively inelastic elasticity parameters (Scenario I), teaching hospitals are predicted to

receive an annual payment of $95,000 from dermatology residents rather than paying them $34,000 per

year, as is currently the case. The quantity of first-year dermatology residents is predicted to increase

from 252 to 328, or by 30 percent. The new residents’ wage is predicted to reduce the rate of return to the

incremental year of dermatology training (relative to family practice) from 47 percent to 12 percent, a

figure that is much closer to empirical estimates of the discount rate. If the increased supply of

dermatologists eventually lowers the price of dermatology services, the new expected rate of return to

dermatology would fall even further.

        The equilibrium residents’ wage in general surgery, radiology, and orthopedics are likewise

predicted to be negative, but not as large in absolute value as for dermatology. The number of first-year

residents hired in these three specialties is predicted to increase by 8 percent, 16 percent, and 10 percent,

respectively, and the rates of return to training fall below 24 percent in all three specialties. One

implication of removing the barriers to entering residency programs is that teaching hospitals are

predicted to reduce their net wage payments to residents by $1.0 billion per year if the lower wages were

fully phased-in to residents of all experience levels (not just first-year residents) in the affected

specialties.

        In the bottom panel of Table 4 I simulate the residents’ wage that clears the market when teaching

hospitals and prospective residents are more responsive to price changes. In Scenario II, the equilibrium

quantity of residents in each of the four specialties is larger and the equilibrium residents’ wage is smaller

than in the first simulation. Dermatology residents, for example, are predicted to pay hospitals $40,000
                                                                                                              27




per year, and the quantity of dermatology residents is predicted to increase by 35 percent. Teaching

hospitals would be predicted to spend $572 million less on resident salaries, and rates of return in all four

specialties would be below 32 percent.



Conclusion

        Medical students have experienced persistently large rates of return to specialization. These

relatively high rates of return could be due, in part, to equalizing differences, variation in returns to ability

by specialty, and liquidity constraints. However, these factors cannot fully explain the high rates of

return to specialization because throughout the 1990s there have consistently been more medical students

seeking entry into specialties with high rates of return than there are positions available. This implies that

barriers to entry in the market for residents may affect the realized supply and price of physicians services

and help create rents to non-primary care specialists.

        I examine a number of explanations for persistent high rates of return to medical specialization

and conclude that barriers to entry may be creating an economic shortage of non-primary care physicians.

I estimate that medical students would be willing to pay teaching hospitals for residency training in

dermatology, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and radiology rather than receiving the average

residents’ salary of $34,000. When I simulate the residents’ wage that clears the market, the quantity of

residents in these four specialties is predicted to increase by an estimated six to 30 percent, rates of return

would fall substantially, and teaching hospitals would save an estimated $0.6 to $1.0 billion per year.

Notes: Baseline residents’ wage is $34,000, the national mean in 1998. The excess supply of residents is the number of U.S. medical
school students who ranked a specialty first in the Match in 2001 and did not receive a position in that specialty in the Match. Given
estimates of the labor demand and labor supply elasticity parameters, I calculate the equilibrium residents’ wage (or payment to the
teaching hospital if the wage is negative) and number of residency positions that equates supply and demand. The rate of return is based
on cross-section data from 1998 and the benchmark specialty is family practice. Teaching hospital labor savings are based on the number
of residents employed in these four specialties and the estimated change in the residents’ wage.
