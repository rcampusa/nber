                                          ABSTRACT

Amenities that vary across cities are typically valued using either a hedonic model, in which
amenities are capitalized into wages and housing prices, or a discrete model of household location
choice. In this paper, we use the 2000 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) to value climate
amenities using both methods. We compare estimates of marginal willingness to pay (MWTP),
allowing preferences for climate amenities to vary by location. We find that mean MWTP for
warmer winters is about twice as large using the discrete choice approach as with the hedonic
approach; mean MWTP for cooler summers is approximately the same. The two approaches
differ, however, in their estimates of taste sorting. The discrete choice model implies that
households with the highest MWTP for warmer winters locate in cities with the mildest winters,
while the hedonic model does not. Differences in estimates are due to primarily to two factors: (1)
the discrete choice model incorporates the psychological costs of moving from one’s birthplace,
which the hedonic models do not; (2) the discrete choice model uses information on market
shares (i.e., population) in estimating parameters, which the hedonic model does not.

   1. Introduction
        To value amenities that vary across cities, researchers have typically followed one of two
approaches. They have used either hedonic models of wages and housing prices (Roback 1982;
Blomquist et al. 1988; Albouy et al. 2016) or discrete models of location choice (Cragg and
Kahn 1997; Bayer et al. 2009; Fan et al. 2016; Sinha et al. 2018b). The former approach infers
willingness to pay for amenities by estimating hedonic price functions for wages and housing
costs as a function of location-specific attributes; the second, by estimating the probability that
consumers choose a city in which to live as a function of wages, housing prices, and location-
specific attributes.

        Cragg and Kahn (1997), Bayer et al. (2009), and Sinha et al. (2018b) note that the
discrete choice approach typically produces estimates of amenity values that are very different
from estimates produced by the continuous hedonic approach. In a discrete choice model where
households choose the US state in which to reside, Cragg and Kahn (1997) find the marginal
willingness to pay for July and February temperatures exceeds the marginal prices implied by
hedonic price functions. Bayer et al. (2009) estimate marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) to
reduce air pollution using a discrete choice approach and find MWTP is three times greater than
values capitalized into per capita incomes and property values. Sinha et al.’s (2018b) discrete
choice model estimates higher damages associated with projected climate changes in US cities
under the A2 scenario in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios than comparable estimates
from Albouy et al.’s (2016) hedonic model.

       While much previous research has compared the hedonic and discrete choice approaches
in the context of a single housing market (Bayer et al. 2007; Klaiber and Phaneuf 2009, Wong
forthcoming), valuing amenities that vary across cities introduces different issues. Hedonic
estimates of the value of city-specific amenities involve the capitalization of amenities in both
the labor and housing markets. An important question is whether these markets should be treated
as national markets or city-specific markets. Moving costs across cities are one reason to
question the assumption of national labor and housing markets. And moving costs may prevent
city-specific amenities from being fully capitalized in wages and housing prices. Hedonic models
typically assume perfect mobility, while moving costs are more easily incorporated into discrete
choice models.

       In this paper, we use the same dataset to value climate amenities—specifically, winter
and summer temperature—using hedonic and discrete choice methods. We compare estimates
from each approach, allowing preferences for climate amenities to vary by location. Similar to
Albouy (2012), our hedonic models regress the weighted sum of wage and housing price indices


                                                                                                  2
on climate amenities and various city characteristics using metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)
as the geographic unit. Wage and housing price indices are estimated, following Albouy et al.
(2016), assuming national labor and housing markets. We construct a weighted sum of wage and
housing price indices for each MSA using the same weights as in Albouy et al. (2016) and,
alternately, using a traditional set of weights (Roback 1982). We capture preference
heterogeneity by allowing the marginal price of climate amenities to vary by city using local
linear regressions, in the spirit of Bajari and Benkard (2005) and Bajari and Kahn (2005).

       In discrete location choice models, consumers choose among MSAs based on predicted
wages and housing costs, moving costs from birthplace, and the same set of location-specific
amenities as used in the hedonic models. To capture heterogeneity in preferences, we estimate
random parameter logit models and calculate the distribution of each household’s tastes for
climate conditional on the city in which they live. This allows us to estimate mean MWTP for
climate amenities by city.

        We focus on prime-aged households when comparing the two approaches. Because the
hedonic approach assumes that amenities are capitalized into wages, and because a significant
fraction of older households have no wage income, Albouy et al. (2016) focus on workers aged
25–55. We have estimated discrete location choice models for various age groups (Sinha et al.
2018b) and find that preferences for climate amenities vary by the age of the household head;
however, we focus on households with heads between 25 and 55 when comparing discrete
choice with hedonic estimates.

         We find that the two approaches produce different estimates of mean MWTP for winter
and summer temperature and different sorting patterns when we allow preferences to vary across
cities. Although both approaches find that households have positive MWTP for warmer winters
and cooler summers, mean estimates of MWTP for winter temperature produced by the discrete
choice approach are about twice as large as estimates produced by the hedonic approach.
Moreover, the taste sorting patterns produced by the two approaches are very different. The
discrete choice model finds that households sort across locations based on their preferences for
winter temperature: there is a strong positive correlation between winter temperature and MWTP
for warmer winters. The hedonic model finds a negative correlation between MWTP for warmer
winters and winter temperature. The discrete choice model thus projects that under most climate
scenarios, the parts of the country that will benefit from warmer winters value this less than the
average US household. The hedonic model with adjusted (Albouy) weights projects the opposite.

       We also explore why estimates produced by the two approaches vary. One reason is that
the hedonic and discrete choice models differ in their underlying assumptions about consumer


                                                                                                 3
mobility. The hedonic approach assumes perfect mobility, whereas moving costs are more easily
incorporated in discrete models of location choice. As Bayer et al. (2009) note, moving costs—
both psychological and out-of-pocket—may prevent amenities from being fully capitalized into
wages and housing values. When we estimate the discrete choice model without moving costs,
the value of climate amenities falls significantly. It is also the case that moving costs, which vary
by household and city, help identify sorting patterns in the discrete choice model (Berry and
Haile 2010). When they are removed, sorting patterns are (incorrectly) reversed.

        A related reason for differences in the two sets of estimates is the way in which data on
wages and housing prices are used. The hedonic model assumes a single national labor market
and a single housing market. The data are used to estimate price indices for each MSA, assuming
that the returns to human capital and marginal prices of housing characteristics are the same
everywhere. The discrete choice model assumes that each MSA constitutes a separate labor and a
separate housing market. It is the variation in wage income and housing costs across MSAs, as
well as the variation in moving costs across MSAs, that identifies household preferences in the
discrete choice model. This suggests that differences in how the two models use information on
housing and labor markets may account in part for the difference in estimates.

         The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the hedonic model of amenity
valuation as originally developed by Roback (1982) and modified by Albouy (2012) and Albouy
et al. (2016). We present the discrete location choice model that we estimate in section 3 and
describe our data and empirical specifications in section 4. Section 5 presents the results of both
modeling approaches. Section 6 concludes.

2. Hedonic Models of Amenity Valuation

2.1. The Roback and Albouy Models
        The hedonic approach to valuing location-specific amenities dates from Jennifer
Roback’s (1982) seminal article “Wages, Rents, and the Quality of Life,” which built on Rosen’s
(1974) model of product differentiation and implicit prices. Roback posited that in a world of
perfectly mobile individuals, wages and land prices would adjust to equalize utility in all
locations. Consider a world of homogeneous individuals who receive utility from housing, H, a
                                                   1
traded good, C, and a location-specific amenity, a. In each location, j, the individual selects C
and H to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint,



1   Roback’s model deals with land, not housing. In the subsequent literature, r is treated as the rental rate on housing.

                                                                                                                         4

where rj is the rental price of housing; Wj is wage income; I is nonwage income, which is
                                                                                              2
independent of location; and the price of the traded good, C, has been normalized to 1. This
yields an indirect utility function, V(Wj, rj, aj). If individuals are perfectly mobile, locational
equilibrium requires that utility be everywhere equal,

implying that housing prices and wages will adjust to equalize utility. Roback shows that the
value to consumers of a small change in aj is given by

where sH is the share of the consumer’s budget spent on housing.
       The literature following Roback (1982) has inferred MWTP for local amenities by
estimating hedonic wage and property value equations. For example, Blomquist et al. (1988) use
census data on individuals residing in different counties to estimate hourly wage (w) and housing
expenditure (P) equations. A common econometric specification in the literature (Gyourko and
Tracy 1991) is the semilog 3

education, experience, demographic characteristics, industry, and occupation of worker m; Pij is
housing expenditure by household i in location j; and 𝑿𝑿𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of dwelling characteristics.
Aj is a vector of attributes characterizing location j. In using equations (4) and (5) to infer the
value of location-specific amenities, Blomquist et al. (1988) multiply the hourly wage by the
average number of workers per household and the average number of hours worked per year, and
monthly housing expenditure by 12. The two are added together to determine the impact of
amenities; thus, implicitly, wage differentials across counties are weighted approximately three
times as much as housing price differentials.


2   It is assumed that each individual offers a single unit of labor in each location.
3 Blomquist et al. (1988) use Box-Cox transformations of wages and housing prices, i.e., (wλ-1)/λ and (Pλ-1)/λ. They
estimate a value of λ = 0.2 for the housing price equation and λ = 0.1 for the wage equation, in contrast to a
logarithmic specification (λ = 0).

                                                                                                                  5
       Albouy (2012) makes significant modifications to Roback’s approach. He argues that the
weight placed on wage income is too high, relative to the cost of nontraded goods, and he
suggests an alternate approach to estimating the value of local amenities. Nontraded goods, as
Albouy points out, include more than housing and hence occupy a larger fraction of the
household’s budget. At the same time, it is after-tax income that matters. This raises the weight
placed on nontraded goods (proxied by housing) relative to wages. Second, Albouy estimates
wage and housing price indices for each geographic area and combines them into a quality of life
(QOL) index, using his adjusted weights. The QOL index is then regressed on site-specific
amenities to estimate marginal amenity values.

        To elaborate, consider the utility maximization problem faced by households, where
indirect utility depends on income (both wage and nonwage), the prices of nontraded goods,
taxes, and the location-specific amenities in each location. The MWTP for amenity a as a
percentage of average total income (𝑚𝑚� ) can be shown to be equal to the derivative of a QOL
index, as described by equation (6),

where 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 is the share of income spent on housing, 𝑠𝑠𝑂𝑂 is the share of income spent on other
nontraded goods, 𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤 is the share of income that comes from wages, and 𝜏𝜏 is the marginal tax
rate. 𝛾𝛾 is the ratio of the housing price to the price of nontraded goods. The QOL index
corresponding to (6) can be viewed as the consumption a household is willing to forgo to live in
city j compared with living in the average city. The weights in the QOL, however, differ from
those in Roback. The weight on housing prices now includes the share of income spent on all -
                                                                            4
local goods, and the weight on wage income has been reduced by taxes.

           To estimate QOL indices, Albouy et al. (2016) estimate national wage and housing price
equations similar to (4) and (5) in two stages. Including location-specific fixed effects in the
hourly wage and housing rent equations in the first stage yields wage and housing price indices,

 To relate this to Roback’s MWTP formulation, if we assume that housing is the only local nontraded good (𝑠𝑠𝑂𝑂 =
0), that all income comes from wages (𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤 = 1), and that there are no income taxes (𝜏𝜏 = 0), this reduces to Roback’s
MWTP expression in equation (3).
5 This is similar to the approach followed by Bieri et al. (2013), who argue that estimation in two stages ensures that
the implicit price of the amenity is not conflated with the implicit price of unobserved worker and housing attributes.

                                                                                                                     6
        These indices are then used to construct the QOL index in equation (6), where 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗𝑤𝑤 and 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗𝑃𝑃
from equations (4′) and (5′) replace 𝑑𝑑ln(𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗,𝐻𝐻 ) and 𝑑𝑑ln(𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 ). Based on Albouy (2012),
(𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 + 𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠𝑂𝑂 ) = 0.33, 𝜏𝜏 = 0.32 and 𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤 = 0.75. This yields the QOL index on the left-hand side of
equation (7), which is then regressed on location-specific amenities.

        In an important paper, Albouy and coauthors (2016) apply this approach to Public Use
Microdata Area (PUMA) level data from the 2000 census to estimate the value of changes in
temperature in the United States. They use flexible functional forms to relate binned temperature
data to the QOL index, while controlling for other amenities. To allow for taste sorting, they
apply a variant of Bajari and Benkard’s (2005) local linear regression to estimate separate
temperature coefficients for each PUMA. Our approach differs from theirs in focusing on winter
and summer temperature. These are less comprehensive measures of temperature, but have an
intuitive interpretation and capture seasonality in temperature.

2.2. Hedonic Models That We Estimate
        We estimate two sets of hedonic models, one using traditional weights on the wage and
housing price indices generated by equations (4ꞌ) and (5ꞌ) (i.e., the weights in equation 3) and the
other applying the weights proposed by Albouy to the same wage and housing price indices (i.e.,
the adjusted weights in equation 7). The national wage and property value equations we estimate
use the same set of explanatory variables as the wage and housing cost hedonic equations that
underpin the discrete choice model described below and are estimated using the same samples of
workers and houses. Our estimates of equations (4ꞌ) and (5ꞌ) yield price indices for 284 MSAs;
hence, we have 284 observations for our QOL models.

       In view of the fact that we have a single cross section of data for 284 MSAs there are two
approaches that we could take to estimating the value of winter and summer temperature using
the hedonic approach. One is to assume that preferences for winter and summer temperature
(and other location-specific amenities) are homogeneous and use the data to estimate the
preferences of a representative individual. This would enable us to trace out MWTP for winter
and summer temperature for the representative individual over the range of observed temperature
values. This is consistent with the Roback model, and is the approach taken by Albouy et al.
(2016) in the first part of their paper.

        The other approach is to assume that preferences for temperature are heterogeneous:
people living in North Dakota may value warmer winters differently than people in Florida. This
is not consistent with the Roback model, which assumes homogeneous individuals, but is


                                                                                                      7
consistent with a model in which there is a continuum of locations and individuals’ first-order
conditions are consistent with equations 3 and 6 above (Bajari and Benkard 2005; Bajari and
Kahn 2005). We believe that this is a more realistic view of the world; however, with only a
single cross section of data, all we can hope to achieve is to estimate MWTP for winter and
summer temperatures in the neighborhood of the temperatures observed in each city.

         To implement either approach requires estimating QOL functions using a
semiparametric, partially linear model (Robinson 1988). We wish to see how the QOL varies
non-parametrically with winter (WT) and summer (ST) temperature, but because we have only a
single cross section of data, it is important that we control for as many amenities that vary across
cities as possible. Specifically, we assume that
                                    𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 = 𝑨𝑨𝒋𝒋 𝜽𝜽 + 𝑓𝑓�𝒁𝒁𝒋𝒋 � + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗                                           (7')

Where 𝑨𝑨𝒋𝒋 is a vector of non-climate amenities and climate amenities other than temperature, 𝒁𝒁𝒋𝒋
= (WTj,STj) and 𝑓𝑓 is a nonparametric function. We use Robinson’s estimator to obtain a √n-
consistent estimate of θ, θ*. 6 To estimate the non-parametric part of (7'), we use a modified
local linear regression, in the spirit of Albouy et al. (2016). We use the residuals (𝑒𝑒̂𝑗𝑗 )
                                           𝑒𝑒̂𝑗𝑗 = 𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 − 𝑨𝑨𝒋𝒋 𝜽𝜽*                                               (7")
where θ* is the √n-consistent Robinson estimator 7, in a local linear regression with kernel
weights, as described in equation (8). In equation (8) Z denotes the matrix of summer and winter
temperatures, N( ) denotes the normal distribution, b is bandwidth, and 𝜎𝜎�𝑧𝑧 is the sample standard
deviation of characteristic z. This approach yields coefficients for each MSA for summer and
winter temperature, where the notation 𝑗𝑗 ∗ in equation (8) emphasizes this.

                                  𝞥𝞥𝑗𝑗 ∗ = argmin(𝒆𝒆� − 𝒁𝒁𝞥𝞥)′𝑾𝑾(𝒆𝒆� − 𝒁𝒁𝞥𝞥)                                             (8)
                                                 𝞥𝞥


                               𝒆𝒆� = �𝑒𝑒̂𝑗𝑗 �      𝑾𝑾 = [𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑�𝐾𝐾𝑏𝑏 (𝒁𝒁𝑗𝑗 − 𝒁𝒁𝑗𝑗 ∗ )�]

                                        𝐾𝐾(𝑍𝑍) = � 𝑁𝑁�(𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 − 𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 ∗ )⁄𝜎𝜎�𝑧𝑧 �
                                                      𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑧𝑧

                                                 𝐾𝐾𝑏𝑏 (𝑍𝑍) = 𝐾𝐾(𝑏𝑏)⁄𝑏𝑏


6   In the equation yj = Ajθ + f(Zj) + εj a consistent estimator of θ can be obtained by regressing [yj – E(yj|Zj)] on
[Aj – E(Aj|Zj)]. Robinson (1988) uses kernel estimators of these conditional expectations to obtain a consistent
estimator of θ.
7 In Sinha et al. (2018a) we used the residuals QOLj – Ajθ to estimate a local linear regression, but estimated θ
using OLS following Albouy et. al. (2016). This yielded very different results than using the correct approach to
handling correlation between Aj and Zj (i.e., using the Robinson estimator).

                                                                                                                           8
The estimates from equation (8) can be used to describe how MWTP for winter and summer
temperature vary with temperature (i.e., they can used to describe how the preferences of a
representative individual vary with temperature). They can, alternately, be used to describe
MWTP for winter and summer temperature in the neighborhood of the current (WTj,STj) for
each city, and interpreted as the outcome of taste sorting.


3. A Discrete Choice Approach to Valuing Climate Amenities
        The discrete choice approach to amenity valuation, like the hedonic approach, assumes
that households choose among geographic locations based on the utility they receive from each
location, which depends on wages, housing costs, and location-specific amenities. Variation in
wages, housing costs, and amenities across locations permits identification of the parameters of
the household’s indirect utility function.

        One advantage of the discrete choice approach is that it allows the researcher to more
easily incorporate market frictions, including the psychological and informational costs of
moving. The traditional hedonic approach assumes that consumers are perfectly mobile and,
hence, that the weighted sum of wage and housing price gradients will equal the consumer’s
MWTP for an amenity (equation 3). Bayer et al. (2009) demonstrate that this equality fails to
hold in the presence of moving costs, and they incorporate the psychological and informational
costs of leaving one’s birthplace into an equilibrium model of household location choice.
Barriers to mobility also imply that the assumption of national labor and housing markets, which
underlies the hedonic approach, may not accurately capture wage and housing costs in different
cities (Cragg and Kahn 1997).

3.1. The Discrete Choice Model
         Our discrete choice model builds on the work of Bayer et al. (2009) and Cragg and Kahn
(1997). We model household location assuming that each household selected its preferred MSA
from the set of MSAs in the United States in 2000. Household utility depends on consumption of
a numeraire good (the Hicksian bundle), a vector of housing characteristics and amenities, and
the psychological costs of leaving the household head’s birthplace. Formally, household i’s
utility from location j is given by

                                                       𝑃𝑃
                            𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖 �𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 ; 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗 , 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �   (9)


                                                                                                   9
where Cij is consumption of the numeraire good, XP is a vector of housing characteristics, Aj is a
vector of amenities observed by the researcher, and ξj is an amenity not observed by the
researcher. MCij represents the psychological cost of moving to city j from the head of
household’s birthplace. εij captures unobserved heterogeneity in preferences. Equation (9) is
maximized subject to the household’s budget constraint,
                                                                       𝑃𝑃
                                            𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 �𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �                                      (10)

where Yij is the sum of household i’s nonwage income, Ii, which is assumed not to vary by city,
and the wages of all family members, Wij. Pj(XP) is the hedonic price function in city j.
Following Sinha et al. (2018b), we assume that households consume the same bundle of housing
                                                             𝑃𝑃
characteristics in all cities and thus use 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖0 ) to represent the expenditure of household i
                               𝑃𝑃
on housing in city j, where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖0 represents household i’s observed housing bundle. 8 Substituting
equation (10) into (9) yields the household’s indirect utility function, which we assume takes the
form
                              𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � + 𝑨𝑨𝑗𝑗 𝜷𝜷𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .              (11)

        To capture preference heterogeneity, we allow the coefficients on amenities to vary
                   9
across households. To predict the earnings of household workers and housing expenditure in
locations not chosen, we estimate hedonic wage and housing price equations for each MSA, as
described below.

        In equation (11), Yij represents income before taxes. We also estimate versions of (11)
with income measured after taxes. Following Albouy et al. (2016), we use an average tax rate of
32 percent. We acknowledge that this is a very simple way of modeling taxes; however, we
adopt it to make our results comparable to Albouy et al. (2016). Ideally, we would like to
incorporate tax rates that are MSA-specific, although this is complicated by the fact that some
MSAs cross state boundaries.

       Moving costs capture the psychological, search, and out-of-pocket costs of leaving the
household head’s place of origin. Seventy-five percent of households in our prime-aged sample
(see Table 1) live in the census region in which the head was born; 69 percent live in the same
census division. Although households have been moving to warmer weather since the Second
World War (Rappaport 2007), family ties and informational constraints may have prevented this


8This assumption can be relaxed by estimating the model described in equations 9' - 11' below, which allows the
housing bundle to vary across cities. See Table A.6.
9In Sinha et al. (2018b), we allow the coefficient on Yij – Pij to vary across households. We also allow Yij – Pij to
enter the utility function in quadratic form.

                                                                                                                        10
from occurring more completely. As shown in section 5.2, failure to account for these costs
significantly alters the value attached to climate amenities.

         Following Bayer et al. (2009), we represent moving costs as a series of dummy variables
that reflect whether city j lies outside of the state, census division, or census region in which
household i’s head was born. Formally,

                                           𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠         𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑          𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
                          𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜋𝜋0 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖       + 𝜋𝜋1 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖             + 𝜋𝜋2 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                     (12)

where dijState denotes a dummy variable that equals 1 if j is in a state that is different from the one
in which household head i was born, dijDivision = 1 if MSA j is outside of the census division in
which the household head was born, and dij Region = 1 if MSA j lies outside of the census region in
which the household head was born. 10

3.2. Estimation of the Discrete Choice Model
        Estimating the location choice model requires information on the wages that a household
would earn and on the cost of housing in all MSAs. Because wages are observed only in the
household’s chosen location, we estimate a hedonic wage equation for each MSA and use it to
predict Wij. The hedonic wage equation for MSA j regresses the logarithm of the hourly wage
rate for worker m in MSA j on variables (𝑿𝑿𝑤𝑤
                                           𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ), measuring the demographic characteristics—
education, experience, and industry, and occupation—of worker m.

                                                        𝑋𝑋,2
                          ln 𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗2 + 𝑿𝑿𝑤𝑤
                                                𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝜞𝜞𝑗𝑗
                                                                 2
                                                             + 𝜈𝜈𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ∀ 𝑗𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽𝐽                          (13)

         Equation (13) is identical to equation (4) above but allows the coefficients on Xw to vary
by MSA. It is estimated using data on full-time workers in the PUMS. 11 The coefficients of (13)
are used to calculate the earnings of each worker in the sample used to estimate the discrete
choice model, under the assumption that individuals work the same number of hours and weeks
in all locations. Summing earnings over all individuals in each household, we obtain predicted
household wages for household i in location j ( Ŵij ).




10 Allowing moving costs to vary by marital status or by presence of children makes little difference to our results
(see Sinha et al. 2018b).
11 We have also estimated equation (13) allowing for nonrandom sorting (Dahl 2002). Specifically, we compute the
probability of moving from each birthplace to current location (in terms of census divisions) conditional on each
education group listed in Table 1 by taking the appropriate cell counts in our sample of workers (close to 3 million
individuals). Including this probability correction term (in quadratic form) in equation (13) has minimal impact on
our wage regression results, possibly due to the inclusion of industry and occupation indicators in the equation.

                                                                                                                   11
       The cost of housing in each location is estimated based on hedonic property value
equations for each MSA,

                               ln 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗2 + 𝑿𝑿𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜟𝜟𝑗𝑗𝑋𝑋,2 + 𝜂𝜂𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

                                                                              ∀ 𝑗𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽𝐽                 (14)
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the annual cost of owning house i in city j, computed as the sum of the monthly mortgage
payment or rent and the costs of utilities, property taxes, and property insurance. 𝑿𝑿𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 contains a
dummy variable indicating whether the house was owned or rented, as well as a vector of
dwelling characteristics. Utility costs are added both to the costs of owning a home and to rents
because heating and cooling requirements vary with climate. We wish to separate these costs
from climate amenities. Equation (14) is estimated separately for each MSA in our dataset. We
predict housing expenditures for household i in city j assuming that the household purchases the
same bundle of housing characteristics in city j as it purchases in its chosen city.
        This is clearly a strong assumption. To test its validity, we examine the mean value of
key housing characteristics (number of bedrooms and number of rooms) and their standard
deviation across MSAs for different household groups, characterized by income group and
household size. The coefficient of variation for number of bedrooms and number of rooms
within income and household size groups averages only 0.07–0.08, suggesting that households of
similar size and income tend to live in dwellings of similar characteristics, thus supporting our
methodology for predicting housing expenditures.

           As a sensitivity analysis, we estimate a location choice model that uses a housing price
index, following Bayer et al. (2009), rather than predicting housing expenditures in each MSA.
In Bayer et al. (2009), utility is assumed to be of the Cobb Douglas form (9′), which is
maximized subject to (10′). 12 H is housing consumption, and 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 is the housing price index in city
j. This implies that indirect utility (11′) is a function of a housing price index 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 that varies across
cities, not households. 13

12   In Bayer et al. (2009) the vector of amenities does not enter the utility function exponentially.
13
  The housing price index for each MSA is the estimated MSA fixed effect in the national hedonic housing price
equation, equation (5′).

                                                                                                                  12
        The results of estimating the hedonic wage and housing market equations for all cities are
summarized in Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2. We find, as do Cragg and Kahn (1997), that the
coefficients in both sets of hedonic equations vary significantly across MSAs, suggesting that the
assumption of national labor and housing markets made in hedonic studies is inappropriate.

       We estimate the discrete location choice model (equation 11) in two stages. The first is a
mixed logit model in which the indirect utility function incorporates unobserved heterogeneity in
preferences for winter and summer temperature, and MSA fixed effects (𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 ):


                   𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼�𝑌𝑌�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑃𝑃�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � + 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (15)

We assume that the temperature coefficients (βWT and βST) are jointly normally distributed, with
mean vector 𝝁𝝁 and variance-covariance matrix Σ. The elements of Σ are estimated in the first
stage. However, since the MSA fixed effects encompass all local attributes that do not vary
across households, the mean vector 𝝁𝝁 is contained in 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 , and thus, is estimated in the second
stage (Murdock 2006). We interpret the error term εij as combining the error in predicting
household i’s wages and housing expenditures in city j with household i’s unmeasured
preferences for city j. Assuming that the idiosyncratic errors are independently and identically
distributed Type I extreme value, the probability of household i selecting city j is given by the
mixed logit model,


                                                 ∞ exp(𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝛼𝛼, 𝜷𝜷𝑖𝑖 , 𝝅𝝅))
                𝑃𝑃(𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑗𝑗) = �                                    𝑓𝑓(𝜷𝜷|𝝁𝝁, 𝜮𝜮)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                 (16)
                                               −∞ ∑𝑘𝑘 exp(𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝛼𝛼, 𝜷𝜷𝑖𝑖 , 𝝅𝝅))

The parameters of equation (16) are estimated via simulated maximum likelihood techniques,
using a choice set equal to the household’s chosen alterative and a sample of 59 alternatives from
                          14
the set of 284 MSAs.
       In the second stage of our model, equation (17) is estimated by ordinary least squares
(Berry et al. 2004).



14 The validity of the McFadden sampling procedure (McFadden 1978) hinges on the independence of irrelevant
alternatives, which does not hold in the mixed logit model. Nerella and Bhat (2004) use simulated data to examine
the effect of sampling on the empirical accuracy of parameter estimates in a mixed logit model. They suggest using
at least one-quarter of the universal choice set in estimating a mixed logit model. We do, however, face
computational trade-offs in estimating the mixed logit model using more than one-quarter of the universal choice set
and a sample large enough to estimate 284 fixed effects with precision. Experiments with the size of the choice set
indicate that increasing the size of the choice set beyond 60 MSAs does not significantly alter parameter estimates.

        To examine how taste heterogeneity varies by location, we compute the distribution of βi
for each household, conditioning on where the household has chosen to locate. Specifically, we
use Bayes’ rule (Revelt and Train 1999) to derive the distribution of βi conditional on chosen
location, household attributes, and the population distribution of β,
                                                            Pr(𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽) 𝑓𝑓(𝛽𝛽|𝝁𝝁, 𝜮𝜮)
                    ℎ(𝛽𝛽|𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝝁𝝁, 𝜮𝜮) =                                                           (18)
                                                                Pr(𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝝁𝝁, 𝜮𝜮)
      Using this conditional distribution yields an expression for mean taste parameters, 𝝁𝝁𝒊𝒊 , for
households of type 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 :

               𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 = 𝐸𝐸(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 |𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝝁𝝁, 𝜮𝜮) = � 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ℎ(𝛽𝛽|𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝝁𝝁, 𝜮𝜮)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑      (19)

These household-level parameters are estimated via simulation. Taking the average over all
households in each MSA and dividing by the coefficient on the Hicksian bundle yields average
MWTP for all households in a given MSA. A similar method can be used to derive the
conditional variance-covariance matrix 𝜮𝜮𝒊𝒊 .

4. Data and Empirical Specifications
       The data used to estimate our discrete choice and hedonic models come from the 5
percent PUMS of the 2000 census as well as other publicly available data sources.

4.1. Data Used to Estimate Hedonic Price Functions
         The variables that we include in the hedonic wage and housing price equations (equations
4′, 5′, 13, and 14) are listed in Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2, together with coefficient estimates.
The hedonic wage equation is estimated using all persons in the 2000 PUMS who live in an
MSA for which we have complete amenity data and work at least 40 weeks per year and between
                             15
30 and 60 hours per week. Persons who are self-employed, in the military, or in farming,
fishing, or forestry are excluded from the sample. The housing equations are estimated using data
on all households living in one of the 284 MSAs for which we have complete amenity data.




15There were 284 such MSAs in the continental United States in 2000, containing 80 percent of the country’s
population.

                                                                                                                        14
4.2. Households Used to Estimate the Discrete Choice Model
        In estimating the discrete choice models, we focus on households residing in one of the
284 MSAs for which we have complete amenity data. To be included in our sample, a household
must be headed by a person 16 years of age or older who was born in the continental United
States. We exclude households whose heads are in the military or are in certain occupations (e.g.,
logging, mining) that would restrict locational choices. We also eliminate households whose
members are self-employed, because of the difficulty in predicting their wages, and drop
                                                                       16
households with negative values of Yij – Pij at their chosen locations. This leaves over 2 million
households. A 2.5 percent sample of these households yields the 54,008 households described in
         17
Table 1.

        We have estimated the discrete choice model for the full sample of households and also
for the two subsamples described in Table 1: households with prime-aged heads (i.e., heads
between 25 and 55) and households with heads over age 55. The results presented in this paper
focus on households with prime-aged heads. As Table 1 indicates, 98 percent of these
households have some labor income, and on average, 93 percent of the income of these
households comes from wages. The hedonic approach, which uses wage and housing cost
differentials to value amenities, is most appropriately applied to prime-aged households. Our
results also suggest that preferences for climate amenities differ significantly between prime-
aged households and households with older heads; hence, focusing on a single demographic
group makes for a cleaner comparison with the hedonic approach.

4.3. Climate Variables
        Previous studies of the value of climate amenities have used various measures of climate,
including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and sunshine. Many studies use average summer
                                                                                                18
and winter temperatures (Graves and Mueser 1993; Cragg and Kahn 1997, 1999; Kahn 2009)
or annual heating and cooling degree days (Roback 1982; Blomquist et al. 1988; Gyourko and
                            19
Tracy 1991; Albouy 2012), which are highly correlated with winter and summer temperatures.
In studying the impact of climate on agriculture, health, and electricity usage, temperature has


16   These households may have substantial accumulated wealth (e.g., in real property) that we cannot measure.
17Computational difficulties led us to use such a small sample of households. However, we have run the mixed logit
model on different samples of this size and find the results to be sufficiently similar.
18Graves and Mueser (1993) and Kahn (2009) use mean January and mean July temperatures; Cragg and Kahn
(1997, 1999) use mean February and mean July temperatures.
19A mean daily temperature greater than 65 degrees F results in (average temperature − 65) cooling degree days. A
mean daily temperature less than 65 degrees results in (65 − average temperature) heating degree days.

                                                                                                                 15
been measured by the number of days in various temperature bins (Schlenker and Roberts 2009;
Deschenes and Greenstone 2011; Barreca et al. 2016). In the context of climate amenities, Fan et
al. (2016) use the number of days below 32 degrees and the number of days above 80 degrees,
while controlling for mean annual temperature. Albouy et al. (2016) use binned data to examine
the impact of temperatures above and below 65 degrees F.

        Our hedonic and discrete choice models use mean winter (December–February) and
mean summer (June–August) temperatures, measured as climate normals for the period 1970–
2000. The advantage of mean winter and summer temperatures is that they capture seasonality,
which annual heating and cooling degree days and temperature bins do not. Also, with the MSA
as the unit of observation, it is asking a lot of the data to estimate the impact of temperature when
                                                               20
measured as the number of days in fine temperature bins.

        In interpreting temperature coefficients, we note that correlation between winter and
summer temperatures and temperatures during other seasons of the year implies that winter and
summer temperatures will pick up other temperature impacts: the correlation between mean
winter temperature and mean March temperature is 0.98, as is the correlation between mean
winter temperature and mean November temperature. Collinearity among mean winter, summer,
fall, and spring temperatures, however, makes it impossible to include all four measures in our
models.

        In the discussion that follows, we focus primarily on results for winter and summer
temperatures; however, the hedonic and discrete choice models also include annual snowfall,
mean summer precipitation, and July relative humidity. The climate variables in the models are
summarized in Table 2. All variables are climate normals: the arithmetic mean of a climate
                                         21
variable computed for a 30-year period. Following the literature, we also include the
percentage of possible sunshine, defined as the total time that sunshine reaches the surface of the
earth, expressed as a percentage of the maximum amount possible from sunrise to sunset.

4.4. Nonclimate Amenities
        The nonclimate amenity variables used in both the discrete choice and hedonic models
are also summarized in Table 2. These include amenity measures typically used in QOL studies
as well as variables that are likely to be correlated with climate, such as elevation, visibility, and

20Moreover, the number of days per year exceeding 80 degrees—based on climate normal for 1970–2000—is very
small.
21The temperature and summer precipitation data are for the period 1970–2000. July relative humidity, annual
snowfall, and percentage possible sunshine are measured for the period 1960–1990.

                                                                                                               16
measures of parks and recreation opportunities. Because both sets of models are estimated using
a single cross section of data, we attempt to avoid problems of omitted variable bias by including
a variety of location-specific amenities in our models.

        Many QOL studies include population density as an amenity variable (Roback 1982;
Albouy 2012) or city population (Gyourko and Tracy 1991). Population should be used with
caution in a discrete choice model, since the model is constructed to predict the share of
population in each city (i.e., summing the predicted probability of moving to city j across
households yields the predicted share of population in city j). We therefore do not include
population as an amenity but do include population density, which may proxy amenities that
higher population density supports that are not adequately captured by other variables (e.g.,
better public transportation, restaurants, and live sporting events). We also estimate models with
population density omitted. 22

         Other (dis)amenities for which we control include air pollution (fine particulate matter,
PM2.5), an index of violent crime, visibility (percentage of hours with visibility greater than 10
miles), square miles of parks within the MSA, elevation measured at the population-weighted
centroid of the MSA, and distance from the population-weighted centroid of each MSA to the
nearest coast. We also include indices from the Places Rated Almanac (Savageau and
D’Agostino 2000) that measure how well each city functions in terms of transportation,
education, health, and recreation opportunities.

4.5. Empirical Specification
        The hedonic wage and price equations we estimate are semilog functions, a form
commonly used in the hedonic literature and used by Albouy et al. (2016) in constructing
location-specific wage and housing price indices. When estimating QOL and discrete choice
models (e.g., equations (7') and (17)), amenities other than winter and summer temperature enter
the models in linear or logarithmic form.

        To examine heterogeneity in tastes for climate, we focus on winter and summer
temperatures. In hedonic models, the residuals obtained by estimating equation (7') as a partially
linear semiparametric model are used to estimate local linear regressions (equation 8), which
allow MWTP for summer and winter temperatures to vary by city. In estimating discrete choice


22 We recognize that ideally we would want to instrument for population density. Although we do not instrument for
population density, we conduct sensitivity analysis by replacing population density with other variables. The results
indicate that the MWTP estimates are robust to these alternative specifications. See Sinha et al. (2018b) for details.



                                                                                                                   17
models, we allow the coefficients on winter and summer temperatures to be random.
Specifically, we assume that the coefficients are jointly normally distributed with variance-
                      23
covariance matrix Σ. We compute the distribution of these coefficients for each sample
household, conditional on its chosen MSA, and then average the means of these location-specific
coefficients for all households in a city to compute MSA-specific MWTP for winter and summer
              24
temperatures.

5. Estimation Results
           In the spirit of Cragg and Kahn (1997) and Bayer et al. (2009), we compare estimates of
mean MWTP from the discrete choice and hedonic models to see whether the discrete choice
approach yields similar mean estimates of amenity values. We are, however, also interested in
taste sorting. From the perspective of valuing climate, it matters how MWTP for temperature
changes varies geographically: Are households living in areas where temperatures are likely to
increase under future climate scenarios willing to pay more (or less) than the mean for warmer
winters or cooler summers? We approach this by measuring MWTP for temperature changes
conditional on a household’s current location.

5.1. Hedonic Results
        We begin by examining how climate amenities are capitalized into wages and housing
prices, based on national hedonic price functions. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 present climate
coefficients from the hedonic wage and housing price regressions estimated when the MSA wage
and housing price indices from equations (4′) and (5′) are each regressed on the vector of city-
                   25
specific amenities. The last two columns of the table show the climate amenity coefficients
obtained when the QOL indices formed from the MSA wage and housing price indices are
regressed on a vector of amenities, following equation (7).

       Table 3 suggests that winter temperature is an amenity that is capitalized primarily into
wages (i.e., wages are lower in MSAs with warmer winters) and summer temperature is a
disamenity that is capitalized primarily into housing prices (i.e., housing prices are lower in



23 In Sinha et al. (2018b), we allow other climate variables to have random coefficients, as well as the coefficients
on moving costs and the Hicksian bundle. These alternative specifications have virtually no impact on mean MWTP
for winter or summer temperature. The sorting patterns we observe for winter and summer temperatures are
qualitatively similar to those we report below.
24 Mean MWTP for winter temperature in an MSA is computed by averaging the means of the winter temperature
distributions for all households in the MSA and dividing by α, the coefficient on the Hicksian bundle.
25   The coefficients of nonclimate amenities are presented in Appendix Table A.3.

                                                                                                                  18
MSAs with hotter summers). Housing prices are higher in MSAs with more sunshine but lower
in areas with more snowfall. At the same time, wages are lower in MSAs with more snowfall.

        The wage and housing prices indices from equations (4′) and (5′) are combined into QOL
indices using traditional (Roback) weights (column 3) and adjusted (Albouy) weights (column
4). Interestingly, the simple correlation between the two sets of QOL indices is low (r = 0.2),
suggesting that the two sets of weights give very different ranking to cities. In the QOL models
in columns (3) and (4) winter and summer temperature enter in linear form, in order to illustrate,
as simply as possible, the impact of the two different sets of weights in valuing local amenities.
The Albouy weights, which assign more importance to housing prices, suggest that summer
temperature is more of a disamenity than winter temperature is an amenity; traditional weights,
which assign more weight to wages, assign a higher amenity value to winter temperature. As
Table A.3 shows, whether a city characteristic is an amenity or a disamenity may differ between
the two sets of weights: for example, population density is an amenity using adjusted weights but
a disamenity using traditional weights.

        We now consider how QOL varies nonparametrically with winter and summer
temperature. Prior to presenting the results of the local linear regression model in equation (8),
we consider a simpler nonparametric model. Specifically, we estimate the partially linear, semi-
parametric model in (7') allowing only one temperature variable at a time to enter the model
nonparametrically. We first include summer temperature in the linear portion of the model
(effectively assuming that MWTP for summer temperature is constant and independent of
location) and estimate f(WT). 26 Then, we do the reverse, controlling for winter temperature in
linear part of the model and estimating f(ST) nonparametrically.

        Figures 1 and 2 display the results of allowing winter and summer temperature to
separately enter equation (7') nonparametrically. 27 Figure 1 displays the results using adjusted
(Albouy) weights and Figure 2 the results using traditional weights. 28 Figures 1A and 2A
indicate that higher winter temperature is an amenity at most, but not all temperatures: the QOL
index decreases with winter temperature at very low temperatures, but increases with winter
temperature between 15 and 60 degrees. It continues to increase after 60 degrees using adjusted
weights, but not using traditional weights. The QOL index increases with summer temperature
between 60 and 65 degrees, suggesting, as do Albouy et al. (2016), that people prefer a summer


26We estimate this using the Stata Semipar command, which computes the Robinson estimator for a model in which
only a scalar variable enters nonparametrically.
27   The θ*coefficients from these models appear in Appendix Table A.4.
28   The vertical axis in Figures 1 and 2 is the QOL index. Temperature is represented on horizontal axis.

                                                                                                             19
at 65 to a summer at 60 degrees. The QOL index, however, decreases with summer temperature,
for temperatures between 65 and 84 degrees, using both sets of weights. We note that the models
estimated with adjusted weights fit the data better (see Table A.4). As there are also a priori
reasons for using adjusted weights (Albouy 2012), we focus, henceforth, on these results.

        Figures 3A and 3B can be used to calculate MWTP for changes in winter and summer
temperature when both temperature variables enter equation (7′) nonparametrically. 29 The
vertical axis of each graph shows the fraction of income that would be given up for a 5-degree
change in temperature, measured from the previous temperature. To illustrate, in Figure 3A an
increase in mean winter temperature from 10 to 15 degrees is worth 1% of income (or 0.2% of
income per degree), although the effect is not significantly different from zero. 30 Figure 3A
suggests that people are willing to pay very little to increase temperature from 10 to 25 degrees
but that MWTP for higher winter temperatures increases beyond 25 degrees. Indeed, MWTP is
highest for an increase in temperature from 45 to 50 degrees. At a mean income of $69,161,
MWTP for a one-degree increase in temperature between 45 and 50 degrees is about $350 per
degree. MWTP declines after 50 degrees, although point estimates are less precise.

        The corresponding figure for summer temperature (Figure 3B) indicates that MWTP for
cooler summers is positive after 65 degrees, but that people are willing to pay less to reduce
summer temperature from 80 to 85 degrees than they are to reduce it from 75 to 80 degrees.

        An alternate way to present the impact of temperature on MWTP is from a taste sorting
perspective—to calculate MWTP for winter temperature in each city, evaluated at the summer
temperature in that city, and likewise for summer temperature. These values are plotted against
mean winter (summer) temperature, for each city, in Figures 4 and 5, to show patterns of taste
sorting based on the hedonic model with adjusted weights. With only 284 observations, results
are sensitive to the bandwidth chosen for the kernel weights in equation 8. 31 In general, the
smaller the bandwidth, the greater the range of estimated MWTP values across cities. The
MWTP for winter and summer temperatures for each city are plotted using adjusted weights in
Figures 4 and 5 using a bandwidth of 0.7 and in Appendix Figures A.1–A.4 for both sets of
weights using bandwidths between 0.4 and 0.9.


29The graphs in Figure 3 were produced by estimating equation (7′) using the Stata Npregress command with
optimal bandwidths chosen by cross-validation.
30The estimates in the winter (summer) temperature graph have been averaged across summer (winter)
temperatures. To illustrate, MWTP for an increase in winter temperature from (e.g.) 15 to 20 degrees was computed
by averaging this value across all summer temperatures.
31The optimal bandwidth in equation 8 should be O(n-1/q+4) where q is the number of covariates in Z (Li and Racine
2007). In our case n-1/6 = 0.39.

                                                                                                               20
        In Table 4, we present summary statistics of MWTP from the local linear regressions in
(8) using bandwidths between 0.4 and 0.9. When preferences for temperature are allowed to vary
across cities, both hedonic models suggest that (on average) summer temperature is a greater
disamenity than winter temperature is an amenity. Focusing on the models using adjusted
weights, the MWTP for warmer winters averaged across all cities is about one-third of the mean
MWTP for cooler summers. At a bandwidth of 0.5 (0.7), mean MWTP for winter temperature is
$189 ($174) using adjusted weights. Mean MWTP to reduce summer temperature by 1 degree is
$558 ($536). Table 4 also indicates that mean MWTP for summer temperature is negatively
correlated with summer temperature (correlation coefficient ≈ -.50), which is consistent with
Figure 3B. MWTP for winter temperature is weakly negatively correlated with winter
temperature, which is consistent with Figure 3A.

        Figures 4 and 5 display the sorting patterns implied by equation (8) when the hedonic
model is estimated using Albouy weights. Figure 4 displays MWTP for winter temperature by
city, plotted against winter temperature; Figure 5 is the corresponding figure for summer
temperature. The sorting pattern for winter temperature in Figure 4 is consistent with Figure 3A.
There is positive correlation between MWTP for winter temperature and winter temperature
between 20 and 45 degrees, but negative correlation below 20 degrees and above 45 degrees.
Cities in South (in the West South Central and South Atlantic regions) with a mean winter
temperature of 45 degrees or higher have below-average MWTP for winter temperature. Cities
on the Pacific Coast with mean winter temperatures above 45 degrees, however, have above-
average MWTP for winter temperature. Households who live in cold cities, in general, have
MWTP for winter temperature that is above mean MWTP for all cities in our sample. This
sorting pattern suggests that households in northern latitudes—in the East and West North
Central and New England census divisions—would be willing pay the more for the beneficial
portion of climate change than households in Texas and Florida.

        Figure 5 indicates that for most cities with mean summer temperatures over 73 degrees
(the sample mean) MWTP for cooler summers is above average MWTP; most cities with mean
summer temperature below 73 degrees have a below-average MWTP for cooler summers. Cities
in the South Atlantic and East South Central regions have above-average MWTP to reduce
summer temperature, as do cities in Southern California. Cities in Pacific Northwest have
below-average MWTP for cooler summers.

5.2. Discrete Choice Results
       As noted above, we have estimated discrete location choice models for various
population groups: households headed by persons between 25 and 55 (prime-aged households),

                                                                                               21
households whose heads are over 55, and households headed by persons 16 years of age and
older (full sample). In comparing the discrete choice and continuous hedonic approaches, we
focus on prime-aged households because of their strong labor-force attachment (see Table 1).

         Table 5 presents estimates of MWTP for winter and summer temperatures based on four
                     32
mixed logit models. Our base model (model M.1) controls for all the amenities in Table 2, as
well as moving costs, and allows the coefficients on winter and summer temperatures to be
jointly normally distributed. Model M.2 is identical to model M.1, except that income is
measured as after-tax income. Both models suggest that on average, higher winter temperature is
an amenity and warmer summer temperature a disamenity. Mean MWTP to reduce summer
temperature by 1 degree is higher than mean MWTP to increase winter temperature by 1 degree
($627 versus $518 in model M.1; $522 versus $382 in model M.2). There is, however,
considerable variation in tastes.

        Interestingly, the coefficients on winter and summer temperatures are negatively
correlated: most (but not all) households that prefer milder winters also prefer milder summers,
while those that favor colder winters like hotter summers. 33 The significant negative correlation
between MWTP for winter and summer temperature (r = -0.7) gives rise to the sorting patterns
described below. We note that in the hedonic model with adjusted weights (Table 4), MWTP for
winter and summer temperature are very weakly correlated (r = -0.15).

        To examine how households sort across locations in relation to their taste for winter and
summer temperatures, we calculate the joint distribution of the coefficients of winter and
summer temperatures for each household, conditional on the household’s choice of location. The
means of these conditional distributions are averaged across all households in each city, divided
by the coefficient on the Hicksian bundle, and plotted against city temperature in Figures 6 and
   34
7.




32   MWTPs for amenities other than winter and summer temperture are reported in Appendix Table A.5.

(11) in quadratic form and to the use of the Cobb-Douglas utility function (equation 11′). Results are robust to these
sensitivity analyses.
34 When preferences for winter and summer temperatures are forced to be uncorrelated, there is a strong association
between MSA mean MWTP for higher temperature and temperature itself: the correlation is 0.96 between MSA
mean MWTP and winter temperature and 0.97 between MSA mean MWTP and summer temperature. It appears that
households that live in warmer cities place higher values on both summer and winter temperatures.



                                                                                                                   22
        The pattern of taste sorting is similar whether we base location decisions on income
                      35
before or after taxes. Households with higher MWTP for warmer winters tend to locate in
warmer cities: the correlation coefficient between winter temperature and mean MSA MWTP is
0.92 in model M.1 (Figure 6A) and 0.91 in model M.2 (Figure 6B). There is, however, some
variation in mean MWTP across cities at a given temperature. For example, at a mean winter
temperature of 40 degrees, households in the states of Oregon and Washington have a
willingness to pay for a warmer winter that is much higher than the MWTP of households in
Texas. At a mean winter temperature of 50 degrees, households on the Pacific coast are willing
to pay more for warmer winter temperature than households in the East South Central division.

        The relationship between MWTP for a 1 degree increase in summer temperature (Figures
7A and 7B) and summer temperature is an inverted U. While MWTP for an increase in summer
temperature is negative in all cities except 2 in the West North Central census division,
households in the South Atlantic and Pacific divisions have the greatest MWTP to reduce mean
summer temperature by 1 degree. 36 The higher MWTP for cooler summers in Florida than in
North Dakota does not reflect the fact that summer temperature is higher in Florida than in North
Dakota: MWTP is the value of a small change in temperature from current temperature levels.
The higher MWTP to reduce summer temperature reflects the fact that people living in Florida
are in the tails of the taste distribution for both winter and summer temperature—they have a
higher than average MWTP to increase winter temperature and a higher MWTP than average to
reduce summer temperature—they are climate sensitive. People living in North Dakota, in
contrast, are not very climate sensitive and have small MWTP for both winter and summer
temperatures.

        Figures 6 and 7 suggest that, holding temperature constant, MWTP for winter and
summer temperatures varies by region: households in the East North Central census division
appear to find hotter summers less of a disamenity than households that have located on the
Pacific coast. Households in the Mountain states appear to favor colder winters than households
in the Pacific division. Some of this might appear to reflect differences in climate variables other
than temperature, such as differences in summer humidity, precipitation, and snowfall. Our base




35 Figures 6A and 7A plot results based on model M.1, while Figures 6B and 7B plot results from model M.2, which
is based on net-of-tax income.
36 The correlation between mean summer temperature and MWTP for summer temperature in Figure 7B is –0.38. If
we restrict preferences over winter and summer temperatures to be uncorrelated, we find a strong positive
correlation between MWTP for summer temperature and the temperature of the city in which the household lives—
see footnote 34.

                                                                                                             23
model, however, controls for summer humidity and precipitation, as well as snowfall and
sunshine.

         Failure to control for moving costs has a large effect on the estimated value of climate
amenities, as well as on the spatial distribution of MWTP for winter and summer temperatures.
Model M.3 (M.4) shows the impact of dropping moving costs from the discrete choice model
when income is measured before (after) taxes. While the mean of the distribution of MWTP for
winter temperature remains positive, its magnitude drops by about 5 percent (15 percent). The
mean of the distribution on the coefficient of summer temperature is even more sensitive: its
magnitude drops by about 38 percent (35 percent) when moving costs are omitted. Table 5 also
indicates the role that moving costs play in taste sorting: when moving costs are omitted from the
base models, the standard deviations on the winter temperature coefficients are no longer
statistically significant. In model M.3, the correlation coefficient between the winter and summer
temperature coefficients switches from negative to positive in sign. Simply put, patterns of taste
sorting are no longer identified when moving costs are removed from the discrete choice model.

        This is borne out in Figure 8, which contrasts the sorting patterns from model M.3 when
moving costs are removed with the patterns shown in Figures 6B and 7B. The top right panel of
Figure 8 still shows a positive correlation between mean MWTP for winter temperature and
mean winter temperature; however, the variation is small, and all MSAs have mean MWTP
within about $20 of each other. The bottom right panel suggests that MWTP for warmer
summers is positively associated with summer temperature. 37 Omitting moving costs makes it
appear, incorrectly, that people sort according to summer temperature, and that people living in
hotter areas will pay less to reduce summer temperature than those who live in locations with
cooler summers—i.e., that people who live in Florida and Texas have a lower than average
MWTP to reduce summer temperature. The fact is that approximately 80% of the people who
lived in the South Atlantic and West South Central census divisions in 2000 were born there.
But, part of the reason that they live there is that the costs of moving from their birthplace are
high. When we ignore moving costs, it appears that people in the South actually like warmer
summers.

        We present these results to show the importance of controlling for moving costs. Moving
costs are highly significant in all discrete choice models and clearly belong in the models.




37   Similar results obtain when using income before adjusting for taxes (see Sinha et al. (2018b), Figure 3).

                                                                                                                 24
5.3. Comparison of Hedonic and Discrete Choice Results
       When comparing the results from the hedonic model (equation (8) estimated with Albouy
weights) and the discrete choice model (model M.2 of Table 5) estimated using the same
underlying data, two results stand out: The first is that mean MWTP for cooler summers,
averaged across all 284 MSAs, is approximately the same using the two models. Mean MWTP
for warmer winters is about twice as high using the discrete choice model as using the hedonic
model.

        More importantly, the hedonic and discrete choice approaches produce very different
taste sorting patterns. The discrete choice models suggest that households sort across locations
based on preferences for winter temperature: there is a strong positive correlation between winter
temperature and MWTP for winter temperature in Figure 6B. The relationship between MWTP
for winter temperature and MSA temperature resulting from hedonic model (Figure 4) is quite
different. The hedonic model estimates that, at mean winter temperatures below 45 degrees,
MWTP for WT is above the average MWTP in virtually all cities; above 45 degrees, cities in
Texas, Florida are Arizona are willing to pay less than the average MWTP for warmer winters.
More simply put; the correlation between MWTP for winter temperature is approximately -0.40
based on the hedonic model; whereas it is 0.96 using the discrete choice model.

         The two models also produce different sorting patterns for summer temperature. A key
result from the discrete choice model is that preferences for warmer summers and warmer
winters are negatively correlated. This leads to the inverted-U sorting pattern shown in Figure
7B. Households on the Pacific coast, which have high MWTP for warmer winters, also have a
high MWTP for cooler summers. The same is true of households that live in the South Atlantic
division. Both are climate sensitive households. In contrast, the sorting pattern produced by the
hedonic model shows a much stronger negative slope: according to this model, households in
Texas and Florida have the highest MWTP to avoid hotter summers, but households on the
Pacific coast have the lowest MWTP for cooler summers.

5.4. What Accounts for the Differences?
        Why do estimates of the amenity value of temperature differ between the two
approaches? The discrete choice and hedonic models we have estimated differ in three ways: (1)
the discrete choice model incorporates the psychological costs of moving from one’s birthplace,
which the hedonic models do not; (2) the discrete choice model allows for city-specific labor and
housing markets, rather than assuming a national market; (3) the discrete choice model uses




                                                                                                  25
information on market shares (i.e., population), which the hedonic model does not. 38 We explore
each of these possible explanations for the differences between the results produced by the two
models.

        If moving costs prevent amenity values from being fully capitalized into wages and
housing prices, then failure to account for moving costs in the hedonic model should reduce
MWTP estimates compared with those produced by the discrete choice model. Equivalently,
removing moving costs from the discrete choice model should cause discrete choice estimates of
MWTP to fall. This is indeed what happens in the mixed logit models. In Table 5, dropping
moving costs reduces estimates of mean MWTP for winter and summer temperatures: mean
MWTP for winter temperature is about 15% lower in model M.2. than in model M.4; mean
MWTP for summer temperature is about 35% lower. More importantly, it is moving costs that
identify taste sorting patterns in the discrete choice model. Removing them reverses the taste
sorting patterns for winter and summer temperature, as Figure 8 demonstrates. Removing
moving costs from the discrete choice model does not, however, cause estimates of MWTP for
winter and summer temperature produced by the discrete choice model to mirror those produced
by the hedonic model.

        To investigate the impact of national versus city-specific labor markets, we estimate the
discrete choice model derived from a Cobb-Douglas utility function (equation 9´), including only
moving costs and city-specific fixed effects (𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 ) in the first stage. The second stage of estimation
entails regressing city fixed effects on wages, housing prices, and amenities,
                                   𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 = 𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌 ln𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗 − 𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻 ln𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 + 𝑨𝑨𝑗𝑗 𝜷𝜷 + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗                       (20)
which we assume vary only by city. In estimating equation (20), we replace ln𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗 by (1 – τ) 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗𝑤𝑤
and ln𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 by 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗𝑃𝑃 , the same wage and housing price indices that are used in estimating the hedonic
model. This imposes the assumption of national labor and housing markets on the discrete choice
model. The resulting MWTP estimates are not, however, very different from those in Table 5:
Mean MWTP for winter temperature is $344 (s.e. = $72); for summer temperature it is -$423




38
   The two approaches also differ in their underlying econometric assumptions. The discrete choice approach adds a
product-specific shock to the consumer’s utility function (εij). This “taste for product,” which is absent from the
hedonic model, leads the discrete choice approach to have undesirable properties in the context of models of product
choice (Ackerberg and Rysman 2005; Bajari and Benkard 2003, 2004; Berry and Pakes 2001). For example, in
standard random utility models, the demand for each product is strictly positive at every price (Bajari and Benkard
2003, 2004). This can lead to very large values of consumer surplus associated with a product and overstate the
welfare loss when a product is eliminated from the market. This is not, however, an issue in the current context.



                                                                                                                  26
(s.e.=$125). The 95 percent confidence intervals therefore overlap with those produced by the
base discrete choice model (M.2), which assumes city-specific labor and housing markets.

        A third difference between the two approaches arises from the fact that the discrete
choice model uses information on market shares in estimating model parameters, which the
hedonic model does not. This can be seen by rewriting the equation for the second-stage of the
discrete choice model (equation 20), following Bayer et al. (2007), as
                                             𝛼𝛼                             𝜷𝜷
                               𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 /𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌 + (𝛼𝛼 𝐻𝐻 )ln𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 − ln𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗 = 𝑨𝑨𝑗𝑗 𝛼𝛼     + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗 /𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌   (21)
                                              𝑌𝑌)                            𝑌𝑌

          𝛼𝛼
where 𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻 is the share of income spent on housing. Equation (21) is similar to the hedonic
               𝑌𝑌
equation, with the QOL index on the left-hand side adjusted by the city-specific fixed effect 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 .
Given this adjustment, there is no reason why the discrete choice model should yield the same
estimates of MWTP as the hedonic approach, provided 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 varies across cities. Maximization of
the likelihood function of the conditional logit model guarantees that each 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 equates the sum of
the probabilities that each household chooses city j to the number of households in the sample
that actually choose that city. Although 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 will also be influenced by other variables that enter
the first stage of estimation, 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 will reflect the number of households living city j; under random
sampling, this will be proportional to city population. 39 The use of quantity (share) information
should therefore cause discrete choice estimates of MWTP to differ from hedonic estimates.

        Equation (21) helps explain why mean MWTP for winter temperature is higher under the
discrete choice than the hedonic approach. The city-specific fixed effects from the first stage of
the conditional logit model with moving costs (the {δj} in equation 20) are more highly
positively correlated with winter than with summer temperature. This raises MWTP for winter
temperature in the discrete choice model compared with MWTP from the hedonic model.

6. Conclusions
        The goal of this paper is to compare the continuous hedonic and discrete choice
approaches to valuing climate amenities—in particular, summer and winter temperatures. While
previous comparisons of the two methods have focused on comparing mean MWTP (Cragg and
Kahn 1997; Bayer et al. 2009) we have focused on comparing how MWTP for small changes in
winter and summer temperatures vary with a household’s current location. Preferences for
temperature represent a classic case of taste sorting, and for the purposes of valuing climate
policies, it is essential to measure how MWTP for temperature varies with geographic location.


39   Specifically, the correlation between {𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 }and city population is 0.71.

                                                                                                        27
        Simply put, the patterns of taste sorting produced by the two approaches are quite
different. The discrete location choice model suggests that households who live in cities with
warmer winters place a higher value on warmer winters than households who live in cities with
colder winter temperatures, although there is variation across cities in MWTP holding
temperature constant. The continuous hedonic approach using adjusted weights and local linear
regression suggests the opposite: MWTP for an increase in winter temperature is higher for
households living in the West North Central census division, where it is very cold, and in the
Northeast US, than it is in Florida and Texas.

        In terms of summer temperature, the discrete choice approach estimates that climate-
sensitive households in the South Atlantic census division and on the Pacific coast are willing to
pay the most to lower summer temperature. Households in the West North Central division are
willing to pay the least for cooler summers. In contrast, hedonic local linear regressions with
adjusted weights suggest that MWTP for cooler summers is negatively correlated with
temperature at current location: people on the Pacific coast and in the mountain states consider
warmer summers to be a disamenity, but less so than people living in the South Atlantic, West
South Central, and East South Central census divisions, who will bear the brunt of hotter
summers under climate change (Karl et al. 2009).

        There is also a difference in the mean MWTP across models. MWTP for warmer winters
is lower, on average, in the hedonic model with adjusted weights than in the discrete choice case:
when taste sorting is allowed, mean MWTP for a 1 degree increase in winter temperature is $175
with a 95 percent confidence interval of ($124, $203), whereas it is approximately $400 in the
discrete choice model (model M.2 of Table 5). Mean MWTP to avoid warmer summers is
approximately the same in the hedonic model with adjusted weights as in the discrete choice
model, approximately $500 per degree.

        These findings raise an obvious question: Why do results differ across models? Bayer et
al. (2009) suggest that it is the inclusion of moving costs in the discrete choice model that causes
their hedonic and discrete choice results to differ. Including moving costs in the discrete choice
identifies the sorting patterns in this model, i.e., it causes MWTP for warmer winters to increase
with winter temperature. However, removing moving costs does not result in the sorting patterns
estimated using the hedonic model.

        The hedonic and discrete choice approaches differ in other ways. The construction of
hedonic QOL indices is based on national labor and housing market equations that assume that
the returns to human capital and the marginal cost of housing characteristics are everywhere
equal. The discrete choice approach, in contrast, treats each city as a separate market and allows


                                                                                                 28
variation in the returns to human capital and in the marginal price of dwelling characteristics
across cities to identify household preferences. Imposing the assumption of national labor and
housing markets on the discrete choice model does not, however, significantly alter estimates of
mean MWTP for winter and summer temperature produced by that model.

         A more important difference between the hedonic and discrete choice models is how they
use information on prices v. quantities. In the hedonic model wages and housing prices adjust to
clear the labor and housing markets as households and firms sort across cities. The discrete
choice approach uses variation in wages and housing prices across cities to explain the location
decisions of households, but it also uses information on the number of households selecting each
city to estimate the model. The city-specific fixed effects estimated in the first stage of the
discrete choice model equate the sum of the probabilities of choosing a city to the number of
persons in the sample who choose the city. In a random sample, this will be proportional to city
population. When city fixed effects are regressed on amenities in the second stage of estimation
of the discrete choice model, population is implicitly used to estimate preferences. This is not the
case for the hedonic model. We show, following Bayer et al. (2007), that the second stage of
estimation of the discrete choice model, assuming national labor and housing markets, is similar
to that of the hedonic model, with hedonic prices adjusted for city-specific fixed effects. There is
therefore no reason why the two approaches should produce identical estimates of mean MWTP
for city-specific amenities.

         This raises another question: If the hedonic and discrete choice approaches yield different
results, which approach yields the more reliable estimates of the value of climate amenities for
use in evaluating climate policy? We believe that several considerations argue in favor of the
discrete choice approach. As noted above, the discrete choice approach captures the stylized fact
that the majority of households in the United States live in the same state in which the head of
household was born. Informational and psychological frictions make households less than
perfectly mobile. The discrete choice approach also makes use of spatial differences in labor and
housing markets to identify household preferences, rather than assuming a national labor and
housing market.

        Finally, the discrete choice approach is more easily able to measure the impact of urban
amenities on all household groups. The hedonic approach typically focuses on the preferences of
prime-aged households, since a significant fraction of older households have no wage income.
But climate benefits accrue to all households. In Sinha et al. (2018b) we present estimates of the
discrete choice model for households headed by prime-aged adults, adults over 55, and all
households with heads 16 years and older. Estimates of MWTP based on all households are
approximately 40 percent greater than those based on the prime-aged sample. Older households

                                                                                                 29
place a higher value on warmer winters and cooler summers, and it is important to estimate these
benefits.

Note: The point estimates in this graph represent the proportion of income, measured on the Y-
axis. that would be given up for a 5 degree increase in temperature to the number shown on the
X-axis. For example, increasing winter temperature from 10 to 15 degrees is worth 1% of
income (.01), although the error bars on the graph indicate that this coefficient is not significantly
different from zero. An increase in mean winter temperature from 15 to 20 degrees has a point
estimate of 0. These effects reported in the graph are averaged across all values of summer
temperature.

Note: The point estimates in this graph represent the proportion of income, measured on the Y-
axis. that would be given up for a 5 degree increase in temperature to the value on the X-axis.
For example, increasing summer temperature from 60 to 65 degrees is worth -2% of income
(2% of income would be given up to avoid this change), although the error bars on the graph
indicate that this coefficient is not significantly different from zero. The value of avoiding an
increase in mean summer temperature from 65 to 70 is approximately 3% of income. The
effects reported in the graph are averaged across all values of winter temperature.

Note: MWTP is computed at mean household income for the prime-aged sample ($69,161). When entering the regressions nonlinearly,
amenity variables are evaluated at population-weighted means in order to compute MWTP. Nonlinear covariates are as follows: population
density, summer precipitation, and elevation enter in log form, while distance to the coast enters the model quadratically.

Note: When entering the regressions nonlinearly, amenity variables are evaluated at population-weighted means in order to compute MWTP.
Nonlinear covariates are as follows: population density, summer precipitation, and elevation enter in log form, while distance to the coast
enters the model quadratically.
