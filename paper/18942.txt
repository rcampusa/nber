                                             ABSTRACT

We study the dynamics linking monetary policy with bank leverage and show that adjustments in leverage
act as the linchpin in the monetary transmission mechanism that works through fluctuations in risk-taking.
 Motivated by the evidence, we formulate a model of the "risk-taking channel" of monetary policy
in the international context that rests on the feedback loop between increased leverage of global banks
and capital flows amid currency appreciation for capital recipient economies.

1       Introduction
Low interest rates maintained by advanced economy central banks have led to a lively debate
on the nature of global liquidity and its transmission across borders. A popular narrative in
the financial press has been that low interest rates in advanced economies act as a driver of
cross-border capital flows, resulting in overheating and excessive credit growth in the recipient
economies.1 However, the precise economic mechanism behind such a narrative has been more
diﬃcult to pin down.
    One way to shed light on the debate is to start with the empirical evidence on the cyclical na-
ture of leverage and financial conditions. Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) conduct an empirical
study using data from 1973 to 2010 for both advanced and emerging economies on the deter-
minants of financial crises. They find that two factors emerge consistently as the most robust
and significant predictors of financial crises, namely a rapid increase in leverage and a sharp real
appreciation of the currency. Their finding holds both for emerging and advanced economies,
and holds throughout the sample period. Shularick and Taylor (2012) similarly highlight the
role of leverage in financial vulnerability, especially that associated with the banking sector.
Thus, one way to frame the debate on the role of monetary policy in the transmission of global
liquidity is to ask how monetary policy influences leverage and real exchange rates.2
    Banks are intermediaries whose financing costs are closely tied to the policy rate chosen by
the central bank, so that monetary policy may act directly on the economy through greater
risk-taking by the banking sector. Borio and Zhu (2012) coined the term “risk-taking channel
of monetary policy”, and Adrian and Shin (2008, 2011) and Adrian, Estrella and Shin (2009)
have explored the workings of the risk-taking channel for the United States.                  In this paper,
we explore the workings of the risk-taking channel both domestically and in an international
setting.

    2
     See also the IMF working paper by Lund-Jensen (2012) that presents similar evidence. Our question is
related to the debate on whether monetary policy was “too loose” in the run-up to the crisis with respect to
the Taylor Rule (Taylor (2007), Bernanke (2010)). However, our focus is narrower in that we examine the
risk-taking channel more explicitly.


                                                      1
   Our first contribution is to draw together two strands in the empirical literature and highlight
the importance of leverage as the common thread that ties the two. Bekaert, Hoerova and Lo
Duca (2012) conduct a VAR study of the relationship between the policy rate chosen by the
Federal Reserve (the target Fed Funds rate) and measured risks given by the VIX index of
implied volatility on US equity options, and show that there is a close interaction between
the two variables.    In particular, they show that a cut in the Fed Funds rate is followed
by a dampening of the VIX index.         Meanwhile, Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) find that a
contractionary shock to US monetary policy leads to persistent appreciation in the US dollar
both in nominal and real terms.
   Our contribution is to show that these two sets of results may be seen as two sides of the
same coin. We highlight bank leverage as the linchpin in the risk-taking channel of monetary
policy that translates lower measures of risk into greater risk-taking, and then to other real and
financial variables. Among the variables impacted by a shock to leverage are capital flows and
exchange rates. We verify in our VAR analysis that a decrease in the Fed Fund rate leads to
depreciations in the US dollar after about 14 quarters, while an increase in leverage is followed by
a depreciation of the US dollar from 3 quarters but which persists for 20 quarters or more. These
results are consistent with the so-called delayed overshooting puzzle found in Eichenbaum and
Evans (1995) who find that a contractionary shock to US monetary policy leads to persistent
appreciation in nominal and real US exchange rates, with a maximum impact that does not
occur contemporaneously but at least 24 months after the shock. Our complementary finding
is that the impact on exchange rates works through leverage and the VIX. In addition, we
document an additional international dimension of the transmission of monetary policy through
capital flows whereby a contractionary shock to US monetary policy leads to a decrease in the
cross-border capital flows in the banking sector.
   Recent papers have documented micro evidence in support of the risk-taking channel of
monetary policy, showing how credit standards are influenced by the central bank policy rate.
For instance, Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró and Saurina (2012) using data from Europe find that
a low policy rate induces thinly capitalized banks to grant more loans to ex ante riskier firms.

                                                 2
Maddaloni and Peydró (2011) find that low rates erode lending standards, for both firms and
households.    Using US survey data, Dell’Ariccia, Laeven and Suarez (2013) find that low
interest rates are associated with riskier lending according the internal ratings used by the
banks themselves.
   The existing literature has focused mainly on lending standards using individual loan data.
Our complementary approach extends the existing micro studies by addressing the macro dy-
namics between monetary policy, the financial intermediary sector and the risk-taking channel
through vector autoregression (VAR) methods. In particular, we explore the extent to which
measures of risk drive the transmission of monetary policy, both domestically and in the inter-
national context and show that the leverage cycle of the intermediary sector as a whole takes
up an important position in the transmission of monetary policy.
   Our second contribution is theoretical. Motivated by the evidence, we construct a theory
of the risk-taking channel of monetary policy in which banks intermediate dollar funds to local
borrowers who hold local currency assets. Our model delivers the core result that bank leverage
is increasing in the expected appreciation of the local currency, thereby connecting with the key
empirical finding in Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) and Lund-Jensen (2012) that the combi-
nation of higher leverage and sharp appreciation of the currency signals greater vulnerability to
reversals.
   In our model, banks are subject to moral hazard in which they can choose an inferior portfolio
of loans in terms of expected repayment, but which generates higher upside potential due to
greater correlation in loan outcomes. The contracting problem that ensues has a unique solution
in which banks’ access to international funding is limited by a leverage constraint, which in turn
depends on the stage of the business cycle.         We show through comparative statics on the
expected default rate that the unique solution to the contracting problem is associated with
procyclical leverage of the banks (leverage is high when assets are large), and that expected
currency appreciation is a key driver of the fluctuations in leverage. Our main proposition is
that bank leverage is increasing in the extent of expected currency appreciation.
   When our result is taken to realistic settings, we show the potential for amplified monetary

                                                3
policy spillovers across borders.   Lowering of bank funding costs in financial centers gives
an initial impetus for greater risk-taking in cross-border banking, and any initial appreciation
of the currency of the capital-recipient economy strengthens the balance sheet position of the
borrowers. From the point of view of the banks that have lent to them, their loan book becomes
less risky, relaxing the funding constraints for banks and creating spare capacity to lend even
more. In this way, the initial impetus is amplified through a reinforcing mechanism in which
greater risk-taking by banks dampens volatility, which elicits even greater risk-taking, thereby
completing the circle.
   In formulating our theoretical framework, we follow Woodford’s (2010) exhortation for “mod-
els in which intermediation plays a role, but in which intermediation is modeled in a way that
better conforms to current institutional realities” (Woodford (2010, p. 21)). Our model of the
risk-taking channel is designed to capture the key institutional features that we outline in the
course of the paper, in particular the fluctuations in the claims given by the cross-border bank-
ing statistics of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). In particular, our model captures
the well-documented procyclical nature of leverage, which determines empirical magnitudes for
macro fluctuations (Nuño and Thomas (2012)).
   Our model highlights the impact of fluctuations in leverage, rather than of default itself. The
leverage constraint addresses the possibility default, so that the actual probability of default
is zero in the resulting contract, just as in Geanakoplos (2009).     More recently, Fostel and
Geanakoplos (2012) prove in a more general setting that the zero probability of default is a
general feature in a class of general equilibrium models of leverage.    Our model diﬀers from
Geanakoplos (2009) and Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012) in that we build an agency model with
moral hazard rather than a micro-founded competitive equilibrium model. Our model is closer
in spirit to Dell’Ariccia, Laeven and Marquez (2010) who examine a pass-through model of
lending by banks in which changes in bank funding rates lead to fluctuations in leverage.
   The risk-taking channel stands in contrast to models of monetary economics that have tra-
ditionally been used at central banks, which tend to downplay the importance of short-term
interest rates as price variables in their own right. Instead, the emphasis falls on the impor-

                                                4
tance of managing market expectations. The emphasis is on charting a path for future short
rates and communicating this path clearly to the market, so that the central bank can influence
long rates such as mortgage rates, corporate lending rates, as well as other prices that aﬀect
consumption and investment.
    In contrast, our focus is on the impact of short-term rates on the feedback loop between
leverage and measures of risk, especially in the international context.      The combination of
the theory and empirical evidence paints a consistent picture of the fluctuations in “global
liquidity” and what role monetary policy has in moderating global liquidity.       By identifying
the mechanisms more clearly, we may hope that policy debates on the global spillover eﬀects of
monetary policy can be given a firmer footing. The recent BIS report on global liquidity (BIS
(2011)) has served as a catalyst for further work in this area, and our paper can be seen as one
component of the analytical follow-up to the report.


2     First Look at the Evidence
We begin with a preliminary look at the empirical evidence on the impact of monetary policy on
risk-taking and market conditions, examining the dynamic relationship between the monetary
stance of the central bank and measures of risk and credit availability.
    The motivation for our initial empirical investigation comes from the close relationship that
holds between bank balance sheet adjustment and measured risks in the financial system. An
illustration of the relationship between bank lending behavior and risk is given in Figure 1
which shows the scatter chart of the changes in debt, equity and risk-weighted assets (RWA) to
changes in total assets of Barclays, a typical global bank active in international markets. Figure
1 plots {(∆  ∆ )}, {(∆  ∆ )} and {(∆  ∆RWA )} where ∆ is the two-year change
in assets, and where ∆ , ∆ and ∆RWA are the corresponding changes in equity, debt, and
risk-weighted assets, respectively.
    The first notable feature of Figure 1 is how the relationship between the changes in the
total assets and its risk-weighted assets is very flat. In other words, the risk-weighted assets

barely change, even as the raw assets change by large amounts. The fact that risk-weighted
assets change little even as raw assets fluctuate by large amounts indicates the compression of
measured risks during lending booms and heightened measured risks during busts.                                                                             In other
words, banks expand their lending when measures of risk point to tranquil conditions.3
    For the risk-taking channel, the reverse causation is also important.                                                                            When lending is
expanding rapidly, the increased supply of credit is likely to compress risk spreads.                                                                         To the
extent that the VIX index is closely related to such measures of risk, we would expect that
shifts in the leverage of the banking sector will have an impact on the VIX index itself. We
will verify the existence of such a channel in our VAR exercise, thereby shedding light on the
finding by Bekaert et al. (2012) that low policy rates lead to a dampening of the VIX. Our VAR
exercise points to bank leverage as the channel for monetary policy to aﬀect market conditions.
Our theory section will build on our empirical findings.
   3
     Adrian and Shin (2012) show that bank leverage is closely (negatively) aligned with the Value-at-Risk (VaR)
of the banks.


                                                                                                     6
   The second notable feature of Figure 1 is how changes in assets are reflected dollar for dollar
(or pound for pound) in the change in debt, not equity. We see this from the slope of the scatter
chart relating changes in assets and changes in debt, which is very close to one. Leverage is
thus procyclical; leverage is high when the balance sheet is large, and credit supply and leverage
move one-for-one.
   Our preliminary empirical investigation comes from recursive vector autoregressions (VAR)
examining the dynamic relationship between the VIX index of implied volatility on the S&P
index options, the real Feds Funds target rate of the Federal Reserve, and a proxy for the
leverage of global banks. The real Fed Funds target rate is computed for the end of the quarter
as the target Fed Funds rate minus the CPI inflation rate. In some specifications to be reported
below, we also employ the Eﬀective Fed Funds rate, which are the actual prices observed in the
Fed Funds interbank lending market.
   Our empirical counterpart for global bank leverage should ideally be measured as the leverage
of the broker dealer subsidiaries of the global banks that faciliated cross-border lending. Shin
(2012) shows that the European global banks were central in banking sector capital flows in the
years before the crisis of 2008. However, the reported balance sheet data for European banks
are the consolidated numbers for the holding company that includes the much larger commercial
banking unit, rather than the wholesale investment banking subsidiary alone. For the reasons
discussed in Adrian and Shin (2010, 2012), broker dealers and commercial banks will diﬀer in
important ways in their balance sheet management. For this reason, we use instead the leverage
of the US broker dealer sector from the US Flow of Funds series published by the Federal Reserve
as our empirical proxy for global bank leverage. To the extent that US broker dealers dance to
the same tune as the broker dealer subsidiaries of the European global banks, we may expect
to capture the main forces at work.
   The left panel of Figure 2 plots the leverage series of the US broker dealer sector from
1995Q4.4 Leverage increases up to 2007, and then falls abruptly with the onset of the financial
   4
    Leverage is obtained from (1) “total liabilities” (FL664190005.Q) and (2) “total liabilities and equity”
(FL664194005.Q) of the US broker dealer sector from the Flow of Funds. Leverage is defined as 2/(2 — 1).

crisis. The right panel of Figure 2 shows how US broker dealer leverage is closely associated with
the risk measure given by the VIX index of the implied volatility in S&P 500 stock index option
prices from Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The dark squares in the scatter chart
are the observations after 2007Q4 associated with the crisis and its aftermath. The scatter chart
adds weight to theories of leverage based on measured risk, such as Value-at-Risk as argued in
Adrian and Shin (2010, 2012).                                                                                            The close relationship between leverage and VIX also provides
a point of contact between Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) who point to the importance of
leverage with Forbes and Warnock (2012) who have highlighted the explanatory power of the
VIX index for gross capital flows.
    Finally, in anticipation of our main empirical investigation into the international dimension
to the risk-taking channel we include in the VAR the US dollar exchange rate as measured by
the Real Eﬀective Exchange Rate (REER) of the US dollar, which is a trade-weighted index of
the value of the dollar, obtained from the IMF’s IFS database. An increase in REER indicates
an appreciation of the US dollar relative to its trade-weighted basket of other currencies. Our
sample is for the period before the crisis in order to examine the workings of the risk-taking


                                                                                                                                                                  8
channel on the up-swing of the global liquidity cycle.       We use quarterly data from the last
quarter of 1995 to the last quarter of 2007. The fourth quarter of 2007 marks the beginning of
the financial crisis, and our empirical results turn out to be sensitive to the zero lower bound
on the policy rate after the crisis, as we explain below.

2.1    Recursive Vector Autoregressions
In our preliminary VAR analysis, the data consist of the real Fed Funds target rate, the log
of the VIX index, the leverage of the US broker dealer sector, and the real eﬀective exchange
rate (REER) of the US dollar. The exchange rate series is included as a prelude to our more
detailed examination of the cross-border eﬀects. From tests for stationarity, we include the US
dollar REER as the log diﬀerence.
   The selection of the number of variables follows from the tradeoﬀ between using a par-
simonious model to avoid overfitting, while guarding against omitted variable bias that can
undermine the interpretation of the results of the VAR. Sims (1980) and Stock and Watson
(2001) describe the tradeoﬀs that are entailed in the selection of variables in the VAR. In our
case, the selection of variables is motivated by the interaction between measured risks and bank-
ing sector leverage. By including both the VIX index and the broker-dealer leverage variable,
we hope to capture the core mechanism that involve financial intermediaries.
   Our interest is focused especially on the way that monetary policy interacts with measured
risks and the risk-taking behavior of the banks.      These questions motivate the choice of our
variables. As well as the Fed Funds target rate itself, we also examine additional VARs where
other proxies for US monetary policy shocks are used instead, such as the residual from a
(backward-looking) Taylor Rule, the eﬀective (market) Fed Funds rate and the growth in the
M1 money stock in the United States.
   We identify the impact of shocks by writing the vector autogression in recursive form. For
the data series { } consisting of the vector  of the variables of interest, we consider the system

                                            () =                                            (1)


                                                  9
where () is a matrix of polynomial in the lag operator , and  is a vector of orthogonalized
distrurbances. For the four variable VAR, we impose the Cholesky restrictions by applying the
following exclusion restrictions on contemporaneous responses in the matrix  to fit a just-
identified model:                      ⎡              ⎤
                                      11 0    0   0
                                    ⎢ 21 22 0    0 ⎥
                                  =⎢
                                    ⎣ 31 32 33 0 ⎦
                                                      ⎥                                       (2)
                                      41 42 43 44

   The ordering of the variables imposed in the recursive form implies that the variable with
index 1 is not aﬀected by the contemporaneous shocks to the other variables, while variable 2 is
aﬀected by the contemporaneous shock to variable 1, but not variables 3 and 4. In general, the
recursive form implies that a variable with index  is aﬀected by the contemporaneous shocks
to variables with index   , but not by the contemporaneous shocks to variables with index
  . Thus, slower moving variables (like the Fed Funds target rate) are better candidates to
be ordered before the fast moving variables like REER and other market prices, although some
caution is necessary even here, as explained in Stock and Watson (2001), since the realism of
the assumptions underlying the recursive identification of shocks may depend on the frequency
of the time series.
   Formal lag selection procedures (Hannan and Quinn information criterion (HQIC) and the
Bayesian information criterion (BIC)) suggest one lag. However, the Lagrange multiplier test for
autocorrelation in the residuals of the VAR shows that only the model with two lags eliminates
all serial correlation in the residuals. We therefore choose two lags. For a stable VAR model we
want the eigenvalues to be less than one and the formal test confirms that all the eigenvalues lie
inside the unit circle. We compute bootstrapped confidence intervals based on 1000 replications,
and make the small-sample adjustment when estimating the variance-covariance matrix of the
disturbances.
   Of our four variables, two are market prices - VIX and the US dollar REER - which adjust
instantaneously to news.     The Fed Funds target rate reflects the periodic decision making
process at the Federal Reserve and the slowly evolving implementation of monetary policy.

                                               10
The adjustment of broker dealer (book) leverage will reflect the speed of the balance adjustment
of market-based intermediaries and so we may see them as being of intermediate sluggishness.

2.2     Evidence from Impulse Response Functions
Figures 3 presents the impulse response functions from our four variable recursive VAR with
90 percent confidence bands. The ordering of the four variables is (1) Fed Funds target rate
(2) broker dealer leverage (3) VIX and (4) US dollar REER. Figure 3 is organized so that the
rows of the matrix indicates the variable whose shock we are following and the columns of the
matrix indicate the variable whose response we are tracking. Each cell of the tables gives the
impulse responses over 20 quarters to a one-standard-deviation variable shock identified in the
first column.
      Figure 4 collects together the key panels for the narrative. Consider first the impact of a
shock to the Fed Funds target rate, interpreted as a monetary policy shock and examine the
impact of the shock on the leverage of the US broker dealer sector.
   We see from Figure 4 that a positive Fed Funds target rate shock leads to a decline in
leverage after a fairly long lag of around 10 quarters and remains significant until quarter 17.
The impact reaches a maximum response of -0.47 at quarter 12. When measured against the
sample average of 21.94 for leverage, the one standard deviation shock to the Fed Funds rate
entails a decline in leverage to around 21.5. The other panels reveal aspects of the mechanism
for such an eﬀect. The left panel of Figure 4 shows that the impact of tigher monetary policy
is to raise the VIX measure from quarter 4, which corroborates the finding in Bakaert et al.
(2012) who find a similar eﬀect on the VIX starting between months 9 and 11.
   Our distinctive finding is the middle panel in Figure 4 which shows that an increase in the
VIX index lowers bank leverage. This panel provides indirect support for the proposition that
the banking sector’s balance sheet management is driven by risk measures such as Value-at-Risk,
as argued by Adrian and Shin (2010, 2012). Thus, the conjunction of the first two panels tells
the story underlying the final panel - of how an increase in the US dollar bank funding costs
results in a decline in bank leverage.

Figure 4. Impulse response functions in recursive VAR. This figure presents three panels from the impulse
response functions of the four variable VAR (Fed Funds, BD leverage, VIX and REER) illustrating the impact
of a Fed Funds target rate shock on the leverage of the US broker dealer sector. A positive Fed Funds target
rate shock leads to a decline in broker dealer leverage, via the fall in theVIX index. The panels show 90 percent
bootstrapped confidence intervals for the model with two lags, based on 1000 replications.



     Finally, in anticipation of our examination of the international dimension to the risk-taking
channel, Figure 5 collects together the panels that form a narrative of the impact of a shock
to the Fed Funds target rate on the US dollar exchange rate as given by REER (real eﬀective
exchange rate).             We see from Figure 5 that a positive Fed Funds target rate shock leads to
an appreciation of the US dollar after a fairly long lag. The left panel of Figure 5 shows the
fall in leverage of the banking sector induced by higher bank funding costs (seen already) while
the middle panel shows that an increase in bank leverage leads to a fall in the value of the US
dollar by 0.42% of the REER index in quarter 3, and with an impact that remains significantly
negative for the entire 20 quarters. Thus, the conjunction of the first two panels tells the story
underlying the final panel - of how a fall in the US dollar bank funding costs results in a decline
in the value of the US dollar.
     Our results are consistent with the “delayed overshooting puzzle” found in Eichenbaum and
Evans (1995) who find that a contractionary shock to US monetary policy leads to persistent
appreciation in nominal and real US dollar exchange rates, with an impact that does not occur
contemporaneously but which comes between 24 and 39 months after the initial shock depend-
ing on the currency pair considered. Our complementary evidence shows that the impact of

monetary policy works through leverage and the VIX.
        We return in the next section to delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying the interna-
tional dimension of the risk-taking channel.

2.2.1       Variance Decompositions

We have seen that monetary policy has a medium-run (two to three years) impact on broker
leverage and VIX, and that broker dealer leverage has a statistically significant eﬀect on the
US dollar exchange rate. As well as their statistical significance, such eﬀects are also significant
economically. Figure 6 shows what fraction of the structural variance of the four variables in
the VAR is due to monetary policy shocks or BD leverage shocks. We see that monetary policy
shocks account for almost 30% of the variance of VIX and between 10% and 20% of the variance
of BD leverage at horizons longer than 10 quarters. On the other hand, we see that monetary
policy shocks are less important drivers of the variance of US dollar exchange rate as given by
REER.
        BD leverage shocks account for more than 20% of the variance of the exchange rate and for
almost 40% of the variance of the Fed Funds rate at horizons longer than 10 quarters. They also

decomposition reveals a considerable degree of interactions between the variables in our model,
and point to the importance of the leverage cycle of the global banks as being a key determinant
of the transmission of monetary policy shocks.

2.2.2   Alternative Measures of Monetary Policy Shocks

Figure 7 shows the impulse-response functions for alternative measures of monetary policy stance
on REER, VIX and BD-leverage in the four-variable VAR with 2 lags and 1000 bootstrapped
standard errors. Monetary policy shocks considered are residuals from a Taylor rule, M1 growth
and nominal eﬀective Fed Funds rate.
   The first alternative measure of monetary policy stance is the diﬀerence between the nominal
Fed Funds target rate and the Fed Funds rate implied by a backward looking Taylor rule. The
Taylor rule rate we use assumes the natural real Fed funds rate and the target inflation rate to
be 2%, while the output gap is computed as the percentage deviation of real GDP (from the IFS)
from potential GDP (from the Congressional Budget Oﬃce). In the top row of Figure 7, we see
that our qualitative conclusions using the Fed Funds target rate as the monetary policy shock
remain unchanged. A positive interest rate shock leads to an appreciation of the US dollar after
a lag of 10 quarters, and the mechanism is consistent with a decline in banking sector leverage
after around 7 quarters. In turn, the “risk-taking channel” is clearly evident in the middle cell
of the top row, where a monetary policy shock is associated with greater measured risks after
two quarters.
   We consider two further alternative measure of monetary policy shocks, shown in the second
and third rows of Figure 7.     One is the growth rate of the US M1 money stock, where a
positive shock to M1 corresponding to monetary policy loosening. We see that the qualitative
conclusions are borne out in the impulse responses for the exchange rate and the banking sector
leverage. The impact on the VIX dissipates more quickly than for the other monetary shock

Figure 7. Alternative definitions of monetary policy shocks. This figure shows the impulse-response
functions and 90 percent confidence bands for alternative monetary policy shocks on REER, VIX and BD-
leverage in the four-variable model with two lags and 1000 bootstrapped standard errors. Monetary policy
shocks considered are residuals from a Taylor rule, M1 growth and nominal eﬀective Fed Funds rate.

bank deposits rather than riskier claims. Further empirical investigations may reveal more the
reasons for the diﬀerences.
   Our third measure of monetary policy shock is the nominal eﬀective Federal Funds rate,
which measures actual transactions prices used in the Fed Funds market of interbank lending,
rather than the Fed Funds target rate itself. Our earlier conclusions using the Fed Funds target
rate are confirmed. To the extent that the diﬀerence between the Fed Funds target rate and
the eﬀective Fed Funds rate are small, high frequency deviations, our results are perhaps not
surprising.

2.2.3      Robustness Checks

In addition to the empirical findings reported in our paper, we also conduct robustness exercises
for our VAR investigation, which are reported separately in an on-line appendix that accom-
panies our paper.5       In the on-line appendix, we examine a number of variations in our VAR
exercise and gauge the robustness of our findings to changes in the ordering of the variables and
to the introduction of new variables.
   The sensitivity of the recursive VAR to alternative ordering of the variables is a perennial
theme in VAR analysis. The selection of our variables has been motivated by the risk-taking
channel of monetary policy, and the diﬀerent degrees of inertia inherent in our selected variables
give some basis for the specification of our VAR analysis (see Kilian (2011) for discussion of this
point). In the on-line appendix, we examine the alternative ordering: (1) Fed Funds target rate
(2) broker dealer leverage (3) REER and (4) VIX, where the two price variables REER and VIX
are switched. Our key findings on the risk-taking channel remain unchanged to such a change.
   The on-line appendix also reports the impulse reponses for the VAR when the Fed Funds
rate is ordered last6 to investigate within-quarter policy responses of the Fed Funds rate to VIX
or bank leverage. In the VAR with the ordering: (1) broker dealer leverage (2) VIX (3) REER
and (4) Fed Funds target rate, our key results on the risk-taking channel are again qualitatively

unchanged.
    Our results remain unchanged if we use the nominal eﬀective exchange rate (NEER) instead
of the real eﬀective exchange rate (REER), as shown in the on-line appendix.
    We also examine one spefication that includes the growth of US industrial production in the
VAR to examine the impact of macroeconomic conditions as a backdrop to monetary policy.
Our results (reported in the on-line appendix) indicate that including industrial production does
not alter the main conclusions on the mechanism of the risk-taking channel through the leverage
of the broker dealer sector.
    Our sample period stops in 2007. The crisis period presents special challenges in the VAR
estimation, especially since the post-crisis period is associated with the Fed Funds rate pressed
against the zero lower bound (see Liu, Waggoner and Zha (2011) and Kilian (2011)). The VAR
using an extended sample period that encompasses the zero lower bound period show markedly
weaker VAR impulse responses, and many of the impulse response functions associated with
shifts in the Fed Funds target rate fail to show significant eﬀects. All the evidence points to
a structural break in the relationships driving our key macro variables. Bekaert et al (2012)
also find a similar structural break, suggesting that shifts in the autoregressive slope parameters
may also have oﬀsetting eﬀects on the impulse response functions. For this reason, the results
reported in this paper should be seen as applying mainly for the boom period preceding the
onset of the crisis.


3     International Dimension
Given the promising nature of the evidence for the risk-taking channel driven by the banking
sector, we turn our attention to the international dimension of the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy.       Taylor (2013) has argued that the potential for monetary policy spillovers
operating through divergent policy interest rates has led to an enforced coordination of interest
rate policy among central banks who fear that failure to follow suit in lowering rates would
undermine other macro objectives.       The role of global banks that channel wholesale funding

across borders is perhaps the most important channel for such transmission of financial condi-
tions.   For instance, Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012) have found that global banks respond to
changes in US monetary policy by reallocating funds between the head oﬃce and its foreign
oﬃces, thus contributing to the international propagation of domestic liquidity shocks.
   Figure 8 is from the BIS locational banking statistics, and plots the foreign currency assets
and liabilities of BIS-reporting banks, classified according to currency. The top plot represents
the US dollar-denominated assets of BIS-reporting banks in foreign currency, and hence gives
the US dollar assets of banks outside the United States. The bottom plot in Figure 8 gives the
corresponding US dollar-denominated liabilities of banks outside the United States. It is clear
from the Figure that the US dollar plays a much more prominent role in cross-border banking
than does the euro, sterling or yen.
   To gain some perspective on the size of the US dollar assets in Figure 8, we can plot the
total assets series next to the aggregate commercial banking sector in the United States, which
is given in Figure 9. We see that US dollar assets of banks outside the US exceeded $10 trillion
in 2008Q1, and briefly overtook the US chartered commercial banking sector in terms of total

assets.    So, the sums are substantial.                                       It is as if an oﬀshore banking sector of comparable
size to the US commercial banking sector is intermediating US dollar claims and obligations.
Shin (2012) shows that the European global banks account for a large fraction of the US dollar
intermediation activity that takes place outside the United States.7

3.1       VAR Analysis of Capital Flows
We augment our list of VAR variables by adding a measure of international banking sector
flows into our existing VAR analysis. Bruno and Shin (2012) show that global “supply push”
variables are responsible in driving cross-border banking sector flows, but they do not investigate
the role of monetary policy shocks for bank leverage fluctuations and for the spillover eﬀects
on international capital flows.                     Our focus here is on how monetary policy aﬀects such global
factors.

     A BIS (2010) study describes how the branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks in the United States borrow
from money market funds and then channel the funds to their headquarters. See also Baba, McCauley and
Ramaswamy (2009), McGuire and von Peter (2009), IMF (2011) and Shin (2012), who note that in the run-up
to the crisis, roughly 50% of the assets of U.S. prime money market funds were obligations of European banks.


                                                                                                 21
   The additional variable we include in the VAR is the first diﬀerence of the BIS 5A series for
US dollar liabilities of banks located outside the US. This is the series given by the bottom
time plot in Figure 8, but given positive sign. The objective is to capture the activities of the
internationally active banks that were instrumental in channeling dollar funding globally. The
objective is to shed further light on the mechanism involved in generating the result from the
previous section that bank leverage is closely related to changes in the US dollar exchange rate.
   We use the following Cholesky ordering: (1) Fed Funds target rate (2) broker dealer leverage
(3) BIS banking flows (4) VIX and (5) US dollar REER. Capital flows reflect the speed of
balance adjustment of the intermediaries and so we order them between the Fed Funds rate
and the market variables, but after the broker dealer leverage. Figure 10 presents the impulse
responses together with the 90% confidence bands for the model with two lags.         As before,
Figure 10 is organized so that the rows of the matrix indicates the variable whose shock we are
following and the columns of the matrix indicate the variable whose response we are tracking.
Each cell of the tables gives the impulse responses over 20 quarters to a one-standard-deviation
variable shock identified in the first column.
   As well as showing the impact of the risk-taking channel of monetary policy on the US dollar
exchange rate as before, Figure 10 also reveals how capital flows through the banking sector is
an important element of the narrative of the risk-taking channel. Figure 11 gathers three of the
panels for a more succinct summary of the relationships. The left panel of Figure 11 shows the
impact of a Fed Funds shock on banking sector leverage, showing very clearly the risk-taking
channel of monetary policy associated with the leverage cycle of global banks. A positive shock
in the Fed Funds rate reduces leverage markedly from after around 10 quarters reaching its
maximum impact at quarter 12 (consistent with Figure 3).
   The other two panels in Figure 11 shows the impact of the risk taking channel on capital flows
through the banking sector. The middle panel in Figure 11 shows that an increase in broker
dealer leverage leads to a marked increase in BIS bank flows after 11 quarters and reaching its
maximum impact after 17 quarters. The right panel in Figure 11 shows the consequence of the
chain reaction where the monetary policy shock works through leverage leading to a decrease

in the capital flows in the banking sector starting in quarter 8 and remaining significant until
quarter 17. In the on-line appendix we verify that these results hold under alternative ordering
of the variables.
        Figures 10 and 11 together show the risk-taking channel in action, where monetary policy
and measured risks determine the leverage cycle of the banking sector, eventually leaving its
mark on the US dollar exchange rate and the capital flows funded by the US dollar.                                   The
empirical regularities uncovered in our VAR results lend considerable weight to the informal
account of the risk-taking channel sketched in our introductory section.                               The following key
findings will provide the motivation for our theoretical framework for the risk-taking channel,
to be developed below.

Empirical Feature 1. When the US dollar bank funding rate declines, there follows a depre-
            ciation of the US dollar.

Empirical Feature 2. When the US dollar bank funding rate declines, there follows an in-
            crease in the leverage of the banking sector and increased capital flows as measured by the
            BIS banking statistics.

Figure 12. This figure depicts the lending relationships examined in the model. A foreign bank branch lends to
local borrowers in dollars and finances its lending from the wholesale dollar funding market.



Empirical Feature 3. When banking sector capital flows accelerate, there follows a deprecia-
      tion of the US dollar.

    Empirical Feature 1 corroborates the finding in Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) that the US
dollar tends to depreciate over a protracted period when the US dollar funding cost declines.
The combination of these three findings motivates our theoretical exercise of constructing a
model of the risk-taking channel.


4     Model of Risk-Taking Channel
4.1     Model Setting
Motivated by the evidence, we construct a model of the risk-taking channel built around the
banking sector, based on the relationships depicted in Figure 12. A bank based in the capital
flow-recipient economy lends to local borrowers in dollars and finances its lending by borrowing
from the wholesale dollar funding market.                          Local borrowers could be either household or
corporate borrowers. For corporate borrowers, borrowing in foreign currency and holding local
currency assets is one way for exporting companies to hedge their future dollar export receivables.

Even for non-exporters, borrowing in foreign currency is a means toward speculating on currency
movements.
   The banks in our model have well diversified loan portfolios consisting of loans to many local
borrowers. Although the bank does not have a currency mismatch, the local borrowers do have
a currency mismatch.       They borrow in US dollars, but invest in projects whose outcome is
denominated in local currency.
   There are many identical borrowers indexed by . Each borrower has a project maturing
at date  which is financed by a loan of  dollars from the bank. Loans are granted at date 0
and repaid at date  . The value of the borrower’s project in local currency terms at date  is
denoted by  . Denote by  the exchange rate at date  expressed as the price of local currency
in dollars. Thus, an increase in  corresponds to an appreciation of the local currency relative
to the dollar. Let ̄ denote the date 0 expected value of  .
   Credit risk follows the Merton (1974) model. There are many identical borrowers indexed
by . Suppose that the terminal value of the borrower’s project in dollar terms is a lognormal
random variable given by
                                           ½µ          ¶            ¾

The project outcome density reflects the higher expected return in dollar terms when the local
currency appreciates relative to the dollar.

   Note that the distance to default is increasing in ̄ reflecting the stronger balance sheet of
borrowers following currency appreciation when they have borrowed in dollars.
   Banks provide dollar-denominated credit (denoted ) to local borrowers at the rate 1 + .
Our model will satisfy an aggregation feature (to be reported below), so that it is without loss
of generality to assume there is a single bank. For simplicity, we will assume that there is an
infinitely elastic demand for dollar-denominated credit at the rate 1 + , so that we may assume
 to be fixed.
   The credit is funded by cross-border bank liabilities (denoted by ) drawn from wholesale
markets or from the parent bank at the funding rate 1 +  , which will be determined from the
solution to the contracting problem. Both  and  are denominated in dollars. The bank’s
book equity (also in dollars) is denoted by .

   The bank has a well diversified loan portfolio consisting of loans to many local borrowers.
Credit risk for the bank follows the Vasicek (2002) extension of the Merton model.8 Assume
that the standard normal  can be written as the linear combination:
                                              √    p
                                        =     + 1 −                                      (5)

where  and { } are mutually independent standard normals.  is the common risk factor
while each  are the idiosyncratic component of credit risk for the particular borrower . The
parameter  ∈ (0 1) determines the weight given to the common factor  . Therefore, borrower
 repays the loan when  ≥ 0, where  is the random variable:
                                                 √    p
                                      =  +     + 1 −                                   (6)

where  is the distance to default of borrower . The probability of default by borrower  is
 = Φ (− ). Since  is a function of the expected terminal exchange rate ̄ , the probability
of default  is also a function of ̄ .

4.2     Moral Hazard
The bank is simultaneously both a lender and a borrower (it borrows in order to lend), but our
contracting problem highlights the status of the bank as the borrower. The bank is the agent
and the bank’s wholesale creditor is the principal. We assume that the principal is risk neutral
and operates in a competitive bank funding market.
   The bank (the agent) has the choice of selecting its portfolio of loans, but faces a moral
hazard problem in this choice. The bank chooses between two alterantive portfolios. The good
portfolio consists of loans which have a probability of default , and low pairwise correlation of
default across loans. The bad portfolio consists of loans with a higher probability of default
 + , for known constant   0, as well as a higher pairwise correlation of default. For the
bank, however, the greater correlation in defaults across loans generates greater dispersion in
   8
   The Vasicek model is the workhorse credit risk model for banks, and has been adopted by the Basel
Committee for Banking Supervision (2005) as the backbone of international bank capital rules.

the outcome density for the loan portfolio, which is associated with a higher option value of
limited liability of using debt financing.
   Specifically, we suppose that the good portfolio consists of loans with default probability of
, but with zero correlation between defaults. The bad portfolio consists of loans with higher
default probility  + , and pairwise correlation   0, which is a known constant.
   Private credit extended by the bank is  at interest rate  so that the notional value of
assets (the amount due to the bank at date  ) is (1 + ) .         Conditional on  , defaults are
independent. Taking the limit where the number of borrowers becomes large while keeping the
notional assets fixed, the realized value of the bank’s assets can be written as a deterministic
function of  , by the law of large numbers.
   If the bank chooses the bad portfolio, the realized value of assets at date  is the random
variable  ( ) defined as:
                                         ³√       p                     ´

                 ( ) = (1 + )  · Pr     + 1 −  ≥ Φ ( + ) |
                                        ³ √ −1        ´
                                           −Φ (+)
                        = (1 + )  · Φ      √

It is convenient to normalize  by the face value of assets. We define ̂ ( ) ≡  ( )  (1 + ) .
The c.d.f. of ̂ is then given by

   If the bank chooses the good portfolio, the default probability is  and correlation in defaults
is zero. The outcome distribution for the good portfolio is obtained from (8) by setting  = 0
and letting  → 0. In this limit, the numerator of the expression inside the brackets is positive
when   1 −  and negative when   1 − .              Thus, the outcome distribution of the good
portfolio is                                    ½

so that the good portfolio consists of i.i.d. loans all of which have a probability of default of ,
and the bank can fully diversify across the i.i.d. loans.
   Denote by  the ratio (1 + )  (1 + ) .       Then, the bank’s objective function can be
written as
                                         (̂) − [ −  ()]                                   (10)

where  (̂) is the expected realization of the (normalized) loan portfolio, and the expression
in square brackets is the expected repayment by the bank to wholesale creditors, which can be
decomposed following Merton (1974) as the repayment made in full in all states of the world
minus the option value to default due to the limited liability of the bank.  () is the value of
the put option when the strike price is given by  = (1 + )  (1 + ) .
   The contracting problem takes equity  as given and chooses ,  and  to maximize
the bank’s expected payoﬀ (10) subject to the incentive compatibility constraint for the bank
to choose the good portfolio, and the break-even constraint for the wholesale creditors. The
incentive compatibility constraint is

                          (̂) − [ −   ()] ≥  (̂) − [ −   ()]                     (11)

where  (̂) is the expected value of the good portfolio and   () is the value of the put
option with strike price  under the outcome distribution for the good portfolio.  (̂) and
  () are defined analogously for the expected outcome and option values associated with the
bad portfolio. Writing ∆ () =   () −   (), (11) can be written more simply as

                                            ∆ () ≤                                          (12)

The left hand side is the addtional option value to default from the bad portfolio and the right
hand side is  (̂) −  (̂), the greater expected payoﬀ from the good portfolio. Incentive
compatibility is maintained by keeping leverage low enough that the higher option value to
default does not exceed the greater expected payoﬀ of the good portfolio.

Lemma 1 There is a unique ∗ that solves ∆ () = , where ∗  1 − .

                                                30
   Lemma 1 can be proved as follows. From Breeden and Litzenberger (1978), the state price
density is given by the second derivative of the option price with respect to its strike price.

Given risk-neutrality, ∆ () = 0 [ () −  ()] , which gives
                              ⎧ R

                   ∆ () =                                                                (13)

                                 0                 1−

Thus ∆ () is single-peaked, reaching its maximum at  = 1 − . In particular,
             Z 1                           Z 1                   Z 1

                                         =  (̂) −  (̂) =                            (14)

so that ∆ () approaches  from above as  → 1. Since   1 for any bank with positive
notional equity, we have a unique solution to ∆ () =  where the solution is in the range
where ∆ () is increasing. Therefore ∗  1 − . This proves the lemma.

4.3    Leverage and Expected Appreciation
We can now fully solve the contracting problem and examine the implications for the risk-taking
channel. The good portfolio has payoﬀ 1 −  with certainty (as seen in (9)). Since the bank
has zero probability of default whenever   1 − , Lemma 1 implies that the bank’s probability
of default is zero. From the break-even constraint of the wholesale creditors, the funding rate
is therefore given by the risk-free rate. Finally, from the balance sheet identity  +  = , we
can solve for the bank’s supply of credit as
                                                         
                                           =            1+                               (15)
                                                   1−    1+
                                                             

   Note that  is proportional to the bank’s equity , and so (15) also denotes the aggregate
supply of private credit when  is the aggregate equity of the banking sector. The leverage of


                                                    31

                                                           1
                                      Leverage =           1+                               (16)

                                                               

On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, the banks’ demand for cross-border funding  can
be solved from (15) and the balance sheet identity  +  = .        We can summarize our full
solution to the contracting problem as follows.

Proposition 2 The contracting problem has a unique solution.          In this solution, the bank
funding rate  is the risk-free rate, bank leverage is given by
                                                  1

                                                      

and total cross-border funding  is given by
                                                      
                                          =   1+ 1
                                                                                             (18)

                                                          −1

   The solution entails zero probability of default for the bank and it borrows at the risk-free
rate. This result is reminiscent of Geanakoplos (2009) and Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012), which
are set in a very diﬀerent framework with a micro-founded competitive equilibrium model. The
common thread is that actual default does not happen precisely because the contract addresses
the possibility of default.
   One remark on the generality of Proposition 2 is in order. The fact that 1 +  is the risk-free
rate derives from the feature of our model that the good portfolio consists of loans that are
i.i.d. However, the uniqueness result is general, and depends only on the fact that  cuts 
once from below. The qualitative features of our model are preserved when the good portfolio
entails positive probability of default by the bank, provided that the funding rate incorporates
the bank’s option value of default.     The funding rate is then determined by the creditors’
break-even constraint.
   The relationship between leverage and expected appreciation comes through the comparative
statics of the default probability . The probability of default  is given by  = Φ−1 (−), where

                                                 32
 is the distance to default, so that  is a decreasing function of the expected appreciation ̄

Meanwhile, from Lemma 1, the solution ∗ satisfies  =                 0
                                                                             () , or

                                     0

Since the right hand side of (20) is increasing in  and in ∗ , we have ∗   0.                 We can
therefore state the main theoretical result of our paper.

Proposition 3 Leverage is increasing in the expected appreciation of the currency.

   Proposition 3 rationalizes the result of Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) on the association
between currency appreciation and leverage. The default probability  can be given an inter-
pretation via the distance to default in the Merton (1974) model, and we may regard  as a
parameter that indicates the stage of the business cycle.                   Then, Propositions 2 and 3 tell us
that bank leverage is procyclical over the cycle - that leverage is high and bank borrowing is
large when fundamentals are strong. The additional feature flagged by Proposition 3 is that
expected currency appreciation is one possible channel through which the probability of default
can decline.

4.4    Amplification Channel
We will now examine how changes in the bank funding rate  will impact credit supply and the
exchange rate.   Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) states that a low interest rate currency will
tend to appreciate against a high interest currency, and that the extent of the appreciation is
increasing in the interest rate diﬀerential. If we denote by ̂ the local currency interest rate,
the prediction of UIP is that
                                                         ̄
                                          (1 + ̂)           =1+                                         (21)
                                                         0

                                                          33
The left hand side is the expected return to one dollar when it is used to buy local currency,
and then converted back to dollars at the terminal date. UIP asserts that the expected return
from such a strategy is equal to the dollar return from holding the unit in dollars.
   However, in our VAR exercise, Empirical Feature 1 corroborates the finding in Eichenbaum
and Evans (1995) that the US dollar tends to depreciate over a protracted period when the US
dollar funding cost declines. Such a finding is also consistent with the finding in Fama (1984)
that not only does the simple version of UIP fail empirically, but the interest rate diﬀerential
term appears with the opposite sign. Although uncovering the precise mechanism for the failure
of UIP is beyond the scope of our paper, the importance of Empirical Feature 1 is that it has the
potential to generate an amplification mechanism where the appreciation of the capital recipient
country currency fuels greater capital inflows, which in turn exerts further upward pressure on
the value of the currency.
   Empirical Feature 3 summarized our finding that the US dollar depreciates following an
acceleration of cross border banking sector activity, including capital flows through the banking
sector as described in our model.       To the extent that the US dollar depreciates following
greater capital flows, such a response implies an upward-sloping demand response and may
seem counterintuitive at first. However, the theme of strong currency appreciation amid surging
capital inflows is a familiar one in the literature on emerging market crises. Calvo, Leiderman
and Reinhart (1993) pointed out the apparent mutually reinforcing relationship between capital
inflows and currency appreciation in Latin America in the early 1990s, and such episodes have
recurred with regularity across both time and distance since.
   The key to understanding the amplification mechanism is the impact of currency appreciation
on the credit risk of lending to local borrowers. Since borrowers have dollar liabilities but operate
local currency assets, an appreciation of the local currency reduces the probability of default 
(see Figure 13 given earlier).   When  declines, bank lending becomes less risky through the
first-degree stochastic shift in the outcome densities. For banks whose lending is dictated by
measures of risk, the decline in  leads to an increase in credit supply through an increase in
leverage.   We see this from our expression for total credit  in (15), which is increasing in

Figure 15. Impact of a decline in bank funding cost  consisting of the initial impact and the amplification eﬀect.




However, in our model any increase in bank lending entails capital inflows to finance the lending,
thereby setting the feedback mechanism in motion. Since the bank’s leverage decision and hence
its lending is sensitive to default risk, the decline in default risk creates an amplified response
where the credit supply and currency appreciation feed oﬀ each other to create a credit boom
in the capital recipient economy.
    The amplified response following a cut in bank funding cost can be illustrated in schematically
as follows. Consider a fall in the funding cost . The impact of this fall in funding cost can be
decomposed into the initial impact and the amplification eﬀect. Figure 15 illustrates the two
eﬀects. The initial impact of the cut in funding cost  is depicted by the rightward pointing
arrow in Figure 15. There is an increase in lending from 0 to 1 following the solution for
bank credit supply given by (15). However, the increase in lending is mirrored on the liabilities
side by an increase in , as given by (18).                                 In other words, a lowering of bank funding cost
results in the increased capital inflow through the banking sector, as given by a larger .
    Then, provided that ̄ 0 is increasing in , an expected appreciation of the currency
associated with increased capital flows results in a first-degree stochastic shift of the outcome
density as illustrated in Figure 13, resulting in a fall in the default probability.                             The decline



                                                                             36
in the default probability  sets in motion the amplification mechanism where bank lending
increases through an increase in , which implies even greater capital inflows through , which
then results in further declines in the default probability . Since the variance 2 of the asset
realization is increasing in the default probability  for   05, we can state the amplification
mechanism in terms of the mutually reinforcing eﬀect of greater lending  financed with greater
capital inflows , which dampens the risks attached to the loan book, which in turn creates
spare lending capacity of the banks. The stepwise adjustment process depicted in Figure 15
illustrates the amplification mechanism.
   Formally, write  (2 ;  ) as the total lending by the banking sector as a function of  2 , with
the funding rate  as a parameter. In turn, the variance of asset realization  2 can be written
as a function of total lending , since  determines the banking sector liabilities  and hence
the credit risk . Thus, the consistency between  and 2 is captured by the pair of equations:
                                        ¡       ¢
                                    =  2 ;        2 = 2 ()                               (23)

Both are downward-sloping that a decline in the funding cost  can result in substantial shifts in
total lending and volatility. To gauge the size of the feedback eﬀect, begin with the expression
for credit supply  given by (15). Then
                                           ∙ 0                  ¸

where  () is the density over project outcomes for the borrowers and  ∗ is the default threshold.
Note that  = 1 from the balance sheet identity with fixed equity. The magnitude of the
risk-taking channel can be substantial when || is large, indicating a substantial drop in
the credit risk of lending due to the credit boom itself. In other words, the credit boom acts to
suppress measured credit risk, rather than make apparent immediately the greater risks inherent
in lending.


5     Lessons and Implications
Our empirical results have highlighted the role played by the US dollar as the currency that
underpins the global banking system, even if the intermediaries are non-US intermediaries. Shin
(2012) emphasizes the combination of the US dollar as the currency of global banking, but the
role of the European banks as the conduit for the transmission of financial conditions.        The
focus on the US dollar as the currency underpinning global banking lends support to studies
that have emphasized the US dollar as a bellwether for global financial conditions, as recently
suggested by Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (2012) and Maggiori (2010).
    More broadly, the role of the US dollar in the global banking system opens up important
questions on the transmission of financial conditions across borders.       Calvo, Leiderman and
Reinhart (1993, 1996) famously distinguished the global “push” factors for capital flows from
the country-specific “pull” factors, and emphasized the importance of external push factors in
explaining capital flows to emerging economies in the 1990s. Bruno and Shin (2012) has verified
the role of global factors associated with the leverage of the banking sector as being a key
determinant of cross-border capital flows in panel regressions of capital flows to emerging and


                                                38
advanced economies. Eickmeier, Gambacorta and Hofmann (2013) and Chen et al. (2012) are
two papers in a recent literature that has attempted to elucidate the concept of “global liquidity”
that was first formally studied by the oﬃcial sector in the BIS study on global liquidity (BIS
(2011)). The results in our paper suggest that further research on the impact of the risk-taking
channel of monetary policy may yield insights into the transmission of global liquidity conditions
across borders.
