           The Optimal Use of Fines and Imprisonment
                          Abstract
     This paper examines the use of fines and imprisonment

to deter individuals from engaging in harmful activities.
These sanctions are analyzed separately as well as together,
first for identical risk-neutral individuals and then for
two groups of risk-neutral individuals who differ by wealth.

When fines are used alone and individuals are identical, the

optimal fine and probability of apprehension are such that
there is some "underdeterrencei' If individuals differ by
wealth, then the optimal fine for the high wealth group
exceeds the fine for the low wealth group. When imprisonment
is used alone and individuals are identical, the optimal

imprisonment term and probability may be such that there is
either underdeterrence or overdeterrence. If individuals

differ by wealth, the optimal imprisonment term for the high
wealth group may be longer or shorter than the term for the

low wealth group. When fines and imprisonment are used
together, it is desirable to use the fine to its maximum

feasible extent before possibly supplementing it with an
imprisonment term. The effects of risk aversion on these

results are also discussed.

      I. Introduction
    This paper builds upon the work of Becker (1968) in

analyzing the use of fines and imprisonment to deter in-

dividuals from engaging in harmful activitieS.V The optimal
use of these sanctions is examined in a model in which it is

assumed that fines are socially costless, that imprisonment
is socially costly, and that regardless of which sanction is
used, the apprehension of individuals is socially costly."

The sanctions are analyzed separately as well as together,
first for identical risk—neutral individuals and then for
two groups of risk-neutral individuals who differ by wealth.
     The main conclusions of the paper can be briefly summarized.

when fines are used alone and individuals are identical, the

optimal fine equals their wealthy •and the optimal prob-
ability of apprehension is such that there is some "under—
deterrence." If individuals differ by wealth, then the fine
for the high wealth group should exceed the fine for the low

wealth group. This is because it is optimal to underdeter
some individuals in Ue low wealth group, but this under—
deterrence can be reduced at no social cost for individuals

in the high wealth group by raising the fine for them.
     When imprisonment is used alone and individuals are

identical, the optimal imprisonment term and the optimal
probability may be such that there is either underdeterrence

 or overdeterrence. If individuals differ by wealth, the
 optimal imprisonment term for the high wealth group may be
                             3



longer or shorter than the term for the low wealth group.
The explanation is that1 on the one hand, a given level of
deterrence can be achieved by a shorter imprisonment term
imposed on individuals in the high wealth group; on the
other hand, because of this, it is socially cheaper to
achieve a given level of deterrence for the higher wealth
group and therefore it may be worthwhile to employ imprisonment
to a greater extent for that group.
     When fines and imprisonment are used together, the only
additional point is that, regardless of whether individuals
are identical, it is desirable to use the fine to its maximum

feasible extent before possibly supplementing it with an
imprisonment term." This is simply because fines are

socially costless while imprisonment is socially costly.
     At the end of the paper we discuss informally how the
conclusions would be modified if individuals were risk

averse. The main difference is that, in general, the levels
of the sanctions should be lower and the probability of
apprehension should be higher than for risk neutral individuals

in order to reduce the bearing of risk.

     II. The Model(


     Individuals are assumed to be risk neutral and to be

identical except, possibly, in terms of their wealth. Each
individual faces a probability distribution of private gain
from engaging in an activity which imposes harm on others.
That is, what an individual would gain from engaging in the
activity depends on random factors but is known to him

before he has to decide whether to engage in it. (For
example, the gain to an individual from falsely reporting
his taxable income may depend on his need to purchase medical
services.) If an individual engages in the activity, he

faces. some probability of being caught and fined and/or
imprisoned. An individual will engage in the activity if
his private gain exceeds the expected sanction.
     The following notation will be used to describe this

situation more precisely, where the gain and .the harm are

assumed to be monetary or to have monetary equivalents, and
the imprisonment term is assumed to have a monetary equivalent.

     y              initial wealth (subscripts will be used
                    when wealth differs among individuals)

                    the activity

                          engages in the activity will be caught

       f                  fine collected from an individual who
                          engages in the activity and is caught

                          who engages in the activity and is
                          caught
                          monetary equivalent for an individual
                          per unit of imprisonment term (subscripts
                          will be used when wealth differs among
                          individuals)
Given this notation, an individual will engage in the activity

when

(1) g >     p(f   +



Thus, since the population size is normalized and set equal
to one, [1 -      H(p(f   +   ax))J   individuals will engage in the

activity.
       As noted in the introduction, it is also assumed that

there is a cost to the public of imprisonment, namely the

cost of operating the jail system:
                              cost to the public per unit
                              of imprisonment term.

However, it is assumed that there is no cost to the public
of imposing fines. Regardless of the sanction used, there

is a cost of apprehending individuals:



       c(p)                   cost to the public of catching fraction
                              p of individuals who engage in the
                              activity (c' > 0).
                                          6



     Social    welfare is assumed to equal the sum of expected

utilities of individuals who, recall, •.are risk neutral.

Fines paid by individuals will not directly affect social
welfare because the loss of utility of the individuals

paying the fines is exactly offset by the gain in utility of
the individuals receiving the fine revenue. (Of course,

fines affect social welfare indirectly through their effect
on individuals' decisions whether to engage in the activity.)

Thus, social welfare W equals the gains from engaging in the
activity less the harm done, less the cost of catching
individuals, and less the private and public cost of imprison-

ment)&"

     The problem to be considered in this paper is the maxi-
mization of social welfare through the choice of the fine f,

the imprisonment term x, and the probability of detection p.

The optimal values of the variables will be indicated by an

 "*", and we will assume that these values are uniquely

determined     by the relevant first-order conditions.

     III. Fines and Imprisonment When Individuals are

           Identical


     In this section we will first consider the optimal use

of fines and imprisonment separately, and then the optimal

use of the sanctions together.


     A.     Fines Alone (x =    0)11/'
     It is well known that when individuals are risk neutral,

the optimal fine, f*, epials their wealth, y.       If this were

not true, it would be possible to raise the fine and lower

the probability so as to achieve the same expected sanction
at a lower cost. To be precise, suppose that f* C y and

let k =   p*f*.   By raising f to y and lowering p to k/y, the
expected fine is unaffected, so that the number of individuals

engaging in the activity remains the same. Therefore, the
only effect on social welfare is through the cost of catching

individuals, which falls. Since, then, social welfare
rises, f* < y could not have been optimal.

     Given that f* =     y,   the optimal probability is determined

by maximizing social welfare (2) with respect to p. The
resulting first-order condition can be written as



(3) (e—py)
              dH(py) =   c'(p).

The right-hand side of this condition is, of course, the

marginal cost of raising the probability. The left-hand

side is the marginal benefit of raising the probability,
                                              8



which equals the reduction in the number of individuals
engaging in the activity, dH(py)/dp, times the harm caused
by each net of benefits gained (at the margin), e -                    py.
       Note that (3) implies that e - py > 0; in other words,
it is optimal to have some degree of "underdeterreflce" in

the    sense   that some individuals who engage in the activity

obtaIn gains less than the harm they cause. To understand

why this is so, suppose f =               y   and p =   ely   so that the expected

fine equals e and there is no underdeterrence. Then, by
reducing p slightly the cost of enforcement is lowered.

Although the reduction in p now leads the marginal individuals

to engage in the activity, there is no (first-order) effect
on social welfare because they had been receiving gains

equal to e (since pf =          e).       Thus, it is optimal to lower p

to some extent)21'


        B.     Imprisonment Alone (f = 0)
        Given the probability p of catching individuals, the

optimal imprisonment term is determined by the first-order
condition with respect to x:
 (4)    (e — pcix)   dH(pczx)     =       (+)p[l    —
                                                        H(pax)]

                                      -    (a +   )px   dH(pax)



 The right-hand side of (4) is the marginal cost of increasing
 the length of imprisonment and equals the private and public
 cost of longer terms of those individuals already in jail,
                                      9



(a +   )p{l   —   H(pax)],   less the savings in the private, and

public cost of imprisonment due to a reduced number of
individuals who engage in the activity and are caught,

(a +   p)pxdH(pax)/dx.       The left-hand side of (4) is the
marginal benefit of increasing the imprisonment term and

equals the reduction in the number of individuals engaging
in the activity, dH(pax)/dx, times the harm caused by each
net of benefits gained, e - pax.
       Note that (4) implies that there may be underdeterrence
or overdeterrence (since the right-hand, side may be positive
or negative). In other words, it may be the case.that some
individuals engaging in the activity obtain gains that are

less than the harm they cause, or that some individuals who
are deterred from engaging in the activity would have received
gains greater than the harm they would have caused. To
understand why this is so, suppose the imprisonment term is
at a level such that px =        e.   Since there is then no (first-

order) effect on social welfare due to changes in the behavior

of the marginal individuals, x should be changed in the
direction that reduces the private and public cost of im-
prisonment. Lowering x reduces the cost of imprisonment per
person in jail but increases the number of persons in jail.
If the former effect is more important than the latter
effect, then it will be desirable to lower x. Otherwise, it

will   be preferable to raise x.      w
       The optimal probability is determined by the following
first-order condition:
                                      10



(5) (e + (a +   )x   —   pax)
                                dH(pax)    =    c'(p)   +

                                           ( + D)x[l        —   H(ax)J.


The interpretation of this condition is similar to that of

condition (3) determining the optimal probability in the
case of fines alone. However, now the benefit of a reduction
in the number of individuals engaging in the activity due to

an increase in the probability includes a savings in the
private and public costs of irnprisorunent, (or + 13)X.              Also,

the cost of an increase in the probability now includes an
increase in the private and public cost of imprisonment due
to the apprehension of a greater fraction of those engaging

in the activity, (a +     p)x[l   —   H(axfl.

     C.    Fines and Imprisonment
     Assuming that both fines and imprisonment may be used

to affect individuals' behavior, it is always optimal first

to use a fine to the fullest extent possible--equal to
individuals' wealth, as in the case of fines alone--before

possibly supplementing it with an imprisonment term.                      The

reason for this is simply that because the fine is a socially
costless means of enforcement, it is advantageous to use it

to its limit before using a socially costly means of enforcement.
      To demonstrate this, suppose, to the contrary, that

 f* c y and x' >   0.    Then the expected sanction is p(f* +                   ax*).
Now lower x slightly and raise f slightly so as to hold
                                   11



constant the expected sanction. The only effect on social
welfare (2) is to reduce the private and social cost of

imprisonment, (a +   p)px[1   -   H(p(f   +   ax))].   Thus, the optimal

fine cannot be less than wealth if imprisonment is used. We
have already shown that if imprisonment is not used, the

fine should also equal wealth.
       If it is optimal to supplement a fine with an imprison-

ment term, the choices of the probability and the imprisonment

term are determined by first-order conditions with interpre-
tations similar to those in the cases of fines and imprison-
ment alone.

      IV.    Fines and Imprisonment when Individuals Differ

                  Wealth


      In    this section we will reexamine the optimal use of

fines and imprisonment when individuals have different
levels of wealth. For simplicity, it is assumed that there
are only two levels of wealth, Yi C y2; let A be the fraction
of individuals with wealth Yi• It is also assumed that
the sanctions can differ for the two groups——denoted by
subscripts on f and on x--but that the probability of apprehension

is the same for both groups.1 It is further assumed that
the private cost of imprisonment is lower for the low wealth

group, that is, a1 C a2.'' Thus, social welfare now is

(6) W =       Xfgh(g)dg + (1 — A)fgh(g)dg
            p(f1+a1x1)                 p(f2+a2x2)
              —   e[A(l    —H(p(f1 + a1x1)))
              + (1 —      k)(l   —   H(p(f2   +

              —   c(p)    — A(cx1    + )px1[l — H(p(f1 + a1x1))]
              —   (1•—    A)(a2 +     p)px2[l —   H(p(f2   +




      A.      Fines Alone
       It   will be shown that the optimal fine for the low
wealth group       is equal to their wealth and that the fine for

the   high   wealth group is larger but not necessarily equal to
their wealth. The reasoning behind this result can be
explained roughly as follows. By an argument similar to
that used in the previous section, it will first be demon-

strated that the fine for the lower wealth group is equal to
                                 13



their wealth and that there is underdeterrence of this

group. Thus, if the fine were the same for the higher
wealth group, they too would be underdeterred.          Since it is

obviously possible to impose a larger fine on the higher
wealth group, the underdeterrence of this group can be

reduced at no social cost. However, because raising the
fine to their wealth might result in overdeterrence of them,
it may not be desirable to raise the fine to that level.

        To demonstrate that f1* =   Yi'   assume, to the contrary,

that f1* C y. Suppose first that f2* C y2. Now consider a
p slightly less than p' and an f1 and an f2 slightly greater
than f1* and f2*, respectively, such that pf1 =         p*f1*   and

pf2 =    p*f2*.   (It is possible to raise f1 and f2 since

f1* C y1 and f2*      Y2•) Since the expected sanction is the

same under p, f1 and f2 and since p < p, social welfare
must have risen, which contradicts the presumed optimality

of f1* < y. Now suppose that f2* = Y2•           Observe first that

p*f2* must be less than or equal to e.         This is because if

          > e, then social welfare would clearly be increased by

 a reduction in f2 to the point where p*f2 =       e.   Since p*y2 =

            e and y1 C Y2' it must be that py < e.        Thus,
p*f2*
 social welfare could be increased by raising f1 from f1* C y

 to yj.
        To show •that f2* > f1* =   y,    assume, to the contrary,

 that f2* .         Suppose first that f2* C y. Note that

 p*y1      e since otherwise social welfare could be increased

 by lowering f1 from y1. This implies that p*f2* C e. But
                                       14



this would allow social welfare to be improved by raising f2

from f2* <     y.       Now suppose that !2*     = n Then,    by (3), p'

must be such that p*y1 <         e.16"      But this would also allow

social welfare to be increased by raising f2 from f2•* =

       Given f1* = y1 and given f2*, the optimal probability
is determined by



(7) k(e—py1) dH(py
               dp
                   ')
                      + (l_X)(e_pf2*) dH(pf
                                       dp
                                          ' *)           =



which has an interpretation analogous to that of (3).
Since c'(p) > 0, it must be that (e -             py1)   0 and/or

(e —   pf2*)   >   0.    Since f2* >   y,    for sure (e —   py)   >   0.
The term (e -       pf2*)   may be positive, implying underdeterrence

of the high wealth group, or may equal zero.


       B. Imprisonment Alone
       Given the probability of catching individuals, two

firtht.-order conditions analogous to (4)           determine the optimal
imprisonment terms for the low and high wealth groups.                      The

imprisOnment term for the high wealth group might be less
than the term for the low wealth group. This possibility
reflects the fact that in order to achieve a given expected
sanction, the required imprisonment term for the high wealth

group is less than the required term for the low wealth
group)" However, it is also possible that the optimal
 imprisonment term is greater for the higher wealth group.

 This might occur because imprisonment is a more "cost-
                                  15



effective" deterrent of the wealthy group-—to achieve a
given level of deterrence, the private cost of imprisonment

is the same for    both groups   but the public cost is less for

the   wealthier   group since a shorter imprisonment term is

required for them.'
       Given   the two imprisonment    terms, the optimal probability
is determined by a first—order condition analogous to (5),

with a similar interpretation.



C.     Fines and Imprisonment
       If both fines and imprisonment are used, then for each

group it is always optimal first to use a fine--equal to the
wealth of the members of that group--before possibly supple-
menting it with an imprisonment term. The reason is the
same as the one discussed in the previous section when there
was only one group of individuals; since the proof is virtually

identical, it is omitted. Also, the first—order conditions
determining the optimal imprisonment terms, if they are
positive, and the first-order condition determining the

optimalprobability are similar to those discussed in the
previous section and have similar interpretations.

       V.   The Implicationsóf Risk Aversion
       If individuals are risk averse, then one woull expect

thatthe optimal sanction-—whether a fine or an imprisonment
term--would be lower than it would be if individuals were
risk neutral and that the optimal              probability of apprehension
would be higher. This is because the problem of maximizing
social welfare would have to take into account the              risk
imposed on individuals subject to the              sanction.-
       Assuming that aversion to risk decreases with income,

one would also expect that the optimal fine imposed on the
high wealth group would be even larger relative to the fine

imposed on the low wealth group than when individuals are
risk neutral. The reason for this is that because the high

wealth group is less risk averse, it is optimal for there to
be less of a reduction iii the level of the sanction from the

 level that would be appropriate if individuals were risk

neutral.
       Finally, if individuals are risk averse, the point that

• fines should be used to their fullest possible extent before

 imprisonment is used is not affected. The explanation is
 the same as when individuals were assumed to be risk neutral.

       1/    To our knowledge, the only other formal analyses
which deal with fines and imprisonment are by Block and lAnd
 (1975a, 1975b), Cooter (1981), and Friedman (1980).            Block

 and Lind, however, do not focus on the optimal choice of
 sanctions. There are also several informal discussions of
 fines and imprisonment that are related to our analysis,

 including Elzinga and Breit (1976, pp. 112-138) and Posner

 (1977, pp. 164—72; 1980).



      a!   Of course, it is not literally true that fines are
 socially costless, although it is reasonable to assume that

 they are much less costly than imprisonment. The assumption
 that fines are socially costless is made for simplicity.
                                 20



     ji That the optimal fine equals an individual's
wealth under the assumption of risk neutrality was first

demonstrated by Becker (1968).



     4/   Our conclusions regarding imprisonment are similar
in spirit to those of Friedman (1980) regarding fines which

are socially costly to impose.



     5/   This conclusion is consistent with Becker's (1968,

pp. 193-98) argument for fines over imprisonment.   Posner

(1980) also makes this point forcefully in the context of
"white collar crime", and it is one of the main points in

Cooter (1981).



     6/   The model used here is similar to those used in

Polinsky and $havell (1979) and in Polinsky (1980).



     2/   f      e, which is to say that engaging in the

activity is never socially beneficial, most of the results
to be discussed would not be affected. See notes 12, 13,

and 17 below.



          For simplicity, we ignore issues of time-discounting
of the imprisonment term and the fact that there is a ceiling

on the length of time a person can be imprisoned.
                                               21



       .2/     'hen     g =   p(f + ax),.individuals      are indifferent

between engaging in the activity and not. We will assume
that they do not. This assumption obviously will not affect
our results.



       j/ To show that (2.) equals the sum of expected utilities,
let t be the per capita tax necessary to finance the cost of
catching individuals and the public cost of imprisonment net

of the fine revenue collected:
       t =    c(p). + ppx[l-H(p(f+ax))] — pf{1—H(p(f+ax))].
Also, let d be the expected harm suffered by each individual
(it is assumed that each individual is equally likely to be

the victim of someone else's ham):
       d =    eEl   —   H(p(f     + ax))].

Thus, the expected utility of a representative individual is

       g
       fgh(g)dg -
   p(f+ax)
                              d    —   t   —   p(f+ax)[l-H(p(f+ax))].
Since the population has been normalized, this is also the

suni   of    expected utilities. Substituting the expressions for
d and t leads directly to (2).



       fl/     This     subsection draws on Polinsky (1980, p. 111).



        12/ Note that if               C e, there may not be underdeterrence

because it may be optimal to set the probability high enough

to deter everyone.
                                       22



     fl/   Note   that if a   <   e,   by definition there cannot be
overdeterrence.

     21/   The    justification for these assumptions is that it
would seem to be more difficult to design a system of detection
which distinguishes among individuals on the basis of their

wealth than to apply sanctions based on individuals' wealth.



     / The motivation for this assumption is that, since
wealth and income are positively correlated, the income

foregone due to imprisonment ii likely to be smaller for a
low wealth individual than for a high wealth individual.



     16/ If the fine is the same for both groups, then it
is straightforward to show from (6) that the problem of the
optimal choice of p and f is identical to the problem that

led to (3).



     42/ If        c e, it may be optimal to completely deter

both groups, which, since the probability is the same for

both groups, would be accomplished by using the same fine

 for each group (equal to Yi).


      18/ To illustrate the possibility that the imprisonment

 term for the high wealth group, x2, may be less than the

 ten for the low wealth group, x1, suppose b = 0.            Then

 social welfare (6) may be written in the form
                                    23



                    W Xz(a1x1)+ (1—X)z(a2X2),


where z is an appropriate function. Clearly, if W is maximized
with respect to x1, and x2, it must be that a1x1't =

Since    &i      a2, x2 C

                                                              =   0
        12/ To    see why x2 may exceed x1', suppose that a

and &2    > 0.    Then clearly x1" equals zero and x2 may exceed

zero.
