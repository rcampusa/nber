This paper provides new evidence on the effects of fiscal policy by studying, using household-level
data, how households respond to shifts in government spending. Our identification strategy allows
us to control for time-specific aggregate effects, such as the stance of monetary policy or the U.S.-wide
business cycle. However, it potentially prevents us from estimating the wealth effects associated with
a shift in spending. We find significant heterogeneity in households' response to a spending shock;
the effects appear vary over time depending, among other factors, on the state of business cycle and,
at a lower frequency, on the composition of employment (such as the share of workers in part-time
jobs). Shifts in spending could also have important distributional effects that are lost when estimating
an aggregate multiplier. Heads of households working relatively few (weekly) hours, for instance,
suffer from a spending shock of the type we analyzed: their consumption falls, their hours increase
and their real wages fall.

1       Introduction
This paper provides new evidence on the effects of fiscal policy by studying, using
household-level data, how households respond to a shift in government spending. Ev-
idence based on micro data is interesting for three reasons. First, individual households’
data allow us to identify how different groups (defined, as an example, by their age, in-
come, occupation, the state of the labor market where they live) respond to the same shift
in fiscal policy. For instance Ercolani and Pavoni (2011), using Italian micro data, find
that the response to shifts in government spending differs depending on the age of the
head and on where the family lives (Northern or Southern Italy). Thus if studies using
aggregate data find that consumption does not respond to a shift in public spending, it
could simply be the result of averaging across households who all respond significantly
but with off-setting signs. Moreover, knowing how different groups respond to a shift
in fiscal policy allows such shifts to be better designed and targeted to groups or areas
where they might be more effective. Second, if households’ responses to fiscal shocks
differ depending on their characteristics, “multipliers” would change over time depending
on the composition—for instance by age, occupation, or geographical distribution—of
the population, or by the state of the labor market as pointed out in Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko (2011). Finally, to the extent that responses to fiscal shocks differ across
households, aggregation bias might impair analyses that use aggregate data (such as the
consumption time series from the national accounts) to study households’ response to
fiscal shocks. The problems raised by the aggregation bias in consumer behavior are well
known, at least since Gorman’s (1953) seminal contribution.1
    We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) of U.S. households.
Theory suggests that households could respond to a shift in fiscal policy in two ways: by
changing their consumption and/or by changing their labor supply. We use the infor-
mation on hours worked contained in the PSID to estimate the response labor supply to
fiscal shocks. To build household consumption, which is not collected in the PSID, we
use the methodology proposed by Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008) which combines
Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and PSID data. The combined dataset is a panel
of up to nearly 3,000 US household covering the period from 1967 to 1992.
    There are lively disagreements over the effects of fiscal policy on consumption, on labor
supply and, through changes in labor supply, on real wages, the third variable we analyze.
They center on theory—the very different predictions of alternative models—and on the
way the empirical evidence is analyzed. Starting from theory, the sharpest difference
    1
   Among many others, Constantinides (1982), Atkeson and Ogaki (1996) and Maliar and Maliar (2003)
make the point that household heterogeneity collapses into parameters of the representative agent model,
modifying its stochastic properties—a result extended by Lopez (2010) to the case of incomplete markets.


                                                   1
arises between the predictions of the textbook Keynesian model and of models based upon
representative agents who base their choices on optimal intertemporal decisions. The first,
as is well known, predicts that a positive spending shock raises consumption and the real
wage, while the model has no predictions for hours worked. Intertemporal models give
the opposite result: the negative wealth effect associated with an increase in government
spending lowers consumption and (if consumption and leisure are complements) raises
hours worked; this in turn lowers the real wage. The sharp difference between these
results is attenuated in optimizations models that allow for nominal rigidities, or introduce
consumers subject to credit constraints: the latter is one case in which the response of
consumption to a spending shock can be positive despite a negative wealth effect.
    On the empirical front the main issue is how the shifts in fiscal policy are identified,
whether through VAR techniques or the “narrative” approach. This paper does not take
a stand on this issue but follows a third path: like Nakamura and Steinsson (2011),
the shifts in government spending we analyze are variations in military contracts across
states. This allows us to control for time-specific aggregate effects (such as, importantly,
the stance of monetary policy — common across U.S. states — that accompanies a shift
in fiscal policy) and instead measure the fiscal shock as the state-specific variation in
military contracts driven by aggregate changes in U.S. military spending. Along with
Nakamura and Steinsson (2011), this is, as far as we know, the only other attempt at
estimating the effects of government spending controlling for time fixed effects, that is
holding constant everything that varied over time and focus on comparing different states
in the same year.
    When the effects of government spending shocks are studied identifying such shocks
within a VAR, one typically finds that a positive spending shock raises consumption,
hours worked and real wages (see e.g. Blanchard and Perotti (2002); Mountford and Uh-
lig (2009); Perotti (2008); Galı́, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007)). In contrast, analyses
that use narrative spending shocks (typically shifts in defense spending) find that while
government spending raises hours, it lowers consumption and the real wage (e.g. Ramey
and Shapiro (1998); Edelberg, Eichenbaum, and Fisher (1999); and Burnside, Eichen-
baum, and Fisher (2004)). The difference between these two sets of results could be
due to the fact that narrative shocks, as mentioned above, are mostly shocks to military
spending, while shocks identified within a VAR refer to overall government spending. A
comparison of the effects of military and non-military spending shocks, both identified
with a VAR, is reported in Blanchard and Perotti (2002): they find similar multipliers
in both cases, suggesting that the difference seems to be related to the way shocks are
identified. Event studies such as Giavazzi and Pagano’s (1990) analysis of fiscal consoli-
dations in two European countries, and Cullen and Fishback’s (2006) analysis of WWII

                                             2
spending on local retail sales in the U.S., generally show a negative effect of government
spending on private consumption. Hall’s (1986) analysis using annual data back to 1920
and also identifying government spending shocks through shifts in military spending,
finds a slightly negative effect of government purchases on consumption.
    The main advantage of our identification strategy — namely, as already mentioned,
that it allows us to use time fixed effects and thus control for time-specific aggregate effects
such as the stance of monetary policy — comes at the cost of limiting the interpretation of
our results. If households expect that the Federal government will satisfy its intertemporal
budget constraint by raising taxes on all U.S. households, independently of where they
live and other characteristics, the negative wealth effect associated with the increase in
spending will be the same for all households and therefore it will be absorbed in the
time fixed effect. This means that while we are able to estimate the direct effect of
spending shocks on consumption, hours worked and real wages, we may not be capturing
the indirect effect arising from the reduction in wealth associated with the expectation of
higher taxes in the future. As we shall discuss, this problem would be compounded if the
negative wealth effect associated with higher government spending were to differ across
households—for instance if higher income households expected to pay a larger fraction of
the future taxes, than lower income households.
    In a textbook Keynesian framework there are no wealth effects: thus, within such a
framework, what we estimate is indeed the multiplier of shifts in government spending.
But if wealth effects are important, what we estimate is the multiplier net of the wealth
effect that is captured in the fixed effect. In the extreme case in which government
spending is pure waste, the effect we estimate, shutting down the wealth channel, should
be exactly zero. Thus the finding of a positive response of consumption to these spending
shocks is uninformative on the size of the multiplier because the wealth effect could turn
that positive response into a negative one. But the finding — which we do estimate for
some groups — of a negative, response of consumption, indicates that the multiplier is
unambiguously negative. The same holds for the response of hours worked: when we find
that labor supply increases following a spending shock — as we also do for some groups
— we can unambiguously conclude that spending shocks raise hours worked, since the
wealth effect works in the same direction.2
    We find evidence of significant heterogeneity in our estimates of households’ responses
to positive spending shocks. For instance lower-income households and households where
the head works relatively few hours per week tend to cut consumption: since these
estimates shut down the wealth effect, the cut in consumption is unambiguous. Instead
   2
    An alternative way to interpret our results is to think of them as the “multiplier” associated with
an exogenous shift in export demand, as shocks to exports imply no wealth effect.


                                                  3
households with relatively higher income and households where the head has a full-time
job tend to increase consumption —- a result which however in this case could be turned
around by the presence of a wealth effect. Heads who on average work relatively few hours
respond to the spending shock by immediately increasing their hours while those working
full-time do not adjust hours for many years after the shock. Once again, since the
wealth effect goes in the same direction, we can unambiguously conclude that the labor
supply response of these groups to a spending shock is positive. We also find significant
differences in the effect of military spending shocks across states, depending on the state-
specific unemployment rate. In states with relatively low unemployment, spending shocks
have insignificant effects on consumption, suggesting that once you allow for wealth effects
the multiplier could be negative. On the contrary we estimate a positive response of
consumption in high-unemployment states suggesting that the multiplier could be positive
for a small enough wealth effect.
    Our estimates suggest that the effects of a shift in government spending might vary
over time depending, among other factors, on the state of business cycle and, at a lower
frequency, on the composition of employment, for instance the share of workers on part-
time jobs. Shifts in spending could also have important distributional effects that are
lost when estimating an aggregate multiplier. Aggregate fiscal multipliers conceal this
wealth of information on the effects of shifts in fiscal policy; they also hamper the design
fiscal policies that are appropriate given the state of the business cycle. Finally, the more
diverse are the effects of a fiscal impulse across different groups in the population, the
more likely is the possibility that an economy-wide multiplier suffers from an aggregation
bias (see e.g. Stoker (2008)).
    The risks of relying on a single multiplier have recently been emphasized in the lit-
erature. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2011), using regime-switching models, find large
differences in the size of spending multipliers in recessions and expansions with fiscal pol-
icy being considerably more effective in recessions than in expansions. Favero, Giavazzi,
and Perego (2011) compare fiscal multipliers across countries and find that they differ
depending on the country’s degree of openness to international trade, its debt dynamics
and its local fiscal reaction function. Interestingly, such differences concern not only the
size of the multiplier, but sometimes also its sign.
    We start in Section 2 describing our data. Section 3 discusses how the fiscal shocks
we analyze are identified. Our results are presented in Section 4 and Section 5. Section
6 concludes.

2       Combining household and state data
We first detail the data that we use. We discuss the household level data and in par-
ticular the approach to construct consumption data. We then explore the state-level
data especially the military procurement that provides the basis for our fiscal shocks
instrument.


2.1     Constructing the data for individual consumption, hours
        and real wages
In order to construct the panel of individual household data on consumption, we follow
the approach of Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008a). The primary source of data is
the PSID, a long-running (surveys since 1968) panel series which includes a large number
of socio-economic characteristics of U.S. households. These include data on income, hours
worked 3 , wealth, taxes as well as other household characteristics such as family size and
levels of education. However, it does not include data on total household consumption;
instead there are measures of household expenditure on food.4
    The CEX, collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, provides high quality infor-
mation on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers. While these data include numerous
household characteristics, they are not collected in the form of a panel; specifically, differ-
ent households respond in each year of the survey. Nonetheless, Blundell, Pistaferri, and
Preston (2008a) impute estimates of both aggregate consumption as well as consumption
of non-durables in the PSID using information from the CEX.
    Their approach is detailed in their paper and in an unpublished appendix (Blundell,
Pistaferri, and Preston 2008b): here we outline their imputation procedure. They es-
timate a demand function for food consumption (a variable which is available both in
the PSID and CEX surveys but was not collected in the 1988 and 1989 surveys) using a
total consumption variable (such as non-durable consumption expenditure),5 a variety of
household characteristics, and the relative prices of food and other types of consumption
    3
      The 1983 questionnaire asks “How many weeks did you work in your main job in 1982? And, on the
average, how many hours a week did you work on your main job in 1982? ”
    4
      Again, using 1983 as a typical year, the question asked is “In addition to what you buy with food
stamps, how much do you (or anyone else in your family) spend on food that you use at home? How
much do you spend on that food in an average week? Do you have any food delivered to the door which
isn’t included in that? How much do you spend on that food? About how much do you (and everyone
else in your family) spend eating out not counting meals at work or at school?”
    5
      Nondurable consumption is defined as food, alcohol, tobacco, and expenditure on other nondurable
goods, such as services, heating fuel, public and private transport (including gasoline), personal care,
and semi durables, defined as clothing and footwear. It excludes housing (furniture, appliances, etc.),
health, and education.



                                                   5
as regressors. They allow this function to have time- and characteristic-varying budget
elasticities,6 and they allow for measurement error in the total consumption variable by
instrumenting it with cohort, year and education-level demeaned hourly wages for the
husband and wife. They then invert this consistently estimated demand function to derive
the imputed PSID consumption measures.
    Before we can make use of these data, they need to be carefully combined and merged
to ensure that the timing of the PSID data matches the fiscal data that we discuss
below. In particular, the questions used to construct the hours and income variables are
retrospective: in the 1983 survey, the household is asked to report their working hours
and income for 1982. With this in mind, and as shown in Figure 1, the responses to the
questions reported by the household during their interview in 1983 are recorded as head
of household i’s income earned and hours worked in 1982; these are denoted yi,82 and
hi,82 .
    The questions referring to food expenditure, described in footnote 3 above, are much
less clear in terms of their timing. The questions asks about food expenditure in an
average week and we follow Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008a) in assuming that
this too refers to the previous calendar year. The imputed consumption variable, ci,82 , is
therefore also the value from the 1983 survey.

                                                                  ci,s,82

    Figure 2 shows a number of measures of the distribution of the (log growth) of the
imputed non-durable consumption variable. We report the mean, median, 25th percentile
and 75th percentile for the cross-section in each year. As discussed above, the absence
of the food expenditure variable for the years 1987 and 1988 (1988 and 1989 surveys)
means that we lose the observations from those years. Additionally, the need to calculate
a growth rate means we lose two further years worth of observations: we lose the first
year of data, as well as 1989 (the first year after the two-year break).
    Figure 3 reports analogous statistics for the annual hours worked by the head of
household. Three points are worth noting: (i) these data are continuous between 1967

   The budget elasticity is the elasticity of the food expenditure measure to the aggregate spending
measure.

   In order to explore the response of real wages, we take the real labor income of the
head of household and divide it by annual hours. This gives us a measure of real labor
income per hour worked which we use as our measure of the real hourly wage. As with the
hours data, this variable is available between 1967 and 1992. Overall, the sample contains
between 1500 households, for the early years in which we have only hours and real wage
data, and nearly 3000 households through the 1980s when data for consumption can also

2.2     State-level data
In order to measure state-level fiscal shocks, we follow Nakamura and Steinsson (2011)
and use state-level military spending data which comes from the U.S. Department of
Defense’s electronic database of military procurement (as reported in the DD-350 forms).
They compiled these data for each state and year between 1966 and 2006. The spending
covers all military purchases with value greater than $10,000 (from 1966 to 1983) and
greater than $25,000 (1983 to 2006) and the form specifies the prime contractor as well
as the location where the majority of the work was completed.8 The DD-350 measure of
government military spending in each state is denoted Gs,t and it forms the basis of our
fiscal policy instrument.
    The macroeconomic literature generally agrees that aggregate military spending is
exogenous to the economic decisions of U.S. households and to the U.S. business cycle
(e.g. Ramey and Shapiro (1998)). As such a natural measure of the fiscal shock occurring
in state s at time t, and resulting from changes in military spending in that state, is the

    Nakamura and Steinsson (2011) deal with the potential concern that these data are mis measured
due to inter-state subcontracting using a newly-digitized dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual
Survey of Shipments by Defense-Oriented Industries. This is an alternative measure of state-level ship-
ments from defense industries to the government. Though the alternative series only runs up to 1983,
the two series are very closely correlated over the coincident time periods, suggesting that cross-border
sub-contracting plays little role in the Gs,t variable.

    In the next section we discuss issues related to the potential endogeneity of this
variable.
    We use Gross State Product (GSP) compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA) as the measure of state output (Ys,t ) used to normalize the level of fiscal spending.
To convert this, and other, variables to per capita values we use U.S. Census Bureau
state population data. Nominal variables are converted into real series using the state-
level CPI data computed by Del Negro (2002) and constructed aggregating a number of
sources of state-level prices and costs of living. As these state level data do not include
CPI for the District of Columbia (D.C.), we assume that the price level there follows that
of the overall U.S. in order to deflate nominal data from D.C..
    In terms of states, we use data from all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia.
Of course, PSID sampling means that some states have much fewer households in each
year. Figure 5 shows the median number of households per year in each state; to calculate
this, we first calculate the total number of households in each state in each year and then
calculate the median for each state. In Figure 5 we show only the contiguous United
States; this is simply to ensure that the map is easier to read. The median number of
households per year is 4.5 in Alaska and 2.5 in Hawaii.

3         Econometric identification of the effects of fiscal
          shocks
The main advantage over aggregate studies of our use of state-level fiscal shocks is that
we are able to control for those time effects that are common across states. Unfortunately
this does not guarantee that we do not have endogeneity concerns: the variation in fiscal
spending may not be completely random across states even if aggregate military spending
is. Consider the possible factors which can drive the behavior of, for example, the change
in hours of a head of household i who lives in state s at time t (∆hi,s,t ). As shown in
equation (2), the movement of (∆hi,s,t ) will partly reflect factors which are common to
all households at time t (for example, changes in monetary policy which affect the entire
U.S.), factors common to all residents of state s (e.g. cross-state differences in working
regulations) and then the idiosyncratic part related to household i. The latter two effects
can be split into those effects which are time-invariant (such as the fact that certain
people always work more hours than others) and those which are time-varying.

                                       Time t Effects     State s Effects   Household i Effects
                                           z}|{           z }| {               z }| {
                           ∆hi,s,t =        δt          + γ̄s + γ̃s,t +        ᾱi + α̃i,t        (2)

    In our analysis, we are interested in the effect of changes in state-level military spend-
ing, Ωs,t on the behavior of households in those states. Our baseline equation, which we
estimate for the three main dependent variables of interest (consumption, hours and real
wages), is:
                                             XK
                    ∆zi,s,t = αi + γs + δt +     βk Ωs,t−k + φXi,s,t + i,s,t
                                                          k=0

where zit is (log) of household’s i consumption/hours/real wages at time t, Ωs,t−k is the k
period lag of government military procurements from supplier companies located in state
s in period t expressed as a percentage of state output, and Xit is a vector of control
characteristics such as whether the head of household is employed or retired. αi , γs and
δt are, respectively, household, state and time fixed-effects.9
    In order to analyze the effects of shifts in fiscal policy, the fiscal shocks should be
exogenous and so uncorrelated with the error term. Relating this regression equation
to (2), and assuming that no controls and only the contemporaneous shock (k = 0) are
included, the estimated equation is:
                                                                                i,s,t
                                                                      z }| {
                               ∆zi,s,t   = δt + γ̄s + ᾱi + β0 Ωs,t + γ̃s,t + α̃i,t
    9
        Standard errors are clustered by household in all the household level regressions.


                                                           10
     The key for unbiased estimates of the β0 coefficient is that Ωs,t is uncorrelated with
i,s,t which incorporates state-time fixed effects which are not controlled for elsewhere.
This may not be the case if the amount of state-level military spending is related to
the state economic cycle. Even though aggregate military spending has been shown to
be exogenous, we may still worry that the allocation of this spending across states is
correlated with the state cycle; in other words, spending associated with an exogenous
military build-up is directed toward those states with weaker local conditions following
lobbying and the resulting political decision.10 Therefore, like Nakamura and Steinsson
(2011), we build state-level fiscal spending shocks instrumenting Ωs,t . Specifically, we
shall use the same logic that Nekarda and Ramey (2011) applied to industry shares. The
share that state s receives of overall military spending in year t is ηs,t = GGs,tt so that:

                                       Gs,t = ηs,t Gt                                                    (3)
                                   ⇒ Ġs,t = ηs,t Ġt + η̇s,t Gt                                         (4)
                                     Ġs,t   ηs,t Ġt η̇s,t Gt
                                           =         +                                                   (5)

                                                             Endogenous?


    Equation (6) shows that the overall change in military spending in state s in year t can
be split between the fact that aggregate spending has changed and a share of this goes to
state s, and the fact that the share of aggregate spending going to state s has changed. If
our worry is that states in which there are weaker economic conditions increase their share
more (∆ηs,t > 0), then the second term on the right-hand-side equation (6) is potentially
endogenous. Of course, some of ∆ηs,t may be exogenous variation and so excluding it we
potentially reduce the variability in our shocks which would lead to less tight standard
errors. However, given that using an endogenous regressor will bias our estimates, we
choose to purge the shocks of this potential correlation with the residual at the expense
of potentially less precise estimates of effects of fiscal shocks. Doing this, we concentrate
on the first term on the right-hand side of (6) which can be re-written as:

                                          ηs,t ∆Gt   ∆Gt Gs,t
                                                   =
                                            Ys,t     Gt Ys,t

                                                                   Gs,t ηs,t ∆Gt
       As a result of the GSP term in the denominator of           Ys,t
                                                                        , Ys,t     is likely to be correlated
  10
    For example, Mayer (1992) finds strong evidence of political business cycles in the distribution of
military contracts, but suggests there is little evidence of the use of military contract awards for economic
stimulus after 1965.

                     Figure 6: State Fiscal Shocks in a Selection of U.S. States

    Figure 6 shows, for four states, the raw shocks (Ωs,t ) calculated according to equation
                                                R
(1) as well as the instrumented shocks (Ω  d s,t ) as defined in (7) above. These data show,

particularly in the case of Louisiana (top right frame), how the approach removes potential
measurement error. The large spike up and then down in Louisiana in 1981 and 1982
is smoothed through when we use the instrumented approach. This noise seems to be
less of an issue in some of the other states displayed. Comparing California (top left) to
Wisconsin (bottom right) and New York (bottom left), it is clear that some states see
much greater swings in the shock variable. In California the instrumented shocks are on
average 0.14% of GSP and are as large (small) as 0.93% (-0.66%); in Wisconsin the mean
is only .04% and the largest (smallest) shock was 0.25% (-0.18%) of GSP.
    Of course, Figure 6 shows only a small sample of the states we use. To show the
difference in variability across states in the main shock that we use, Figure 7 shows the

   As an alternative instrument, we also consider using Ramey’s (2011) measure of de-
fense news to instrument for aggregate U.S. military spending. Specifically, we regress
∆ ln(Gt ) on an annual sum of the news measure and generate ∆\ ln(Gt ) as the fitted value.
We then create an alternative measure of our state level shocks by applying the formula:

                                            IV
                                       Ω
                                       ds,t    = ∆\
                                                  ln(Gt )θ̄s                                      (8)

This gives a very similar pattern as shown in Figure 6 above; the correlation between the
two shock series is over 0.9 across all time periods and states. In appendix A, we show
that the main results are robust to using this alternative measure of fiscal shock.


3.1     Household heterogeneity
As mentioned above, an advantage of household data is that we can explore heterogeneity
amongst households. Consider a simple dummy variable D(A)i,s,t which is 1 when the
characteristic A applies to the head of household i in state s at time t. With this
separation of households, we interact particular set of household characteristics with the

     As variability in Ω
                       d s,t is driven by the aggregate growth in military spending, this map captures
differences in average military intensity across states (θ̄s ).

4        Results
Before describing our results it is useful to briefly summarize the predictions of a few
models. In the (static) IS-LM model an increase in government spending has no wealth
effect and acts like a pure demand shock: because output is demand determined and prices
do not respond, consumption increases, labor demand increases (although the model does
not distinguish between an intensive and an extensive margin and thus has no predictions
about the intensive margin) and so does the real wage.
    Models based on a representative agent who makes optimal intertemporal decisions
give the opposite result: the negative wealth effect associated with an increase in gov-
ernment spending lowers consumption and raises hours worked; this in turn lowers the
real wage. The sharp difference between the results of the IS-LM and the intertemporal
optimization models are attenuated in intertemporal models that allow for nominal rigidi-
ties, or introduce consumers subject to credit constraints: in the latter the response of
consumption to a spending shock can be positive.13 Table 1 summarizes these theoretical
results:

       When estimating the effects of a shift in fiscal policy one has two ambitions: (i) to
  12
     Where the characteristic is split into more than two groupings, for example splitting the household
into young, middle-aged and older, we can use a similar but extended regression approach.
  13
     See Leeper, Traum, and Walker (2011) for a detailed analysis of the multiplier implied by different
models. The accompanying monetary policy obviously makes a difference but remember that here we
control for monetary policy that is the same across U.S. states.


                                                        14
control for anything that might have varied while fiscal policy was changing, so as to
separate out the effects of other factors, such as shifts in monetary policy, or the business
cycle; ii) to construct an estimate of the total change in consumption (or hours worked, or
the real wage) associated with the shift in fiscal policy. This will be the sum of the direct
effect of the shift in fiscal policy, plus the indirect effect possibly arising from the change
in wealth associated with the policy shift. In this paper we achieve the first objective
using time fixed effects and comparing the effects of shifts in government spending across
different states in the same year. This however come at the cost of shutting down the
wealth channel — to the extent that one exists — i.e. of overlooking any wealth effect
associated with the shift in government spending. What we potentially estimate is simply
the direct effect of the shift in government spending (i.e. excluding the wealth effect).
    However, since we are interested in comparing the response of different households,
we potentially run into an additional problem: the possibility that the wealth effect
differs across households depending on their characteristics. For example, higher income
households might expect to pay a larger fraction of the future taxes than lower income
households. To understand what we estimate, the following might be useful.
    Assume the total wealth effect of the fiscal spending shock is, for a household belonging
to group i, w + wi . That is, the wealth effect is comprised of two components, the
average wealth effect, w < 0, plus the specific wealth effect which varies by household
characteristic. Overall, the wealth effect should be non-positive for both groups (which
means that the average effect w is non-positive and also that w + wi is non-positive), but
— for instance if taxes are progressive — the rich could expect to have a larger negative
wealth effect than the poor. In this case, their specific wealth effect wR (which measures
the effect relative to the average) would be negative while for the poor the specific effect
would be positive, wP > 0.
    The response of interest, for testing between models and calculating multipliers, is
the total effect
                                        dCi
                                             = xi + w + w i
                                        dg
However, our estimation procedure controls for time fixed effects which, as we said,
capture common factors such as the U.S. business cycle and Federal Reserve policy stance,
but also any common negative wealth effect that comes from the expected change in
Federal taxes as a result of the spending shock. Therefore, we estimate:

   • for the rich: β R = xR + wR

   • for the poor: β P = xP + wP

   Given that w < 0, our estimate of the total effect is upward biased for both groups.

                                              15
If however we were interested in the direct effect, xi , then if wR = wP , that is if the
two groups shared the same wealth effect, then our estimate of the direct effect would be
unbiased. But it would not if instead wR < 0, wP > 0. In this case

   • for the rich: β R < xR

   • for the poor: β P > xP

    In other words, if there are specific wealth effects as described above, these will cause
us to overstate the xP and understate xR .
    There are a few cases in which our results provide an upward bound for the total effect
which is consistent with the intertemporal model. For instance when, for consumption,
we estimate β P < 0, that is a negative response of consumption to the spending shocks —
which we do for some groups, e.g. the relatively poor and part-time workers — our results
that are consistent with the intertemporal model because for this group our estimate of
the direct effect is upward biased and w < 0.
    For hours, the analysis is similar except that the average wealth effect (w ≥ 0) and
the specific wealth effects (relative to the average), under the progressive tax system
described above, would be positive for the rich (wR ≥ 0) and negative for the poor
(wP ≤ 0). Overall, the wealth effect should be non-negative for both groups (they
respond to the negative wealth effect by consuming less leisure) and as above the specific
wealth effects reinforce the average wealth effect for the rich.
    In this case, using similar logic to above, our estimates are downward biased estimates
of the total effect for both groups, but we overstate the direct effect on hours and under-
state the direct on the poor. Where we estimate a positive response of hours for the rich
(β R > 0), we can not conclude that the direct effect is positive but we can state that the
total effect is positive (since β R = xR + wR ≥ xR (wR ≥ 0 and w ≥ 0).
    For the poor, where we find a negative (β P < 0), as we do in the initial response, since
β P = xP + wP ≤ xP (wP ≤ 0), we cannot conclude that the direct effect is negative nor
can we conclude that the total effect is negative as that depends on whether |w| > |βP |.
If we estimate a positive effect (β P > 0), as we do in the later years of the response, we
can conclude that both the total effect and direct effect is positive.
    We now illustrate our empirical findings. When we aggregate all households (Figure
8) we find that following the increase in military spending consumption increases right
after the shock and remains higher for about two years; this is true for both durables
and total consumption which includes non durables and services. (Given that the two
categories of consumptions seem to respond very similarly, in the rest of the paper we
only look at total consumption.) Hours worked and real wages initially do not move,


                                             16
although both increase significantly three years after the increase in spending: the long
lag could be the result of off-setting positions by heterogeneous groups in the economy.
Our estimates of the labor supply response focus on the intensive margin: longer hours
by employed workers (we control for employment status in the regressions).14 In Section
5 we return to the issue of the extensive margin. The magnitude of these lagged effects
is small. Since our shocks are equivalent to 1% of GDP, a point estimate of 0.16 for the
percent change in aggregate consumption after the first year suggests that consumption
increases by less than one-fifth which is similar to the year-3 response of hours, but four
times as large as the percent change in real wages (0.04). In appendix A, we show that
these results are unchanged if we use the alternative measure of the fiscal shock given by
      IV

d s,t    in equation (8) above.
     As mentioned above, the evidence of a positive response of consumption is inconclu-
sive, since it could be canceled, or turned around by the presence of a wealth effect that
our estimates capture in the time-fixed effects.

   All the regressions control for whether the head of household is employed or retired while the con-

    As we mentioned, our data allow us to split the sample along a very large number
of dimensions, although along some of them the resulting sub-sample included too few
individuals. For instance looking at splits based on the marital status of the head is prob-
lematic; over 70% of our more than 67,000 observations are married households (including
permanently cohabiting) while only 11% are single and 19% are Widowed, Divorced or
Separated. We thus have decided to look at six dimensions: the state of the local labor
market, household income, workers in low-hours jobs, age, sector of employment and
gender.


4.1     The effect of the state cycle on responses to shocks
Using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on state level unemployment (available from
1976), we can derive measures of the state business cycle.15 Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
(2011) find that the effects of government purchases are larger in a recession: we can
evaluate this with our data.
    Our measure of the state cyclical conditions is the state unemployment gap which
we plot, along with the key components of the calculation, for the same four states used
above to illustrate the military spending shocks in Figure 9. The calculation proceeds as
follows. First, we take the time-series of state-level unemployment and calculate a trend
unemployment rate by fitting a third-order polynomial trend. Second, we calculate the
state unemployment gap as the difference between state unemployment and this fitted
trend - the lower line in Figure 9. Finally, we look across time comparing, within each
state, periods of high and low unemployment where we define “tight” (“loose”) labor
market conditions as periods when the state unemployment gap is in the lower (upper)
quartile.16 A tight labor market is therefore one in which the state unemployment is
far below its trend. We then include these dummy variables, as well as the appropriate
interactions, in our regression equation as described above.
    The results (see Figure 10) are consistent with Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2011).
Spending shocks seem to have different effects in periods of high and low unemployment.
When the local labor market is tight, our estimates suggest that neither consumption
nor hours respond, implying that wealth effects could make the consumption multiplier
  15
     Using county-level unemployment data is problematic for two reasons. First, because many heads
of household live outside the county in which they work and commute across county lines. Second, to
protect the anonymity of respondents the PSID public-use files suppress the county identifier. As we wish
to evaluate whether the local labor market is above or below its normal conditions, we cannot use the
reported household measure of county unemployment because households may move county meaning that
the reported local unemployment rate can change with no meaningful change in labor market conditions
relative to normal conditions.
  16
     The quartiles are marked in the Figure by the parallel lines which cut through the unemployment
gap.

negative and the effect of hours worked positive. In periods of relatively high unemploy-
ment we estimate a positive effect on consumption, which however could be canceled by
the wealth effect.


4.2    Responses by Income Group
In order to examine whether relatively richer and relatively poorer households react dif-
ferently to a spending shock, we define two dummy variables using the distribution of
real disposable income:
                              
                              1         if in lower quartile of year t income distribution
      D(Low Income)ist =
                              0         otherwise


                              
                              1         if in upper quartile of year t income distribution
      D(High Income)ist =
                              0         otherwise

   Our definition means that a household i will be marked as a low (high) income house-
hold with D(Low Income)ist = 1 (D(High Income)ist = 1) if the household has real
disposable income in year t that is at or below (at or above) the 25th (75th) percentile

Figure 10: IRFs to a 1% GDP state spending shock: the response by State labor condi-
tions

of the U.S. income distribution in year t.
     Figure 11 shows that there is an important difference between the response of higher
and lower-income households according to our definition of relative income. Lower income
households respond to the spending shock lowering consumption and raising (although
with a three-year lag) hours worked. The presence of a group specific wealth effect would
make such responses even stronger; as described earlier for a progressive tax system,
these results are consistent with lower income households cutting consumption (the true
direct effect is more negative than our estimates which potentially include the specific
wealth effect) and raising hours (both the total and direct effects would be larger than
the estimates presented). Thus lower income households appear to behave consistently
with the predictions of intertemporal models where households derive no benefit from
the increase in government spending, but realize they will eventually have to pay for it.
Their real wages, however, do not change significantly (as those models predict): this
could be because there are regulatory reasons that make their wages relatively sticky
(such as minimum wages laws).
     The response of high- and middle-income households, instead, is inconclusive: we
estimate a positive and significant direct response of consumption, which however could be
overturned by the a wealth effect. If anything, however, the military contracts we analyze
seem to favor relatively higher income households, perhaps because they are concentrated
in firms with relatively high-skilled workers, or because higher income households are more
likely to own shares in such firms.
     One concern with this analysis is that our dummy variable could simply capture
differences in levels of income across states: remember that we have identified those
households with extreme (high or low) incomes within the entire distribution of income
in the PSID in each year. Therefore, we repeat our analysis but use the following two
alternative dummy variables:
                        
                        1     if in lower quartile of state s, year t income distribution
 D(Low IncomeA )ist =
                        0     otherwise


                         
                         1    if in upper quartile of state s, year t income distribution
 D(High IncomeA )ist   =
                         0    otherwise

    Now a household is a low (high) income household if the household has real disposable
income in year t that is at or below (at or above) the 25th (75th) percentile of the state
s income distribution in year t. The potential worry about this approach is that some

of the states, as discussed above, have relatively few households and therefore such a
distribution is based on very few observations. Nonetheless, the results of the earlier
analysis are little changed as we show in Figure 12.


4.3    Workers who work low hours
Heads of household working relatively few hours (most likely on part-time jobs) are likely
to have more labor supply flexibility. In fact in Giavazzi and McMahon (2010) we found
that part-time German workers responded to an exogenous increase in uncertainty by
working longer hours - a response we did not observe for workers in full-time employment.
In order to check whether the response differs between full-time and part-time workers,
we define a dummy variable:
                       
                       1     if the head regularly works less than 20 hours per week
   D(Low Hours)ist   =
                       0     otherwise

    The choice of 20 hours per week is somewhat arbitrary. As mentioned above, we find
that the median worker works about 40 hours per week and so this number represents
someone working about half the full-time workers hours. We restrict the sample to heads
of household who did not change their employment status during the year: since our data
measure annual hours worked, if someone worked for 6 months and then lost their job
and did not get a new one for the remainder of the year, their hours for the year would
look like someone working about 20 hours a week but their position is not as a regular
low hours worker.
    Figure 13 shows that there is an important difference between the response of full-time
and part-time workers. Heads working less than 20 hours per week initially respond to
a spending shock increasing consumption, but they then soon reduce it (remember that
these estimates likely overstate the multiplier). They also work longer hours, precisely as
we observed for lower income households. As in that case our estimates understate the
increase in hours because the average wealth effect would indicate an increase in hours,
meaning that the hours of part time workers unambiguously increase. And like the lower
income households, if they expect to pay less of the taxes, then the increase in hours and
fall in consumption is further reinforced. Hours, which average about 10 per week for
this group, actually increase by between 50 and 75 per cent meaning the average worker
would now work 15 to 18 hours per week. Finally, those working less than 20 hours also
see their real wages fall which is consistent with the increase in their labor supply.
    The response of heads working more than 20 hours per week is instead closer to the

4.4    Age
We have also looked at different age groups. In order to split the sample into different
age groups, we do as we did for income above and use the by-year distribution of ages
as the point of reference. This is shown in Figure 14 and we will define anyone above
(below) the 75th (25th) percentile in a given year as the high (low) age group:
                              
                              1    if in lower quartile of age distribution in t
           D(Low Age)ist =
                              0    otherwise
                              
                              1    if in upper quartile of age distribution in t
           D(High Age)ist =
                              0    otherwise
    The response of older workers, relative to younger ones, should depend, in principle,
on their life horizon and on the extent to which they internalize the well-being of their
children. If they do not, and expect that someone else will bear the taxes that will be
raised to pay for the additional spending, the negative wealth effect associated with the
increase in government spending will be smaller. Instead, if they expect that some of
these taxes will fall upon themselves, they will cut consumption and increase hours, the
more so the fewer the active years they have left. However, because our time fixed effect
captures the average wealth effect, any differential wealth effect should be reflected in the
estimated response of the older workers.
    The results are shown in Figure 15. While all age groups seem to increase consumption
(as in the aggregate response), the youngest workers tend to increase by the least. The
response of hours is more striking: relatively young heads increase hours, while the oldest
workers actually reduce their hours. These findings are consistent with the older workers
experiencing a negative wealth effect that is smaller relative to the mean wealth effect
captured in the time fixed effect; this (relative) positive wealth effect is reflected in the
estimated response as more positive consumption and lower hours worked. Younger
workers seem to experience a relatively larger negative wealth effect. Intriguingly, the
middle-aged heads tend to both increase consumption and hours worked.

We are also able to follow which industry a head of household works for between 1976 to
1992. This is the response to a question in which the head is asked to report the “kind of

business” that the head of household considers themselves to work in. The categorization
uses the 3-digit industry codes from the 1970 Census of Population Classified Index of
Industries and Occupations. We use these data and classify workers according to two
dummy variables which we define only for those who are employed:17
                                       
                                       1      if head is employed in manufacturing industry
       D(Manufacturing)ist =
                                       0      otherwise
                                       
                                       1       if head is employed in services sector
                D(Services)ist =
                                       0       otherwise

    We use these two industries as Nekarda and Ramey (2011) discuss the effects of mil-
itary spending on U.S. manufacturing while services account for about 70% of the U.S.
economy; the residual includes “Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing”, “Mining and Extrac-
tion”, “Construction”, ”Retail or Wholesale”, “Transport, Communication & Utilities”
and “Government” industries.
    The results of our sectoral split are reported in Figure 16. The sectoral response of
consumption matches the aggregate response: there is no difference across sectors. But
the (positive) response of hours is concentrated in the service sector confirming what
we had found looking at heads working less than 20 hours: flexibility is higher where
part-time jobs are more frequent (3.2% of heads who work in the services sector work low
hours compared with only 1.4% of those in other sectors).

    Manufacturing industries include both durable and non-durable industries given by codes 139-169,
177-209, 219-238, 107-138, 239-259, 268-299, and 307-398. The “Services” sector is identified by codes
707-718, 757-759, 727-749, 769-798, 807-809, 338-389, 828-848, 857-868, 869-897 and 849.

Figure 16: IRFs to a 1% GDP state spending shock: the response by industry


                                                                                               29
    We also compared government employees (including those working for states and
cities) with heads of households working in the private sector. Interestingly, spending
shocks have no effect on government employees: neither their consumption, nor their
hours move.


4.6    Gender Split
Finally, we look at whether there are differences in the reaction of households in which
the head is a female. Such households make up 26% of all observations. While 12%
of male heads are in the lower income quartile (as defined above), 40% of female heads
are. Female heads are disproportionately not employed; half of not employed heads are
female. Of those female heads in employment, they are under-represented (in the sense
of less than 25% share) in all sectors of employment except for services; they make up
37% of the services sector.
    Given this, it is not surprising that their response to a spending shock matches that
of heads working in the service industry (see Figure 17). While the effect of the spending
shock on consumption is independent of gender, the response of hours is concentrated on
women. Also their real wages increase more than those of non-female heads.


4.7    Summing up
Our main findings from the various splits can be summarized as follows:

  1. the spending shocks we have analyzed seem to have important distributional effects.
     There is a difference between the response of higher and lower-income households.
     Lower income households match the predictions of standard intertemporal repre-
     sentative agents models: they cut consumption (unambiguously because the wealth
     effect if anything reinforces our results) and work longer hours (also unambigu-
     ously), precisely as we would expect from households that receive no benefit from
     higher public spending but realize they will eventually have to pay for it. The re-
     sponse of higher income households is more muted and we are unable to say whether
     the positive response of consumption we estimate is reversed by the wealth effect.
     Of course, our results may be specific to the military contracts that we consider
     and so other types of fiscal spending may have very different distributional effects;

  2. there is also an important difference between the response of full-time and part-
     time workers. Differently from full-time workers, part timers respond to a spending
     shock cutting consumption, although perhaps not immediately. They also work
     longer hours, precisely as we observed for lower income households. But differently

      from lower income heads, those working less than 20 hours also see their real wages
      fall which is consistent with the increase in their labor supply. Thus the response
      of part-time workers matches that predicted by a model in which households make
      optimal intertemporal decisions and government spending is pure waste, at least
      from their viewpoint;

    3. our results suggest that increases in military spending tend to be more effective in
       states with relatively high local unemployment. Although we cannot say whether
       in such states consumption increases, it certainly doesn’t (and could very well de-
       crease) in states with low local unemployment;

    4. the positive response of hours worked to a spending shock is concentrated among
       households headed by a woman, among heads employed in the service sector and
       among relatively younger workers;

    5. there is not much our results can say about the aggregate effects of these spending
       shocks. At the aggregate level our estimates indicate an increase in consumption,
       which, however, could be overturned by the working of a wealth effect.


5     The Extensive Margin of Employment
So far we have analyze the intensive labor supply margin: hours worked by employed
workers. A separate question is the effect of the spending shocks on the extensive margins:
employment. Specifically, we estimate a linear probability model and regress a dummy
variable for whether the worker is employed on state, time and household fixed effects.
For this regression we include only those households in the labor force. The regression
is analogous to those estimated above. For the aggregate results, reported in Figures 18,
the estimated equation is:

                                                       K
                                                       X
                   D(Employed)i,s,t = αi + γs + δt +         βk Ωs,t−k + i,s,t
                                                       k=0


    While the point estimate is for an increase in the likelihood of employment for a
household in a state receiving a positive fiscal spending shock, the result is only marginally
significant after 2 years.
    Figure 19 reports the results for a variety of the classifications used above; we cannot,
obviously, do the industry breakdown as it is only classified for those that are employed.
A positive spending shock increases the likelihood of employment for almost all house-
holds. Strikingly, households headed by relatively poorer workers see their probability

    Figure 18: Change in the Probability of Employment following a 1% fiscal shock

of employment fall; this effect tends to accentuate the relative decline in the intensive
margin for these households. In periods of relatively high unemployment spending shocks
have no effect on hours worked nor on the likelihood of being employed.


6    Conclusion
Observing significant differences across the responses of various groups does not neces-
sarily imply that aggregate estimates are biased: they could simply reflect the average of
group-level responses. Aggregation theory suggests however that the large differences we
have documented are likely to result in biased aggregate estimates. In our results however
there are no instances of a consistent response among all groups that disappears at the
aggregate level, which would be clear evidence of an aggregation bias. If aggregation bias
exists, it is likely to be attenuated.
    Our results could be used to design the allocation of military contracts across states,
so as the to increase their macroeconomic effect: the answer here is simple: you want
to spend in states with relatively high unemployment. They also suggest that military
spending has significant distributional effects: the group more negatively hit appears
to be part-time workers: they cut consumption, work longer hours and see their real
wages fall. Of course, it would also be interesting to explore the effects of other types
of government spending and so care should be taken in extrapolating from the identified
fiscal spending shocks in this paper to all other types of fiscal spending.
    Finally our estimates, despite the potential problem of missing any wealth effect,
can in some cases still allow us to discriminate between alternative models. We find it
interesting that some groups (lower income and low-hours workers in particular) appear
to behave consistently with the predictions of models in which households respond to
