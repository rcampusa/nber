                                             ABSTRACT

While financial knowledge is strongly positively related to household wealth, there is also considerable
cross-sectional variation in both financial knowledge and net asset levels. To explore these patterns,
we develop a calibrated stochastic life cycle model featuring endogenous financial knowledge accumulation.
The model generates substantial wealth inequality, over and above that of standard life cycle models;
this is because higher earners typically have more hump-shaped labor income profiles and lower retirement
benefits which, when interacted with precautionary saving motives, boost their need for private wealth
accumulation and thus financial knowledge. Our simulations show that endogenous financial knowledge
accumulation has the potential to account for a large proportion of wealth inequality. The fraction
of the population which is rationally financially “ignorant” depends on the generosity of the retirement
system and the level of means-tested benefits. Educational efforts to enhance financial savvy early
in the life cycle so as to produce one percentage point excess return per year would be valued highly
by people in all educational groups.

1        Introduction1

Americans are increasingly being asked to manage their own financial wellbeing, both during

their working years and in retirement. This process has been hastened by the movement

away from defined benefit (DB) pensions toward defined contribution (DC) plans: in 1980,

about 40% of private-sector pension contributions went to DC plans, but two decades later,

almost 90% of these contributions flowed to DC plans (which were mainly 401(k) plans; cf.,

Poterba, Venti, and Wise 2007). At the same time, financial markets have become more

complex, expanding the set of instruments that households can use to save and invest. The

trend toward more individual responsibility means that people’s financial decisions made

early in life can have long-term consequences. For example, if young workers direct their

pension contributions to equities instead of money market accounts, this will likely produce

very different wealth levels by retirement age. Moreover, in this new financial environ-

ment, investments in financial knowledge can have important consequences for retirement

wellbeing, by influencing people’s ability to save and invest. When the decision to invest

in financial literacy alters life cycle wealth profiles, individuals with similar initial circum-

stances will end up with very different wealth holdings at retirement. To the extent that

this mechanism is at work, understanding it will help explain wealth inequality.2

        This paper proposes that financial knowledge itself should be modeled as an endogenous

choice variable akin to human capital investment. The mechanism we posit is that financial

knowledge can enable individuals to better allocate resources over their lifetimes in a world of

imperfect insurance and uncertainty. Our approach uses an explicit multiperiod theoretical

model which allows us to explore two important questions: (1) What forces shape financial

knowledge accumulation over the life cycle?, and (2) How much wealth inequality can be

attributable to resulting differences in financial knowledge? We also evaluate which types

of consumers would benefit most from investment in financial knowledge and the use of

     Wealth levels do vary considerably across both workers and retirees; see Moore and Mitchell (2000) and
Venti and Wise (2001).

sophisticated investment products. These issues have not been explored prevously in a rich

theoretical context with uncertainty, and our answers shed light on the important issue of

wealth disparities over the life cycle.

    We build and calibrate a stochastic life cycle model featuring uncertainty in income, cap-

ital market returns, and medical expenditures; we also incorporate an endogenous knowledge

accumulation process and a sophisticated saving technology. In the model, financial knowl-

edge permits consumers to use more sophisticated financial products which can help them

raise the return earned on financial assets. Individuals who wish to transfer resources over

time by saving will benefit most from financial knowledge. Moreover, because of how the

U.S. social insurance system works, better-educated individuals have the most to gain from

investing in financial knowledge. As a result, making financial knowledge accumulation en-

dogeneous allows for an amplification of differences in accumulated retirement wealth over

the life cycle.

    Our contributions to the literature are several. First, we explain why many consumers

lack knowledge about key aspects of financial markets. Several papers have reported that a

large proportion of the population is not financially literate and cannot grasp the concepts

of inflation and risk diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007, 2011a; Lusardi, Mitchell, and

Curto 2010). Second, we show that some level of financial ignorance may, in fact, be optimal.

That is, we explain why consumers may rationally fail to invest in knowledge, since it is

expensive to acquire financial knowledge and not everyone will benefit from greater financial

sophistication. Third, our model can account for a large share of wealth inequality without

appealing to exogenous preference differences or heterogeneity in fixed costs of investing

(cf., Cagetti 2003; Vissing-Jorgensen 2003). In support of this approach, Venti and Wise

(2001) show that permanent income differences and chance alone can explain only 30-40% of

observed differences in retirement wealth, implying that other factors should be taken into

account. Fourth, our model generates wealth inequality above and beyond what traditional

models of saving normally deliver. Thus it helps account for some of the large differences in

wealth reported in the literature, by recognizing that individuals do not start their economic


                                              3
lives with full financial knowledge and knowledge can be acquired endogenously over the life

cycle.

    Finally, we show that financial knowledge can be an important public policy lever. For

example, reducing the cost of financial knowledge by providing financial education in high

school could have potentially large effects on wealth accumulation and welfare. For instance,

we report that a 25-year-old college graduate would be willing to pay more than half of his

initial wealth to boost financial knowledge, if it offered an expected permanent increase of

1% in his annual rate of return. Our estimates also suggest that a large portion of wealth

inequality, over half, can be attributed to financial knowledge that helps people access

a sophisticated technology generating higher returns. Policies such as personal accounts

under Social Security and increased reliance on individually managed retirement accounts,

for example, would be anticipated to lead to higher financial knowledge.

    In the remainder of the paper we first briefly summarize prior studies; then we offer

evidence on the life cycle path of assets, consumers’ use of financial products, and finan-

cial knowledge accumulation by education group. Next we present our model, outline the

model calibration, and report simulation results. The paper then offers conclusions and

implications.



2    Prior Literature

Our research builds on several related literatures including research on household life cycle

saving patterns.3 We depart from conventional intertemporal models in that we allow for

the endogenous choice of a saving technology with returns and costs that depend on a

consumer’s level of financial knowledge. In this way, we extend the portfolio choice model

(e.g. Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout 2005) in which returns are assumed to be exogenous and

consumers decide only how much they will invest in risky assets. Our work is also informed

by prior studies that examined patterns of financial knowledge in the general population. For

2006).

instance, Bernheim (1995, 1998) was among the first to document that many U.S. consumers

display low levels of financial literacy. Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly (2003) showed that

most Americans do not understand basic financial concepts including key aspects of bonds,

stocks, and mutual funds. The National Council for Economic Education’s report (NCEE,

2005) detailed widespread knowledge gaps regarding fundamental economic concepts among

high school students, as did Mandell (2008). Lusardi and Mitchell’s (2008, 2011a) Health

and Retirement Study (HRS) modules on planning and financial literacy confirm that many

older individuals (age 50+) cannot do simple interest-rate computations such as calculating

how money grows at an interest rate of 2% per year, nor do they have a grasp of inflation

and risk diversification concepts. These findings have also been confirmed for younger adults

(Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2010; Lusardi and Mitchell 2011a).4

       We are not the first to suggest that financial knowledge is an endogenously determined

choice variable. For example, Delavande, Rohwedder, and Willis (2008) posited that invest-

ment in financial knowledge is akin to human capital investment, but their static model

cannot trace life cycle wealth patterns. Jappelli and Padula (2011) discussed investments

in financial knowledge, but they used a life cycle model with certainty and no borrowing

constraint and did not evaluate whether differences in knowledge levels produce wealth in-

equality. Both papers built on the seminal work of Ben-Porath (1967) and Becker (1975) who

modeled the economic decision to invest in human capital by linking education to wages. By

contrast, we dynamically model investments in financial knowledge in a rich intertemporal

setting with decisionmaking under many sources of uncertainty, an approach that allows us

to evaluate the quantitative importance of financial knowledge and to perform several im-

portant policy experiments. Our work also helps explain recent empirical findings regarding

financial knowledge and economically consequential outcomes. For example, our model is

consistent with evidence of a positive empirical link between financial knowledge and wealth
   4
    Low levels of financial skills are not only a problem in the United States. As illustrated by the Orga-
nization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2005) and the Survey of Health, Aging and
Retirement in Europe (SHARE), respondents around the world also score poorly on several numeracy and
financial literacy scales (Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula 2010). Lusardi and Mitchell (2011b) review a range
of other studies documenting low financial literacy levels around the world.

holdings.5 Additionally, our model explains why highly knowledgeable consumers may be

more likely to participate in the stock market6 which in our model is represented by the use

of a sophisticated investment technology.

    Finally, our analysis speaks to the difficulty that standard life cycle models have when

attempting to account for observed wealth inequality using heterogeneity in education and

permanent income. In view of the conventional model’s shortcomings, some researchers

have invoked different factors including impatience in the form of hyperbolic discounting

(Angeletos, Laibson, Repetto, Tobacman, and Weinberg 2001) or means-tested programs

(HSZ, 1995). Still others assume that consumers use rules of thumb when making sav-

ing decisions (Campbell and Mankiw 1989). By contrast, our approach draws on the fact

that risk-adjusted expected returns from financial products can differ across income groups.

For example, Yitzhaki (1987) established that higher earners enjoyed higher returns on

stock market transitions. In field experiments, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2010) and

Hastings, Mitchell, and Chyn (2011) showed that more financially knowledgable individu-

als paid lower fees for mutual funds. Since such fees can substantially reduce net returns

on such investments, this implies that financial knowledge boosts investors’ net returns.

Moreover, financial knowledge may also have an effect on diversification, which can produce

higher risk-adjusted returns. For example, Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009) showed

that better-educated Swedish households held more stock than others. Using Dutch data,

van Gaudecker (2011) looked at the relationship between investment diversification (return

loss), financial knowledge, and financial advice, and he reported that the least financially

informed were unlikely to do well on diversification.7 Such differences in returns can produce

a considerable amount of wealth inequality: for example, a dollar invested at a 6% versus

a 2% return over 50 years grows to be nearly seven times as large. To simply assume that

      See Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula (2010) and van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie (2011) among others.
    7
      One could argue that financial knowledge would not be needed if individuals could rely on financial
advisers. Our model, explained in detail below, therefore incorporates the cost of obtaining financial advice.
Yet it is worth noting that there are impediments to obtaining good financial advice if consumers lack finan-
cial knowledge (Collins 2012; U.S. GAO 2011). For this reason, financial literacy is plausibly a complement
to, rather than a substitute for, financial advice.

there is substantial heterogeneity in returns does not help much in explaining wealth het-

erogeneity, since that merely replaces one source of unexplained heterogeneity with another.

Instead, our approach generates such heterogeneity arising from endogenous accumulation

of financial knowledge.



3     Life Cycle Wealth and Financial Knowledge

3.1    The Evolution of Income and Assets by Education

The basic life cycle economic model posits that individuals will save in order to transfer re-

sources to life stages where the marginal utility of consumption is highest. Given concavity

of the utility function, consumers seek to transfer resources from periods of their lives when

they earn substantial incomes to periods when they earn less. We illustrate typical house-

hold income profiles over the life cycle in Figure 1, which plots median net household income

by education group constructed from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).8 Educa-

tional attainment refers to three sets of household heads: those who had not completed their

high school education, high school graduates, and those with at least some college. We focus

on white males throughout this paper to keep our sample as homogeneous as possible. We

also drop individuals with business assets and censor all variables at the 99th percentile.9

    [Figure 1 here]

    As is evident, life cycle household income for this cohort is hump-shaped. It also rises

at a faster rate for the college-educated than for the less-educated, and from around age

50 onward, incomes slowly decrease for all groups. Post-retirement, income falls due to the

fact that Social Security and pension benefit amounts are generally less than labor earnings.

In the U.S., old-age benefit replacement rates are higher for the least-educated due to the

progressivity of public safety net programs, so better-educated consumers see their incomes
    8
      These calculations use the PSID CNEF files from 1980 to 1997 (in $2004). To generate the figure, we
first run median regressions with age and cohort effects, and then we predict incomes for the 1935-1945
cohort. Age dummies are smoothed with a lowess filter.
    9
      Including those with business assets skews the interpretation of saving motives compared to the general
population, because of the large amount of wealth held in these ventures as well as the volatility of this
income (see Hurst, Kennickell, Lusardi, and Torralba 2010).


                                                     7
fall relatively more after retirement. Additionally, net household income declines somewhat

for all groups in retirement, probably because of changes in household composition (e.g. loss

of a spouse).

      Figure 2 traces life cycle paths of median net wealth (defined as the sum of bank ac-

counts, stocks, IRAs, mutual funds, bonds, and net real estate, minus debt) for these same

individuals.10 For the typical household, wealth grows steadily up to the mid-60s and then

flattens or declines. Again, there are striking differences by educational attainment, with

the median college-educated household having more than $375,000 in wealth at age 65 (in

$2004). By contrast, high school dropouts at the same age had accumulated less than

$125,000, with most of that in the form of housing wealth.

      [Figure 2 here]

      In the simplest version of a life cycle economic model, individuals will optimally consume

only a portion of their lifetime incomes each period, borrowing in some periods and saving in

others. A key prediction of this framework is that the life cycle path of assets normalized by

lifetime income should be the same across groups. Therefore, as noted by HSZ (1995), higher

earners would be predicted to have wealth-to-income profiles that simply scale-up lower

earners’ paths. Yet our data indicate non-proportional wealth-to-income profiles, implying

that the simple model cannot explain observed wealth heterogeneity. This confirms evidence

from Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2004) who report large differences in saving rates across

education groups, using different datasets (both CEX and PSID).

      More sophisticated models allow for a precautionary saving motive, which comes into

play when income is uncertain and borrowing is difficult. In this circumstance, some indi-

viduals will want to save more anticipating that they will have a very high marginal utility

of consumption when future income is low. Given a concave utility function exhibiting

prudence, such a consumer will save more in anticipation of this possibility.11 While pre-

cautionary saving can explain some of the heterogeneity observed in the data, it still falls

short of explaining wealth differences among those facing similar uncertain income profiles.
 10
      In what follows, we refer interchangeably to net wealth, net assets, net worth, and household wealth.
 11
      See Deaton (1992).


                                                      8
Yet another explanation for why the less-educated fail to save was offered by HSZ (1995),

who noted that the U.S. social insurance system protects families with limited resources

against bad states of the world. That is, means-tested and redistributive transfer programs

such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income provide an explicit

consumption floor in the event that households fall into poverty. In turn, the existence of

this consumption floor dampens consumers’ precautionary saving motives, particularly when

people are rather likely to become eligible for such benefits. Though this does help explain

why the less-educated save little, it cannot explain wealth inequality in the upper half of

the income distribution, where the consumption floor is less likely to be reached.

   Other authors resort to differences in preferences to explain observed wealth inequality

patterns. For example, Cagetti (2003) posits that consumers have different high rates of

time preference and low rates of risk aversion, and he suggests that this combination could

lead to small precautionary saving for the less-educated and younger consumers. Differences

in household composition over the life cycle can also affect consumption by directly chang-

ing discount factors or the marginal utility of consumption: inasmuch as household size

is negatively correlated with education, this could also account for some portion of wealth

inequality (Attanasio, Banks, Meghir, and Weber 1999; SSK 2006). Another potential chan-

nel generating wealth inequality might be differences in anticipated mortality patterns. It is

well-known that the more educated live longer (De Nardi, French, and Jones 2011), which

might also account for a portion of the observed divergence in wealth accumulation (and

decumulation) across groups. Our analysis below incorporates many of these differences, to

assess how their impacts compare to those of endogenous financial knowledge as a separate

channel explaining wealth inequality.


3.2   Differentials in Sophisticated Financial Products by Education

In view of the income paths illustrated above, it should be apparent that college-educated

consumers would optimally do relatively more saving (and borrowing), compared to the less-

educated. In turn, this could make the better-educated group more interested than their


                                              9
less-educated peers in a technology that enhanced returns on resources transferred across

periods. Table 1 shows the fraction of PSID respondents holding stocks, mutual funds,

bonds, and/or individual retirement accounts (IRAs), arrayed by age and education. We

denote these products as relatively “sophisticated,” compared to having only a bank account

(or no saving at all).

      [Table 1 here]

      From these data, it is evident that college-educated households are much more likely to

use a sophisticated technology for saving, compared to high school dropouts.12 In particular,

more than three-quarters of the older college-educated respondents (age 55-65) use sophis-

ticated products, compared to fewer than one-third of the high school dropouts of the same

age. And even small differences in returns over the working life can generate substantial

differences in wealth levels at retirement, holding saving rates constant.

      The ability of the highly educated and better paid to enjoy higher risk-adjusted returns

may result from greater knowledge about financial products. Some authors surmise that

limited numeracy and lack of financial sophistication can explain people’s generally low lev-

els of investment and low participation in the stock market (van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie

2011). Since equity investments provide higher expected returns, one would therefore antic-

ipate that highly educated households would likely earn higher returns on their saving. But

such differences in financial holdings are insufficient to generate observed wealth inequality

patterns. For example, Venti and Wise (2001) report that including controls for stock own-

ership contributes little to explaining the dispersion of wealth across households: that is,

adding “investment choices” as controls (in addition to lifetime earnings) reduces the uncon-

ditional standard deviation of wealth at retirement by only 8%, at the margin. Accordingly,

if the differential take-up of sophisticated products is to account for more of wealth in-

equality, modelers must allow for the possibility that returns are persistently heterogeneous

across households in a predictable way. In what follows, we endogenize the motivation to

take up sophisticated financial products as a way to motivate the emergence and persistence

3.3   Financial Knowledge and Wealth Accumulation

To understand how financial knowledge can alter the invariance of wealth to income in a

standard life cycle model, we first build an illustrative two-period example, and below we

extend this to a richer framework. Accordingly, assume that the individual receives labor

income y only in the first period. Denoting wealth in period 2 as w, we seek to understand

wealth accumulation in period 2 as a function of lifetime income. The consumer can choose

how much to consume, c, in the first period, and how much to invest in raising R, the return

factor on saving, s. Thus, w = Rs and c = y − πR − w/R where π is the monetary cost of

raising R. Assuming the consumer has a discount factor β, he maximizes:


                                max u(y − πR − w/R) + βu(w)
                                w,R


                                                                                            c1−σ
   From the first order conditions to this problem and assuming power utility, u(c) =       1−σ ,

we obtain the following condition for optimal wealth:

                                                          √ 1/σ
                                        1
                                    1− 2σ        √          π
                                w           (y − 2 πw) =
                                                           β

   While the right-hand side of the equation is constant with wealth, the left-hand side is

not: the left-hand side is decreasing in w for reasonable values of σ and π. A rise in income

increases the left-hand side for a given wealth level. If the wealth ratio is to increase to equal

the right-hand side, wealth must rise by more than income. We use simulations to show

that this is indeed always the case for reasonable parameter values. Figure 3 illustrates how

wealth-to-income ratios vary with income levels, given σ = 1.6, β = 0.96, and π = 2.5; these

are all reasonable parameter values (as discussed below).

   [Figure 3 here]

   The slope of this line is positive, and the intuition behind the result is clear. There is a

complementarity between an agent’s need to save and his willingness to invest in raising R.


                                                     11
For high values of y, the reward to investing in R rises because saving needs are relatively

important. In this two-period model, where lifetime income and the income trajectory are

the same, it is not higher income per se that raises the incentive to invest in financial knowl-

edge but rather the need to smooth marginal utility across periods. The need is greater

when there is a larger gap between first- and second-period consumption. Accordingly, het-

erogeneity in retiree benefit replacement rates can affect the incentives to invest in financial

knowledge; in turn, this can lead to additional differences in wealth accumulation. The

same can be said of differences in demographic factors that shift the marginal utility of

consumption over the life cycle, as well as differences in expected mortality.

    A richer setting with uncertainty and borrowing constraints offers additional motivations

to save. If consumers are liquidity constrained, they may be unwilling to invest in financial

knowledge. Faced with uncertainty, a consumer might also wish to save more and invest

more in financial knowledge for precautionary reasons. Furthermore, the sensitivity of saving

to the interest rate can be smaller than in the certainty case (Cagetti 2003), which may also

affect incentives to invest in knowledge. Accordingly, we next turn to a richer model of

saving to investigate the effects of financial knowledge on wealth inequality.



4    The Model

To allow cross-sectional variation in both financial knowledge and wealth levels, we ex-

tend the two-period example above in several directions. First, we introduce uncertainty

regarding asset returns, household income, and out-of-pocket medical expenditures. The

consumer is assumed to choose his consumption stream by maximizing expected discounted

utility, where utility flows are discounted by β. Second, the individual also faces stochas-

tic mortality risk, and decisions are made from time t = 0 (age 25) to age T (or as long

as the consumer is still alive; T = 100). Third, and adding to the heterogeneity created

by the stochastic components, we also examine three different education groups (less than

high school, high school, and college). Across these, we allow for heterogeneity in income,



                                              12
mortality, demographics, out-of-pocket medical expenditure levels, and risk. Importantly,

to highlight how investment in financial knowledge affects outcomes, we do not allow for

differences in preferences, and we assume consumers start their life cycles with no financial

knowledge.

       The utility function is assumed to be strictly concave in consumption and defined as

nt u(ct /nt ), where nt is an equivalence scale capturing (known) changes in demographics

(SSK 2006). The marginal utility of consumption is u0 (ct /nt ) and thus rises with nt . Since

the path of nt is hump-shaped over the life cycle, this contributes to generate a hump-shaped

consumption profile with age (Attanasio, Banks, Meghir, and Weber 1999).

       The consumer may elect to invest his resources in two different investment technologies.

The first is a basic technology (for example, a checking account) which yields a certain

(low) return r (R = 1 + r). The second is a more sophisticated technology which enables

the consumer to receive a higher expected return, increasing in financial knowledge, f, but

it comes at a price. Specifically, the consumer must pay a direct cost (fee) to use the

technology, cd , and he must also invest time and money in acquiring the knowledge.

       Obtaining knowledge, in the form of investment, it , has a cost of πi (it ); we assume that

this cost function is convex, reflecting decreasing returns in the production of knowledge.13

Relatively little is known about how this cost might vary across individuals; for instance, it

could either rise or fall depending on the level of education. Clearly the opportunity cost of

time is higher for higher earners, but education might be a complement in the production

of knowledge, making it easier for the better-educated to learn. We remain agnostic about

whether the average cost of investing in additional knowledge is higher or lower for more

educated households; rather, we assume initially that all households face the same cost

function, and subsequently we explore alternative formulations in sensitivity analyses.14

       The rate of return of the sophisticated technology is stochastic, and the expectation of
  13
      A convex cost has the advantage of avoiding bang-bang solutions where consumers invest massively in
one period; hence it encourages the smoothing of investment over time (cf., Delavande, Rohwedder, and
Willis 2008).
   14
      Alternatively one might allow for a direct disutility of investing in financial knowledge and try to estimate
it from the data. Here, because we are concerned mainly with the model’s properties rather than its precise
fit to the data, we abstract from the direct disutility channel.


                                                        13
the return depends on the agent’s level of financial knowledge at the end of t, R(f
                                                                                e t+1 ). Thus

the stochastic return function is given by


                                  R(f
                                  e t+1 ) = R + r(ft+1 ) + σε εt+1


where εt+1 is a N(0,1) iid shock and σε is the standard deviation of returns on the sophis-

ticated technology. The function r(ft+1 ) is increasing in ft+1 and it can be interpreted as

an excess return function. Since the variance is assumed fixed, this also implies that agents

with higher financial literacy obtain a higher Sharpe ratio (higher risk-adjusted returns)

on their investments. We denote by κt = 1 an indicator that the consumer invests in the

sophisticated technology in period t, and κt = 0 if not.15

       Financial knowledge evolves according to:


                                            ft+1 = δft + it


where δ is a depreciation factor and it is gross investment. Depreciation exists both because

consumer financial knowledge may decay, and also because some knowledge may become

obsolete as new financial products are developed.

       The consumer receives a government transfer trt which guarantees a minimum consump-

tion floor of cmin (as in HSZ 1995). This consumption floor may lower the expected variance

of future consumption, which diminishes the precautionary motive for saving. Transfers are

defined as trt = max(cmin − xt , 0) where cash on hand is:



                                          xt = at + yt − oopt

where yt is net household income and oopt represents out-of-pocket medical expenditures.

Both variables are stochastic over and above a deterministic trend. The sophisticated tech-
  15
     In this paper we model only the extensive margin of investment in the sophisticated technology, since
exploratory work with the PSID showed that differences across education groups are larger at the extensive
rather than the intensive margin of “how much” to invest. Prohibitive computational requirements put the
latter model beyond current reach.



                                                   14
nology cannot be purchased if xt − cd < cmin (that is, the government will not pay for costs

of obtaining the technology). End-of-period assets are given by


                               eκ (ft+1 )(xt + trt − ct − π(it ) − cd κt )
                        at+1 = R


      eκ (ft+1 ) = (1 − κt )R + κt R(f
where R                            e t ). We impose a borrowing constraint on the model

such that assets at+1 must be non-negative.

   As in many papers in this literature, we posit that during the work life, the individual’s

net income equation (in logs) is given by a deterministic component which depends on

education, age, and an AR(1) stochastic process:


                          log ye,t = gy,e (t) + µy,t + νy,t

                             µy,t = ρy,e µy,t−1 + εy,t
                                               2                    2
                                 εy,t ∼ N (0, σy,ε ), νy,t ∼ N (0, σy,v )


Here e represents the education group, and gy,e (t) is an age polynomial (quadratic). The

error term ηy,t is the sum of a persistent component µy,t and an idiosyncratic component

νy,t . Retirement is exogenous at age 65. After retirement, the individual receives retirement

income which is a function of pre-retirement income.

   A similar stochastic AR(1) process is assumed for out-of-pocket medical expenditures.

Log out-of-pocket expenditures follow the process:




                        log oope,t = go,e (t) + µo,t + νo,t

                              µo,t = ρo,e µo,t−1 + εo,t
                                                2                    2
                                  εo,t ∼ N (0, σo,ε ), νo,t ∼ N (0, σo,v ).


Because these expenditures are generally low prior to retirement (and to save on computation

time), we allow only for medical expenditure risk after retirement (as in HSZ, 1995). Again,

                                                15
the error term ηo,t is the sum of a persistent component µo,t and an idiosyncratic component

νo,t . Finally, we allow for mortality risk at all ages, denoting pe,t as the one-year survival

probability. Mortality risk is allowed to differ across education groups.

    The state-space in period t is defined as st = (ηy,t , ηo,t , e, ft , at ). The consumer’s decisions

are given by (ct , it , κt ). Hence there are two continuous control variables (consumption and

investment) and a discrete one (participation). There are five state variables. We represent

the problem as a series of Bellman equations such that, at each age, the value function has

the following form:16

                                                      ˆ ˆ         ˆ
           Vd (st ) = max ne,t u(ct /ne,t ) + βpe,t                    V (st+1 )dFe (ηo )dFe (ηy )dF (ε)
                      ct ,it ,κt                         ε   ηy   ηo

                    eκ (ft+1 )(at + ye,t + trt − ct − π(it ) − cd I(κt > 0)), at+1 ≥ 0
             at+1 = R

             ft+1 = δft + it

        eκ (ft+1 ) = (1 − κt )R + κt R(f
        R                            e t ).


We index variables by e where education differences are assumed to be present.17

    The model is solved by backward recursion after discretizing the continuous state vari-

ables. At each point in the state-space, we use a grid-search method to search for the

optimal solution of consumption, financial knowledge investment, and investment in the

sophisticated technology. We solve for optimal decisions for a grid of 40 net asset points

and 25 financial knowledge points. Bi-linear interpolation is used to find the value function

when net assets or the financial knowledge stock at t + 1 fall off the grid; the value function

behaves smoothly and is concave except at low levels of net assets where liquidity constraints

and the consumption floor bind. Accordingly, the grid for assets in the state-space is defined

as equally spaced points on a0.5 , which leads to more points at lower levels of net assets.
  16
     This formulation abstracts from bequest motives. While an extension to include bequests could be
interesting, the evidence suggests that this would have a minimal effect on wealth decumulation among the
elderly (DeNardi, French, and Jones 2011). Moreover, incorporating bequests would only increase wealth
inequality, without changing the qualitative nature of our results.
  17
     There are four sources of risk over which the value function is integrated: mortality, rate of return,
out-of-pocket medical expenditures, and income. These risks are assumed to be independent.




                                                    16
We use the method proposed by Tauchen (1986) to discretize the processes for income and

out-of-pocket median expenditures (with nine points each). Finally, we use three points for

rate of return shocks.18



5         Calibration

Our goals are to show how endogenous financial knowledge affects wealth holding, and to

understand the determinants of financial knowledge accumulation patterns. Since we lack

information on individual returns over the life cycle by education group, we do not estimate

all relevant parameters of the model. Rather, we proceed with a calibration using plausible

values from the literature for preferences and constraints for our base case. Additionally, we

provide an extensive sensitivity analysis in Section 6.

         To implement the model in the base case, we assume that u(ct /nt ) has a CRRA form with

relative risk aversion σ. The value of 3 for this parameter used by HSZ (1995) is reasonable

in their context, since their main mechanism for creating dispersion in saving patterns

is the differential impact of the precautionary saving motive due to a consumption floor.

Accordingly, in their setting, the precautionary saving motive governed by the coefficient

of relative prudence, 1 + σ, needed to be large. By contrast, our model has an additional

channel for creating wealth dispersion, so there is no need for such a strong precautionary

saving motive. We use a value of σ = 1.6 in the base case, which is close to that estimated

by Attanasio, Banks, Meghir, and Weber (1999) using consumption data. It is worth noting

that the portfolio choice literature typically assumes risk aversion parameters in excess of

four (e.g. Campbell and Viceira 2002; Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout 2005), but we do not

require such a high degree of risk aversion in our model. One reason is that agents with low

financial knowledge already face low returns if they used the sophisticated technology; hence

they will not adopt it. Additionally, the cost of participating in the sophisticated technology
    18
    The fact that even low literacy individuals act as though they can solve the complex model above may
seem incompatible with their lack of sophistication. But an approximation to these people’s optimal decision
rules can be quite simple in our setup, as noted by Deaton (1992) in his discussion of complex precautionary
saving models.



                                                    17
reduces the incentives to use it (Vissing-Jorgensen 2003). Both factors mean that we can

fit market participation patterns relatively well using the sophisticated technology proposed

here, without resorting to high values of risk aversion.

       Following SSK (2006), we define an equivalence scale that accounts for consumption

differences in household size by education group and changes in demographics over the life

cycle. Let z(j, k) = (j + 0.7k)0.75 where j is the number of adults in the household and k is

the number of children (under 18 years old). We then define ne,t = z(je,t , ke,t )/z(2, 1) where

je,t and ke,t are the average number of adults and children in the household by age and

education group. We use PSID data to estimate the time series of average equivalence scales

by education group. The age profile of those scales is hump-shaped and more amplified for

less-educated households.19 For the base case, we use a discount factor of 0.96, as in SSK

(2006) and Campbell and Viceira (2002).20 The annual minimum consumption floor is set

at $10,000 per couple with one child.21

       Computing post-retirement income as a function of pre-retirement income is notori-

ously difficult because retirement is endogenous. Here we abstract from this and estimate

fixed-effect regressions of net household income on age and a retirement dummy, analyzed

separately by education level. This produces replacement rates of 0.81 for dropouts, 0.72

for high school graduates, and 0.68 for college graduates. These are higher than rates based

only on Social Security benefits, since older households have additional sources of retirement

income (e.g. spousal earnings, employer pension benefits, annuities, etc.). The replacement

rates are close to those based on total retirement income in the literature (cf. Aon Consult-
  19
     In the PSID, we compute the average number per household of adults and children (under 18 years old)
by the head’s education and age. We then implement the equivalence scale according to the formula in the
text.
  20
     This is also close to the value of De Nardi, French, and Jones (2011) who estimate it to be 0.97, and
Cagetti (2003) who estimates a value of 0.948 for high school dropouts and 0.989 for the college-educated.
  21
     This value is derived from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE,
2008), where the maximum monthly benefit payable to a couple with one child under the Temporary Assis-
tance for Needy Families (TANF) program was $495 (in $2006). The average monthly benefit of recipients on
food stamps (for a 3-person household) was $283. Hence, prior to age 65, the sum of TANF and food stamp
benefits totaled $778/month for a 3-person household or $9,336/year (omitting the lifetime TANF receipt
limit). The Social Security Administration (http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/factsheets/colafacts2004.htm)
reports that the 2004 maximum monthly federal payment for SSI was $552 for a single household and $829
for couples; including food stamps yields an annual total of $7,620 for singles and $12,180 for couples.
Accordingly we use a value of $10,000/year, comparable to the $12,000 used by HSZ (1995) in $2004.


                                                   18
ing 2008). Following retirement, we let income decline at the rate estimated in PSID data

controlling for educational groups and cohort effects; that pattern is mostly due to changes

in household composition (e.g. widowhood).

       The return on the safe asset is set to r =2% (as in Campbell and Viceira 2002). The

form of the excess return function is not available from previous studies. The range of risk-

adjusted portfolio returns reported, for example, by van Gaudecker (2011) ranges from -0.017

to 0.054.22 Therefore we set the range of possible returns using the technology between 0%

and 4%; we choose the latter figure because it roughly matches the equity premium used in

other studies on portfolio choice.23 Consequently we do not assume a range of returns that

would make financial knowledge artificially important (say, by assuming households could

persistently earn excess returns over 10%).

       Another issue has to do with the functional form for the return function that depends on

financial knowledge, r(ft+1 ). As data are not available to calibrate this function, we employ

a linear function by setting rmax = r(fmax ) = 0.04 and rmin = r(fmin ) = 0. Below, we

choose a convex cost function for investing in financial knowledge, which therefore embodies

decreasing returns to producing knowledge. Accordingly, even if the production function

is linear, agents will seek to smooth their investments in financial knowledge over the life

cycle. We adopt this simpler form of the production function in order to show the basic

mechanisms of the model. In the robustness analysis of Section 6, we show how allowing for

an elasticity below one affects results regarding the role of financial knowledge in explaining

wealth inequality.

       To compute the deterministic part of net household income, we draw on data from

Cross-National Equivalent files of the PSID, pooling all available waves (1980-2005).24 The

NBER’s Taxsim program is used to compute net household income. We account for cohort

effects when computing income profiles, setting the cohort effect for our calibration baseline
  22
     We thank Hans-Martin van Gaudecker for sharing the Dutch portfolio data with us. Using expected
portfolio returns and standard deviation (computed using CAPM and historical returns), we then evaluated
the Sharpe ratio for each individual portfolio (the ratio of expected returns to the standard deviation). We
then used a standard deviation of 0.16, as in Campbell and Viceira (2002), to compute risk-adjusted returns.

to the 1935-1945 birth group. For comparability with prior studies, we use the AR(1) error

structure estimated by HSZ (1995) for net household income prior to age 65. We use HRS

data to compute the profile of household out-of-pocket medical expenditures allowing for

cohort effects; we predict the profiles for those born between 1935 and 1945, again using the

error structure estimated by HSZ (1995). Both income and out-of-pocket expenditures prove

to be highly persistent, and differences in persistence and variance across education groups

are relatively small. Following the literature (HSZ 1995; SSK 2006), we set the variance

of the transitory error component to zero in the simulations since most of it likely reflects

measurement error.

   Estimating the price of acquiring financial knowledge from available data is difficult

because little information is available on inputs to the production process – time and ex-

penditures on financial services – let alone data on investments in, as opposed to the stock

of, financial knowledge. According to Turner and Muir (2012), the cost of a one-hour finan-

cial advice consultation averages about $250. Veritat.com offers financial planning at $25 a

month for singles and $40 for families ($35 for retirees), after an initial meeting fee of $250.

Accordingly, the cost ranges from $550 for singles and $730 for families. Less-expensive

alternatives include financial advice software such as ESPlanner, where a one-year license

costs $40 (the upgraded ESPlanner costs $149; see esplanner.com/product_catalog). In our

analysis, we seek to match an average annual expenditure of $500 on financial literacy. We

use the function π(it ) = 100i1.75
                              t    which matches this average expenditure in the simulations

and yields a smooth financial literacy investment age profile. For the participation cost

of the sophisticated technology (cd ), we use the median estimate of $750 (in $2004) from

Vissing-Jorgensen (2003).

   We also require an estimate of the depreciation factor for financial knowledge, δ, but

there is little information on the size of this parameter. One study reported that undergrad-

uates’ economic learning depreciated at 4-10% annually (Kipps, Kohen, and Paden 1984).

Wage and labor supply information have also been used to measure human capital depreci-

ation; for instance, Heckman (1976) estimated annual depreciation rates of 3-7%. For the


                                              20
sensitivity analysis, we start with a value of 6% and study whether results vary from that

baseline. We could permit the depreciation rate to rise with age to reflect the possibility

of cognitive decline, but this is not needed to produce a hump-shaped financial knowledge

profile. Furthermore, it is unclear whether consumers can predict cognitive decline, partic-

ularly when it comes to memory, and self-reported memory does not change with age in the

HRS.25

         We also allow for mortality risk differences across education groups, estimated using

Gompertz hazard regressions in HRS data for people age 50+, allowing for proportional

education effects.26 We assume the same proportionality by education prior to age 50, but

we use age/mortality profiles taken from population life tables.

         Upon finding optimal consumption, financial knowledge investment, and technology par-

ticipation at each point in the state-space and at each age, we then use our decision rules

to simulate 5,000 individuals moving through their life cycles. We draw income shocks,

out-of-pocket medical expenditure surprises, and rate of return shocks, and we then simu-

late the life cycle paths of all consumers. These consumers are given the initial conditions

for education, earnings, and assets derived from the PSID for indiviudals age 25-30. We

initialize financial knowledge at the lowest level (0), because we lack baseline information

on financial knowledge. This also makes clear how endogenous accumulation of financial

knowledge affects wealth outcomes, and it abstracts from differences in initial conditions.



6         Simulations

Our discussion of the simulation results focuses on outcomes around the time of retirement,

since this is when heterogeneity in net assets is most evident. Table 2 reports statistics

for each education group at the time of retirement, where we see that wealth patterns are

quite unequal. As of age 65, the median high school dropout has accumulated less than half
    25
      Objectively-measured memory scores do fall after about age 65, but self-assessed perceptions are more
likely to affect individual behavior.
   26
      These regressions are available upon request. Life expectancy at age 25 is five years higher for the
college-educated compared to high school dropouts.



                                                    21
as much wealth compared to high school graduates ($61,500 versus $180,300), and college

graduates have accumulated twice as much in retirement assets ($370,200) compared to

high school graduates. In fact, compared to the outcomes reported in Figure 2, the model

somewhat overpredicts wealth inequality, due mainly to very low predicted assets among

dropouts. The ratio of median wealth to income (average lifetime income for each group) is

1.91 for dropouts and 7.8 for college graduates. Accordingly, the ratio of wealth to income

for these two groups stands at 4.08. In other words, our model generates a strongly positive

relationship between accumulated wealth (normalized by income) and income. We proxy

the percent of indiviudals who will be poor in old age, proxied by the fraction of consumers

reaching retirement age with assets below their current income levels. As indicated in Figure

2, close to 40% of high school droputs will be poor according to this metric, versus 17% for

college graduates.

   [Table 2 here]

   At retirement, the fraction of consumers investing in the sophisticated technology also

varies by education group, with 35% of the dropouts, 54% of the high school graduates, and

69% of the college graduates doing so. This pattern nicely matches the patterns shown in

Table 1 for participation in sophisticated financial products. There we found that 32% of

dropouts, 53% of high school graduates, and 76% of college graduates held what we defined

to be sophisticated saving technologies.

   Finally, we compute the fraction of consumers with low financial knowledge at the time

of retirement. Given the production function, a threshold of 25 units implies that such

households could expect an excess return of only one percentage point or less. In our model,

such a low level of financial knowledge turns out to be optimal for many, given the constraints

and shocks that individuals face. These “optimally ignorant” individuals include 67% of the

dropouts, 47% of the high school graduates, and 33% of college graduates. Since financial

knowledge strongly influences participation in the sophisticated technology, it is perhaps not

surprising that almost all of those with a financial knowledge level of over 25 do use the

technology. In this way, financial knowledge can be seen as a type of entry cost, allowing


                                              22
users to deploy the technology effectively. This entry cost varies by education groups, since

incentives to invest in financial knowledge also differ.

   Figure 4 illustrates the life cycle paths of average financial knowledge by education

groups, all of which which prove to be hump-shaped. Financial knowledge peaks around the

age of 65 and declines thereafter. In the accumulation phase, better-educated consumers

invest more because they have more to gain from higher returns that help them smooth

lifetime marginal utilities. At some point, the opportunity cost of investing becomes too

large in terms of foregone consumption and depreciation, and the marginal benefit decreases

due to the shorter horizon over which consumers have to enjoy the investments. Raising the

depreciation rate of knowledge with age would only make this decline more marked.

   [Figure 4 here]


6.1   Quantitative Importance of Endogenous Financial Knowledge

Our model embodies several differences across education groups that generate differential

wealth accumulation patterns. First, the consumption floor acts as a tax on saving for those

most likely to experience a substantial negative income shock, since subsistence benefits

are means-tested (HSZ 1995). Second, differences in replacement rates, demographics, and

mortality patterns can create differential incentives to save. Finally, there is the mechanism

we propose: financial knowledge, which creates a positive relationship between normalized

wealth and income. To clarify the relative contribution of each mechanism in the life cycle

model, we next undertake a decomposition exercise which is depicted in Figure 5.

   [Figure 5 here]

   To this end, we recall that the ratio of median wealth-to-income for college graduates to

dropouts is 4.08 at retirement in our baseline simulation. To offer a contrast, we eliminate

the possibility of accumulating knowledge along with all differences across education groups

other than income while working and medical expenditure differences. For this alternative

case, we fix all constraints to those of high school graduates and eliminate the consumption

floor. The top bar of Figure 5 shows in the setup with only income and medical expenditure


                                              23
uncertainty that the wealth-to-income ratio of college graduates is virtually the same as that

of dropouts, at 0.96. In other words, confirming what we noted at the outset, the basic life

cycle model predicts that all groups accumulate wealth in the same proportion to income.

   Next we reintroduce the consumption floor, which reduces precautionary saving of high

school dropouts by more than that of college graduates. As illustrated, this does raise

the wealth-to-income ratio for college versus high school dropouts, but the impact is small,

raising it only to 1.08 (the second bar in Figure 5). Thus in our model, the consumption floor

plays a relatively inconsequential role in generating wealth inequality. This finding differs

from HSZ (1995) because our precautionary saving motive is much smaller than theirs due

to lower risk aversion. Reintroducing differences in old-age income replacement rates is

important since college graduates have much lower replacement rates than do dropouts.

Moreover, this change alters both wealth accumulation and lifetime income patterns; the

net effect, of course, depends on the substitutability of retirement wealth and private wealth.

The third bar in Figure 5 represents this simulation, which does increase inequality by 50%

(from 1.08 to 1.5). Introducing differences in demographics (the 4th bar down) contributes

another increase of roughly 0.5 in the ratio. What this means is that, in the model, differences

in household composition are as important as differences in replacement rates. Accounting

for mortality differences (the 5th bar) again increases the ratio, now to 2.49. This is because

college-educated households must finance consumption over a longer horizon, while high

school dropouts face a shorter horizon. Consequently, this is the amount of inequality

generated using a life cycle model that lacks endogenous financial knowledge.

   The bottom bar in Figure 5 shows how outcomes change when we reintroduce the pos-

sibility of consumer investments in financial knowledge, in addition to the other factors

mentioned above. The impact of allowing consumers to access the sophisticated technology

and earn higher expected returns is striking. Now the wealth-to-income ratio across edu-

cation groups rises from 2.49 to 4.09, an increase in the ratio of 1.6 (or 65%). Thus of all

the explanations examined here for heterogeneity in wealth outcomes, financial knowledge

accounts for more than half the cross-group wealth inequality [0.51=1.6/(4.09-1)].


                                              24
   To more fully illustrate the impact of having access to the higher returns as a result of

investing in financial knowledge, we undertake a simple counterfactual exercise. For each

schooling group, we first compute average simulated consumption, investment, and medical

expenditures by age. Then we evaluate the average return factor for each educational group

by age using its accumulated financial knowledge, and we compare this to the average

wealth path assuming all groups could only earn the average return earned by high school

dropouts. We find that wealth would have been 39% lower for college graduates at the

time of retirement if they had experienced the returns paid to dropouts; for high school

graduates, the decline would have been just over 30% compared to the paths using their

actual average rates of return. Since rates of return differ by roughly 1% between education

groups, over many years these differences compounded produce substantial differences in

wealth. Moreover, our model generates this wealth inequality endogenously, building only

on differences in marginal utilities of consumption over the life cycle.


6.2   Policy Simulations

In the real world, several institutional factors can help shape the process of financial knowl-

edge accumulation. For instance, means-tested benefits protect consumers against bad states

of nature: when consumers seek financial knowledge to create a buffer stock of saving, having

such programs may provide a disincentive to invest in financial knowledge. Similarly, Social

Security benefits may crowd out household saving and also discourage the accumulation of

financial knowledge. And the educational system can be influential in boosting initial levels

of financial knowledge, as demonstrated by Bernheim (1998); Behrman, Mitchell, Soo, and

Bravo (2012) and Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto (2010).

   To explore the relative importance of each type of policy, we next undertake three policy

simulations. First, we reduce expected retirement benefits by 20%, which might mimic what

Social Security can pay future retirees unless revenues to the program are increased (Cogan

and Mitchell 2003). Second, we examine the impact of a reduction in means-tested benefits

by half, which could mean either that generosity is decreased or that eligibility is restricted.


                                              25
Finally, our last scenario is aimed at understanding what would happen if all consumers

starting their life cycle had a financial knowledge level of 25; this implies that they would

start their life cycle with a possible excess rate of return of 1%. Results are reported in

Table 3.

       [Table 3 here]

       Panel A reports the impact of a 20% reduction in the retirement income benefit. Across

all educational groups, median assets rise compared to Table 2, which is not surprising

because retirement income crowds out private wealth accumulation in a life cycle setting.

Median assets more than double for dropouts, and they rise by roughly one-third for college

graduates. Lowering retirement income generosity thus reduces wealth inequality, instead

of increasing it.

       We can also compute the change in the present value of retirement income by education

group in this scenario. Expressing the change as a fraction of the change in the expected

present value of retirement income yields an estimate of the displacement or crowd-out effect

of retirement income. A naive life cycle model would predict a complete offset, once adjust-

ment is made for the fact that wealth is measured at the time of retirement, so the reduction

in lifetime income is only partially offset by that age. By contrast, the unadjusted displace-

ment effects in our simulations range from -0.79 to -1.03.27 The percentage of dropouts

who face shortfalls due to having assets below their current income falls by 30%, with not

much change among the best educated. All groups boost their holdings of the sophisticated

technology, and even more interestingly, the fraction of optimally ignorant respondents falls.

In other words, since all consumers must now save for retirement, investment in financial

knowledge rises across the board. Of course, this comes at a cost: the present value of in-

vestment expenditures rises by about $8,000 for dropouts, $4,000 for high school graduates,

and $6,000 for college graduates.28
  27
     These numbers are computed as the change in wealth at retirement divided by the change in the present
value of retirement income when we reduce the generosity of pensions. We use a discount rate of 3% for
these calculations.
  28
     These present values are computed using simulated data on financial knowledge investment over the life
cycle, the cost function, and a discount rate of 3%.



                                                    26
       The next scenario, in Panel B, halves the means-tested consumption floor from $10,000

to $5,000 per year. As before, this boosts incentives to save for precautionary reasons.

But because our precautionary saving motive is less important than in other studies, such a

policy change would produce few differential effects for wealth accumulation and/or financial

knowledge. That is, both wealth and knowledge rise following the benefit reduction, but

the impact is relatively similar across education groups. Accordingly, in this model, means-

tested benefits do not appear to be an important factor shaping saving and investment in

financial knowledge.

       The final policy scenario, reported in Panel C, considers the possibility that consumers

could start on their life cycle paths already having a positive endowment of financial knowl-

edge. This could happen, for instance, if financial education were included in high school

curricula. To explore how results change, we chose a level of 25; this implies consumers can

earn an initial excess return of 1% on their investments. Interestingly, this policy changes

retirement outcomes only slightly. Since financial knowledge is endogenous in the model,

people who do not need the knowledge will let it depreciate to their target optimal levels.

Although wealth is slightly greater at retirement and financial ignorance less prevalent, these

effects are small in comparison to the initial change in financial knowledge.

       The fact that outcomes at retirement are relatively insensitive to this policy change does

not, however, mean that financial education is unimportant to welfare. In fact, the last row

of Panel C in Table 3 reports the change in initial wealth at age 25 that a consumer would

require to make him as well off as with the initial endowment of financial knowledge. It

would take an additional $6,800 to make a dropout equally well off, $6,900 for a high school

graduate, and $15,400 for a college graduate. In other words, high school dropouts would

need 82% more initial wealth to make them as well off in expected utility terms, as with a

higher starting value of literacy; the wealth equivalent value is 56% for college graduates.

Such substantial wealth equivalence measures demonstrate that consumers do value financial

knowledge, even when they make no new investments thereafter.29 A large part of this value
  29
   Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007) also report large welfare consequences of enhancing consumer
knowledge, in a very different framework.


                                                27
is due to the fact that investment costs are reduced when people are endowed with a positive

level of initial financial knowledge.

   Interestingly, this last simulation suggests that a policy which exogenously raises financial

knowledge early in life might not have measurable long-term effects, when consumers have

both optimal financial knowledge and optimal target wealth levels in mind when solving

their life cycle problems. In other words, it is possible that a financial education program

could enhance saving in the short run, but it might have little enduring impact in terms

of additional future wealth. Nonetheless, the training would still bring important welfare

benefits, since additional short-term saving increases lifetime consumption and thus utility.

Therefore any effort to evaluate the impact of financial knowledge programs should take

these factors into account.


6.3     Sensitivity Analysis

6.3.1    Preference, Depreciation, and Cost Parameters

We have not estimated all parameters of the model because we lack data on individual rates

of return. For this reason, we next provide a rich set of sensitivity analyses to help assess

how results might change when important parameters are varied. To this end, we explore

sensitivity of the asset ratio of college-educated individuals relative to dropouts, the fraction

using the sophisticated technology, and the fraction optimally ignorant at retirement, for

key model parameters. Table 4 permits a comparison of results for the baseline case, as well

as the case where we vary one variable at a time. In all cases, we report the college to high

school dropout ratio, with the first column showing the ratio of wealth values at retirement;

the second providing the ratio of persons with the sophisticated technology; and the third

reporting the ratio of the populations with low financial knowledge.

   [Table 4 here]

   The first two rows of Table 4 indicate how results change with different values of the

relative risk aversion parameter σ. We vary this parameter from 1.1 to 3, spanning the

baseline value of 1.6. This variation proves to have an important impact on wealth inequal-

                                               28
ity as well as on the fraction holding sophisticated technology and with low knowledge.

Specifically, when risk aversion is low (σ = 1.1), individuals save more for retirement. Since

the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is large, better-educated people are also willing

to invest in financial knowledge and hold equities. Such complementarity substantially in-

creases the wealth dispersion across educational groups; the degree of inequality rises by

more than half [53%=(6.25-4.08)/4.08]. In contrast, setting σ to 3 produces the opposite

result: the precautionary saving motive is now more important, so all groups accumulate

more wealth and financial knowledge. Accordingly, in a cross-sectional context, our model

implies that more risk averse individuals would invest more in financial literacy, hold more

assets, and invest in financial knowledge. Overall, this reduces wealth inequality and reduces

the financially ignorant share of the population.

   The next two lines illustrate that results change relatively little when we vary the depre-

ciation rate for financial knowledge, δ, from the baseline level of 0.06 to a low of 0.03 and a

high of 0.09 (always holding other factors constant). Wealth inequality changes are small,

from 0 to 10% [=(4.08-3.58)/4.08]. The higher depreciation rate generates a bit less wealth

heterogeneity because college graduates cut back on their financial knowledge investments.

Relatively more of the college-educated group now fall in the low knowledge category than

at baseline.

   The next four rows indicate that the sensitivity of results depends on the production

function for financial knowledge, π(i). It will be recalled that the baseline representation of

this function π(it ) = 100i1.75
                           t    had two parameters. The multiplicand affects the average cost

of acquiring financial knowledge, while the exponent influences the function’s convexity. We

vary both in Table 4, in turn. Varying the multiplicand from its baseline value of 100 to

a low of 75 and a high of 125, has a relatively small impact on the results. By contrast,

changing the function’s convexity has a non-linear effect. Increasing convexity gives larger

incentives to spread investment over the life cycle and to avoid large investments. Hence,

this should lower differences in financial knowledge. However, raising convexity increases

the average cost of reaching a certain level of financial knowledge. Hence, this could amplify


                                              29
differences as college-educated households have more resources. The effect we observe is not

monotonic: inequality first increases (from 3.81 to 4.08) and then decreases (from 4.08 to

3.42).

   The final four rows of Table 4 change the fixed cost of participation in the sophisticated

technology, cd , and the discount factor, β. Altering cd around the baseline value of $750

has relatively little impact on wealth-to-income ratios as well as the other two outcomes.

By contrast, the wealth inequality ratio is relatively sensitive to changes in the discount

factor, β, set initially to a value of 0.96. In the final row of Table 4, we see that setting β =

0.98 produces one-third less wealth inequality compared to the baseline [=(4.08-2.69)/4.08],

less dispersion in risky asset holdings, and far smaller differences in financial literacy across

groups.

   In sum, our sensitivity analysis illustrates that, although results are somewhat dependent

on parameter values, the amount of wealth inequality generated by financial knowledge

remains high.


6.3.2     Production of Returns

In order to assess how the production function shapes the role of financial knowledge in

wealth dispersion, we next examine a different model from the one used in the baseline

setup. Consider the following function:


                                                      α1
                                       r(ft+1 ) = α0 ft+1 .


Here α1 is the elasticity of risk-adjusted returns to financial knowledge. Lacking data on

rates of return at the household level, there is little known about this elasticity. We use

a plausible range from the human capital literature as reported in Browning, Hansen, and

Heckman (1999), namely 0.5 to 0.9, and we consider three elasticity values: low (α1 = 0.5),

medium (α1 = 0.75), and high (α1 = 0.9). Table 5 reports the ratio of college to less-than-

high school median wealth for each of these scenarios.



                                               30
    [Table 5 here]

    What we find is that when the production function is more concave, less dispersion in

income-to-wealth ratios is generated. For example, an elasticity of 0.9 yields a ratio of 4.02,

versus 4.09 in the base case. An elasticity of 0.75, at the mid-range of the human capital

literature, yields a ratio of 4.0. The lower-bound elasticity of 0.5 yields a value of 3.35.

It is worth noting that even the lowest value of 3.35 represents considerably more wealth

inequality than results from a model without financial knowledge (there the ratio was 2.5).

Accordingly, more concavity in the knowledge production function attenuates the wealth

inequality created by financial knowledge. This is mostly due to the fact that, relative to

when the technology is linear, less-educated households now have higher marginal returns to

investing. Better-educated individuals have slightly flatter incremental returns to investing

in knowledge, relative to the baseline, and thus they invest slightly less. In general, concavity

of the function does therefore influence the degree of inequality generated, when financial

knowledge is endogenous. Yet in any case, allowing for a concave production function with

plausible elasticities instead of a linear function still implies a substantial role for financial

knowledge.



7    Discussion and Conclusions

This paper has developed an augmented stochastic life cycle model that endogenizes the

decision to acquire financial knowledge. Our goals were to explore the forces that shape

financial knowledge accumulation over the lifetime and to evaluate how much wealth in-

equality might be attributable to differences in financial knowledge. Our formulation posits

that financial knowledge offers higher expected returns though it is costly to acquire and

depreciates with time. The profile of optimal financial knowledge is shown to be hump-

shaped over the life cycle, and it also differs by educational groups because of differences

in life cycle income paths. Most importantly, we demonstrate that allowing for endogenous

financial knowledge creates large differences in wealth holdings, and that social insurance



                                               31
influences the incentives to acquire financial knowledge. Thus our model can rationalize and

account for a sizeable share of observed differences in wealth across education groups, while

other authors have had to rely on social insurance and preference parameters to produce

similar dispersion.

   In generating wealth inequality above and beyond what traditional models of saving

have delivered, we also can account for some of the large differences in wealth found in most

empirical work on saving. The precise values depend on model parameters, but our estimates

are strongly supportive of the conclusion that financial literacy plays a key role in explaining

inequality and should not be ignored. The model relies on an important and intuitively

sensible fact: individuals do not start their economic lives with full financial knowledge, so

this knowledge may be acquired endogenously over the life cycle. Moreover, we show that

some level of financial ignorance may actually be optimal: since it is expensive to acquire

financial knowledge and not everyone benefits from greater financial sophistication, some

consumers will rationally fail to invest. We also show that financial knowledge can be an

important public policy tool. For example, we predict that growing reliance on individually

managed 401(k) accounts or personal Social Security accounts would be accompanied by

more financial knowledge and more wealth inequality. Additionally, an increase in labor

income risk, as in the current macroeconomy, is likely to be accompanied by an increase not

only in precautionary saving but also in financial knowledge.

   Our theory is also helpful in explaining several recent empirical findings mentioned

above, including the widespread low levels of measured financial knowledge in the U.S.

and around the world. Our model has predictions about why some population sub-groups

are ill-informed, particularly those anticipating larger old-age social insurance benefits. This

also would imply that nations promising higher levels of old-age benefits will also be those

with lower population levels of financial knowledge. And finally, our model helps explain

why financial education programs may not appear to generate large behavioral changes,

particularly for those finding it suboptimal to invest in financial knowledge.

   In sum, we have shown that allowing for different levels of financial knowledge early in


                                              32
life has important implications for how much people will save. Adding financial knowledge to

life cycle models permits a more accurate rendering of a world where consumers must cope

with complex financial markets and must save so as to provide for their own retirement.

Incorporating these more realistic features in life cycle models will permit us to better

understand empirical regularities, make predictions for the future, and provide more accurate

policy recommendations. An important task for future research would be to obtain evidence

on differential returns over the life cycle, to confirm the exact form of the financial knowledge

production function.

Figure 1: Life Cycle Net Household Income Profiles by Educational Attainment.
This figure shows median net household income by education group computed from the
PSID for waves 1980-1999 (in $2004; see text). The term <HS refers to households where
the head has less than a high school diploma, HS means the head completed high school, and
College+ means the head had some college. The figure adjusts for cohort effects based on
median regressions with age controls; predictions are for those born 1935-1945. Age profiles
are smoothed using a lowess filter.

Figure 2: Life Cycle Wealth by Educational Attainment. This figure shows median
wealth profiles by education group, from the PSID (in $2004; see text). The curves are
predicted from median regressions with a correction for cohort effects (following French,
2005); wealth refers to the sum of assets minus debt. Wealth is predicted for all persons
born 1935-1945; age profiles are smoothed using a lowess filter.

Figure 5: Decomposition of Wealth Inequality at Retirement by Education Group.
This figure reports the simulated median wealth-to-lifetime income ratios expressed as a ratio
of the College+ to those with no high school (<HS). The top bar accounts only for differences
in uncertain lifetime income and medical expenditures; all other differences across education
groups are suppressed and all education groups use the values for those who finished high
school. Subsequent bars then progressively add mechanisms that can generate dispersion
in asset ratios. The second bar adds a realistic consumption floor. For the third bar, we
add differences in replacement rates by education group. The fourth bar includes differences
in household size over the life cycle. The fifth bar incorporates mortality differences by
education. The bottom bar adds the impact of financial knowledge accumulation.

Table 3: Simulation Results of Policy Experiments. This table summarizes outcomes
from simulations at the time of retirement in three scenarios. The first lowers retirement
income by 20%; the second lowers means-tested benefits from $10,000 to $5,000. The last
scenario provides a boost of 25 units of financial knowledge at age 25 for all consumers; here,
we compute the initial wealth equivalent at age 25 that would make the average consumer
at baseline as well-off in terms of utility, compared to the scenario where he inherits 25 units
of financial literacy. See Figure 1 and Table 2 for definitions.
