                  Wage Expectations in the Labor Market
                      Survey Evidence on Rationality


                              ABSTRACT




     Using a new set of directly observed wage expectations among firms, this

paper finds that in general firms' forecasts fail the unbiasedness and efficiency

requirements of weak—form rational expectations. These market participants

consistently underestimate the wages they actually end up paying, and their

expectations do not efficiently utilize the information in past realizations.

The mean absolute forecast error of two percent compares with an error of only

five percent if static expectations were held. The major source of wage fore-

cast error seems to be errors in predicting demand, rather than in predicting

supply or the general price level. Wage forecast errors are positively correlated

across fields with distinct supply patterns, and are positively correlated with

quantity forecast error. The properties of stochastically weighted expectations

and the effectiveness of the wage and price controls of the early 1970's are

also discussed.

      In much of the recent economic literature, expectations play a role akin to

that of the higher being in theological discussions: commanding the center of

attention, powerfully affecting events, but rarely revealing itself directly. With

only scant or indirect empirical evidence, economists have fallen back on rules of

thumb such as "rational expectations (R.E.) may be a reasonable assumption for

financial markets but a tenuous one for labor markets". Survey evidence of

expectations in the financial market have been studied elsewhere1 and a useful

summary of the methodology is presented in Friedman (1980). This paper shall

examine survey evidence of expectations in the labor market.

      The effectiveness of monetary policy in Phillip's curve type trade—off s

depends critically on the rationality of firms and workers. Do agents on the demand

side of a competitive market that meets annually have or develop R.E.? If there is

systematic error in their forecasts of market wages, is it due to errors in forecasting

demand or supply, or to misjudging the general price level that will prevail? How

has inflation affected their accuracy? These are all questions that must be

answered empirically before we can judge the distortions caused by inflation, and the

real effects of monetary policy- on labor markets.

      This paper uses a new set of directly observed wage expectations among market

participants. Section I will test the unbiasedness and efficiency properties of

these observed expectations. The sources of observed forecast error will be

analyzed in section II, followed by the conclusion.



Section I. Tests of Weak—Form Rationality

      Every year large firms hire inexperienced college graduates in competitive

markets. The supply to these markets is largely determined four years previously —

the   time it typically requires to earn a Bachelors degree. Since 1948, Frank

Endicott of Northwestern University has published the results of his annual survey

of employers' wage expectations. The survey of about 170 large and medium sized
                                                                                       2.

 corporations is conducted in November, calling for half—year ahead forecasts of the

 monthly starting wages of inexperienced college graduates by field of specialty,
                                     2
 as well as data on past realizations . Together these firms comprise a substantial

 force in the market, hiring about one—seventh of all new engineers for example.

 The statistical properties of the Endicott data are discussed in Appendix A.

      The statistical tests of this section will show that employers' expectations

are not far from the mark, hut that in six of the eight fields tested these

expectations fail the unbiasedness and efficiency requirements of weak form

rationality. These basic results are generally in accord with those of Turnovsky

and Wachter (1972), who reject the hypothesis of R.E. among the Livingston sample

concerning the average weekly wage in manufacturing. On the other hand, In the

Endicott sample of market participants I do find evidence of rational expectations

of wages In some more disaggregated markets.3 While the wage forecast error is

small in absolute size, less than two percent of the actual wage on average, it is

significant. For comparison, if firms naively held static expectations, the

worst they would do would be a forecast error of five percent. The mean absolute

error in a slmle regresion on trend in the full sample of realizations is only

about one percent.

      Rational expectations are tested in Table 1 by regressing the realized

wage on the wage that had been predicted:

(1)
                          Wta+b t_1+e
If agents have R.E., then a=O and b=1; the expected wage is an unbiased predictor

of the actual wage. F—tests accept this null—hypothesis in the fields of sales,

chemistry and mathematics, but reject it in the other five fields. In accord

with R.E., there is no significant evidence of autocorrelated errors in any of

the fields. On average, firms repeatedly underestimate what they will actually

end up paying in all eight fields.

      Implicit in this discussion is the firm's loss function for errors in

forecasting wages. The unbiasedness tests in Table 1 employ two alternative
                                                                                       3.




 assumptions: that firms optimize their forecasts for 1) the linear wage, or for

 2) the log wage. By Jensen's Inequality, an unbiased forecast of some variable X

will in general be a biased forecast of a convex non—linear function of X. Rather

than conduct a random search over non—linear functions, I have taken the log of

wages as a plausible candidate.   If firms optimized their forecasts for the log of

wages, they need not exhibit R.E. in linear wages even if they do in log wages.

Table 1 shows evidence of this in only one case. Since the rest of the unbiasedness

results are unchanged by taking the log transformation, the remainder of this paper

shall refer to the linear form only.

     It is worthwhile looking in more detail at the case of engineering, where

firms' expectations are farthest from the mark. The cob—web supply structure and

sensitivity to demand shocks of this market have been studied by Freeman (1976).

Engineering is among the fields with the most volatile supply, as measured by the

coefficient of variation of its share in total degrees. But it is also the one

field where enrollment data is systematically collected, so the information needed

to forecast supply six months or three years ahead is readily available4. Yet

employers consistently err in their wage forecasts.

     Note that employers seem to have R.E. in some fields with cob—web structure,

such as chemistry and mathematics, but fail in liberal—arts, accounting and business

where supply is smoother and no evidence of the more complicated cob—web supply

structure has been found (Freeman and Leonard 1978). Supply variation, as indicated

by the existence of cob—web supply, does not appear to be the dividing line between

fields in which employers do or do not exhibit R.E. These results indicate that if

employers understand how wages are determined, then either they cannot predict supply

even in fields dominated by simple trend growth, or they cannot accurately predict

industry demand six months ahead. Alternatively, they may be able to predict real

market clearing wages, but fail to forecast the general price level. Section II

will examine the sources of this forecast error in more detail.

      Firms that predict wages for a number of Eields may be able to form more

efficient forecasts by exploiting the cross—field error structure. The appropri-

ate test of joint unbiasedness in this case would be Zeliner's (1962) seemingly

unrelated regression procedure, presented in Table 2. The test statistic A,

which is — 2 times the log of the Likelihood ratio, allows us to reject the

null hypothesis of joint unbiasedness, a=o and b=l, across all eight fields

for the sample period 1965 to 1978 at the 90% confidence level, and across the

four fields withrequisite data for the slightly longer period 1962 to 1978 at

the 99% confidence level.

      To be rational, expectations must not only be unbiased, they must also

efficiently use the available information. In particular, expectations and

realizations should identically incorporate the information contained in past

realizations (see Pesando 1975). In the specification that

valid. Nullineaux (1978) suggests subtracting (3) from (2) yielding:

    Under the null hypothesis, all the coefficients should equal zero, and there

should be no autocorrelation of the errors. Choosing N to minimize the standard

error of (3), F—tests allow the rejection of the null—hypothesis of R.E. in all

fields except chemistry and mathematics. The evidence against efficiency in

Table 3 is weaker for economics, which fails the Mullineaux type test, but passes

a Chow test for equality of coefficients. Note also in Table 3 that the forecast

errors in engineering, liberal—arts and sales are not orthogonal to past actual

wages: direct evidence against R.E.

     In this section I have presented the results of two separate tests of weak—form

R.E.: unbiasedness and efficiency. Two of the eight fields, chemistry and

mathematics, pass both tests. If the fields are considered independent Bernoulli

trials, then we can state at a 75 percent level of confidence that employers do not

have rational expectations.

     While in general employers' expectations are significantly different than

those required by R.E., it is arguable whether it would profit any firm to invest

in the information needed to improve the accuracy of these forecasts. When past

actual wages could be used to improve forecasting as noted above, it is difficult

to justify why firms do not use them efficiently, since the information is presuma-

bly at hand and the processing nearly costless. The same argument holds for

correcting the bias in forecasts. That firms find it costly to err in their wage

forecasts can be inferred from a simple market test: from the long and profitable

existence of consulting firms that survive by performing compensation surveys of

professionals, including new hires, and selling the results, the obvious conclusion

is that other firms are willing to pay to be told what market wages are or will be.

This is not implausible, given the developed planning and budgeting mechanism in

firms today.   If a firm offers too little, it risks encountering delay and difficulty
                                                                                         6.


in filling its openings, or getting poor quality workers with higher training and

turnover costs. If it offers too much, it will get locked into paying more than

it needed to. For a firm hiring 100 engineers whose market clearing wage is

$25,000, the mean absolute error of 2 percent found in the sample translates into

an overpayment of $50,000 in the first year. The resulting compression of the wage

structure is likely to create upward pressure on the wages of other employees in

the firm. In the following section I demonstrate some of the other data that could

be used to improve wage forecasts at little cost to the firm.



Section II. The Sources of Forecast Error

     Why do employers err in their forecasts? Should we be surprised that their

expectations are not rational? It would be troubling if in practice employrs were

not predicting a supply that had been largely fixed four years earlier. It would

be slightly more comforting to know they erred in forecastig market demand or

inflation six months ahead. This section tries to determine whether employers

erroneously forecast wages because of errors in predicting supply or demand or

the general price level. The underlying assumption is that employers understand

that real wages in a competitive market are determined by supply and demand.

     Consider the following simple model of the labor market for new college

graduates. The market demand for graduates in the         i'th   field in year t   is:

5) Nit =    i
           a. + b. ii Gt + b.12 X. — b.i3W.it/Pt + e.it
                                    it



                where
                  Nit = number       demanded

                        = common component of demand across fields.


                 X.     = demand shift term for field i
                  it

                W.,/P
                        =   real   wage
                                                                                                 7.




        Market supply is given by:



6) Nt =          +               + i2              + vit



                where

                 Dt
                            common supply component across fields

                        =    real   wage, lagged four years.



        Modelling the supply of college graduates as a function of past wages is

theoretically and empirically justified in Freeman (1976), and in Freeman and Leonard

(1978). Solving this recursive structure for real wages yields



            =                -   a.) +

Assume that the errors are independently identically distributed with mean zero.


       As noted in the previous section, firms consistently underestimate aáross time

and fields the nominal wages they end up paying. There are three ways this may

occur in the above model.

        1) The firms underestimate the price level, P.

        2) The firms overestimate D, the common component of supply.

     or 3) The firms underestimate G, the common component of demand.

       For example, if firms underestimate C by the amount G' then


8)     t*i,t_1 =     Etl(t)         -     C'
                                                                                8.



               where E 1(W.     is the mathematical expectation of eq. 3 and
                      t    1,
                                                       —b.
               and the wage forecast error is simply          G'.
                                                         i3

      If errors in projecting G are the only errors the firms make, then wage fore-

 cast errors across firms will be perfectly correlated. In addition, if firms

 underestimate demand, then both the actual wage and the actual number of hires

 will be greater than expected, due to movement up the supply curve. The evidence

 I shall present in this section suggests that errors in forecasting demand are

 the major source of wage forecast error.

      In the Endicott Survey, employers forecast not only the wages they expect to

 pay six months in the future, but also the number of people they expect to hire

 at that wage. Since the expected market clearing wages are not greatly dispersed,

 the quantities demanded by each firm are summed to give a rough estimate of market

demand5. If employers know the true demand, but err in predicting supply, then

I expect to observe a negative correlation between wage forecast error and quantity

forecast error. Alternatively, if the market supply schedule were known to all

employers six months ahead but demand were a mystery, wage forecast error would be

positively correlated with the quantity forecast error6. For example, let firms

expect a demand curve shifted further out than actually prevails. This will

intersect the known supply curve at a higher wage and a higher quantity than

actually occurs— yielding the positive correlation. Empirically, such demand

surprises seem to dominate the market. Although the quantity data is not very

reliable7, quantity forecast errors are positively correlated with wage forecast

errors in three of the four fields for which the requisite data was available for

the period 1962 to 1978. For accounting, the correlation coefficient was .77,

for sales .63, for engineering .47, and for business —.13.

     This evidence of demand side surprises is reinforced by the positive

correlation of forecast errors across fields in Table 4. Since the supply cycles
                                                                                   9.


 of the various fields are distinct (Freeman
                                                and Leonard 1978), and in some cases
 the fields are substitutes, the correlation of forecast errors across fields would

 be due to a common supply shock if firms
                                             were ignorant of massive demographic changes,
 which is unlikely. The evidence again points to common errors across firms in

 forecasting market demand.

      I obtain a clear picture of the source of wage forecast error by testing for

 the orthogonality of the error to past information that is readily available. The

 theory of R.E. states that forecast errors should be uncorrelated with such informa-

 tion. In all eight fields wage forecast error is orthogonal to real wage lagged

 four or five years— a key variable
                                      determining supply. Similarly, with the
 exceptions of sales and chemistry, forecast error is orthogonal to the number of

 graduates lagged one year. Engineering, however, tells a different story. A

 substantial portion of engineering supply is determined by freshman year enrollments.

 This information is made available by the
                                             Engineering Manpower Commission, facilita-
 ting supply forecasts three years ahead. Yet the firms in the Endicott sample

do not appear to use this information to form
                                                 unbiased forecasts. I find a signi-
ficant negative correlation between engineering enrollments three or four years

previously and current forecast error. This is consistent with a world in which

employers are surprised by a shift in supply that occured four years ago.

     Surprisingly, the wage forecast error is not significantly correlated with

the current or past year's rate of inflation, so there is no strong evidence that

misperceptions of inflation account for the forecast error8.    The absolute accuracy
of the forecasts has declined in recent
                                          years. In engineering business and liberal
arts the error is significantly correlated with last
                                                       year's price level. This,
however, suggests a simple scale effect: the larger the level of nominal wages,

the larger the error.

     Lucas (1976) and others have argued that if
                                                   monetary policy is perfectly
anticipated, it will be matched by price level changes and have no real effects.

Barro (1978) has presented empirical support for this model, showing that real

output changes were correlated with unexpected monetary policy, while price

level changes may be explained by anticipated monetary policy. To corroborate this

rational expectations model, I would need to find that wage forecast error was

correlated only with that part of monetary policy which was unanticipated. I find

that with the exception of engineering, wage forecast error is orthogonal to

expected money supply, and curiously, to unexpected money supply as defined by

Barro (1978). It is implausible that firms that have difficulty forecasting

demand in their labor markets could accurately predict inflation and monetary policy,

particularly that part of money supply that Barro defines as unexpected. A more

plausible interpretationis that monetarypolicy affects the wage and price level

only with long lags, so that actual market wages as well as expectations are little

affected by current monetary policy.

     Even if perfectly anticipated, inflation creates what some companies consider

real problems of adjustment. ". . . the inflationary trend of wages in general. . . (has)

                                                                                   will

force reductions in the number of college graduates we can hire." The first quote

is from the 1953 Endicott Report, the second is from 1979. Starting wages are

 typically more responsive to market pressures than are the wages of established

workers. Employers may forecast starting wages in line with established wage

 structures, which would help explain why they have consistently underestimated

 actual starting wages during the past twenty years of inflation.

      How did employers wage expectations react to the wage and price controls imposed

 during the early seventies? Such controls are sometimes recommended as the only

 policy short of inducing a recession that can reduce inflationary expectations,

 albeit at the cost of reduced economic efficiency. The Endicott data shows that
                                                                               11.



 in November, 1971, before wage—price guidelines had been firmly established

 following the freeze of August 15, 1971, firms expected wages to increase by only

 one percent over their 1971 levels. This decline in expected wage growth is not

 solely due to the freeze, since actual and expected wage growth had already slowed

 significantly prior to the freeze. In November of 1970 fIrms expected wage growth

 of only two percent, as expectations reacted quickly to the slowing of actual

 wage growth. Three years later, rather than expecting a burst of wage inflation

 with the phase—out of controls, firms were predicting only a three percent

 increase,below the guidelines and below the actual five percent increase that

 occured during 1974. While controls were in place, wage expectations did not become

 significantly more accurate, perhaps because although particular controls did

 limit wage growth, controls policy itself was unstable during this period.


    Finally, if one wants a rule of thumb to describe wage expectations, they seem

to be extrapolative in these market   .   In   contrast to Turnovsky and Wachter's results,

in this data set the extraolative model fits the observed expectations better than

the adaptive expectations model does, with an adjusted R—squared of .99.

     In sum these results suggest that firms would fall short of the requirements

of R.E. even in a world without changing inflation rates. It appears that employers

err in forecasting wages for the most part because they err in predicting demand.



Section III. Conclusion

     Expectations play such an important role in economic theory that the scant

direct empirical evidence available bears considerable interest. The evidence from

the Endicott Survey of market participants tells a mixed story, allowing the

acceptance of the rational expectations hypothesis in two of the eight fields tested.

Employers appear to err in forecasting market demand six months ahead,

and do not efficiently utilize a supply indicator set four years previously in

engineering. All of this suggests the usefuliness of further empirical study of

the formation of expectations.

Appendix A. The Statistical Properties of Weighted Averages


       The Endicott Report has published only weighted averages of actual

and expected wages since 1965. These are the wage data used in this paper.

The weighted average is given by




      where N. = # of people to be hired by firm i

                   =
                       average wage to be paid by firm i

                                                N.
       for notational simplicity let Z = ______
                                                     N.
                                                      1
                                               1=1



       The null-hypothesis of R.E. requires that E(W.) =          W   for all i, where

W is the realization and         is the prediction.       We want to investigate the

statistical properties of W and compare them to those of the unweighted

average W, where
                       J
                            W.
                             1
                        J
                                                                                               14

  A stochastic weighted average of the W. will be equal in expectation to W if

  and only if the covariance of the Z. and W. is zero because:

                                     J
                                =    E   EZ.W.
                                                 11
                                     J
                                =    E   [E(Z.)E(w.) +       COV(Z.,W)]

                                =   W    +
                                             J*CQV(ZW)
                                                   11
 The bias of the weighted average equals J *
                                             COV(Z.,W.).                  I argue that it
 is reasonable to assume that COV(Z.,W.) = 0 in the Endicott data since the
                                   1 1
 scale of demand by field differs greatly across firms - some hire no engineers,

 others hire hundreds. This scale effect probably dominates the negative

 covariaflce one might expect between quantity and wage from movement along a

 demand durve. Under the assumption that COV(Z.,W) = 0, if the null-hypothesis

E(W.) =   W   is true then E(W) =    W   is also true.

     If one does not accept the assumption that COV(Z.,W.) =
                                                                             0, then the
bias of the forecasts =      J*COV(Z.,wi),             If COV(Z.,W.) < 0, because of shifts

along the demand curve for example, thenwe expect the weighted average to

underestimate the realization, the bias increasing with the number of firms.

Such would be the case if our sample consisted of firms that differed only

in their expectation of future wages.

     Empirically this does not appear to be a major source of error.                  By the
above argument E(W) < E(W).         In fact I find the opposite. During the years

1962 to 1964 for which both series are available, I find that the mean weighted

expectation, ,     is   greater than the mean unweighted expectation,W, by six dollars,

pooling across engineering, accounting, business and sales.
                                                                                      15



      Further tests also support the validity of the use of weighted
                                                                     expecta-
 tions in this sample. Replicating the unbiasedness tests with unweighted

 expectations changes the result only in the field of business. For the

 fields for which requisite data is
                                      available, the F-statistics against the null-
 hypothesis a=o and b=l are engineering:
                                            93.6, accounting: 67.9, business: 0.6,
 and sales: 0.06. Thse tests
                                 are not directly comparable with those of
 Table 1 since the weighted sample includes
                                                 the inflation plagued 19701s while
 the unweighted observations are forl9S4
                                            to 1964. Similarly, the result of
 the cross-field correlation of forecast
                                            error is essentially unchanged: all
 four fields have positively correlated
                                           wage forecast errors. In most cases
 the correlation is greater. As
                                  an additional test, I pool time-series data
 for the above four fields for the year 1962 to 1964 during which weighted

and unweighted expectations are reported. F-tests do not reject the null-

hypothesis of equality of coefficients at the .01 level when actual wages

are regressed on weighted or unweighted
                                           expected wages. All of this suggests
that the results reported in the text are not affected by the use of
                                                                     weighted
expectations.

     If firms that hire more people invest
                                                 more in information to improve
their forecasts, then the weighted average will have a lower variance than

the unweighted average, and may have a lower mean-squared_error. If the

precision of    is directly proportional to N. then


                      Variance    (1J) =    k
                                            J
                                            E    N.
                                                  1
                                           1=1
                                                                          16




                         which is strictly less than




                                 Variance (W) = K *
                                                       Ji

                         where k is an arbitary constant.



        So, assuming constant bias over time, the efficiency and ortho—

gonality tests in this paper are not adversely affected by the use

of weighted averages.

1. Empirical work on price and interest rate expectations has been done by Friedman,

Gibson, Mullineaux, Pyle, Turnovsky, and Turnovsky and Wachter. Turnovsky and Wachter

also tested wage expectations, rejecting rational and simple adaptive and extrapolative

models of expectations. With the exception of Friedman, all of these authors used the

Livingston expectations data.



2. The actual question asked on the 1978 Endicott Survey is: "The table on the

following page has been designed to gather information regarding the number of

beginning college graduates, both men and women, recruited by your company last

year and the number to be recruited during the next twelve months. We are in-

terested in hirings at the bachelor's level and also at the Master's level.   In

addition, you are asked to indicate average starting rates for graduates of 1978

classes and to estimate, as realistically as possible, what the average starting

rates will be for 1979 graduates. By average starting salary, we mean actual first—

month gross earnings. In estimating starting salaries for 1979, please indicate

what you think the average will be at the end of the season, taking into account past

trends, inflation, and possible competition for the best qualified graduates in

certain fields."



3. To the extent that firms can set wages they will trivially fulfill the requirements

of R.E. However, wages do seem to clear these markets and unemployment is typically

low. As evidenced by College Placement Council Data, wage offers do change during

the course of a recruiting season.
                                                                                20.


4. Before 1965 enrollment data was collected and published by the U.S. Office of

Education. In a notable case of the private market stepping in to serve a function

that government had ceased to fulfill, the Engineering Manpower Commission of the

Engineers Joint Council has collected engineering enrollment data since 1965.



5. More strictly, I only observe directly the average of each firm's expectation

of a point on its own demand curve. It is possible for a few firms to expect high

market demand and report the resulting high wages driving the firm up its own un-

changed demand curve. While this may be true for a few firms that do not expect

their demand to shift with market demand, it cannot be consistent behavior for the

market as a whole. If the firms expect high market demand, then in a representative

sample, the average of each firm's own expected demand at a given wage will indicate

market demand. In any case, the arguments in the text are more striking if they are

interpreted simply as each firm wrongly predicting its own demand, which should be

easier than predicting market demand.



6. Here we relax the assumption that supply responds only to past, not current, real

wage.



7. Actual and expected hires are reported for different samples and so are not

strictly comparable.   I used average hires per firm.



8. Wage forecast error is not in general significantly correlated with errors in

forecasting the inflation rate as measured by the Livingston data. This suggests that

firms have difficulty predicting the real wage rate. Direct evidence of employers'

inflation rate expectations from the Endicott Report for 1965, 1976, and 1978 are

.10, .08, and .08, which compare with the actual rates of change of the GNP price

deflator of .09, .05, and .09 respectively.

8. While the extrapolative model in which expectations are given as a function of

the past two years realizations is the best rule of thumb, the S.E.E. is typically

minimized in a regression that includes the actual wage lagged three years.
