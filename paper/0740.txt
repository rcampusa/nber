               The Effective Tax Rate and the Pretax Rate of Return



                                     ABSTRACT



     This paper presents new estimates of the taxes paid on nonfinancial
corporate capital, on the pretax rate of return to capital, and on the
effective tax rate. The basic time series show that both the pretax rate
of return and the effective tax rate have varied substantially in the past
quarter century.
     An explicit analysis indicates that, after adjusting for different
aspects of the business cycle, pretax profitability was between one and
1.5 percentage points lower in the l970's than in the l960's. The rate of
profitability in the l960's was also about one—half of a percentage point
greater than the profitability in the 7 years of the l950's after the
Korean war.

     Changes in productivity growth, in inflation, in relative unit labor
costs, and in other variables are all associated with changes in
                                                                 profitability.
None of these variables, however, can explain the differences in profitability
between the l950Ts, l960's and l970's.

     Looking at broad decade averages, the effective tax rate and the
pretax rate of return move in opposite directions, higher
                                                         pretax profits
occurring when the tax rate is high. There thus appears to have been no
tendency for pretax profits to vary in a way that offsets differences in
effective tax rates.

 Section 1 then examines whether there has been a trend in profitability in the
 postwar   period   or a tendency for profits to decline in the 1970's. Several fac-
 tors   that are potential determinants of corporate profitability, including pro-

 ductivity and the ratio of final product prices to intermediate input prices and

 unit labor costs, are      then examined in section 5. There   is no evidence   that the
 broad fluctuations in the effective tax rate over the past 25 years      induced off-

 setting changes    in the pretax rate of return. Changes in the effective tax rate

were therefore associated with correspondingly large changes in the net rate of

return.


1. State and Local Taxes Paid by Nonfinancial Corporations

            In measuring corporate profits, the national income and product

accounts treat state and local property taxes very differently from the profits
taxes levied by all levels of government.1 Pretax profits are defined as profits
before   corporate income taxes but after all of the state and local property

taxes paid by   corporations.     We believe that this method is conceptually

incorrect and that it significantly distorts the measurement of the national

rate of return on additions to the stock of corporate capital.2

           Although   all   of the taxes paid by corporations are costs from the pri-
vate   viewpoint of the shareholders, these taxes do not represent social costs.

1 The term "property tax" refers to taxes levied on the value of physical assets
  while "profits taxes" are levied on the income generated from these assets.
2 The national income accounting convention of treating property taxes as a cost
   of production rather than as a tax on capital appears to be based on
  accepting the business accounting convention that the property tax is a
  "cost" because it is subtracted in calculating business profits; see Ruggles
  and Ruggles, 1956. A further reason offered in defense of the conventional
  national income accounting method is that the property tax is "an indirect
  tax" and therefore presumably has a very different incidence than the direct
  capital income taxes; see Ruggles and Ruggles, 1970. We believe that the
  property tax and the tax on profits cannot usefully be distinguished in
  eit?ier of these ways.

            This   paper presents new estimates of the pretax rate of return on non—

financial corporate capital in the United States and on the effective rate of

tax paid on that return. We then use these estimates to examine whether there

                            decline in the rate of return and to study the sources
has been any   systematic
of variation in profitability. Our      estimates   of the rate of profit during the

past quarter century use the most recent national income account revisions and
                                                          and the Federal Reserve
the latest estimates by the Department of Commerce

Board   of the stocks of reproducible capital and land. In      addition, we have

developed our own estimates of the property tax paid by nonfinancial cor-

porations to state and local governments, a significant component both of

taxes and of pretax profits that was omitted in all        previous   studies.

            These estimates of property taxes and their implications for the pre-

tax rate   of return are discussed in the first two sections of the paper. The
effective   tax rate reflects the taxes paid by corporations, their shareholders

and their creditors to governments at all levels.         Section 3 of the paper

discusses the estimation of these taxes and the implied behavior of the effec-

tive tax rate.

  Similarly, the taxes paid by business to state and local governments do not

  represent charges for benefits received. From
                                                   the national viewpoint, the
  marginal product of capital is therefore the total addition to national
                                                                          output
  and not that addition net of the taxes levied on capital or
                                                              capital income.
  A correct measure of capital
                               productivity therefore requires adding the state
 and local property taxes to the national income measure of
                                                            pretax income.1 This
 section presents alternative estimates of he state and local
                                                              property taxes
 paid by nonfinancial corporations.

           In 1979, state and local
                                      governments collected more than $32 billion
 in taxes on the capital or capital income of nonfinancial
                                                             corporations This
 includes the state personal income
                                      taxes on the dividends of shareholders as
 well as the state and local taxes
                                     on corporate property and profits.   State and
 local taxes on the capital income
                                     of nonfinancial corporations now exceed 17

percent of real pretax capital income and 70 percent of that income net of
                                                                           all
federal, state and local taxes. It is clear
                                                from these figures alone that
recognizing state and local taxes is important
                                                  for calculating the total effec-
tive tax rate on capital income as well as for assessing the
                                                             pretax rate of
return on corporate capital.

          Nonfinancial corporations pay two types of state and local taxes that

are based on capital or capital income:
                                           corporate profits taxes and property
taxes. Since there are no official
                                      estimates of either type of tax paid by non-
financial corporations we now describe our own method of
                                                            estimation.

 This expanded pretax profits differs from the social product of
 there are externalitites, economic                              capital if
                                    rents, nonconstant returns to scale, or
 monopoly power. This distinction will be ignored in the current
                                                                  paper.
                                          14_

            The total corporate profits tax accruals of state and local govern-

ments for all types of corporations is calculated by the Department of Commerce

and published in the National Income and Product Accounts.1 The value for 1919

was $13.0 billion. We divide this amount between nonfinancial and financial

corporations in the same ratio as the federal corporate income tax accruals are

divided between these two types of corporations. In 1979, for example, non-

financial corporations accounted for 80 percent of total federal corpcrate tax

liabilities.2 On the basis of this information, we estimate that the state and

local corporate tax liability for nonfinancial corporations was $10.14 billion.

Similar values forother years since 19148 are shown in column 1 of Table 1.

Note that the tax rose from only $1.1 billion in 1960 to $2.8 billion in 1910

and$l0.14 billion in 1979.

            The total value of state and local property tax collections appears

in the national income and product accounts (Table 3) but no distinction is made

between the taxes levied on the property of nonfinancial corporations and the

taxes levied on the property of households, unincorporated businesses and financial

corporations. The total state and local property tax receipts for 1979 were    $614.14


billion. Because calculating the share of property taxes levied on nonfinancial

corporations is difficult, we present three different estimates based on three

different assumptions. All three estimates are based on the Department of

Commerce series of the replacement value of stocks of reproducible physical assets



1 Table 3.14 of the NIPA contains a detailed breakdown of state and local govern—
    inent receipts.

2 The total corporate profits tax liability is reported in Table B-l9 of the
  1981 Economic Report while the corresponding figure for nonfinancial cor-
    porations   is reported in Table B—il. The Department of Commerce follows the
•   same procedure, based on the NFC's share of federal profits, for allocating
    state and which
              local include
                    profits federal,
                            taxes. Therefore,  the profits tax liabilities data
                                     state and local taxes, reflect the share of    NFC
    reported,
    federal profit    taxes in total profit taxes.

     For 1979, the total value (including that           jurisdictions differ in their
   institutions) was $58I3 billion. State and local
                                   conservative, we exclude inventories from the
   treatment of inventories to be
                                   fraction of property taxes assigned to nonfinan-
   tax base and thereby reduce the
   cial corporations.
 3 Including inventories would raise the total taxable capital stock by $655
                                              corporations, the increase would be
   billion to $6281 billion; for nonfinancial    definition would raise the share
   $539 billion to $2250 billion. This expanded
                                      from 0.30 to 0.36. This may seem a
   of nonfinancial corporate property
   surprisingly small share of capital owned by NFCs; most of the remaining
   property is housing (i percent) and agricultural land (8 percent).
                                           —7—

  property or agricultural land'; this implies that nonfinancial corporations bear

  more than a proportionate share of the total property tax. The variation in

  effective tax rates among jurisdictions could
                                                   either strengthen this tendency or
  reverse it. Because of this uncertainty, we present three separate

  calculations. The first assigns property taxes in the same ratio as the value

  of the property; if the variation in tax rates among jurisdictions is uncorre—

  lated with the mix of property
                                   types, this "equal tax assignment is a conser-
 vative understatement of the property tax paid by non—financial corporations.

 The second method assumes that the effective tax rate on nonfinancial corporate

 property is three times the effective tax rate
                                                   on other property.2 The third
 method assumes the opposite imbalance: the effective tax rate on other property

 is three times the rate on the property on non—financial corporations. (The

 second and third calculations are almost certain to bound the true value.) For

 1919, these two assumptions imply that nonfinancial corporations may
                                                                        pay   as much
 as 56.7 percent of the total state and local
                                                 property tax or as little as 12.7
percent.

           Column 4 of Table 1 reports the total state and
                                                           local property tax
collections while columns 5, 6, and 7 report the property taxes assigned to

nonfinancial corporations by the three assumptions. Note that the basic
                                                                         assuinp—
tion of method 1 (i.e., the assumption that nonfinancial corporations
                                                                      pay the
same effective tax rate as other property owners)
                                                     implies that NFCs paid $19.6
billion in property taxes during 1979.


  The effective tax rate has two
                                  components: the assessment—price ratio and the
  tax rate on assessed value. The 1977 Census of Governments Taxable Property
  Values and Assessment—Sales Price Ratios
                                            reports the assessment price ratio on
  commercial and industrial property to be higher than that on any other class of
  property. Netzer's (1973) comments indicate that the equal effective tax rate
  assumption probably understates the taxation of business
                                                            property.
2 This
       implies that, for 1979, nonfinancial corporations paid 56. ercent of
  the property tax even though they 'only had 30.4 percent of taxable property.

2.   Expanded Profits and the Rate of Return on Capital

            Several recent studies have estimated
                                                    the total pretax return to capi-

                                      the effects of inflation on the traditional
tal with appropriate adjustment for
                                   income.1 The common procedure in all of these
accounting measures of corporate

studies is to define total capital income as the sum
                                                         of   (1) corporate interest

                                                                         and
payments and (2) corporate profits with a capital consumption adjustment

            valuation adjustment.2 The   rate of profit is then calculated as the
inventory
                                                                           the
ratio of this measure of total capital income to the replacement value of
                                                                       and land.3

This rate of profit is the marginal product of capital if

  of   land. The capital stock is defined on a ttnetU basis1 and capital income is

  defined in the corresponding way.

                Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 present this conventional measure of total

 corporate      income and the implied net rate of   return. 2    Column 3 expands the
 measure   of   total corporate income by including the estimate of the state and

 local property taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations on the assumption of

 equal effective rates of property tax on all types of property, i.e. , column 3

 is the sum     of   column 1 of Table 2 plus column 5   of   Table 1. The corresponding

 rate of return, calculated by dividing column 3 by the same capital stock series

 that is used to go from column 1 to column 2, is presented in column )4•

             For the 32 year period from 1948 through 1979, the total pretax rate

 of return (column 4) averages
                               11.5 percent. By contrast, the conventional

 return based on capital income after state and local property tax payments is

only 10.3 percent. The failure to add state and local property taxes back into

the total return to capital caused previous estimates to understate the rate of

return by about 1.2 percentage points or nearly 11 percent. The estimates for

overlapping decades (also shown in Table 2) indicate that this difference has

remained fairly constant over the post—war period with some tendency for a

larger gap in the second half of the period than in the first half.




1 The capital stock is measured net of depreciation in
                                                       contrast to a gross capi-
  tal stock from which scrapping is deducted. All of the estimates in the pre-
  sent paper are therefore comparable to the "net" profitability series in
  Feldstejn and Summers (1977) and not to the "gross" profitability series.
2 These
       figures differ from the rN series in Feldstein and Summers (1977)
 because of data revisions. tta revisions affect the earlier years in the
 series because of the new estimates of the values of land and inventories.

  Columns 5   and   6 present
                          alternative estimates of the net rates of return based on
  the two extreme assumptions about the property tax rate on nonfinancial cor-
  porations and other types of property. The assumption that the non—financial
  corporations pay a property tax rate equal to three times the rate paid on other
  property yields the series shown in column 5 and implies that the conventional
  estimate of the rate of return understates the true value by about 2.2
                                                                         percen-
 tage points. Conversely, the extreme assumption of 'undertaxation' of nonfinan-
 cial corporate property implies that the conventional estimate understates
                                                                            the
 true rate of return by about 0.5
                                     percentage points (column 6). It seems safe to
 conclude that the truth lies somewhere
                                           between these extremes and that the con-
 ventional estimate of the rate of return
                                            has been too low by between one and two
 percentage points, implying that the true value exceeds the conventional esti-

 mate by between 10 and 20 percent.


 3.   Effective Tax Rates
          The effective tax rate on the capital income of nonfinancial cor-
porations depends on the federal, state and local taxes that are paid by the
corporation   itself and by the corporation's shareholders and creditors. These

include the corporate income
                                taxes, the property tax, the personal tax on divi-
dends and capital gains, and the personal and corporate taxes on the interest

income received by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporations.

           In an earlier paper, Feldstein and
                                                  Summers (1979) calculated the
effective tax rate on the capital income
                                           of nonfinancial corporations. In
contrast to previous studies that were limited to the corporate rate, the

Fe1dsteinSuers analysis also included the federal taxes on dividends,
                                                                        capital
gains and interest. They defined
                                 the effective tax rate as the ratio of the
combined tax liability to the real pretax capital income. The present study

            The effective tax rate on dividends depends on the distribution of

  dividends among different classes of investors
                                                    (households, pension funds, life
  insurance companies, etc.) and the average effective tax rate for each class of

  investor. The present study uses the Flow of Funds data on equity ownership to

 distribute dividends among classes of investors for each year since 1953.1

 Brinner and Brooks (1979) have calculated the tax rate on dividends received by

 individuals, inc1udin the state and local taxes; this rate averaged 143.2 per-

 cent for the years 1953 through 1979 and was 149 percent for 1979.2 Individuals

 account for approximately 93 percent of the equity that the Flow of Funds sec-

 tor statements of assets and liabilities
                                            classsify as belonging to "households";
 the remaining thousehold equity is owned by nonprofit organizations

 (foundations, universities, etc.) and trusts.3    We make the conservative assump-
 tion that the dividends received by these "other
                                                    household institutionst' are

                                      recipients, we follow the procedure of

Feldstein and Summers (1979) and assume that insurance companies and banks
                                                                           pay a

                                                      corporations is distri-
   buted in the same way as total equity and that dividends are distributed in
   proportion to total equity. This represents an improvement over Feldstein
   and Summers (1979) where the 1976 pattern of ownership was used to assign
   dividends in all years of the period.
2 To compute the federal tax on dividends, Brinner and
                                                       Brooks constructed a
   weighted average of individual taxrates, using the fraction of dividends
   received by each taxable income class each year and the corresponding statu-
   tory marginal rates. State dividend taxes
                                                are estimated by assuming that the
   marginal rate on dividends is 1.5 times the average state personal tax rate,
   which can be computed from NIPA aggregates. Columns 3 and 4
                                                                  of Appendix

capital gains was raised in a number of ways: the use of the alternative tax was

limited, the value of the loss offset was reduced, the "untaxedt' portion of

capital gains was subject to a minimum tax, and the amount of income qualifying

for the maximum tax on personal services income was reduced. There is no way to

provide an accurate evaluation of the weighted average capital gains tax rate

for each year in our series. In stead, we shall make what we regard as the quite

conservative assumption that households paid an effective rate of tax of only 5

percent on accruing capital gains except during the years 1969 through 1918 when

the rate was 7.5 percent. Insurance companies and banks are taxed at a 30 per-

cent statutory rate on capital gains realizations. We assume an effective rate

of 15 percent on accruing gains because of the effect of deferral. Finally, we

assume that pensions, foreign shareholders, and other "miscellaneous" investors

pay no tax on capital gains. The overall effective tax rate on capital gains

implied by these values was .0L in 1919 and .062 in 1918 (before the tax

change) •1

             The capital gains tax rate must be applied to two kinds of capital

gains: the rise in the real value that results from retained earnings and the

rise in the nominal value that results from the general increase in the price

level. The national income account estimate of retained earnings is deficient

because it ignores the real gain that the equity owners make at the expense of

the creditors. For example at the beginning of 1979 the net debt of nonfinan-

cial corporations2 was $138.2 billion. The 9.9 percent rise in the personal

  gains are realized.

is responsible for only between one percentage point and four percentage points

of the total effective tax rate.

calculate the nominal rise in the value of the capital stock as the product of

the capital stock at the beginning of the year and the rise in the G1P deflator




1 Of course, the equity owners "paid for" some of this gain in the form of
   higher interest rates and,•to that extent, national income account profits
   are lower. The issue here is clarifying the real allocation of the income
   between debt and equity and identifying the way in which this extra component
   of real income is taxed.

3 This real increase in equity value is presented in column 1 of Appendix table
   A—i. We assume that an extra dollar of real retained earnings raises the
   market value of equities by one dollar. This abstracts from year—to—year
   fluctuations in stock market valuation. It also ignores the arguments of
   Auerbach (1918), Bradford (1919) and King (1911) that the capitalization of
                                             of retained earnings to raise share
   future tax liabilities may cause a dollar

 during the year.1 Multiplying this nominal increase in equity values by the

 capital gains tax rate and dividing the product by the adjusted real capital

 income gives the additional tax component shown in column 7 of Table 3. This

 source of tax was responsible for less than 1.5 percentage points of effective

 tax rate until the late l960's but the rise in inflation since then has made

 this a more significant factor.   In the five years ending in 1979, the accrued

 capital gains tax on this nominal increase was equivalent to an average tax on

 total income of     percent.

           The final component of the total effective tax rate is the tax borne

by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporations. Although there are federal,

 state, and in some cases, local taxes on interest income, we follow the very

conservative procedure of including only the federal tax.2 Feldstein and

Summers (1979) used the Flow—of Funds accounts for 1976 to estimate the distri-

bution of the net liabilities of nonfinancial corporations among households,

pensions, commercial banks, savings banks, life insurance companies, government

accounts, and a number of smaller categories. We use the relative weights

implied by this analysis and also follow Feldstein—Summers in setting the house-

hold tax rate on this interest income at 35 percent, the mutual savings bank


   The GNP deflator is too broad an index while the fixed nonresidential invest-
   ment deflator is too narrow (because it excludes inventories and land);
   however both indices rose almost exactly the same amount over the 17 year
   period and behaved quite similarly from year to year. Note that the equity
   owners receive the nominal gain on the entire capital stock and not just on
   the equity fraction. The value of the beginning—of—year capital stock for
   each year, found in the "Balance Sheets" document, is presented in column 8
   of Appendix table A—l. The calculation abstracts from the depressing effect
   on share prices of unanticipated changes in inflation; see Feldstein (1980)
   and the other research cited therein.

2 We do this because of the difficulty of calculating the state and local
   taxes on interest income, especially the taxes paid by financial corporations.

 with existing tax rules and despite

                                            on nonfinancial corporate capital is
 equal to the product of the pretax rate of return on

 contrast with the mid-l96O's is
                                     striking; in the five years from 1963 through
1967, the real net return averaged 6.2

  cation of saving is different from the
                                          average saving pattern. In particular,

 paid, and the denominator, for pre—tax income, of the effective tax rate ratios.

  rises tr about three percentage points.           Conversely, if nonfinancial corporations

  are taxed more lightly than other property (column Ii), the effective tax rate

  falls by about two and one—half percentage points.'

              The last column of Table          ignores state and local taxes completely

 and reports the effective federal tax rate defined as the ratio of the total

 federal tax to the real capital income net of the state and local taxes paid by

 the corporations.2 This effective federal rate shows the same general movement

 over   time as the effective total rate. In the five years ending in 1919, the
 rate averaged 63     percent   —   twelve percentage points higher than in the years
 1963 through 1967.

 3.   Is   the Rate of Profit Falling?

             The   average value of the pretax rate of return was 9.8 percent      in the
1970's and thus substantially lower than the corresponding averages of 12.7

for the 1960's and 11.1 for the period from 1953 to 1959. Does the lower

rate of return in recent years reflect a fundamental fall
                                                                    in the rate of profit
or has it just been a cyclical or temporary change?
          In a previous paper, Feldstein and Summers (1977) attempted to answer
that question with data for a period ending in 1976. That study concluded
                                                                           that
there was no statistical support         for   the view that there had been a gradual

decline in the rate of return over the postwar period but found that the average

return between 1970 and 1976 was some 1 to 2 percent lower than would have been

                                                   2 is independent of the

            The results are very similar to the previous estimate. There is no

  evidence of a general time trend but an indication that the rate of return was

  some two percentage points lower in the l970's than in the previous two decades.

  A higher rate of capacity utilization
                                          tends on average to raise the rate of

  return, each additional percentage point raising the rate of return by about

  one—sixth of a percentage point. Replacing
                                                 the capacity utilization variable
  with the GNP—gap yields very similar results.

           Although capacity utilization (or the GNP—gap) is intended as an indi-
 cation of the economy's cyclical
                                     condition, it actual]y describes only one
 aspect of that cyclical condition. Figure 1 presents a business cycle diagram

 with the amplitude measured in terms of capacity utilization. The use in

 equation .l of capacity utilization as a measure of the economy's cyclical con-

 dition is equivalent to treating points A and B as equivalent even though A




occurs during a business cycle contract ion
                                               (i.e., between a peak and the sub-
sequent trough) while B occurs during a business
                                                    cycle expansion (i.e., between
a trough and the subsequent peak).            research
                                      Early              by Wesley Mitchell (1927,
1951) and others at the National Bureau
                                          of Economic Research suggested that pro-
fits decline during a business cycle contraction and then increase during

An   annual series derived by averaging the quarterly values in each calendar year
is denoted RECOVERY.
                                                                     cycle is likely to

decline. As  the econorrr gets closer to the cyclical peak, there are problems
with bottlenecks, older machinery, less experienced employees, etc. To investi-
gate whether the end of expansion has an effect on profitability that goes
beyond the effect of a high level of capacity utilization, we have created a
variable that measures how close the econosrj is to reaching a cyclical peak. We
create a quarterly series equal to zero during contractions and otherwise equal
to the number of quarters until the peak is reached. The annual average of
 these quarterly values gives the annual variable QTILPK.
           Several other cyclical variables were also examined, including the
 proportion of the year spent      in recession, the number of quarters until a cycli-

 cal trough and an indicator of whether a trough
                                                       occured in the year. None of

                                                                return tends to

 be about two percentage points higher during the first year of the recovery than

 it would otherwise be with the same level of capacity utilization. The coef-

 ficient of the QTILPK variable shows that the rate of return is higher during

 expansion than during contractions (when QTILPK = 0) but that this excess fades

as the econonr gets closer to the peak; each quarter further away from the peak

adds about one tenth of a percentage point.            Capacity utilization continues to be

an important variable; indeed, its coefficient is twice as large in 4.2 as it

was in 4.i when the other cycle variables were not taken into account. The

coefficients of the time trend variable and the dummy variable for the l970's

are also similar to those of equation 4.i, indicating no time trend but a

reduction of about 1.5 percentage points in the l970's.

           The coefficients of equation 4.2 show that the explicit business

cycle variables provide information about the fluctuations in profitability

that are not captured in simpler measures of aggregate demand like capacity

utilization and the GNP cap. As a further test of the usefulness of measuring

activity relative to the business cycle peaks and troughs, we added a four year

distributed lag in the capacity utilization variable. The explicit business

cycle variables are still very significant; the coefficients are more than three

   This specification implies    a ich fter rate of groh of profitability both
   before 1972 (.082 percentage points a year) and even after
                                                              1973 (.029 points a
   year) than the insignificant time
                                       trend of equation 4.2. Like the earlier
   specification, this also implies
                                      a drop in profitability of about
                                                                         1.3 percent in
   addition to the change in the
                                   profitablity trend.
             It should be emphasized that
                                            these three time variables should not be
   extrapolated outside the sample
                                     period. They are really a way of describing
  the complex time pattern
                           of profitability during the 27 year sample and should
  not be given a more structural
                                  interpretation. A useful way of summarizing the
  implication of the three time
                                variables is to evaluate the suni of the three
  effects for each year. The
                              variable constructed in this way shows the pure
  time—related changes in
                          Profitability after excluding the cyclical and raidom
 variations in Profitability.
                                Column 2 of Table 5 presents
                                                              this composite trend
 variable. For comparison,
                             column 1 shows the real net
                                                         return variable. Column
 3 presents the cyclically
                            adjusted rate of return, i.e., the rate of return with
 the three cyclical variables
                               evaluated at their sample means.

           The mean values of the
                                     composite trend variable are a useful   way of
 assessing the extent to which
                                 Profitability declined in the l970's relative to
 earlier years after taking
                              account of cyclical and random fluctuations. For the
period 1953 to 1969, the

                                                                   variable was 1.23;
by contrast, it was —0.06 for
                                 1970 to 1979. This trend
                                                            Profitability was 1.31
percentage points lower in the l970's than in the previous 17
                                                               years. A similar
comparison between the 1960's and
                                  the l970' shows that trend
                                                               profitability was

             Two specifications in addition to the combination of a 1910 level

 shift and 1913 trend shift provided nearly as good an explanation of the profi-

 tability series; all the other specifications covered in our search were con-
 siderably worse. The first of these other two specifications includes a posi-
 tive   level shift in 1969   and a negative trend shift in that same year. The
 second   specification has a negative level shift in 1973 and a negative trend

 shift in 1970. Although the three specifications imply minor differences in the

 timing of the change in profitability, they have very similar implications about

 thechange in profitability between the 1970's and the earlier years of the
 sample. In comparison to the 1.31 percentage point difference implied by
 equation 1.3,   placing both shift   dummies in 1969   implies a difference of 1.25
percentage   points while placing the shift dummies in 1970 and 1973     implies a
difference   of 1.23 percentage points. Similarly, comparing the 1960's and the

1970's shows differences of 1.59 in the specification of equation 1.2 and 1.58

and 1.61 in the other two specifications. The
                                                   cyclically   adjusted profitability
figures shown in column 3 of Table 5 show a similar pattern. For the 1970's as

a whole, the cyclically adjusted profitability was 1.6 percentage points below

the corresponding figures for the 1960's.

             is interesting to note that all three measures of profitability
            It

have changed in the same direction and that the effective tax rate moved in the
opposite direction. The total effective tax rate averaged 69.6 percent in the
l950's, 59.6 percent in the 1960's, and 68.7 percent in the 1970's. There was
obviously   no tendency for the pretax return to rise and fall in parallel to the

effective tax rate in order to dampen    the effect on   the net—of—tax rate of

return. Instead, the two moved in opposite directions and thereby caused pro—

The coefficient'of the productivity growth variable (PRODGRO) implies that each

additional percentage point of productivity growth has associated with it a 0.3

percentage point increase in profitability.

          The lower rate of productivity growth in the 1970's contributed signi-

ficantly to the decline in profitability but zas not responsible for the change

in the composite trend variable. The coefficients of equation 5.1 imply com-

posite trend values of 0.52 for the 1970's, 1.85 for the 1960's and 1.50 for the

entire sample period before 1970. The gap between the profitability of the

1960's and the 1970's is narrowed to 1.32 percentage points while the difference

between the 1970's and all the preceding years is 0.98 percentage points. The

fall in productivity growth from an average of 2.5 in the 1960's to 1.4 in the

1970's decreased profitability by .32 percentage points or about 24 percent of

the overall profitability decline.

          A higher inflation rate can reduce pretax profitability in a variety

of ways. For example, firms may seek greater after—tax profits by investing in

inventories and other assets with more favorable tax treatment. Alternatively,

firms may be misled into making low—profit investments or inappropriate pricing

decisions by accounting calculations that do not correctly adjust for inflation.

  is large and statistically significant (—3.98 with a standard error of 1.21).

 For the 1970's as a whole, the average value of this nominal to real profits

 ratio was .99 while for the 1960's it was 1.25. The increase in the ratio thus

 implies a fall in pretax profitability.

             Including this accounting ratio variable reduces the size and sta-

 tistical significance of the time variables. In this specification, the com-

 posite trend var±able is .03 for the 1970's and .77 for the 1960's, implying a

 fall of only .71 percentage points. Similarly, between the 1970's and the
 entire   pre—1970 sample period, the difference is only .59 percentage     points. If
 this is a correct estimate of the effect of the accounting error, it can be
 assumed to be only a temporary    influence until firms see through the accounting

 convention and assess costs and profits more accurately.

            Adding the productivity growth variable reduces the coefficient of the

accounting ratio to —2.13 and raises its standard error to 1.60. In this more

general specification, the accounting ratio can at most be considered marginally

significant. Moreover, the composite time trend implies a more substantial

decline of 1.10 percentage points between the 1960's and 1970's. The inference

that a substantial part of the profitability decline is transitory because it

reflects an accounting error is therefore conditional on regarding the produc-
tivity decline as an inappropriate explanatory variable.
            The jump   in the price of oil in 1973 and again in 1979 clearly

disrupted   normal economic behavior. It has been   cited as   a   possible source of
the   decline in productivity growth (Bruno, 1981; Bruno and Sachs, 1980;

Vinals, 1981) and may have contributed directly to the profitability decline as

well. This would be true in the short—run to the extent that selling prices had

            In summary then, we have identified several variables that have
 influenced profitability during the past decades, Of these variables, only the
 rate of productivity growth, the rate of general inflation, and the ratio of
 accounting profits to real profits helped to explain some of the trend decline
 in pretax profitability. Adding the productivity, growth variable to any speci-
 fication leaves the other new variable statistically insignificant. The impli-
 cation of this work, therefore, is that although several factors contributing to
 the profitability decline have been identified, a decline in cyclically—adjusted

profitability of between one and 1.5 percentage points from the 1960's to the

1970's remains to be explained.

           It should again be noted in conclusion that the fall in cyclically

adjusted pretax profitability between the 1960's and 1970's occurred at the same

time   as a rise in the effective tax rate. Similarly, the rise in cyclically
adjusted pretax profitability between the post—Korean war years of the 1950's
and the decade of the 1960's occurred at the same time as a fall in the effec-
tive tax rate. There was no tendency for pretax profits to move in a way that
offset changes in the effective tax rate.


6.   Conclusion
           This paper has presented new estimates of the taxes paid on nonfinan-

cial corporate capital, on the pretax rate of return to capital, and on the

effective tax rate. The basic time series show that both the pretax rate of

return and the effective tax rate have varied substantially in the past quarter

century.

           An explicit analysis indicates that, after adjusting for different

aspects of the business cycle, pretax profitability was between one and 1.5 per—
                                     —38—


centage points lower in the 1970's than in the 1960's. The rate of profitabi-

lity in the 1960's was also about one—half of a percentge point greater than the

profitability in the 7 years of the 1950's after the Korean war.

          Changes in productivity growth, in inflation,

costs, and in other variables are all associated with chances in profitability.

None of these variables, however, can explain the differences in profitability

between the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's.

          Looking at broad decade averages, the effective tax rate and the pre-

tax rate of return move in opposite directions, higher pretax profits occurring

when the tax rate is high. There thus appears to have been no tendency for pre-
                                                        in effective tax rates.
