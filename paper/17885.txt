                                              ABSTRACT

This paper extends a New Keynesian model to include roles for currency and deposits as competing
sources of liquidity services demanded by households. It shows that, both qualitatively and quantitatively,
the Barnett critique applies: While a Divisia aggregate of monetary services tracks the true monetary
aggregate almost perfectly, a simple-sum measure often behaves quite differently. The model also
shows that movements in both quantity and price indices for monetary services correlate strongly with
movements in output following a variety of shocks. Finally, the analysis characterizes the optimal
monetary policy response to disturbances that originate in the financial sector.

1         Introduction

Thirty years ago, William Barnett (1980) demonstrated how economic aggregation theory
can be used to construct coherent and consistent measures of money in economies, like the
United States, where liquidity services are provided through an entire spectrum of assets
including various types of interest-bearing deposits as well as noninterest-bearing currency.
During the three decades that have followed, Barnett’s work has influenced profoundly the
research conducted by a number of economists, including the two authors of this paper.
Indeed, if pressed on this issue, virtually all monetary economists today would no doubt
concede that the Divisia aggregates proposed by Barnett are both theoretically and empir-
ically superior to their simple-sum counterparts. The reason is that the latter simply add
up the nominal value of all monetary assets in circulation and ignore the fact that these
different assets yield different flows of liquidity services and, in equilibrium, also differ in
the opportunity, or user, costs that households and firms incur when they demand those
liquidity services.1 Because the necessary condition for simple-sum aggregation is that all
component assets are perfect substitutes, the only question about simple-sum aggregates is
the magnitude of their measurement error.
        Yet, despite this widespread appreciation of the advantages of Divisia monetary aggre-
gation, Barnett’s article has had a surprisingly small impact on empirical work in monetary
economics, where throughout the past three decades and down to the present day, analysts
have continued, overwhelmingly, to rely on the readily available but conceptually flawed
simple-sum measures. Likewise, central banks around the world, including those like the
Federal Reserve that possess the resources to construct high quality monetary statistics and
to disseminate them widely, have continued to prepare and release data on the simple-sum
aggregates alone even as, for example, national income accountants have gradually adopted
theoretically-consistent economic aggregation methods in producing data on Gross Domestic
    1
    Simple-sum and superlative indexes of money also differ when examined from the perspective of the
production of monetary services as in Barnett, Hinich, and Weber (1986).

Product and its components.2 And in what is perhaps the biggest irony of all, while the
various contributions celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of Barnett’s article on monetary
aggregation all deal with important issues, the vast majority focus on problems relating to
economic aggregation more broadly: Almost none focus on the Divisia monetary aggregates!
Evidently, the “Barnett critique,” to borrow the phrase coined by Chrystal and MacDon-
ald (1994) to summarize the basic message of the arguments articulated in Barnett (1980),
applies with equal force today as it did three decades ago.
       Building on this last point, this paper revisits the issues regarding the appropriate mea-
surement of money studied by Barnett (1980) using a state-of-the-art model of the monetary
transmission mechanism: The microfounded, dynamic and stochastic New Keynesian model,
which features prominently in widely-read surveys such as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999)
and in leading graduate-level textbooks like Woodford (2003) and which, partly as a con-
sequence, has become in recent years something of a canonical model for monetary policy
evaluation and the analysis of the monetary business cycle. As discussed by Ireland (2004b),
virtually all standard presentations of the New Keynesian model focus on the behavior of
output, inflation, and interest rates, with little or no attention paid to measures of the money
supply. Hence, the analysis begins here, in section 2 below, by extending the New Keyne-
sian model to incorporate roles for both noninterest-bearing currency and interest-bearing
deposits as alternative sources of liquidity services consumed by households.
       In this extended New Keynesian environment, Barnett’s (1980) critique applies: Simple-
sum measures of the money supply that merely add the nominal value of currency and
deposits are theoretically flawed. Moreover, unlike other studies which have attempted to
   2
     The Bank of England stands as an important exception: see Hancock (2005) for an overview of the
official series for Divisia money for the United Kingdom, and Bissoondeeal, Jones, Binner, and Mullineux
(2010) for further discussion and application to UK money demand. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
produced high-quality series on the Divisia monetary aggregates, as described by Anderson, Jones, and
Nesmith (1997), through 2006, and comprehensive revisions and updates have been presented very recently
by Anderson and Jones (2011a). Finally, Stracca (2004) is a highly ambitious study that first constructs
from source data and then analyzes unofficial series for Divisia money in the Euro Area. William Barnett’s
new program in “Advances in Monetary and Financial Measurement” at the Center for Financial Stability
has, as one of its key objectives, the important and long-neglected goal of collecting and indexing data on
the Divisia monetary aggregates from economies throughout the world.

resolve the merits of simple-sum versus superlative indexes of money on the basis of goodness-
of-fit criteria or have judged money not to be an important variable when a simple-sum
measure alone was used in empirical work, the current paper shows that, with a model
fully-specified at the level of tastes and technologies an exact aggregate of monetary services
is well-defined and observable. Hence, the results presented in section 3 can confirm that
Barnett’s critique applies quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In particular, those results
show that the Divisia approximations proposed by Barnett (1980) track movements in the
true monetary aggregate almost perfectly, despite the fact that the theoretical framework
used here extends Barnett’s along several dimensions by being fully stochastic as well as
dynamic and explicitly accounts for the forward-looking and optimizing behavior of house-
holds, firms, and financial institutions in general equilibrium. The simple-sum aggregates,
by sharp contrast, often behave quite differently, echoing with New Keynesian theory the
points made empirically by Belongia (1996) and Hendrickson (2011): that “measurement
matters” when considering, for instance, the behavior of the money supply in the aftermath
of a monetary policy disturbance.
   Extending previous work by Barnett (1978, 1980), the results from section 3 below also
confirm that movements in an exact price index for monetary services are mirrored almost
perfectly by a Divisia approximation. These same results also complement those derived
by Belongia and Ireland (2006) in a real business cycle setting by showing that important
movements in price as well as quantity indexes for money occur when a variety of monetary
and financial-sector shocks hit the economy and that movements in the price as well as the
quantity of money often correlate strongly with movements in output.
   Indeed, by developing an extended New Keynesian framework in which private financial
institutions create deposits as imperfect substitutes for government-issued currency, this
paper can go on to examine, quantitatively, the macroeconomic effects of a range of shocks
impacting on the economy through the banking sector. Motivated in particular by recent
events from the US economy, the results from section 3 trace out the aggregate consequences


                                               3
of financial-sector disturbances that give rise to a sharp increase in banks’ demand for reserves
or that raise the costs that those same banks must incur in creating highly-liquid deposits
that substitute for government-issued currency. Finally, the results from section 3 begin
to shed light on the optimal policy response to such financial-sector shocks, suggesting in
particular that a standard Taylor (1993) rule must be expanded to allow for a monetary
policy response to changes in a welfare-theoretic measure of the output gap, in addition to
changes in inflation and instead of changes in output itself, to insulate the macroeconomy
fully from a wider range of disturbances, real and nominal alike. And interpreted more
broadly, those results also indicate that there may be an expanded role for the Divisia
aggregates as indicators of monetary conditions during times of financial crises, along the
lines suggested by Barnett and Chauvet (2011).



2     The New Keynesian Model

2.1    Overview

The model developed here extends the standard New Keynesian framework, with its key
features of monopolistic competition and nominal goods price rigidity, in the same way that
Belongia and Ireland (2006) extend the standard real business cycle model, with its key fea-
tures of frictionless markets and technology shocks, by introducing a role for money through
a shopping-time specification and by allowing private banks to produce interest-bearing de-
posits that compete with government-issued currency as a source of liquidity services that
households consume to economize on their time spent purchasing other goods and services.
As noted above, this model provides an analytic framework that is fully stochastic and dy-
namic and that is based on microfoundations and general equilibrium reasoning, which can
be used to revisit a range of issues associated with the Barnett (1980) critique as it continues
to apply to work in monetary economics at the state-of-the-art today.
    Also as noted above, the model provides an analytic framework for examining how the


                                               4
economy responds to a variety of disturbances that originate in the financial sector and for
considering the appropriate monetary policy response to those same shocks. In particular,
with its focus on reserves and deposits – items on the liability side of the banking system’s
balance sheet – this model complements Goodfriend and McCallum’s (2007), with its focus
on securities and loans – items on the asset side of the same balance sheet.3
       The model economy consists of a representative household, a representative finished
goods-producing firm, a continuum of intermediate goods-producing firms indexed by i ∈
[0, 1], a representative bank, and a monetary authority. During each period t = 0, 1, 2, ...,
each intermediate goods-producing firm produces a distinct, perishable intermediate good.
Hence, intermediate goods also may be indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], where firm i produces good
i. The model features enough symmetry, however, to allow the analysis to focus on the
behavior of a representative intermediate goods-producing firm that produces the generic
intermediate good i. The activities of each of these agents now will be described in turn.


2.2       The Representative Household

The representative household enters each period t = 0, 1, 2, ... with Mt−1 units of currency,
Bt−1 bonds, and st−1 (i) shares in each intermediate goods-producing firm i ∈ [0, 1]. At the
beginning of the period, the household receives Tt additional units of currency in the form
of a lump-sum transfer from the monetary authority. Next, the household’s bonds mature,
providing Bt−1 more units of currency. The household uses some of this currency to purchase
Bt new bonds at the price of 1/rt dollars per bond, where rt denotes the gross nominal interest
rate between t and t + 1, and st (i) shares in each intermediate goods-producing firm i ∈ [0, 1]
at the price of Qt (i) dollars per share.
       After this initial session of securities trading, the household sets aside Nt dollars of
   3
    Cysne (2003) and Jones, Asaftei, and Wang (2004) also develop general equilibrium models in which
noninterest-bearing currency and interest-bearing deposits both provide liquidity services; these studies
also draw links to the literature on Divisia monetary aggregation, but then go on trace out the models’
implications for the welfare cost of sustained price inflation as opposed to issues relating to the monetary
business cycle that are the focus here.

currency to be used in purchasing goods and services and deposits the rest in the bank.
At the same time, the household also borrows Lt dollars from the bank, bringing the total
nominal value of its deposits to

    Dt = Mt−1 + Tt + Bt−1 +              Qt (i)st−1 (i) di − Bt /rt −                  Qt (i)st (i) di − Nt + Lt .   (1)

   During period t, the household supplies ht (i) units of labor to each intermediate goods-
producing firm i ∈ [0, 1], for a total of

receiving labor income Wt ht in return, where Wt denotes the nominal wage rate. In addition,
the household purchases Ct units of the finished good at the nominal price Pt from the
representative finished goods-producing firm; making these transactions also requires

                                                   χ    MtA

units of shopping time, where MtA is an aggregate of monetary services provided from cur-
rency Nt and deposits Dt according to


                                          (ω−1)/ω                           (ω−1)/ω ω/(ω−1)
                      MtA = [ν 1/ω Nt               + (1 − ν)1/ω Dt                    ]        .                    (3)


In the shopping-time specification (2), the parameter χ > 1 governs the rate at which the
effort required to purchase goods and services increases as the household economizes on its
holdings of monetary assets. Extending the specification from Ireland (2004b), the shock,
vt , that impacts the total demand for monetary services follows an autoregressive process of
the form
                           ln(vt ) = (1 − ρv ) ln(v) + ρv ln(vt−1 ) + εvt ,                                          (4)



                                                           6
where v > 0 determines the steady-state level of real monetary services demanded relative
to consumption, the persistence parameter satisfies 0 ≤ ρv < 1, and the serially uncorre-
lated innovation εvt has mean zero and standard deviation σv . In the monetary aggregation
specification (3), the parameter ν, satisfying 0 < ν < 1, governs the steady-state expendi-
ture shares on currency versus deposits and the parameter ω > 0 governs the elasticity of
substitution between currency and deposits in producing the monetary aggregate MtA .
   At the end of period t, the household owes the bank rtL Lt dollars, where rtL is the gross
nominal interest rate on loans. At the same time, however, the bank owes the household rtD Dt
dollars, where rtD is the gross nominal interest rate on deposits. The household also receives
a nominal dividend payment of Ft (i) for each share that it owns in each intermediate goods-
producing firm i ∈ [0, 1]. After all these payments are made and received, the household
carries Mt units of currency into period t + 1, where

                                           Z    1
                  Mt = Nt + Wt ht +                 Ft (i)st (i) di + rtD Dt − Pt Ct − rtL Lt .   (5)
                                            0



   The household, therefore, chooses sequences for Bt , st (i) for all i ∈ [0, 1], Nt , Dt , Lt , ht ,
Ct , hst , MtA , and Mt for all t = 0, 1, 2, ... to maximize the expected utility function

where the discount factor and the weight on leisure relative to consumption satisfy 0 < β < 1
and η > 0. The preference shock at in (6) follows the autoregressive process


                                     ln(at ) = ρa ln(at−1 ) + εat ,                               (7)


where 0 ≤ ρa < 1 and the serially uncorrelated innovation εat has mean zero and standard
deviation σa ; as shown by Ireland (2004b) a preference shock of this kind translates, in
equilibrium, into a disturbance to the New Keynesian model’s forward-looking IS curve,

linking expected consumption growth to the real interest rate. The household makes its
optimal choices subject to the constraints (1)-(3) and (5), each of which must hold for all
t = 0, 1, 2, ..., taking as given the behavior of the exogenous shocks described by (4) and
(7) for all t = 0, 1, 2, .... Part 1 of the appendix displays the first-order conditions for the
household’s problem.4


2.3       The Representative Finished Goods-Producing Firm

During each period t = 0, 1, 2, ..., the representative finished goods-producing firm uses Yt (i)
units of each intermediate good i ∈ [0, 1], purchased at the nominal price Pt (i), to manu-
facture Yt units of the finished good according to the constant-returns-to-scale technology
described by
                                                  Z     1                           θ/(θ−1)

                                         Yt =                Yt (i)             di                 ,             (8)
                                                     0

where θ > 1 governs the elasticity of substitution between the various intermediate goods in
producing the finished good. Thus, the finished goods-producing firm chooses Yt (i) for all
i ∈ [0, 1] to maximize its profits, given by

                                Z   1                         θ/(θ−1) Z                 1

for all t = 0, 1, 2, .... The first-order conditions for this problem are


                                                  Yt (i) = [Pt (i)/Pt ]−θ Yt                                     (9)


for all i ∈ [0, 1] and t = 0, 1, 2, ....

    These first-order conditions reveal, in particular, that in equilibrium, the interest rate rtL on loans
always equals the interest rate rt on bonds. This no-arbitrage condition results partly from the assumption,
implicit in the formulation of the household’s problem, that the household can obtain additional funds at
the beginning of each period by issuing bonds as well as by borrowing from the bank.

2.4     The Representative Intermediate Goods-Producing Firm

During each period t = 0, 1, 2, ..., the representative intermediate goods-producing firm hires
ht (i) units of labor from the representative household to manufacture Yt (i) units of interme-
diate good i according to the constant-returns-to-scale technology described by


                                             Yt (i) = Zt ht (i).                          (10)


The aggregate technology shock Zt follows a random walk with positive drift:


                                   ln(Zt ) = ln(z) + ln(Zt−1 ) + εzt ,                    (11)


where z > 1 and the serially uncorrelated innovation εzt has mean zero and standard devia-
tion σz .
    Since the intermediate goods substitute imperfectly for one another in producing the
finished good, the representative intermediate goods-producing firm sells its output in a
monopolistically competitive market; during each period t = 0, 1, 2, ..., the intermediate
goods-producing firm sets the nominal price for its output, subject to the requirement that
it satisfy the representative finished goods-producing firm’s demand, described by (9). In
addition, following a specification first proposed by Rotemberg (1982), the intermediate
goods-producing firm faces a quadratic cost of adjusting its nominal price, measured in units
of the finished good and given by

                                                         2

where the parameter φ ≥ 0 governs the magnitude of the price adjustment costs and where
π > 1 denotes the gross, steady-state inflation rate.
       This costly price adjustment makes the intermediate goods-producing firm’s problem
dynamic. As described in part 2 of the appendix, the firm chooses a sequence for Pt (i) for
all t = 0, 1, 2, ... to maximize its total, real market value. When log-linearized, the first-order
conditions for this problem, also shown in part 2 of the appendix, combine to take the form
of a forward-looking, New Keynesian Phillips curve, which links inflation during period t to
expected inflation during period t + 1 and real marginal cost; because labor is the only factor
of production in this model, real marginal cost is measured by dividing the real wage Wt /Pt
by the aggregate technology shock Zt during period t.


2.5       The Representative Bank

During each period t = 0, 1, 2, ..., the representative bank accepts deposits worth Dt dollars
from the representative household and makes loans worth Lt dollars to the representative
household. It pays interest on the deposits it accepts at the gross rate rtD and receives
interest on the loans it makes at the gross rate rtL . Let τt denote the bank’s reserve ratio
during period t. Here, this reserve ratio is allowed to vary stochastically, but exogenously,
to capture the macroeconomic effects of unexpected changes in banks’ demand for reserves;
it follows the autoregressive process


                               ln(τt ) = (1 − ρτ ) ln(τ ) + ρτ ln(τt−1 ) + ετ t ,                          (12)


where 0 < τ < 1, 0 ≤ ρτ < 1, and the serially uncorrelated innovation ετ has zero mean
and standard deviation στ .5 Bank loans are then related to bank deposits according to the
   5
     Since this law of motion is specified in terms of the natural log of τt , it automatically imposes the
constraint that the reserve ratio be strictly positive. In general, however, further restrictions must be placed
on the parameter τ and the volatility of ετ t to ensure that the reserve ratio remains below one. In all of
the numerical simulations discussed in section 3, below, the reserve ratio remains bounded between zero and
one.

for all t = 0, 1, 2, ....6
       Following the specification introduced into a real business cycle framework by Belongia
and Ireland (2006), the bank creates deposits with total real value Dt /Pt during each period
t = 0, 1, 2, ... according to a constant-returns-to-scale technology that requires xt (Dt /Pt )
units of the finished good. The financial-sector cost shock follows the autoregressive process


                               ln(xt ) = (1 − ρx ) ln(x) + ρx ln(xt−1 ) + εxt ,                           (14)


where x > 0, 0 ≤ ρx < 1, and the serially uncorrelated innovation εxt has mean zero and
standard deviation σx . Hence, the bank’s nominal profits during period t are


                             Πbt = (rtL − 1)Lt − (rtD − 1)Dt − Pt xt (Dt /Pt ).


Substituting (13), which links loans to deposits, into this last expression reveals that as
competition drives profits in the banking industry to zero,


                                     rtD = 1 + (rtL − 1)(1 − τt ) − xt ,                                  (15)


must hold in equilibrium during each period t = 0, 1, 2, .... This implies that the spread
between the loan and deposit rates is affected by the financial-sector cost shock as well as
the stochastically-varying reserve ratio.7
   6
      Of course, (12) and (13) provide only a rudimentary description of bank behavior: (12) abstracts entirely
from the considerations that lead banks to choose their holdings of reserves optimally by balancing the
benefits and opportunity costs of doing so, while (13) makes clear that the model makes no attempt to
capture any heterogeneity in the terms and risk characteristics of bank loans or the services provided by
different types of bank deposits. Here, where the focus remains squarely on households’ demands for monetary
services, readers are asked to accept these simplifying assumptions; Ireland (2011), however, relaxes these
assumptions and models bank decision-making in greater detail, to examine how both banks and depositors
are affected by the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to begin paying interest on reserves.
    7
      Equation (15) also reveals that, as with the reserve ratio shock in (12), additional restrictions must in

2.6     Efficient Allocations and the Output Gap

As a preliminary step in describing the monetary authority’s behavior, it is helpful to consider
the problem faced by a benevolent social planner who can overcome both the shopping-time
frictions that generate demands for the liquidity services provided by currency and deposits
in equilibrium and the quadratic adjustment costs that give rise to sluggish price adjustment
in equilibrium. During each period t = 0, 1, 2, ..., this social planner allocates h∗ (i) units
of the representative household’s labor to produce Yt∗ (i) units of each intermediate good
i ∈ [0, 1] according to the technology described by (10), then uses those various intermediate
goods to produce Yt∗ units of the finished good according to the technology described by (8).
    Part 3 of the appendix shows that the first-order conditions for the social planner’s
problem can be combined to yield the simple expression


                                              Yt∗ = (1/η)Zt                                              (16)


for the efficient level of output. This expression confirms a general applicability of Kydland
and Prescott’s (1982) insight: To the extent that business cycle fluctuations are driven by
technology shocks, those fluctuations are efficient and therefore should not be the target of
monetary or fiscal stabilization policies in this New Keynesian model. Based on this insight,
a welfare-theoretic measure of the output gap can be defined for this economy as


                                         gt∗ = Yt /Yt∗ = η(Yt /Zt )                                      (17)


for all t = 0, 1, 2, ..., indicating that the converse to Kydland and Prescott’s observation is
also true: To the extent that shocks other than those to productivity lead to fluctuations
in output, there is a potential role for activist stabilization policies. Some of the results
presented in section 3 below speak directly to this last point.
general be imposed on the parameter x and the distribution of εxt in the process (14) for the financial-sector
cost shock to ensure that the interest rate on deposits remains nonnegative. Once again, this additional
constraint is satisfied in all of the numerical simulations described below.


                                                     12
2.7      The Monetary Authority

In equilibrium, Mt = Mt−1 + Tt , Bt = Bt−1 = 0, and st (i) = st−1 (i) = 1 for all i ∈ [0, 1]
must hold for all t = 0, 1, 2, .... Substituting these conditions, together with (13), into (1)
confirms that the monetary base Mt equals currency in circulation Nt plus reserves Ntv :


                                       Mt = Nt + Ntv ,


where
                                          Ntv = τt Dt                                     (18)

for all t = 0, 1, 2, ....
    In a real business cycle version of this model, Belongia and Ireland (2006) assume that
the monetary authority conducts monetary policy as described by a rule for managing the
monetary base. Here, in line with most New Keynesian analyses, the central bank is as-
sumed instead to follow a Taylor (1993) rule for managing the interest rate instead. Thus,
the extended model developed here has, at its core, the three basic equations common to
all New Keynesian models: a forward-looking IS curve describing the behavior of optimizing
households, a forward-looking Phillips curve describing the behavior of optimizing firms,
and a Taylor rule describing the conduct of monetary policy. The extended model developed
here, however, adds to this New Keynesian core the shopping-time specification described
by (2) and (3) that generates a demand for currency and deposits as sources of liquidity ser-
vices consumed by households and the stochastic relations described by (12)-(15) describing
the competitive behavior of the private financial institutions that produce interest-bearing
deposits as imperfect substitutes for government-issued currency in producing those same
liquidity services.
    Accordingly, let
                                        πt = Pt /Pt−1                                     (19)

and
                                               gty = Yt /Yt−1                                             (20)

denote the gross rates of inflation and output growth between periods t − 1 and t, and let
r, π, g ∗ , and g y denote the average, or steady-state, values of the nominal interest rate, the
inflation rate, the output gap, and the output growth rate in this model where, as explained
below, all of these variables turn out to be stationary. Then the modified Taylor (1993) rule


           ln(rt /r) = ρr ln(rt−1 /r) + ρπ ln(πt /π) + ρg∗ ln(gt∗ /g ∗ ) + ρgy ln(gty /g y ) + εrt        (21)


allows the monetary authority to adjust the interest rate in response to changes in two
stationary real variables, the output gap and output growth, in addition to the inflation
rate, and also allows for interest rate smoothing through the introduction of the lagged
interest rate on the right-hand-side, all depending on specific settings for the policy reaction
coefficients ρr , ρπ , ρg∗ , and ρgy . In (21), the serially uncorrelated innovation εrt has mean
zero and standard deviation σr .8


2.8     Monetary Aggregation

In this model with currency and deposits, the variable MtA represents the true aggregate of
monetary or liquidity services demanded by the representative household during each period
t = 0, 1, 2, .... Part 4 of the appendix demonstrates that the own rate of return rtA on this
true monetary aggregate and the associated opportunity cost rt − rtA incurred by households
when they hold this monetary aggregate instead of bonds can be defined with reference to
   8
    The specification in (21) allows the monetary authority to adjust the interest rate contemporaneously
in response to changes in inflation, the output gap, and output growth. A previous version of this paper,
available to interested readers as Belongia and Ireland (2010), used a version of the Taylor rule featuring
a response to lagged inflation, the output gap, and output growth instead, obtaining results that are both
qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those reported below, and the analysis here briefly returns to this
alternative version of the rule when considering the optimal response to financial sector shocks towards the
end of section 3.

the price dual of the quantity aggregation formula (3),


                       rt − rtA = [ν(rt − 1)1−ω + (1 − ν)(rt − rtD )1−ω ]1/(1−ω) ,                       (22)


which also recognizes that rt −1 measures the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing
currency and rt −rtD measures the opportunity cost of holding interest-bearing deposits. Part
4 of the appendix also confirms that Barnett’s (1978) formula


                                            uA          A
                                             t = (rt − rt )/rt ,                                         (23)


formula for the user cost of the monetary aggregate MtA applies here as well.9
       As shown in (3), (22), and (23), however, the monetary services aggregate MtA and its user
cost uA
      t depend on the share and elasticity parameters ν and ω, which though observable to

private agents within this model economy may well be unobservable to outsiders, including
analysts working for the monetary authority and applied econometricians more generally.
In this model economy, as in the US economy, therefore, some observers may construct
and monitor alternative measures of money that do not depend on unknown parameters or
functional forms. One such measure is the simple-sum aggregate


                                             MtS = Nt + Dt ,                                             (24)


computed in the usual way by adding the nominal value of currency plus deposits.
       Barnett’s (1980) critique states, however, that simple-sum aggregates like (24) are flawed
measures of money, except under the extreme assumption – violated both within this model
and in the US economy – that all monetary assets are perfect substitutes in terms of the
liquidity services they provide. But, Barnett (1980) goes on to show how Divisia indexes
can be used to approximate the true monetary quantity and price aggregates, even when the
   9
    Barnett (1978) notes that this formula coincides with the one displayed, though not derived with reference
to a formal model, by Donovan (1977).


                                                     15
parameters and more basic functional forms of (3) and (22) are unknown.
     Start by defining the user costs of currency and deposits in a manner analogous to (23),
that is, using Barnett’s (1978) formula:


                                       uN
                                        t = (rt − 1)/rt                                 (25)


and
                                     uD     A    D
                                      t = (rt − rt )/rt .                               (26)

Next, compute total expenditures on monetary services as


                                     Et = u N        D
                                            t Nt + u t D t .                            (27)


Part 4 of the appendix demonstrates that


                                           Et = uA  A
                                                 t Mt ,




indicating that while the true quantity and price indexes cannot be observed separately
without knowledge of the functional forms and parameters in (3) and (22), their product,
equal to total expenditures on monetary services, can be measured directly from the data.
     Next, compute the associated expenditure shares as


                                       sN    N
                                        t = ut Nt /Et                                   (28)


and
                                       sD    D
                                        t = ut Dt /Et .                                 (29)

Now the growth rate of the Divisia quantity index for monetary services can be computed
as

Theil (1967) shows that in discrete time, this Divisia price index is not dual to the Divisia
quantity index in (30). The results below demonstrate, however, that across a wide range
of circumstances, the Divisia quantity index defined in (30) tracks the true quantity index
defined in (3) and the Divisia price index defined in (33) tracks the true price index defined
in (23) almost perfectly, and (23) is the price dual associated with (3).


2.9     The Equilibrium System

Part 5 of the appendix collects equations describing private agents’ optimizing behavior,
the monetary authority’s chosen policy, market clearing conditions, and the evolution of the
exogenous shocks to form a system that determines the behavior of all of the model’s endoge-
nous variables in a symmetric equilibrium in which all intermediate goods-producing firms
make identical decisions. This system of equations implies that most of these variables will
be nonstationary, with the real variables inheriting a unit root from the nonstationary pro-
cess (11) for the technology shock and the nominal variables inheriting a unit root from the
conduct of monetary policy via the Taylor rule (21), which makes the price level nonstation-
ary. However, when the system is rewritten in terms of a set of appropriately-transformed
  10
     Strictly speaking, (30) describes the discrete-time approximation proposed by Tornqvist (1936) and Theil
(1967) to the continuous-time Divisia index.


                                                            17
variables, also identified in part 5 of the appendix, it implies that the model has a balanced
growth path along which these transformed variables remain stationary.
    The transformed system also implies that, in the absence of shocks, each of the stationary
variables converges to a unique steady-state value. The transformed system can therefore be
log-linearized around its unique steady state to form a set of linear expectational difference
equations that can be solved using methods outlined by Klein (2000).



3     The Barnett Critique Revisited

3.1    Calibration

Computational implementation of Klein’s (2000) solution method requires that numerical
values be assigned to each of the model’s parameters. Here, this task can be accomplished
using the calibration methodology first proposed by Kydland and Prescott (1982), one used
throughout the literature on dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium macroeconomic theory.
    Accordingly, setting β = 0.99 for the representative household’s discount factor identifies
one period in the model as one quarter year in real time and setting η = 2.5 pins down the
steady-state value of hours worked in goods production at 1/3, or eight hours out of every
24. The setting θ = 6, drawn from previous work by Ireland (2000, 2004a, 2004b), makes the
steady-state markup of price over marginal cost resulting from monopolistic competition in
the markets for the differentiated intermediate goods equal to 20 percent. And, as explained
in Ireland (2004b), the setting φ = 50 implies a speed of price adjustment in this model
with quadratic price adjustment costs that is the same as the speed of price adjustment in
a model with staggered price setting following Calvo’s (1983) popular specification in which
individual goods prices are adjusted, on average, every 3.75 quarters, that is, slightly more
than once per year.
    The setting χ = 2 makes the shopping time specification in (2) quadratic, and the
setting ω = 1.5 implies that there is more substitutability between currency and deposits


                                              18
in the general CES aggregator (3) than there would be in a more restrictive Cobb-Douglas
specification. The setting v = 0.4 works to match the steady-state ratio of the simple-sum
aggregate MtS to nominal consumption expenditures Pt Ct in the model with the average,
equal to approximately 3.3, as measured by the ratio of simple-sum M2 to quarterly personal
consumption expenditures in US data running from 1959 through 2009. Likewise, the setting
ν = 0.225 works to match the steady-state ratio of currency Nt to the simple-sum aggregate
MtS in the model with the average, equal to approximately 0.10, as measured by the ratio of
currency in circulation to simple-sum M2 in the same sample of US data.
   The calibrated value z = 1.005 implies growth of 2 percent per year on average for most
of the model’s real variables. The value τ = 0.03 reflects the observation that, again in
a sample of US data running from 1959 through 2009, the ratio of total reserves to the
deposit (non-currency) components of M2 averages about 3 percent. The value x = 0.01 is
similar to the one used by Belongia and Ireland (2006) and, since the deposit costs in this
model are measured in units of the finished good, implies that banking activities account
for just slightly more than 2 percent of total aggregate output in the steady state. By
comparison, data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis show that within the “finance
and insurance” sector of the economy, the subsector including “Federal Reserve banks, credit
intermediation, and related activities,” accounts for 3.6 percent of GDP, on average, from
1998 through 2009. The figure for the model is smaller than the associated figure in the
data, but that seems appropriate, given that the subsectoral category in the data covers a
range of activities beyond accepting deposits and making loans, which is what banks in this
model do.
   The inflation target π = 1.005 implies a steady-state inflation rate of 2 percent per year
in the model. And, for a benchmark parameterization, the settings ρr = 0.75 and ρπ = 0.30
provide for a substantial amount of interest rate smoothing together with a monetary policy
response to inflation that is strong enough to make the linearized model’s dynamically sta-
ble rational expectations equilibrium unique according to the criteria outlined by Blanchard


                                             19
and Kahn (1980) and both expectationally stable and stable under least squares learning
according to the conditions derived by Evans and Honkapohja (2001, pp.236-238) and repro-
duced by McCallum (2009, pp.1103-1104).11 While this benchmark parameterization sets
the policy coefficients ρg∗ and ρgy on the output gap and output growth equal to zero, pos-
itive values for these parameters are considered as alternatives below, in characterizing the
optimal policy response to the model’s financial-sector shocks.
       For the parameters determining the degree of persistence in the exogenous shocks, the
settings ρv = 0.95 and ρa = 0.90 imply that the money demand shock is highly persistent and
the preference shock just slightly less so. The settings ρτ = 0.50 and ρx = 0.50 mean that
the financial-sector shocks to reserves demand and the cost of creating liquid deposits retain
some serial correlation but die out more quickly than the other macroeconomic disturbances.
       In this linearized model, different numerical settings for the standard deviation of the
innovations to each shock simply scale up or down the impulse response functions around
which the quantitative analysis is organized below. Hence, the settings σv = σa = σz = 0.01
are used for illustrative purposes, describing the effects of money demand, IS, and technology
shocks of a more-or-less typical size. The much larger values στ = 1 and σx = 0.25 are
selected so that the impulse responses to the reserve demand and deposit cost shocks can be
interpreted as describing what happens during extreme conditions accompanying a financial
crisis in which banks’ demand for reserves doubles and the cost of creating deposits rises by
25 percent. Finally, the setting σr = 0.0025 implies that a one-standard-deviation monetary
policy shock raises the short-term nominal interest rate in the model by one quarter of one
percent; but since the interest rates from the model are expressed in quarterly terms and
not annualized, this shock should be interpreted as one that increases the federal funds rate,
quoted as usual in annualized terms, by 100 basis points.12
  11
     These conditions apply directly, since the solution obtained here through the application of Klein’s (2000)
algorithm coincides with what Evans and Honkapohja (2001) and McCallum (2009) call the “minimum state
variable” solution.
  12
     Also, under the Taylor rule (21), the monetary authority responds contemporaneously to the move-
ments in inflation, the output gap, and output growth generated by the monetary policy shock; hence, in
equilibrium, the observed response of the nominal interest rate will be somewhat smaller than 25 basis points.

3.2    The Quantity and Price of Money: Measurement Matters

Figures 1 and 2 plot the impulse responses of the growth rates of three monetary aggregates,
the true aggregate defined in (3), its Divisia approximation defined in (30), and the simple-
sum aggregate defined in (24), to each of the model’s six exogenous shocks. These impulse
responses confirm that the Barnett (1980) critique and Belongia’s (1996) and Hendrickson’s
(2011) related empirical findings that “measurement matters” when gauging the linkages
between the money supply and other key macroeconomic variables carry over to this state-
of-the-art theoretical specification.
   In particular, the graphs presented in the first two columns of each row in each figure con-
firm that the Divisia quantity aggregate tracks the true monetary aggregate almost perfectly
after each of the six shocks. Indeed, if the impulse responses for the true monetary aggre-
gate and its Divisia approximation were plotted together in the same graphs, the two lines
would appear indistinguishable. These findings are encouraging since, in terms of theory,
they show that the Divisia monetary aggregate continues to be a trustworthy approximation
even in this fully dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium setting in which a range of real
and nominal disturbances are accounted for. These findings also are encouraging since, in
terms of practice, they show that specific knowledge of the true functional forms describing
how households aggregate currency and deposits into a composite yielding liquidity services
and specific knowledge of the parameters entering into those functional forms are not needed
in constructing reliable monetary statistics. This last goal, of course, is one of the principle
objectives of Barnett’s (1980) original study: To use economic theory as the basis for defining
“parameter-free approximations to aggregator functions,” with the emphasis taken directly
from page 12 of the original text.
   Of course, this first set of results will come as no surprise to those familiar with Barnett’s
(1980) work on monetary aggregation and Diewert’s (1976) theory of exact and superlative
index numbers upon which it builds. Within the general equilibrium structure, the utility
function obtained by combining the CES aggregator (3), the shopping-time specification (2),


                                              21
and the description of household preferences over consumption and leisure (6) is weakly sepa-
rable in currency Nt and deposits Dt . Moreover, the aggregator function (3) is nonstochastic
and homogeneous of degree one. Despite all of the other, dynamic and stochastic, features
of the full model, therefore, these properties of the utility function and the monetary aggre-
gator coincide with those imposed by Barnett (1980). And since Diewert (1976) establishes
that the Tornqvist-Theil version of the Divisia index that appears in (30) is superlative,
meaning that it provides a second-order accurate approximation to a linear homogenous
function, the results in figures 1 and 2 can be viewed as confirming, quantitatively, that
these approximation results apply, and therefore that the underlying logic from the pioneer-
ing work by Diewert and Barnett can be embedded, quite tractably, into a state-of-the-art
macroeconomic model.
   On the other hand, the graphs in the third column of each row in figures 1 and 2 also
reveal that the more conventional simple-sum aggregate often behaves quite differently than
its true and Divisia counterparts. This happens following the preference, or IS, shock and
both of the financial-sector shocks, but especially in the aftermath of a monetary policy
shock. Since, in particular, the decline in the growth rate of the simple-sum aggregate
is much smaller than the decline in either the true or Divisia monetary aggregate, any
econometrician looking for evidence of a liquidity effect as manifested by a decline in the
money supply following a policy-induced increase in the interest rate would reach quite
different conclusions depending on whether he or she uses data on the Divisia or the simple-
sum aggregate from this economy. Here, in theory, “measurement matters,” just as it does
in Belongia’s (1996) and Hendrickson’s (2011) empirical studies.
   This second set of results, concerning the divergence between movements in the true
and the simple-sum monetary aggregates, turns out to depend somewhat sensitively on
the setting for the parameter ω measuring the elasticity of substitution between currency
and deposits in producing the true monetary aggregate defined by (3). Figure 3 shows
this by reproducing the impulse responses of the growth rates of the true and simple-sum


                                             22
monetary aggregates following a one-standard deviation monetary policy shock for various
values of ω.13 The panels reveal that increasing ω from its benchmark setting of 1.5 to
a higher value of 2.0 makes the discrepancy between the true and simple-sum aggregates
even larger. And the divergence remains important, although it becomes somewhat smaller,
when ω is reduced to 0.75. The true and simple-sum aggregates still behave differently when
ω = 5, but as ω gets larger, currency and deposits move closer and closer to being perfect
substitutes, so that the representative household’s demand for currency becomes arbitrarily
small and both the true and simple-sum aggregates reflect the behavior of deposits alone.
The degree of synchronization between movements in the true and simple-sum aggregates
also grows stronger when ω is reduced to 0.50 and then to 0.10, as substitution effects
across currency and deposits diminish greatly in importance. Cynse and Turchick (2010)
survey the empirical literature and find a wide range of estimates for the elasticities of
substitution between alternative monetary assets, with both the smallest and largest values
extending beyond the range considered in figure 3. Hence, the results from these graphs,
while highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the extent to which simple-sum measures
misrepresent movements in true economic monetary aggregates, also demonstrate that across
a broad range of parameterizations, the errors can be quite large. The preferred Divisia
measures, by contrast, track the true aggregates much more closely and under a far wider
set of assumptions.
       Figures 4 and 5 extend the comparison by tracing out impulse responses of the growth
rate of the user cost of the true monetary aggregate, defined in (23) using Barnett’s (1978)
formula, and the growth rate of the Divisia price index for the aggregate of monetary services,
defined in (33). Again, the measures move in virtual lockstep following each type of shock,
confirming that reliable price, as well as quantity, indexes for monetary aggregates can be
compiled directly from observable data alone and without knowledge of the true form of the
  13
    Since, in every case, consistent with the logic referred to above, the Divisia aggregate tracks the true
aggregate almost perfectly, the panels in figure 3 focus exclusively on the comparison between the true and
simple-sum aggregates.



                                                    23
aggregator functions or the true values of the parameters entering into those functions.
       As noted above, the spread rt −rtA between the interest rate on bonds rt and the own rate
of return on the true monetary aggregate rtA represents a theoretically consistent measure of
the opportunity cost of holding the true monetary aggregate MtA , since it is defined using
the price dual (22) to the monetary quantity aggregator (3). Part 4 of the appendix shows,
for instance, that the household’s demand for the monetary aggregate MtA can be described
by the equilibrium relationship

                   MtA
                                                            
                                χ             1           Wt            1                   χ
          ln                 =     ln(Ct ) +     ln                −       ln(rt − rtA ) +     ln(vt ),
                   Pt          1+χ           1+χ          Pt           1+χ                 1+χ

which resembles a conventional money demand specification that, having been derived from
a shopping-time specification, has the real wage as well as consumption as its scale variables,
a result that echoes Karni’s (1973), and has rt − rtA as its opportunity cost term. An
alternative measure of the opportunity cost of money, often used in studies that employ
simple-sum aggregates, subtracts from the interest rate on bonds an own-rate measure rtS
formed instead as the weighted average of the interest rate on currency and the interest rate
on deposits, which for this model is simply


                                         rtS − 1 = (Dt /MtS )(rtD − 1),


since the interest rate on currency equals zero and since Dt /MtS measures the nominal share
of deposits in the simple-sum aggregate. Figure 6 compares the impulse responses of the
true opportunity cost measure rt − rtA to the conventional measure rt − rtS and shows that
once again, the conventional measure behaves quite differently, particularly in the aftermath
of preference, financial-sector, and monetary policy shocks.14 Figures 4, 5, and 6 confirm,
  14
      This discussion refers to rt − rtS as the “conventional” opportunity cost measure instead of the “simple-
sum” cost measure since the price dual to the simple-sum quantity aggregator is given, instead, by the
opportunity cost of rt − rtD of holding deposits, which would be the only monetary asset valued in this model
if, in fact, currency and deposits are viewed by households as perfect substitutes.




                                                      24
therefore, that for prices as well as quantities, “measurement matters” in monetary eco-
nomics.
   Figures 7 and 8 shift the focus back to the three macroeconomic variables that more
typically hold center stage in New Keynesian analyses: output, inflation, and the short-term
nominal interest rate. The top row in figure 7, in particular, echoes the famous results from
Poole (1970) and extended to a New Keynesian setting in Ireland (2000), showing that by
holding the nominal interest rate fixed in the face of a money demand shock, the Taylor
rule (23) requires the monetary authority to accommodate that shift in money demand with
an increase in the monetary base, leaving output and inflation unchanged. Likewise, in this
setting where the technology shock follows a random walk, the immediate and permanent
shift in the level of productivity that follows a technological innovation leaves the natural
real rate of interest unchanged. As a consequence, under a Taylor rule that also holds the
market nominal rate of interest unchanged, output follows its efficient path, as dictated by
(16), rising immediately and permanently without a change in inflation. Note, however,
that bringing about this efficient response of output to the technology shock does require
deliberate action on the part of the monetary authority, in the form of an increase in the
monetary base that, again, helps accommodate the increased demand for liquidity services
reflected in the third row of figure 1.
   The last row of figure 8 shows how an unanticipated monetary tightening, brought about
through a policy-induced rise in the short-term nominal interest, leads to a sizable decline
in output and a smaller decline in inflation, as the New Keynesian element of nominal price
rigidity leads to monetary nonneutrality in the short run. Again, going back to figure 2, this
monetary tightening also is associated with a liquidity effect, as the true monetary aggregate
falls even more sharply than output.
   Row two of figure 7 reveals that an exogenous, nonmonetary demand-side disturbance –
the preference, or New Keynesian IS – shock generates a rise in both output and inflation.
The benchmark Taylor rule, with its settings of ρr = 0.75 and ρπ = 0.30, calls for a sustained


                                             25
monetary tightening to counteract what, according to the expression (16) for the efficient
level of output, represents an inefficient overheating of the economy; as discussed in more
detail below, a Taylor rule with a larger value for ρπ , and hence a more aggressive policy
response to inflation, would insulate more successfully the economy against the volatility set
off by this IS disturbance.
   Finally, rows one and two of figure 8 show the responses to both financial-sector dis-
turbances: When banks’ demand for reserves or when banks’ cost of creating deposits rises
unexpectedly. Whereas output declines in reaction to either disturbance, inflation remains
unchanged after each of these shocks. These outcomes get shaped, to a large extent, by
the workings of monetary policy under the benchmark Taylor rule, which again calls for
the monetary authority to fully accommodate the increased demand for base money that
arises as a consequence of each of the two shocks so as to stabilize the price level. Yet,
this policy-induced increase in the monetary base does not suffice to offset the change in
either the reserve ratio or the currency-deposit ratio – more generally, the change in the
money multiplier – caused by these shocks. And so, returning again to figures 2 and 5, the
true and Divisia price and quantity indexes for the monetary aggregate respond sharply; in
both cases, the quantity index falls and the price index rises, indicative of a liquidity crunch
centered in the private financial sector that generates the loss in output shown in figure 8.
Empirically, Belongia and Ireland (2006) isolate effects quite similar to these in US data
using a vector autoregression to associate increases in the price index for monetary services
with reductions in aggregate output. Belongia and Ireland (2006) also show that these price
effects of money on output arise, too, in a real business cycle framework, that is, even in the
absence of other, New Keynesian, monetary nonneutralities.




                                              26
3.3      The Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Financial-Sector

         Shocks

As noted above with reference to the expressions (16) and (17) for the efficient level of
output and the associated welfare-theoretic measure of the output gap, the New Keynesian
model shares with the real business cycle framework the implication that output fluctuations
driven by technology shocks represent the economy’s optimal response to shifts in production
possibilities and therefore ought not to be stabilized by countercyclical monetary policies.
On the other hand, (16) and (17) also imply that the output fluctuations exhibited in figures
7 and 8 as responses to the model’s non-technology shocks are inefficient and raise the
question of whether alternatives to the benchmark settings of ρr = 0.75, ρπ = 0.30, ρg∗ = 0,
and ρgy = 0 for the parameters of the Taylor rule (21) can be found that might help the
monetary authority better accomplish both goals: Insulating output from the effects of the
other disturbances while, at the same time, allowing output to respond to the technology
shock.
   Starting with the preference shock, again as noted above, a more aggressive response to
changes in inflation, brought about through the choice of a larger value for ρπ , will produce
the more vigorous monetary tightening that prevents the economy from overheating after a
positive IS shock and, by the symmetry of this linearized model, also produce a monetary
easing that prevents output from falling below the efficient level following a negative IS shock.
Rows one and two of figure 8 show, however, that after either of the two financial-sector
disturbances, inflation remains unchanged even under the benchmark setting of ρπ = 0.30.
A further increase in the value of that policy coefficient, therefore, will not help in bringing
about the monetary easing that is required to stabilize output when the demand for reserves
or the cost of creating deposits increases. Instead, a response to one of the measures of real
economy activity, either output growth gty or the output gap gt∗ , becomes necessary.
   Intuitively, compared to the scenarios that unfold under the benchmark policy illustrated
in figures 7 and 8, setting the policy response coefficient ρgy equal to a positive number will

                                               27
produce both the monetary tightening that works to stabilize output after a positive IS shock
and the monetary easing that works to stabilize output after either of the adverse financial-
sector shocks. That same modification to the output growth coefficient in the Taylor rule,
however, will generate a monetary tightening after a positive technology shock, slowing down
the economy’s efficient adjustment to that disturbance. Instead, the appropriate monetary
policy response to all six of the model’s shocks gets generated under a Taylor rule that calls
for an aggressive reaction to changes in the welfare-theoretic measure of the output gap gt∗
defined in (17).
       Preliminary experimentation revealed that, indeed, augmenting the benchmark settings
of ρr = 0.75 and ρπ = 0.30 with positive settings for ρg∗ in the Taylor rule (21) help stabi-
lize the economy in the face of the financial-sector shocks. Settings for the key parameter
ρg∗ that are sufficiently large to provide close to full insulation against these disturbances,
however, turned out to be inconsistent with the existence of a unique dynamically stable
rational expectations equilibrium according to the Blanchard-Kahn (1980) conditions, al-
though they continued to deliver an expectationally stable and learnable minimum state
variable solution according to Evans and Honkapohja’s (2001) and McCallum’s (2009) pre-
ferred criteria. Further analysis showed that all of these problems can be sidestepped by
replacing the benchmark Taylor rule (21), featuring contemporaneous responses of the in-
terest rate to movements in inflation and the output gap, with a backward-looking variant
of the form


                                                               ∗                    y
         ln(rt /r) = ρr ln(rt−1 /r) + ρπ ln(πt−1 /π) + ρg∗ ln(gt−1 /g ∗ ) + ρgy ln(gt−1 /g y ) + εrt .


With this modified Taylor rule, the dynamically stable equilibrium is unique, expectationally
stable, and learnable even for very large values of ρ∗g .15
  15
    Consistent with the results obtained here, Bullard and Mitra (2002) also find that the determinacy,
expectational stability, and learnability properties of rational expectations equilibria in a much simpler,
textbook New Keynesian model often hinge sensitively on whether the Taylor rule has the monetary authority
responding to lagged, contemporaneous, or expected future variables, with the coefficient on the output gap



                                                      28
    Thus, figures 9 and 10 plot impulse responses of output, inflation, and the nominal
interest rate using this alternative version of the Taylor rule using the benchmark settings
of ρr = 0.75, ρπ = 0.30, and ρgy = 0 from before, together with a setting for ρg∗ = 100,
representing an extremely vigorous policy response to changes in the output gap. The
first column of figures 9 and 10 shows, in particular, that this alternative monetary policy
succeeds in insulating output almost completely (note the changing scale of the y-axes when
comparing the individual graphs presented in this first column) from the effects of shocks
to money demand, preferences, reserves demand, deposit costs, and even to the Taylor rule
itself, while still allowing the economy to respond efficiently to technology shocks. Moreover,
the third column of figures 9 and 10 reveals that, despite the very large numerical value
assigned to ρg∗ , this policy gets implemented with only modest adjustments in the short-
term interest rate, as the reduction in volatility in the output gap itself helps offset the larger
value of the response coefficient in determining the total volatility of the interest rate.
    Of course, these results lean quite heavily on the assumption that the monetary author-
ity can identify successfully the various shocks that hit the economy and thereby measure
accurately the output gap in real time. Orphanides’ (2003) careful study of Federal Reserve
policy during the 1970s raises strong doubts about whether this assumption is tenable in
practice. At a minimum, however, these results indicate that the optimal monetary response
to financial-sector shocks may differ considerably from what is prescribed by a standard Tay-
lor rule specification. And given that these shocks affect the economy through the money
multiplier as opposed to the monetary base – a point that also lies, of course, at the heart
of Friedman and Schwartz’s (1963) critique of Federal Reserve policy during the Great De-
pression – under more realistic assumptions about the information available to monetary
policymakers in real time they may require a shift in focus back to the broader monetary
aggregates as useful indicators of monetary conditions.
    Here again, therefore, the Barnett (1980) critique applies and, indeed, as emphasized by
playing a particularly important role.



                                                29
Barnett and Chauvet (2011) for the US and Rayton and Pavlyk (2010) for the UK, access
to Divisia monetary aggregates that improve on their simple-sum counterparts may become
especially useful during periods of financial crisis.16 These results suggest that it would be
highly worthwhile, in future research, to use a model like the one developed here to revisit
issues raised by Bernanke and Blinder (1988) concerning the relative roles of “credit” versus
“money” in driving fluctuations both during normal times and times of crisis and by Ireland
(2004a) and Nelson (2002, 2003) concerning the role for the monetary aggregates in New
Keynesian-style business cycle analyses. Moreover, since movements in properly-measured
price as well as quantity indexes for monetary services relate closely to movements in real
economic activity in models like those developed here and in Belongia and Ireland (2006),
associated empirical work should focus on the usefulness of these price variables as well,
both as indicators of the stance of monetary policy and as predictors of future movements
in output and employment in data from the US, UK, and other countries.17



4        Conclusion

Very few papers in economics – especially in monetary economics – remain as relevant thirty
years after publication as they were on the day when they first appeared in print. But,
both for better and for worse, William Barnett’s article from 1980 volume of the Journal of
Econometrics surely counts as one among those elite few.
       For better, the analysis conducted here demonstrates that the Divisia approach to mone-
tary aggregation first proposed by Barnett (1980) works exactly as intended within a state-of-
the-art, dynamic, stochastic, New Keynesian model of the monetary business cycle, extended
to include roles for both currency and interest-bearing bank deposits as sources of the liq-
uidity services demanded by households in general equilibrium. Within the confines of this
theoretical model, the true aggregate of liquidity services becomes an observable variable.
  16
    Anderson and Jones (2011b) and Barnett (2012) also examine and discuss the behavior of the Divisia
monetary aggregates during and in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis.
 17
    For a very recent contribution along precisely these lines, see Serletis and Gogas (2011)

                                                 30
The results of the analysis show, however, that a Divisia monetary aggregate, which can
be measured without reference to the functional forms describing tastes and technologies
and without knowledge of the values of the parameters entering into those functional forms,
tracks the true aggregate almost perfectly following a wide variety of macroeconomic shocks,
both real and nominal.
   But for worse, the Federal Reserve, like most other central banks around the world, con-
tinues to assemble and report data on simple-sum monetary aggregates alone. And, in large
part precisely because no official data on the Divisia monetary aggregates exist, virtually all
empirical work in monetary economics relies on the simple-sum measures instead. Yet Bar-
nett (1980) shows that these simple-sum measures are theoretically flawed, Belongia (1996)
and Hendrickson (2011) demonstrate that a wide range of apparently puzzling empirical
results concerning the links between money and other key macroeconomic variables stem
exclusively from the use of these simple-sum aggregates, and Barnett and Chauvet (2011)
list numerous occasions throughout post-World War II US monetary history when Federal
Reserve officials or outside observers have been led astray in making or evaluating monetary
policy by signals mistakenly gleaned from the simple-sum aggregates. The results of the
analysis conducted here confirm, with state-of-the-art monetary theory, that “measurement
matters” in all of these ways.
   Barnett (1980) concludes with reference to this quote from Irving Fisher’s (1922, pp.29-
30) treatise on index number theory:

     The simple arithmetic average is perhaps still the favorite one in use .... In fields
     other than index numbers it is often the best form of average to use. But we
     shall see that the simple arithmetic average produces one of the very worst of
     index numbers. And if this book has no other effect than to lead to the total
     abandonment of the simple arithmetic type of index number, it will have served
     a useful purpose.

In fact, Fisher’s arguments have served their useful purpose in the area of national income

                                              31
accounting and, indeed, the Federal Reserve itself now employs indexes like those advo-
cated by Fisher in its monthly measurements of industrial production. But for monetary
aggregation, even thirty years after its publication, Barnett’s work has yet to make its full
impact felt: the Federal Reserve and the scientific community continue to operate without
theoretically-coherent and empirically-reliable indexes of monetary services. The “Barnett
critique” still applies.

5.1     Household Optimization

A convenient way to characterize the solution to the household’s problem is to substitute
the shopping-time specification (2) into the utility function (6) to obtain

for all i ∈ [0, 1] and t = 0, 1, 2, .... Combining these first-order conditions with the binding
constraints leads to the expression (16) for the efficient level of output.


5.4    Monetary Aggregation

Returning to the first-order conditions from the household’s problem, note that (38), (42),
and (46) imply that
                                                   rtL = rt ,

                                        Λ1t − Λ3t = (rt − 1)Λ3t ,

and
                                    Λ1t − rtD Λ3t = (rt − rtD )Λ3t

for all t = 0, 1, 2, .... Using these relationships together with (36), (40) and (41) can be
written more compactly as

                                                                                 ω

and
                                                                                      ω
                                                     MtA                  Λ2t

                             Dt
                                = (1 − ν)                                                  .

Substituting these last two conditions back into (36) then yields

                        Λ2t
                            = [ν(rt − 1)1−ω + (1 − ν)(rt − rtD )1−ω ]1/(1−ω)                                (49)
                        Λ3t

Let the own-rate of return rtA on the monetary aggregate MtA be defined with reference to
the right-hand side of this last equation:


                     rt − rtA = [ν(rt − 1)1−ω + (1 − ν)(rt − rtD )1−ω ]1/(1−ω) .                            (50)


Then it can be verified that if the choices of currency and deposits are not of independent
interest, the household’s problem can be stated more simply as one of choosing sequences for
Bt , st (i) for all i ∈ [0, 1], Lt , ht , Ct , MtA and Mt to maximize the utility function as written
in (34) subject to the constraints

for all t = 0, 1, 2, ..., confirming that MtA can be treated as a true aggregate of monetary
services. Note also that (43), (45), (49), and (50) can be combined to obtain the expression
for the household’s demand for the true monetary aggregate MtA in terms of consumption,
the real wage, and the true opportunity cost rt − rtA that is shown in the text.
   Next, note that (45) and (46), when rewritten in nominal terms, can be combined into

where the equilibrium condition rtL = rt has also been used. Iterating forward to turn
this single-period budget constraint into an infinite-horizon budget constraint, in a manner
following Barnett (1978), requires rewriting the last three terms on the right-hand-side as

                                         rA M A + Bt − rt Lt                       rt − rtA
                                                                                             

which confirms that Barnett’s (1978) formula for the user cost uA
                                                                t of the true monetary

aggregate, restated in (23), applies here as well. Finally, note that (23), (25)-(27), (36), (38),
(40), (41), (46), (49), and (50) imply that Et = uA  A
                                                  t Mt , as indicated above in the text.




5.5      The Equilibrium System

In a symmetric equilibrium, all intermediate goods-producing firms make identical decisions,
so that Yt (i) = Yt , ht (i) = ht , Pt (i) = Pt , Ft (i) = Ft , and Qt (i) = Qt for all i ∈ [0, 1] and
t = 0, 1, 2, .... In addition, the market-clearing conditions Mt = Mt−1 + Tt , Bt = Bt−1 = 0,
and st (i) = st−1 (i) = 1 for all i ∈ [0, 1] must hold for all t = 0, 1, 2, .... After imposing these
conditions, (2), (4), (7), (10)-(33), and (35)-(48) can be collected together to form a system
of of 41 questions that determine the equilibrium behavior of the 41 variables Ct , Yt , Yt∗ , gty ,
                                                                                              Q

    As noted above in the text, most of the variables entering into this system will be non-
stationary, with the real variables inheriting a unit root from the nonstationary process (11)
for the technology shock and the nominal variables inheriting a unit root from the conduct

to include ct = Ct /Zt−1 , yt = Yt /Zt−1 , yt∗ = Yt∗ /Zt−1 , gty , gt∗ , ht , hst , ft = (Ft /Pt )/Zt−1 ,

system is rewritten in terms of these transformed variables, it implies that each transformed

Figure 3. Impulse Responses for Nominal Money Growth. Each panel shows the
       percentage-point response of the growth rate of the true monetary
       aggregate (solid line) and its simple-sum counterpart (dashed line) to a
       one-standard-deviation monetary policy shock for a different value of
       the parameter ω measuring the elasticity of substitution between
       currency and deposits.

Figure 6. Impulse Responses for Opportunity Cost Measures. Each panel shows
       the percentage-point response of the true opportunity cost of holding
       the true monetary aggregate (solid line) and the opportunity cost as
       measured more conventionally using a simple weighted average of the
       interest rates on currency and deposits (dashed line) to a
       one-standard-deviation innovation in one of the model's shocks.
