Empowering Mothers and Enhancing Early Childhood Investment: Effect on Adults Outcomes
and Children Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Skills

                                          ABSTRACT

Empowering women and enhancing children’s early development are two important goals that
are often pursued via independent policy initiatives in developing countries. In this paper we
study a unique approach that pursues both goals at the same time: empowering mothers through
tools that also advance their children’s development. A program operated by AVSI, an Italian
NGO, in a poor neighborhood of Quito, Ecuador, targets parents of children from birth to age 5. It
provides family advisor-guided parent training sessions once every two weeks for groups of six to
eight mothers and their children. We find that the program empowered women in various
dimensions, including higher labor force participation and employment, higher likelihood of a
full-time job in the formal-sector and higher wages. Treated mothers are also more likely to
continue their education, make independent decisions regarding their own finances, have greater
role in intra-household decisions, especially on issues involving children’s education and
discipline and increase parental inputs into their children’s development. We find that treated
children improve their cognitive and non-cognitive skills, for example, they are less likely to
repeat a grade or temporarily drop-out from schooling, are less absent from and have improved
behaviors in school, have better attitudes towards learning, and achieve higher scores on
cognitive tests. Applying a recently suggested factor model of children's relative non-cognitive
skills reaffirms our finding of significant gains in children non-cognitive skills. All results hold
when we estimate aggregate treatment impacts, use summary indices instead of individual
outcomes in order to account for multiple inference, when we use entropy balancing to adjust for
differences in pre-treatment covariates, and when we use other robustness checks.

1. Introduction
         Empowering women and enhancing early childhood development are important policy goals
which are often pursued as separate, discrete initiatives in developing countries. We study an approach
that exploits potential complementarity by pursuing both goals through one measure, based on
empowering mothers and teaching parenting skills that advance their children’s development.
Empowerment for mothers in this program is based on acquiring knowledge, home and personal
practices that strengthen their role in the family and community and increase awareness of their role in
their children’s education. These sessions include joint activities for mothers and their children, and
separate group activities for the children in the program.
         The accumulation of evidence that education programs are both more effective and less costly
when delivered to younger children has sharpened the focus on early childhood research and policy
(Heckman, Pinto and Savelyev 2010, Heckman et al. 2013, Gertler. et al 2014). However, questions
remain about which policy tools are most effective.
           Similarly, empowering women has been the focus of research and policy because engaging
women as equal participants in the community and economy has been seen to enhance development
outcomes (Klugman et al. 2014; Wong 2012). Doing both - empowering women in a way that also
supports early childhood development - has not been widely studied, however, it could be a means of
achieving both goals. This approach has the potential to deliver improvements in women’s
empowerment and status at home and in the community, as well as improving children’s education.
Duflo (2012) defines women’s empowerment as “improving the ability of women to access the
constituents of development – in particular health, education, earning opportunities, rights, and political
participation”. Improving mothers’ access to each of these domains can have positive effect on early
childhood, which has been shown to deliver life-long benefits (Barber and Gertler 2009, Carneiro et al.
2013, Kiernan and Huerta 20081). Evidence of spillover effects from early child development programs
on the empowerment of their mothers is scarce and needed (Baker-Henningham and Lopez-Boo 2010).
         In this paper we study the consequences of a home-preschool program designed to enhance
both women’s empowerment and children’s early childhood development. The PelCa (preescolar en la
casa – home pre-schooling) program started in Pisullì, one of the poorest neighborhoods of Quito,
Ecuador, in 2005. It is run by the Association of Volunteers in International Service (AVSI), an
international non-governmental organization founded in Italy that focuses on human development. The




1 Carneiro et al. (2013) find that maternal education improve the home environments, particularly for low-ability mothers.
Moreover, more educated mothers invest more quality time with their children (breastfeeding, reading books to children and
engaging children in more outdoor recreational activities). The authors suggest that these child investments lead to better
children’s cognitive outcomes and fewer behavioral problems. Barber and Gertler (2009), argue that encouraging women to
be more informed and active health consumers reduces child mortality, morbidity, anemia, and stunting. Kiernan and Huerta
(2008) show that economic deprivation and maternal depression negatively affect children’s cognitive and emotional outcomes,
partly because of less nurturing and parental engagement.

program is open to mothers with children aged up to three years old, and currently involves hundreds
of mothers and children.
        In the program we studied, a qualified family advisor trained groups of six to eight mothers.
Children accompanied their mothers in these group sessions, which were held every two weeks in the
NGO offices. There were three parts to each group session. In the first part, mothers received structured
training focused on strengthening their role in the family, and learned parenting techniques that
emphasized their children’s early development. At the same time, children socialized using educational
games and didactic materials. In the second part, family advisors taught mothers and children
educational activities that could be reproduced at home, to improve the quality of maternal-child
interactions and enhance mothers’ participation in child development activities. In the third part,
advisors monitored and assessed the home assignments from the previous meeting.
        The program was implemented non-experimentally, but since its initiation in 2005, new
families have joined every year. Assuming that new applicants resemble those who joined the program
earlier, we selected a control group from the applicants in 2012. Following our suggestion, the NGO
made a special effort to reach as many eligible families as possible in 2012. This provided us with a
large pool of applicants from which we selected our control group, which consisted of families that had
an older child in any grade in primary school and a younger child who would enroll in the program
jointly with his or her mother. This can be viewed as a quasi-natural experiment, and we will
demonstrate that it yields well-balanced treatment and control groups.
        We evaluate the effect on women’s empowerment after two to seven years of participation in
the program by focusing on: self-esteem, inputs into child education, labor-market participation and
earnings, allocation of decision-making within the household, and economic and social independence.
We also examine the impact on children’s educational outcomes, such as how likely children were to
repeat a grade or drop out of school, and how they fared in cognitive tests. Our evidence shows that the
program empowered women in various dimensions: mothers who participated in the program for two
to seven years are more likely to be employed, more likely to have a full-time job, and more likely to
have a formal-sector job. Mothers who have been in the program also earn higher wages, and are more
likely to manage their own money and to make independent decisions about how to spend it. Women’s
autonomy is also reflected in a higher likelihood of deciding by themselves whether to work outside the
home, and a higher likelihood of returning to school as an adult. Moreover, there is evidence that these
women take on a greater role overall in intra-household decisions, especially on matters involving
children’s education and discipline. Mothers who participated in the program increased their child
investment, for example by spending more time practicing cognitive and social skills with their children.
We also carry out an additional analysis, in which we limit the control sample to mothers who did not
enroll in the program because they did not hear about it. In this analysis, the control sample is down by
half yet the results we obtain are very similar.
                                                   2
        The program had positive effects on children: it significantly reduced the drop-out rate and
likelihood of temporarily withdrawing from school, strengthened non-cognitive skills, and improved
scores in cognitive tests (though it is precisely measured only for some sub-groups of the overall
sample).
        Allowing for heterogeneity of treatment effect by mother’s pre-program characteristics and
outcomes and by child gender reveals meaningful differences, which we use to interpret our findings.
All of the above results hold when we estimate aggregate treatment impacts, using summary indices
instead of individual outcomes, in order to account for multiple inference, when we use entropy
balancing to adjust for differences in pre-treatment covariates, and when we use other robustness checks.
        The remainder of our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present an overview of the
literature on women’s empowerment and on early childhood development. Section 3 outlines the
background and design of the quasi-natural experiment. In Section 4 we describe the data and in Section
5 we discuss the empirical analysis, , results and we explore potential mechanisms through which results
are achieved. In Section 6 we discuss robustness checks and the conclusion is in Section 7.

2. Related Literature on Early Childhood Interventions
        The present work is related to two different literatures: studies on women's empowerment and
studies on early childhood development. The literature on women's empowerment is more extensive.
Kabeer (2005) defines empowerment as the "ability to make choices" in ways that change power
relations and affect women’s education, employment, and political participation. Duflo (2012) defines
women's empowerment as improving women access and utilization of social, political and economic
opportunities. Decision-making within the household is also an important indicator of the distribution
of power within the household (Alkire 2007, Narayan et al. 2005). We will follow this approach and
explore intra-household decisions, capturing women's power relations within the household and their
access to the constituents of development (e.g. whether they are allowed to work).
        Different channels for empowering women have been explored. Education is sometimes
proposed as one of the main drivers of empowerment (Oyitso and Olomukoro 2012), but the evidence
is mixed. There is substantial evidence that education can improve cognitive skills, raise aspirations,
allow access to information, raise awareness to real conditions, and help coping with dis-equilibrium
(Kabeer 2005, LeVine 2001). More educated women also experience less domestic violence (Kabeer
2005, Sen 1999). Mocan and Cannonier (2012) find that more educated women in Sierra Leone are
“more intolerant of practices that conflict with their well-being”. It is less clear, however, whether this
change in preferences translates into behavior. Andrabi et al. (2012) show that higher maternal
education improves maternal child care, but the study does not find an effect on intra-household
decision-making.
        Women are also empowered by accumulating wealth but there is little evidence on how to

                                                    3
enhance the mechanism. Microfinance programs can facilitate the accumulation of economic assets but
evidence for a causal effect of such programs on women’s empowerment is mixed. Kabeer (2001, 2005)
suggests that women's access to credit improves women's self-perception, reduces domestic violence
and increases women's power in the household decision-making process. In households where the loan
recipient was male, the role of women in decision-making regarding loan use, enterprise management
and allocation of profits was much lower than in households where the loan recipient was a female.
However, Banerji et al. (2013) find no short- or long-run effects of micro-credit in India on women's
empowerment.
    Baker-Henningham and Lopez Boo (2010) suggest that training mothers in group parenting
sessions is a cost-effective method of service delivery but little is known about the effect of such
programs on mothers' longer term well-being and life course outcomes. Our study is the first to focus
on long-term exposure to group parenting sessions and its impact on both mothers and their children
and it contributes to the growing literature on early age interventions. Among others, we note the
Abecedarian project, High Scope Perry Preschool Program, Chicago Child-Parent Centers and the Head
Start Program. Evidence suggests that these programs led to improved schooling attainment and better
outcomes in adulthood (higher employment rate and earnings, lower crime rates). For example, the pre-
school Abecedarian project improved children’s reading and mathematics achievements, lowered grade
retention and increased completed education at adulthood (Campbell et al. 2002, Temple and Reynolds
2007). The High Scope Perry preschool program affected the schooling outcomes of girls only: by age
19 treated females had a higher school GPA and completed a higher grade (Heckman et al. 2013); by
age 27 treated females were 30 percent less likely to drop-out from high-school (Nores et al. 2005). We
note however, that these interventions target the most-disadvantaged groups and that such programs
may be unfeasible in most developing countries because they are expensive. Most related evidence in
developing countries is often based on very short interventions and small samples (see Baker-
Henningham and Lopez Boo 2010 and Nores and Barnett 2010 for a literature review). Few studies
focus on longer treatment and long-term child outcomes. Exceptions are Watanabe et al. (2005) and
Kagitcibasi et al. (2009), both providing evidence of positive effects on cognitive outcomes, while
Kagitcibasi et al. (2009) find positive effects on other socio-economic outcomes. For example, children
exposed to an early treatment entered the workforce later (due to longer schooling) and found jobs of a
higher status as young adults.
    Another related study is Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011), which evaluates the effect of home visits
and child care centers on mothers and children in Ecuador. Child care centers provide day care for the
whole day throughout the entire year, and groups of 8-10 children are supervised by a trained teacher.
Weekly home visits, each lasting about an hour, teach mothers how to stimulate and nourish their
children, in individual sessions if children are younger than three, and in groups if children are older.
Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011) find that child care centers increase mothers’ labor force participation
                                                   4
but have detrimental effects on children’s cognitive and health outcomes, while they observe the
opposite effects for home visits. The early childhood development program that we study is more
similar to the home visits than to the child centers described above. 2 However, while Rosero and
Oosterbeek (2011) can analyze short term treatment effects only3, we are able to explore long term
effects on the mother and children. Attanasio et al. (2014) also evaluate the effects of a weekly home
visit program in Colombia that targeted children 12-24 months and lasted for 18 months. They find that
enhancing mothers’ engagement with their children positively affects their cognitive and socio-
emotional domains through an increase in parental investments and find no effects on mothers’
depression (Attanasio et al. 2014, 2015).

3. Background and Research Design
     AVSI, the Association of Volunteers in International Service, is an international not-for-profit, non-
governmental organization (NGO) based in Milan, Italy. Founded in 1972, it operates in 30 countries
in Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East and it runs more than 100 long-term
projects. It started its activities in Ecuador in 2001, focusing on infant and child development and
education. In 2005 an AVSI branch was opened in Pisullí, a disadvantaged, urban neighborhood to the
northwest of Quito. In collaboration with Fundación Sembrar, a local non-profit organization, and the
local parish, AVSI funded a community development center where it implements a modified version of
PelCa. The program expanded rapidly, providing after-school programs and other services to more than
700 children, youth and their families in 2013, with more than 50 members on the local staff.



3.1 The Intervention
     PelCa is a preschool program targeted at parents of children age 5 and under, based on group-
parenting sessions. Fortnightly meetings are held in the NGO for small groups (usually six-eight
mothers – with their children), under the guidance of a family advisor. In the first part of the meeting,
children socialize with each other, playing games using didactic materials, while parents read and
discuss material about family education. In the second part of the meeting, parents and children work
together: they learn songs, educational games and various development activities that parents can
reproduce with their children at home (e.g., reading books, playing with puppets, playing building
games, etc.). The family advisor gives every child a notebook of age-appropriate activities that focus
on different areas of development, and parents and children are expected to undertake these activities


2
  The main difference between the PelCa program and the home visits analyzed by Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011)
is that in the latter mothers with their children are visited in their homes once a week, and individually if the child
is younger than 3, while in the PelCa program mothers and children go to the NGO twice a month and are taught
in groups from the beginning.
3
  Data was collected after the children in the program were exposed to treatment during 21 months (Rosero and
Oosterbeek 2011).
                                                          5
in the two weeks between the program sessions. In the last part of the meeting, the family advisors
monitor the progress made by each child and verify whether they have completed home assignments
with the parent (e.g., by having children show drawings, or having children answer questions based on
a story that was to be read to them by the parent). The family advisor gives each parent and child
reinforcement activities to perform at home in the next two weeks. These activities are geared towards
mothers and children achieving specific targets and goals.4 These NGO-set goals are the basis for the
outcomes that we evaluate in the paper.
Goals for the mother: build self-confidence and self-awareness and a greater ability to relate to their
environment and the people in their peer group; to build a sense of value in oneself and in material
assets.
At the personal level: awaken interest in life; assume responsibility through personal commitment;
enhance self-perception of own abilities and the capacity to take initiative; and to give appropriate value
to assets and saving.
At the level of relationships with the family and community: to take pleasure in dialogue, patience and
reflection; strengthen the level of involvement of each member of the family in the light of existing
dynamics; share between the couple the responsibility for the children’s education; develop an attitude
that favors the autonomy of children and teenagers; develop relationships of intimacy and solidarity
with the group in the meetings, and with neighbors in the neighborhood.
Goals for the children: facilitate children’s integral growth in different areas of development
(psychometric, language, cognitive, socio-affective).
          Families usually find out about the program via word of mouth or a poster outside the NGO. If
they express interest, AVSI employees visit the family at home to collect information about the family
circumstances, observe conditions at home, assess the need for support, and identify family weaknesses
and strengths. Children up to three years old are eligible to enter the program (so that they can participate
in the program for at least two years). The mother commits to participating in fortnightly meetings and
to performing the assigned tasks at home. The selection process also takes into account the family’s
financial standing and the proximity of the home to the NGO sites where sessions are held. Parents and
children can remain in the program until the child is 12 years old but once the child reaches five years
of age they move to the NGO PelCa school program. The application process for the PelCa pre-school
program starts at the end of April and lasts for two weeks. Approximately 50 families (the number can
vary depending on funding for that year) are selected to start the program in September.

3.2 Design: choosing a comparison group
       Our treatment group was selected from many applicants, and is made up of mothers who enrolled



4
    The goals are taken from the NGO handbook in Spanish.
                                                      6
in the PelCa preschool program and their children, who are now in primary school. In the summer of
2012, we selected a control group by mimicking the program’s selection process, but on a larger scale.
The NGO advertised the PelCa program in schools and through posters, as had been done previously
in the program. However, it extended the application period to approximately two months to reach as
many families as possible, and, indeed, attracted a much larger pool of applicants compared to other
years. We selected applicant families with a preschool-age child and, similar to our treated mothers, at
least one child enrolled in primary school. The identifying assumption is that the sample of mothers
with children of primary school age who did not participate before in PelCa but chose to do so now
with a younger child, represents a sound counterfactual for PelCa mothers and their primary-school-
age children.
        The families making up the control and treatment groups were invited to an interview in June-
July 2012. The mother participated in a structured interview, while her primary school children were
tested for cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The mother was asked to bring her children’s vaccination
certificate and birth certificate, which includes a record of the child’s birth height, weight and head
circumference and the older child's school report cards for the previous and current years. We then
selected from among the applicants, those who had an older child at a primary school age. We also held
a follow-up interview with these control and treatment groups a year later in the summer of 2013.
        In addition, control mothers were asked as to why they did not enroll in the program. As a
robustness check, we exploit this information and also re-estimate all models in Section 6 by limiting
the control sample to those who did not participate in the program due to different reasons.

4. Data
        The data were collected through face-to-face interviews with mothers and children, using a
questionnaire we developed specifically for this study.5 The questionnaire seeks information on family
members (mother, partner and children), demographic characteristics, labor-market activities (type of
job, full-time/part-time, formal/informal sector, wage, etc.), intra-household decision-making, and
parents’ inputs into child rearing. All questions targeted information current or prior to enrollment in
the program. 6 The interview lasted approximately 45 minutes. The mother then took the Big Five




5
  We piloted the survey questionnaire in January 2012, interviewing 23 treated mothers: 12 of them had a primary-
school-age child who participated in the PelCa preschool program and 11 of them had a primary-school-age child
who did not participate in the PelCa program. We revised the questionnaire following this pilot test.

  We will provide details about the questionnaire upon request.

Personality Test7 and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale.8
        Each child took cognitive tests in Spanish and mathematics.9 Data on weight, height and head
circumference at birth of the school age children were gathered through vaccination certificates and
birth certificates. For some children, this information was incomplete or unavailable.
        The control group for 2012 was 164 children and 115 mothers, while the treatment group was
219 children and 166 mothers, a total of 383 children and 281 mothers. We interviewed some
grandmothers who participated in the program on behalf of the mothers, but we excluded these families
from the analysis because we do not have grandmothers in the comparison group.
        In summer 2013, we conducted follow-up interviews. Ten female interviewers from the area
conducted home visits with all of the mothers in the sample. To obtain comparable information in the
two rounds of data collection we used the same questionnaire, but with slight modifications. Some
questions were added in order to clarify issues we encountered in the 2012 data. However, where we
introduced new questions, we also sought retrospective information. Mothers were asked to bring the
vaccination and birth certificates again (because many of these documents had been missing in the
previous year). Eventually we collected data on height at birth for 44 percent of the children, weight at
birth for 41 percent, and head circumference at birth for 38 percent. We think that the extent of missing
values for these variables preclude a meaningful analysis of this information. Mothers were also asked
to bring children's school report cards for 2010-11 and 2011-12. The children were tested again in
Spanish and mathematics, using tests appropriate for the student’s school grade. The follow-up sample
included 136 control children (83 percent) and 98 control mothers (85 percent), and from the treatment
group, 197 children (90 percent) and 150 mothers (90 percent).

4.1 Treatment-Control Comparisons: Balancing Tests
        We examine in this section whether pre-treatment covariates are balanced between treatment
and control groups. The evidence suggests that mothers and children in both groups are very similar on
observed and predetermined characteristics, supporting our view of the empirical setup as a quasi-
natural experiment. The first two columns of Tables 1-2 display the means for the treatment and control



7
  The Big Five Personality Test is based on decades of research. It consistently evaluates five broad traits of
personality through a series of questions: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness,
and neuroticism. In 1981 these factors became known as the “Big Five” to indicate the broad dimensions to which
they refer. It has since been used intensely.
8
  The Rosenberg test, developed in 1965 by Dr. Morris Rosenberg, includes 10 Likert-type questions and it is
used to evaluate the self-esteem of an individual and is widely used today by psychologists, sociologists, and
social scientists. It has been translated into various languages (e.g., French, Norwegian, Spanish, Portuguese,
Chinese, and Italian).
9 Grade specific language and mathematics tests were constructed based on national tests from Ecuador, known

as “pruebeas SER (Sistema de Evaluación y Rendición de la Educación)” and on Peruvian national tests for grades
for which Ecuadorian tests were not available.

groups, while the last two columns present the difference in means between the two groups and the
standard error.
        Mothers' characteristics (Table 1) are balanced in most of the dimensions, except that control
mothers were more likely to be employed before joining the program: 47.0 percent of treated mothers
were working versus 60.9 percent of control mothers. Control mothers were also more likely to be
working full-time. Pre-treatment paternal characteristics and most of the household characteristics are
well balanced,10 with a few exceptions: whether the family owned a house, the number of rooms and
the availability of drinkable water in the house. Overall, 3 of the 32 pre-treatment maternal
characteristics differences are significantly different at 10 percent level of significance. This is less than
10 percent. The F-test on the bottom of Table 1 on all of the pre-treatment maternal characteristics11 is
also not significantly different from zero, suggesting that the imbalance in the pre-program employment
status of the mothers is an exception. We will however include in the regressions pre-treatment control
variables to capture these differences between the treatment and control groups. It will be shown that
the estimates are not sensitive to adding these controls.
        With respect to the child characteristics (Table 2), control group children are half a year older
on average. This is probably due to the fact that we selected children from 1st to 7th grade and that, as
we will see, control children are more likely to repeat a grade and therefore be older at survey date. The
F-test on the significance of all the characteristics together suggests that overall children’s
characteristics are not linearly correlated with treatment status.

4.2 Entropy Balancing
        An alternative way to control for the differences in some of the pre-treatment characteristics is
to use entropy balancing (Hainmueller 2011). Entropy balancing is a data-preprocessing method to
achieve covariate balance. It computes the means (or higher moments of covariate distributions) of the
covariates in the treatment group and looks for a set of entropy reweights so that the means in the
reweighted control group match the means in the treatment group. We implement entropy balancing for
the means of the covariates that we will include as control variables in our analysis (child and household
pre-treatment economic characteristics). 12 Entropy balancing makes the treatment-control covariate
balance almost perfect: differences in means are not significantly different from zero for all covariates
(Table A3). 13 This approach is preferred over a propensity score matching because the former
eliminates all treatment-control imbalances. In addition, the propensity score matching requires treated



10
   Details are provided in the Table A1 and A2 in the Appendix.
11
   Pre-treatment characteristics related to intra-household decisions before treatment are included.
12
   We also include an indicator of whether mothers were working full-time before treatment.
13
   We also obtain balanced samples through entropy balancing when we consider the children’s samples or when
we pool the two years of data together.

                                                      9
and controlled units to be comparable within the common support. As a consequence, the individuals
who do not lie in the common support (5 out of 281 mothers in 2012 and 22 out of 496 mothers in the
pooled data) are dropped from the sample.14

4.3 Relative Measure of Children's Non-cognitive Skills
          To study the program effects on children's non-cognitive skills, we use information from our
survey and adopt a novel approach suggested by Heckman et al. (2016) and Kautz and Zanoni (2014),
to construct a relative measure of non-cognitive skills. This approach is motivated by the concern that
the standard non-cognitive measures are partly a function of cognitive attainment (Heckman and Kautz
2012). For example, empirical evidence suggests that measures of non-cognitive skills are related to
students’ school grades (Duckworth and Tsukayama 2012, Borghans et al. 2011). The new suggested
factor model is a relative measure of non-cognitive skills net of related cognitive skills. Following
Heckman et al. (2016) and Kautz and Zanoni (2014), we use the following factor model of relative non-
cognitive skills15:
𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑘,𝑗 (𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾𝑗 , 𝑗 = 𝐶, −𝐶) are the observable outcomes of children’s cognitive skills (𝑗 = 𝐶)
and non-cognitive skills ( 𝑗 = −𝐶 ). 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ and 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ are two latent variables of
cognitive skills and non-cognitive skills, respectively. Hence, the factor model can be formulated by:

                                     𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑘,𝐶 = 𝛼𝑘,𝐶 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ + 𝜀𝑘,𝐶

                      𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑘,−𝐶 = 𝛼𝑘,−𝐶 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ + 𝛽𝑘,−𝐶 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ + 𝜀𝑘,−𝐶


where 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ and 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ represent the common factors in the model, and 𝜀𝑘,𝑗 (𝑗 =
𝐶, 𝑁𝐶) indicates the specific factor of outcome 𝑘. The factor loadings are denoted by (𝛼𝑘 , 𝛽𝑘 ), in
which the first element is normalized to one to correctly identify the parameters.
          In the first equation we assume that observable outcomes on cognitive skill (𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑘,𝐶 ) depend
only on the cognitive skills factor, while the second equation implies that the remaining outcomes
( 𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑘,−𝐶 ) depend on factors of both cognitive and non-cognitive. Hence, the latent variable
𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ can be referred as a measure relative to the cognitive skills. The model is estimated
through a standard maximum likelihood procedure. We replace children’s cognitive skill and non-
cognitive skill outcomes by predicted latent variables from the factor analysis, and finally we re-
estimate the average treatment effects.


14
   For purposes of robustness, we also re-estimated the effects of the program through a propensity score matching,
with and without replacement, and the results are very similar to the estimates we present in the paper (these
results are available upon request).
15 Kautz and Zanoni (2014) use factor model to predict the pre-treatment cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

They use predicted values as confounding variables for matching, as well as control variables in regressions.

5. Empirical Strategy and Results
        We estimate the effect of participating in the program on the outcomes of interest using the
following regression model:
      𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 + 𝛽2 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖 + 𝛽3 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖
                        + 𝛽4 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖 + 𝛽5 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝐹𝐸𝑡 + 𝛽6 𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙𝐹𝐸𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
where 𝑖 is the individual and 𝑡 is time. 𝑦𝑖𝑡 is a vector of maternal and child outcomes of interest. Since
we face a multiple outcomes problem, we will also compute summary indices 1617 for domains of
outcomes. 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 is a dummy equal to 1 when mother and child participate in the PelCa program
and 0 otherwise. To shed light on heterogeneous treatment effects by number of years of participation
in the program, we will also use the specification outlined above with a linear effect of number of years
a mother/child participated in the program. Exposure to the program varies from two years and four
months to seven years and eleven months.
     𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖 includes year of birth, birth order, number of siblings as of 2005, i.e.
before the program started, and gender. 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖 are pre-treatment household
demographic characteristics: mother’s and father’s age, their civil status (married, lived together,
mother was divorced, separated, widow, single) at the time of the birth of the first child, and the parents’
level of education before the birth of the first child, a dummy equal to 1 if the mother was born in Quito,
a dummy equal to 1 if the parents came from the same city, and the number of children the mother had
in 2005. 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖 are pre-treatment household economic characteristics: whether the
mother worked before treatment, whether the father worked, the mean firm size of mother’s and father’s
employer, average monthly family income before treatment. 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝐹𝐸𝑡 is a dummy equal to 1 when the
observation corresponds to 2013, 0 if 2012; 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term, clustered at the mother level when we
run regressions pooling the observations in the two years together or when we analyze outcomes for
children. 𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙𝐹𝐸𝑖 are school fixed effects. 18 They are included when we analyze outcomes for
children. A more detailed description of the control variables is provided in the Appendix.

5.1 Results based on Summary Indices

        As we note in Section 3.1, the primary purposes of the PelCa program are to empower mothers,
harmonize intra-family relations, and increase investment in education in early childhood. The breadth



16
   We followed Kling et al. (2007) to construct each summary index as an “equally weighted average of z-scores
of its components, with the sign of each measure oriented [...] so that more beneficial outcomes have higher scores.
The z-scores are calculated by subtracting the control group mean and dividing by the control group standard
deviation.”
17
   We developed a Stata package “mseffect” to calculate the mean effect size on the summary index with the
advantage that we account for different weights, reversibility of outcome sign, and different types of robust
standard errors. The Stata package “mseffect” is available at the online appendix to this paper.

   55 are the number of schools that children attend in 2012.

of the goals implies that the consequences of the program can be measured in multiple domains. We
decide to measure the following domains, each of which contains multiple outcomes for mothers and
children. For mothers, the domains (and specific outcomes) are: labor-market outcomes (whether
working, working full-time, working with a contract and average family monthly income), mothers'
economic and social independence (whether she has control over her own money, participates in
voluntary activities, is currently studying and whether she has a role in her own employment decisions),
mothers’ intra-household decision-making (role in decisions regarding child’s education, health, and
discipline, expenditures in general and on food, having children, use of contraceptives, own health),
mothers' child investment (own time inputs with child, aspirations/expectations for child’s education),
mothers’ self-esteem (Rosenberg scale) and Big Five personality traits (agreeableness,
conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism and openness to experience). Summary statistics on the
domains indices and individual outcomes are presented in Table 3, in panel A for mother’s labor market
outcomes, in panel B for mother’s economic and social independence outcomes, in panel C for mother’s
role in intra-household decision making, in panel D for mother’s child’s investment, in panel E for
mother’s non-cognitive skills and fertility choices, and in panel F for the father’s labor market outcomes.
        For children, the domains (and outcomes) are: test scores (language and mathematics test score),
school dropout and grade repetition, non-cognitive I: attitudes towards schooling (whether child likes
school from both their own and their mothers' perspectives, and whether the child chose a book as
gift19), and non-cognitive II: absences and behavior in school.
        Before presenting the detailed estimates of the effects on each specific outcome, we analyze
each domain by creating domain-specific summary indices. This allows us to control for the potential
problem of over-rejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. Because different outcomes
have different data scales, simply averaging the estimators for the treatment effect is not likely to
produce a meaningful statistic. To address this concern, we follow the summary-index approach per
Kling et al. (2007). The summary index of multiple outcomes is the average of z-scores of each outcome
variable. Z-scores are calculated by subtracting the control mean from the outcome and dividing by the
control standard deviation. This summary index is a special case of the z-score20 and is identical to the
mean effect size of treatment if there is no missing value.21 In general, the sign of the summary index



19
   At the end of each interview, children were offered a gift. They could choose between a book and a game. We
interpret the choice of a book as interest in schooling activities.
20
   Here we replace the minuend and the divisor in the z-score by the control group mean and standard deviation
respectively. In other words, we do require some dispersion in the controlled outcomes to guarantee the validity
of standardization.
21
   In the regression specification this approach yields standardized estimators as follows: the treatment effects for
𝐾 outcomes are aggregated and reflected in a single standard normal statistic,
                                                 1    𝜷1k

reveals information on the direction of the aggregate impact of a class of outcomes, and the more the
summary index deviates from zero, the stronger is the implied aggregate effect.
        Estimated effects on summary indices of mothers based on the 2012 data (panel A) and on the
pooled 2012-13 data (panel B) are presented in Table 4. We report estimates from three different
specifications, with only the treatment indictor as a covariate (column 1), with child and household
demographic characteristics as controls (column 2) and with the addition of household economic
characteristics as additional controls. Based on the fully specified regression (column 3), we conclude
that the program enhances mother’s participation in the labor market; the treatment effect on the
corresponding summary index based on the 2012 data is 0.482 (se=0.098) and based on the pooled
2012-13 data it is 0.503 (se=0.098). These positive estimates are precisely measured and are practically
unchanged after controlling for child and household demographics (column 2) and for economic
covariates (column 3) as well. The entropy balancing estimates in columns 4-6 are very similar to the
unweighted estimates presented in columns 1-3.
        The corresponding treatment estimates on mothers’ economic and social independence are also
positive and large, 0.366 (se=0.076) when using the 2012 data and 0.276 (se=0.056) when using the
pooled 2012-2013 data. A similar positive treatment effect is evident for the household decision-making
outcomes, albeit the estimated coefficient for this summary index is smaller, 0.126 based on the 2012
data and 0.093 based on the 2012-13 pooled sample. The program encouraged an increase in parental
investment in early child development. The estimated effect on the overall index capturing mothers’
investment is positive and significant, 0.207 (se=0.065). This positive effect is seen in improvements
in several measures of children’s outcomes (test scores, drop-out rates, repetition). It is possible that the
better education outcomes for children were the result of other improvements generated by the program,
such as the increase in family income, and the direct training in cognitive and non-cognitive skills that
the children received in the biweekly meetings with the family adviser. We will discuss this further
when we present evidence of the effect of the PelCa program on children.
        We note again that the estimates for these summary indices are robust to the inclusion of control
variables and also to a re-weighting with entropy balancing. Taken together, these results suggest that
we can gain further insights by examining in detail the effect on the mothers’ outcomes. However, we
do not find a strong average treatment effect on mothers’ self-esteem and on personality traits (openness



where 𝜷1𝑘 indicates the average treatment effect for outcome 𝑘 and 𝜎𝑘𝐶 denotes the standard deviation of the
𝑘 th control outcome. Having included the covariates, the 𝐾 average treatment effects (𝜷𝟏 ) and sample variances
can be easily acquired through a linear regression. By doing so, the above equation can be thought of as a point
estimator representing a collection of standardized treatment effects. However, this paper also takes into account
the covariance of effects and therefore adapt a seemingly uncorrelated regression (O’Brien 1984, Kling et al.
2007):
                                             𝐘 = 𝑰𝑲 ⨂(𝑻 𝑿)𝜷 + 𝝊
where 𝑻 is the treatment indicator(s), and 𝑿 consists of controlled regressors as well as a constant term.

                                                       13
to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism): the estimated effect on the
summary index of these aspects is small (0.045) and not precisely measured22. This contrasts with
Kabeer (2001), who finds that access to credit improves women’s self-esteem. However, our findings
do not necessarily imply the absence of a treatment effect on self-esteem or personality traits, as it could
also be that the instruments used to measure these outcomes were not the most appropriate.

Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
           Next, to gain more insight into the treatment effects on mothers, we explore treatment
heterogeneous effects. Table 5 presents the aggregate-estimated effect on the summary indices with
control for all covariates and for subsamples of mothers based on the 2012 data. We first examine the
subsamples of mothers by pre-treatment working conditions: this evidence is presented in columns 1-2
of Table 5. Among the group of treated mothers, 148 reported that they were working when their
interviewed child was born, and 133 reported they were not working at that time. Our estimates indicate
that the program had larger effect on labor market outcomes of mothers who were not working before
joining PelCa, 0.794 (se=0.191) versus 0.340 (se=0.126), the F-test strongly rejecting that they are
equal (at 5 percent significance level).
           For intra-household decisions, the same pattern emerges between the two treated subsamples.
Although the F-statistic is less significant, the estimated effect for mothers who were not working before
PelCa is greater, 0.213 versus 0.086, respectively. The program has the same effect for the two groups'
summary measure of economic and social independence outcomes (0.351 and 0.484, respectively).
Interestingly, the average effect on child investment comes mainly from the effect among mothers who
worked at baseline (0.373) with practically no effect among mothers who did not work before enrolling
in the program. The mothers with a higher pre-program employment rate might have had a more
enriched upbringing, which complemented the knowledge about child rearing acquired during the
program.
           In columns 3-4, we present estimates by sub-samples stratified by mother’s pre-program
educational attainment (up to/more than primary school education). These are almost equal samples,
144 and 136, respectively. The treatment effect on the labor market index for the higher education
mothers is 0.611 (se=0.163), versus 0.462 (se=0.130) in the lower education sample, both estimates
being statistically significant. A similar heterogeneous pattern is seen in the effect on mother's role in
family decision-making, larger for the more educated mothers, 0.205 (se=0.087) versus 0.098
(se=0.076), though the difference is not statistically significant. We find a similar effect size on the
summary index of all mothers’ economic and social independence outcomes for both groups (0.420 vs.




22   When we evaluate the effects on a summary index for fertility choices separately we find no effects.

                                                         14
0.386). The effect on child investment is strikingly different however for the two groups, 0.320
(se=0.105) for less-educated mothers and 0.070 (se=0.100), for more educated mothers, and the
difference is statistically significant. One possible explanation is that mothers with lower education
levels are less skilled in child rearing and hence have higher marginal benefits from their participation
in the PelCa program.
        Next, we explored heterogeneous treatment effects by mothers’ pre-treatment role in decision-
making. We expect that mothers who initially (before 2005) were less involved in family decision-
making would benefit more from the program.23 The estimates in Table 5, columns 5-6, suggest that
this group had larger gains in the labor market and in household decision-making. With respect to the
latter effect, the difference is striking, 0.197 (se=0.073) versus -0.017 (se=0.083).
        We next examine heterogeneity in the treatment effects by child gender. The results are
presented in Table 6. Based on 2012 data, the treatment effect on labor market outcomes does not vary
by the child gender, 0.534 for mothers of boys vs. 0.500 for mothers of girls. The effect on child
investment is larger for boys (0.268 vs. 0.193) but the difference is not statistically significant.
Interestingly, mothers of boys have also a larger and significant treatment effect on the score in the
Rosenberg self-esteem scale test and the Big Five Personality Traits test (0.177 vs. -0.021). However,
mothers of girls have larger treatment effects on intra-household decision-making (0.161, significant at
5 percent level, versus 0.079 and not significant) and on economic and social independence outcomes
(0.471, significant at 1 percent level, versus 0.323, significant at 1 percent level).
        In the rest of the paper we will study which specific mother’s and child’s outcomes drive the
response of our aggregate measures. First we will present and discuss estimates based on the full sample,
with and without the pre-treatment covariates. Second, we will check if our results hold when the sample
is reweighted through entropy balancing. Finally, we will perform other robustness checks.

5.2 Estimated Effects on Mothers’ Specific Outcomes
Labor-Market Outcomes
     The estimates based on the 2012 data are presented in panel A of Table 7 and those based on the
pooled 2012-13 data are presented in panel A of Table 8. Labor-market outcomes reflect the
empowerment and emancipation of women. As we pointed out in the previous section, the effect on the
summary index in Table 4 suggests an overall significant improvement in mothers’ employability and
family income, and the evidence in Tables 7-8 strengthens this conclusion. Treated mothers are 17.6




23
   We made use of pre-treatment variables of mothers’ intra-household decisions. After calculating the number of
total household decisions that mothers made in 2005, we divide the full sample into two by the mean of total
decisions. In the 2012 sample of mothers there are 179 and 93 mothers who made more decisions and fewer
decisions respectively.

                                                      15
percent more likely to be working, 20.7 percent more likely to be working full-time and 20.4 percent
more likely to be working in the formal sector. These estimated effects relative to the untreated mothers
are an increase of 36 percent, 130 percent and 230 percent, respectively, indicating a large increase in
mothers’ employability.24 Results based on the pooled 2012-13 data are very similar. All these estimated
coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 1 percent significance level, and they are not
affected by adding any of the control variables in the regression. Moreover, we find that treated mothers
have more stable employment: 69 percent of the working mothers from the program were working in
both 2012 and 2013, whereas only 49 percent of the working mothers in the control group were working
in both years.
     Another important result in Table 7 shows that the 2012 average monthly income of treated families
is $44.48 higher than the families in the control group – a finding that we attribute largely to increased
wages for mothers. The median wage of workers in the neighborhood is the minimum wage ($292 per
month in 2012) and, therefore, the income gain from the program is large. In 2013 we collected the data
on mothers’ wages. Using this information we estimate that family income is up mainly because of an
increase in mothers’ wages: treated mothers earn $13.33 (se=4.87) more per week than control mothers,
i.e. more than $57 extra per month (Table 8, panel A), while fathers' wages are not significantly different
in the two groups. Our result of a significant impact on mothers’ wages without any similar effect on
the spouse is in contrast to the findings reported in Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011) who study the effect
of child care centers on labor market outcomes of mothers. They report an estimated increase in the
likelihood that a mother is working by 22 percent25 and of household income by $8026, but unlike in
the PelCa program the latter is not driven by a rise in mothers’ earnings, but by the partners’ income.
Actually Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011) even find that home visits reduce the proportion of mothers
working by 17 percent, while leaving mothers’ income unaffected; however, we note that our study is
based on a longer term follow-up and that the long term effect of the home visits program might be
different than the short term effect reported in Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011).

Economic and Social Independence
     As seen from Table 4, the effect on mothers’ independence from an economic and social
perspective is very large. The evidence presented in panel B of Tables 7 and 8 shows that treated mothers
in 2012 are 21.3 percent (se=0.056) more likely to manage their own money. Relative to the control
group mean (44.7 percent), this is a 47.7 percent increase. Again, these effects are unchanged when we



24
   The types of jobs that treated mothers hold are typically low-skilled jobs: mainly domestic cleaners, but also
seamstresses and shopkeepers. More details on the job categories are available upon request.
25
   The child care centres’ effect on mothers’ employability is stronger than the PelCa program effect (22 percent
vs. 16.4 percent), but it goes in the same direction.
26
   Please note that household income in Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011) is measured in 2007, while in the current
analysis it is measured in 2013, making the two incomes not perfectly comparable.
                                                       16
add to the regression each set of control variables and when we expand the sample to include also the
2013 data.
        Another sign of the program’s effect on women’s empowerment is a larger proportion (8.1
percent more, se=0.036) of treated mothers who are studying at the survey date, which is about 155
percent higher than the rate of mothers in the control group. This estimate is significant at the 5 percent
level and is unchanged even after adding all the control variables. When using the pooled 2012-13 data,
the treatment effect on this outcome is 8.5 percent (se=0.031). A concern may be that entering the job
market may lower the incentives and time for studying, and mothers who participated in the program
were more likely to be working. To address this issue, we check whether mothers who quit studying in
2013 also found a job in 2013; we find little evidence of such correlation.
        More evidence of the program’s effect on women’s empowerment is based on the program effect
on mothers’ role in the decision whether she can work. In the 2012 survey, we asked the mother who
decides whether she can work. Treated mothers were 13.2 percent (se=0.044) more likely to report that
this decision is taken by themselves or jointly with their partner. The estimated impact relative to the
control group is 16.4 percentage points higher. This holds true when we pool data from the 2012 and
2013 surveys: treated mothers are 10.4 percent (se=0.031) more likely to have a role in this decision.
Both estimates are statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Here as well, adding controls and using
a weighted regression does not move the point estimates at all.

Household Decision-Making
       Treated mothers are more likely to make decisions alone or with their partners about issues
related to children's education (9.9 percent effect, significant at the 1 percent level) and on children’s
discipline (8.7 percent effect, significant at the 5 percent level), which are 11.6 and 10.4 percent greater,
respectively, than the outcome means of control mothers. These estimated effects remain unchanged
when controls are added. In the 2012 and 2013 pooled data, we estimated similar effects. However, we
find no effect on the other domains (intra-household decisions on spending, on having children, on
contraceptives and on what to do when children are ill). In the follow-up survey in 2013, we also
collected intra-household decision outcomes on who decides on issues related to mothers’ health, on
purchasing important items and on whether mothers can visit friends and relatives. Effects on these
intra-household decisions are non-conclusive. When stratifying the sample by length of participation in
the program (Tables A10-A11), we find that mothers who have been in the program for a longer period
of time are more likely to be involved in household decision-making.
        Together with the results based on the single-treatment dummy, it seems safe to conclude that
mothers participating in the PelCa program assume greater intra-household responsibilities and
participate more fully in intra-household decision-making.
        Access to credit was also found to have a positive effect on women’s power in household

                                                     17
decision-making, for decisions related to the loan (Kabeer 2001, 2005). The effect of access to credit
seems higher than what we find here. However, this might be due to the lower initial power of women
who received the loan in the analysis by Kabeer (2001, 2005), where 20 percent of women in the
comparison group had some sort of role in decision-making, compared to the women in our study, where
even before the treatment, 70/80 percent of women had some power within the household.

Mothers’ Child Investments
        The program is intended to improve children’s outcomes by enhancing investments in children’s
cognitive and non-cognitive skills. We therefore asked mothers in the 2012 survey how much time per
week they spend interacting with their children in a variety of activities. Table 11 presents evidence on
forms of child investment that we aggregated in the overall respective index. The PelCa program
enhanced three of the four types of maternal investment that we considered. The estimates show that
treated mothers are more likely to have conversations with children (4 percent effect, significant at 5
percent level) and also more likely to listen to and talk to their children about the books or other material
they read (10 percent effect, significant at 5 percent). Treated mothers also invest more time in playing
educational leisure games (for example dancing) with children (6.6 percent effect, se=0.025). We find
no similar effects on mothers going to the library regularly with children (2 percent effect, se=0.040).
        Taken together, the results suggest that participation in the PelCa program has increased
mothers’ investment in their children, in the form of increased mother-child educational interaction and
recreational activities. In the next section we will report positive effects of the PelCa program on
children’s schooling and non-cognitive outcomes and we view the above evidence on maternal
investment as indication of a possible mechanism through which the program might have improved
child development. These reduced form effects are similar to findings about the effect of a home visiting
program in Colombia that increased varieties of play materials and play activities in the home and also
improved children’s cognitive, language and socio-emotional development (Attanasio et al. 2014).
Using a structural model, Attanasio et al. (2015) provide evidence that directly links these parental
investments in children to the children’s improved cognitive outcomes.

Treatment Effect by Number of Years in the Program
        We estimated the treatment effect where exposure is measured by number of years in the
program. This specification imposes a linear effect of years in the program. We prefer this specification
over estimating separate regressions using stratified samples by number of years in the program because
of sample size considerations. The number of years that mothers in our sample participated in the
program ranges from two to eight and the mean is 5.5 years. We note that when using a linear effect
specification of years in the program as a treatment measure, the summary index cannot be calculated
because the treatment variable is no longer binary. In Tables A8 and A9 we report the linear effect
estimate for each of the mothers’ outcomes. Most of the estimates are positive and significantly different
                                                     18
from zero. The pattern of positive or no effects in these two tables is consistent with the estimates we
present in earlier tables. For example, the intensity of treatment measured as number of years in the
program has no effect on mothers’ role in decision making regarding food expenditure, having children
and use of contraceptives (Table A8), which is exactly in line with the evidence presented in Tables 8-
9, where we use a simple indicator of program participation as a measure of treatment.
        Next, we re-estimated the effect on mothers’ and children’s outcomes by two subsamples --
whether the treated enrolled in the program before 2007 or from 2007. Enrollment in early years is
positively correlated with the length of time mothers were in the program, and therefore it is an
alternative approach to assess the effect of treatment intensity. The resulting estimates are reported in
panels A of Tables A10-A11. Overall, the estimated effects on labor market outcomes, mothers’
economic and social independence and mothers’ care of children are larger for early participants than
participants who joined later. For example, the effect on probability of making intra-household
decisions among mothers who joined the program early is 0.195, while for later participants (from 2007)
this effect is small and non-significant. The results based on the pooled sample of 2012 and 2013 present
a similar pattern. The results presented in Tables A12-A13 suggest that the effect on children’s overall
summary indices for mothers who started the program before 2007 is positive and significant (0.138,
se=0.063), whereas it is smaller and not significant for mothers who enrolled in the program later (0.109,
se=0.094). However, we cannot reject the possibility that the two estimates are not statistically different
from each other.

5.3 Effect on Children’s Outcomes
        The estimated effect of the program on children’s outcomes are presented in Table 12. In the
first row we present the program impact on summary index of children’s outcomes and in rows 2-4 we
present the estimates on the specific outcomes that make this index.27 The effect on the summary index
is based on fewer observations than the sample size of each of the detailed outcomes because there are
missing values for some of these outcomes, mostly for test scores, because not all the children were
tested in both subjects. The estimated effect on the summary index of children’s outcomes is positive
and significant, 0.195 (se=0.055), suggesting that children are positively affected by participating in the
PelCa program. We note again that this estimate is not sensitive at all to adding child, household
demographics and household economics controls, nor to the entropy balancing.
        The estimated effect on the average of the test scores in Spanish language and mathematics is



27The effect on the summary index is estimated through a seemingly uncorrelated regression which considers
only outcome observations that are all observable. However, when looking at data on children’s report cards, 193
out of 383 report cards do not contain information about non-cognitive II index (i.e. the school absence and the
behavior of the child) and, therefore, the non-cognitive II outcomes are excluded in the overall summary index.
Specifically, the overall summary index is made up of outcomes of tests scores, schooling dropout and grade
repetition, and non-cognitive I: attitudes towards schooling.
                                                      19
0.115 (se=0.103) when including all the controls. This implies that treated children have marginally
higher school performance. This effect becomes clearer when we divide the children’s sample by gender.
Table 13 reports the heterogeneous effects on children’s outcomes by gender and mothers’ education.
In columns 1 and 2, the estimated summary indices are based on 191 girls and 192 boys, separately.
The PelCa program increased girls' average test score by 0.378 (se=0.144) and boys’ by 0.012
(se=0.147). The effect on girls is larger and precisely measured and the difference between the two
groups is statistically significant. The F-test statistic for this difference is 3.146, significant at 10 percent
level. These results are different from Rosero and Oosterbeek (2011), who do not find significant gender
differences in the (positive) treatment effects of home visits on children’s cognitive outcomes. The High
Scope Perry Preschool program however had stronger effects on female students (Heckman et al. 2013).
        We also estimated the program effect on this cognitive outcome when we stratified the child
sample by the mother’s educational levels. The results are presented in Table 13, columns 3-4. We
divide the full sample of children into two groups according to whether their mothers had completed
primary school; our data show that 207 mothers finished up to primary school, and 176 mothers have
more than primary education. The estimates in columns 3-4 suggest that the effect of the program on
this cognitive index is higher for children of less educated mothers (0.341, se=0.117). The respective
estimated effect on children with more educated mothers is actually negative though imprecisely
measured (-0.193, se=0.154). F-statistics for group differences in the treatment effects are reported in
square brackets and show that the estimated impacts for the two groups are significantly different. The
negative effect on children of more educated mothers could be related to the higher employment rate of
these mothers before and after they joined the program and also to the lower increase in child investment
during the program. We have noted above the lower gain in early childhood investment in children of
educated mothers that could be explained by the small impact the program had on time inputs of these
mothers into child rearing. The estimates presented in Table 13 columns 5-6 provide additional support
for this explanation. In these columns we present program effect on stratified samples by mother’s pre-
program employment status and find that the effect of the program on test scores was much higher for
the sample of children whose mother did not work at baseline, 0.302 (se=0.180) versus -0.092
(se=0.122).
        The effect size on children’s dropout rates and grade repetition presented in Table 12 is -0.192
(se=0.082) in a specification without covariates; it practically remained unchanged, -0.182 (se=0.073),
when adding all the relevant controls, clearly indicating that treated children generally have improved
educational attainment due to the program. The estimates presented in Table 13 suggest that impacts on
girls' dropout rate or grade repetition (-0.256, se=0.089) are larger than on boys' (-0.087, se=0.116), and
the difference is marginally significant. The negative effect on these outcomes is in line with evidence
from other pre-school early childhood programs such as the Abecedarian project, the High Scope Perry
Preschool program and the Chicago Child-Parent Centers, where grade retention is significantly
                                                       20
lowered for treated students (Nores et al. 2005, Temple and Reynolds 2007).
       In Table 12 we also observe that the estimated effect on children’s attitudes towards schooling
(non-cognitive I) is less precise (0.104, se=0.075). However, when the sample is stratified by gender
(Table 13), the point estimate is positive and significant among male participants. The estimated effect
on this index is 0.231 (se=0.100) for boys, and smaller for girls (0.137, se=0.105).
       Among 383 children, 190 have information on their report cards about school absence and
behavior in school (non-cognitive II). The estimated mean effect size of the program is 0.286 and is
statistically significant at 5 percent level. In particular, in Table 13 we present a virtually large
improvement in the school attendance and behavior for children whose mothers have poorer educational
background (0.483, se=0.131). On the other hand, it seems that children who have more-educated
mothers, after participating in the program, did not make a progress in this dimension, compared to
controlled children with better educated mothers.

Results Based on Relative Measures of Children's Non-cognitive Skills
         Next, we apply the approach described in Section 4.3 to create the factor scores of children's
relative non-cognitive skills, which can be viewed as measures relative to the cognitive skills by
construction. We propose two specifications of the factor model to predict the relative measure of non-
cognitive skills. First, Duckworth and Tsukayama (2012) and Borghans et al. (2011) have empirically
shown that standard non-cognitive measures are correlated with students' scores. We then assume that
tests scores depend on cognitive skills, and remaining outcomes depend on both cognitive and non-
cognitive skills. This results in a non-cognitive skill factor that is relative to students' test scores
(panels A of Tables 14-15). Second, one might argue that schooling dropout and grade repetition
outcomes, which are measures of students' perseverance, could also be direct functions of cognitive
outcomes. Then we further allow the dropout and repetition variables to depend on the cognitive skill
factor; and as a consequence, this specification generates a non-cognitive skills factor which is relative
to test scores, and the schooling dropout and grade repetition as well (panels B of Tables 14-15).
Furthermore, considering that only half of the children provided their report card information, we
construct our relative non-cognitive skill variable in two different ways, namely Non-cognitive Skills I
and Non-cognitive Skills II. The first measure is constructed on the basis of outcomes including
schooling dropout, grade repetition, whether the child likes school (from both theirs own and their
mothers’ points of view), and whether the child chooses books as a gift. The Non-cognitive Skills II
further includes outcomes of school absence and behavior in school. It has a smaller sample size as it
is based on the children’s sample whose report cards contain relevant information about absence and
behavior in school.
        The estimated results are presented in Tables 14-15. Table 14 shows positive and significant
treatment effects of the program on children’s relative non-cognitive skills, based on both the

                                                    21
unweighted sample and the reweighted sample by entropy balance. In Table 15, we stratify the sample
by children’s gender, mothers’ pre-treatment educational levels and working status. The point estimates
on the two relative non-cognitive skills variables consistently suggest that both male and female
students made progress on their non-cognitive skills through their participation in the Pelca program.
The estimates for the female student subsample are higher and statistically stronger than those for the
male students, though the statistical difference of effects by gender are insignificant. The estimates
within subsamples by mothers’ educational attainment show that children of less educated mothers
benefited more from the program as seen from columns 3-4 of Table 15. These estimates are positive
and statistically significant, while they are small and insignificant for children of more educated
mothers. In comparison to the results based on the original non-cognitive measures presented in Tables
12-13, the estimates in Tables 14-15, based on the full or stratified samples, tell pretty much the same
story.
         Moreover, after separating the cognitive component from non-cognitive measures, regressions
by mothers’ pre-treatment working status show that the treatment effects on children whose mothers
did not work before are higher than children whose mothers worked before (columns 5-6 of Table 15).
However, this is slightly opposite to the estimates using unadjusted non-cognitive measure presented
in Table 13, which show that children of mothers with prior work experience had a larger improvement
in their non-cognitive skills. Nonetheless, F-test statistics (columns 5-6 of both Table 13 and 15)
indicate that these differences are fairly insignificant.

6. Robustness Checks
Evidence on Entropy Balancing: In this section we examine whether treatment effects are robust to
reweighting the sample with entropy balancing. The results after imposing entropy balancing are
reported in columns 4-6 of Tables 4, Tables 7-12, Table 14 and online appendix Tables A3-A6. With
respect to mothers’ outcomes, we also calculate summary indices for the reweighted sample. The
estimated effects on the indices of mothers’ labor-market outcomes, independence and household
decision-making exhibit similar patterns to those previously reported. The estimated impacts on
summary indices tend to suggest a slightly larger overall effect on mothers’ employment in 2012 (0.577
vs. 0.482 in Table 7). However, the 95 percent confidence interval with re-weighting (0.388, 0.766)
overlaps with the confidence interval without re-weighting. The pooled data in Table 8 tell the same
story. When it comes to disaggregated labor-market outcomes of mothers, the estimated parameters
remain roughly the same: in 2012 treated mothers are 21.6 percent more likely to be working (the
estimated coefficient in the reweighted sample is slightly higher than in the sample without reweighting,
where we estimated a 17.6 percent increase), 23.4 percent more likely to be working full-time (20.7
percent without reweighting), and 22.0 percent more likely to be working in the formal sector (20.4
percent without reweighting). These estimates are not statistically different from the estimates in the

                                                     22
original sample. The same pattern is observed regarding the estimated effects on average monthly
family income in 2012, and mothers’ wage in 2013.
          The estimated effect on mother’s independence does not change much either when we use the
entropy re-weighting. Treated mothers are 20.5 percent more likely to control their own money,
consistent with the 22.2 percent likelihood we found earlier. The effects of the program on other
outcomes are also similar to previous results: treated mothers in the reweighted sample are
approximately 9.5 percent more likely to be studying in 2012 or 2013 or both, and they are about 11.6
percent more likely to participate in making the decision on their job status. We find small effects on
mothers’ engagement in social voluntary activities. Again, the confidence interval at 1 percent for
economic and social independence outcomes based on the reweighted sample overlaps greatly with the
estimates using the original sample.28
          The estimated effects on intra-household decision-making also exhibit the same pattern with
entropy re-weighting: positive effect on mother's power in decisions on children's education and
children's discipline (columns 4-6 in Tables 9-10) and no significant effect on other decision-making
outcomes. The estimated aggregate effect on intra-household decision-making in 2012 is 0.124
(statistically significant at the 1 percent level), which is, again, almost identical to the previous result
without re-weighting (0.126). In the pooled data, the estimated effects on the indices using the weighted
data are smaller and less significant, which is consistent with our finding using the unweighted data,
partly because the effects on the additional outcomes in the panel data are negligible.
          The estimated effects on mothers’ child investment are similar after we re-weighted the sample.
The magnitudes of coefficients on the summary index and the detailed outcomes, albeit being
statistically weaker, are still positive and remain within reasonable distance of the unweighted estimates.
          We present the estimated effects on the children sample adjusted by entropy balancing in Table
12 (columns 4-6). We find the very same pattern that we found in the unadjusted data. Estimated effects
on the non-cognitive I: attitude towards schooling become slightly larger and more statistically
significant based on the reweighted sample. The estimates on test scores and educational attainment are
also consistent with those found in the original sample.
          We also check whether improved women's status hinders men's status in the family.
Reassuringly, we find no evidence of a change in the economic status of fathers with entropy-balancing
either.
Attrition Analysis: A potential concern in our paper is attrition bias. Since mothers can enroll in PelCa
soon after their child’s first birthday and up to age 5, and then enroll in the PelCa school program,
participation in the program can be up to twelve years. Mothers who remained in the program for longer
may be different to mothers who decided to leave earlier. Therefore, the sample of treated mothers


28
     This is true both for 2012 data and the pooled data.
                                                            23
might be different to the mothers in the control group. To examine this potential threat to our
identification strategy, we take advantage of a sample of mothers and children who enrolled in the PelCa
program between 2004 and 2013 and left the program between 2005 and 2015. For this sample we have
information on mothers’ characteristics such as age, living status, working status and highest
educational level, and age of their child who was enrolled in the program. This sample includes 311
mothers and 430 children.
    We first restricted this “attrite” sample to 172 mothers and 258 children who joined the PelCa
program during the same period that the treated mothers joined the program, namely between 2005 and
2009. We find that the two groups are very well balanced in terms of their pre-program characteristics
(column 4 of Table A7 in the online appendix). This result is unchanged even if we restrict further the
attrite sample to mothers and children who joined the program between 2005 and 2009 and left it after
4 years (column 5 of Table A7).
    One important difference between the two samples is that all treated children have reached primary
school age by 2012 and moved to the school-PelCa program while 67 out of 258 attrite children (25.97
percent) were still in the pre-school PelCa program. We therefore limit further the attrite sample to
mothers whose children were all in the school-PelCa program when they left the program. The means
of the pre-program characteristics of the attrite group, the treatment group and the control group are
presented in columns 1-3 of Table 17. T-tests on pre-program differences of mothers’ pre-characteristics
(mother’s age, number of children in 2005, living status, working status and highest educational level)
and in child’s age before entering the program are well balanced at 10 percent level of significance. The
results of this comparison between the attrite and treatment groups are presented in column 4 and the
attrite and the control group in column 5. We think this evidence suggests that the decision to leave the
program is not correlated with observed characteristics of mothers and children, which raises the
likelihood that they are also uncorrelated with their unobserved characteristics.
Additional Robustness Checks: Our analysis relies on the similarity between treatment and control
groups. However, we note that 10 percent of mother or child characteristics were not balanced at the 10
percent significance level. We interpreted this difference in pre-treatment observables characteristics as
random, as might happened even in a randomly assigned treatment and control groups. We think that
the close similarity between the control and treatment groups results from the similar self-selection of
mothers into the two groups, as both have shown their desire to participate in the program. In support
of this identification approach we show below that mothers who decided to participate in the program
in 2012 did not participate before for reasons that do not affect the outcomes we study. For example,
we found some imbalance in mothers working status before joining or showing interest in joining the
program. We therefore re-do the analysis by subsamples: first we analyze the treatment effects in the
group of treated and control mothers who were not working at baseline, and secondly in a sub-sample
of treated and control mothers who were working at baseline (2005). The estimated treatment effects
                                                   24
obtained from these two sub-samples are very similar and they are also very similar to the estimates we
obtained from the full sample. This evidence rules out the possibility that our results are driven by non-
comparable treatment and control groups in terms of employment rate at baseline.
       It is still important, however, to understand why control group mothers did not enroll in the
program previously. From the Figure 2 in the online appendix, we can see that a high proportion of
mothers did not enroll in the program because they did not know about it (44.55 percent); about a
quarter of mothers because they lived too far from the NGO offices (25.74 percent); some had problems
with their application forms, for example, losing the forms (11.88 percent), and some because of a
previous affiliations with other NGOs in the area (8.91 percent). These responses exclude the possibility
that mothers chose not to enroll in the program because they questioned its effectiveness. We also note
here that none of these explanations are correlated with the previous working condition or with working
full-time before.
       As a further robustness check, we re-estimate all models by limiting the sample to the 45 out of
115 control mothers who did not enroll in the program because of their unawareness of the program.
Table A14 in the appendix presents the estimated average effect sizes on mothers’ outcome using both
2012 data and the pooled data of 2012 and 2013. Reconciling two results using the original sample in
Table 4, we find that the estimated effects on mothers’ outcomes using this 45 mothers’ sub-sample are
slightly higher, though they are generally very similar to what we have found using the full sample.
       Moreover, we also re-estimate all models by restricting the sample to the control mothers who
did not enroll in the program either because they were already affiliated with another NGO, or because
there was a problem with their application forms. The first group of control mothers, if anything, should
be more attentive than treated mothers. The second group can be interpreted as randomly assigned to
the control group. Unfortunately the sample here is very small (21 mothers): the estimated effects we
obtain from this sample are qualitatively similar to those obtained from the full sample, but they are
much less precisely estimated.
       As a final robustness check, we also re-estimate the various models using propensity score
matching. Using the mothers’ sample in the 2012 data, we find that 281 out of 283 individuals are in
the common support of the estimated propensity score, which reassures that the treated sample and the
control sample are quite balanced. The propensity score is estimated via a standard probit regression on
all observable covariates, and the results are not sensitive if a logit regression is used instead. In the
nearest neighbor matching algorithm, 64 control mothers are matched to 166 treated mothers. 100
bootstrap replications are repeated to correct the standard errors from the matching. As indicated above,
we prefer the entropy balancing which allows us to maintain the sample size, even though when we




                                                   25
reduce the sample size through propensity score matching, we obtain very similar results.29

7. Conclusions
          In this paper we analyze an innovative method to empower women and increase their early
childhood investment in their children. PelCa, a home-preschool program, placed the mother at the
center of her children's education, and provided guidance and training for achieving its goals. Relying
on a ‘designed’ quasi-natural experiment, we are able to identify and measure the causal effects of this
program on both mothers and children after several years of program participation.
          First, we find that the intervention empowers women across different domains. It facilitates their
entry into the labor market: treated mothers are much more likely to be working, more likely to be
working full-time and more likely to be working in the formal sector. All of these estimates are precisely
measured and are robust to the inclusion of covariates. Moreover, treated mothers become more
financially independent and more likely to manage and make spending decisions about their own money;
to be studying; and to decide whether they can work outside of the home. The results suggest that after
joining the PelCa program, mothers are also willing to spend more time interacting with their children,
on cognitive or social activities. The treatment further modifies the allocation of power in the house:
mothers become more likely to take part in decisions about children's education and discipline. However,
we find no effect on mother’s role in decisions about what to do when the child is ill, about various
types of expenditures, about having children, or the use of contraceptives. Treatment intensity plays a
role here: the longer the mother stays in the program, the more empowered she becomes within the
household. Moreover, mothers who were less empowered at baseline are the ones who gain the most in
terms of advancing their role in decisions about the household and the allocation of resources.
          All of the above results hold when we estimate aggregate treatment impacts, use summary
indices instead of individual outcomes in order to account for multiple inference, when we use entropy
balancing to adjust for differences in pre-treatment covariates, and when we use other robustness checks.
          We also evaluate the program’s impact on children. We firstly examine children’s cognitive tests.
The estimated impact on the summary index of cognitive achievement of treated children is positive
but only marginally significant. But the average treatment effect disguises meaningful heterogeneity.
Girls in the program appear to make large positive progress in test scores but there is no corresponding
effect on boys; children whose mothers have a lower educational attainment benefit much more from
the program in terms of improved cognitive tests than children of more educated mothers. Our findings
also suggest that there are differential treatment effects by mothers’ pre-treatment working status and
that children with less-educated mothers at baseline (before enrolling in the program) show more


29
     These results are not presented in the paper and are available from the authors.

improvements in their cognitive testing.
        Moreover, consistent with findings from other pre-school programs, students in the PelCa
program are much less likely to drop out of school or to repeat a grade. These effects are marginally
larger for female students, but the difference between genders is not significant. We also find significant
treatment effects on children’s non-cognitive skills. After participating in the PelCa program, children
exhibit less school absence and better behavior at school, and the male students appear to have better
attitudes towards schooling. Overall, there is evidence that the home-preschool program that we study
helped mothers raise their children in a more learning conducive environment, which led to positive
effects on children, as well as on empowering mothers at home and in the community.

† The first non-cognitive skills variable in panel A, which is relative to the tests scores, represents outcomes of schooling dropout, grade repetition,
whether the child likes school (from both her own and mother’s prospective), and whether the child choose the book as a gift. In panel B, the outcomes
of schooling dropout and grade repetition depend on the cognitive skills as well.
†† The second non-cognitive skills variable further represents outcomes of the absences and behavior in school. It has a smaller sample size as it is
based on the children’s sample who reported the school absences and behavior in report cards.

  Notes: Same as Table 13.
  † The first non-cognitive skills variable in panel A, which is relative to the cognitive skills, represents outcomes of schooling dropout, grade repetition,
  whether the child likes school (from both her own and mother’s prospective), and whether the child choose the book as a gift. In panel B, the outcomes
  of schooling dropout and grade repetition depend on the cognitive skills as well.
  †† The second non-cognitive skills variable further represents outcomes of the absences and behavior in school. It has a smaller sample size as it is
  based on the children’s sample who reported the school absences and behavior in report cards.

Appendix: Construction of Control Variables
Household demographics controls
 • Mothers' and fathers' education (separately): indicator variables (0/1) for whether primary schooling not
 completed, primary schooling completed, secondary schooling not completed, secondary schooling
 completed, and university schooling completed.
 • Mother age and Father age.
 • Mother personal status: indicator variables (0/1) for whether the mother was married, cohabitated, or
 single.
 • Mother origin: the indicator variable (0/1) for whether the mother is from Quito.
 • Parents from same city: the indicator variable (0/1).
 • Number of children in 2005.
Household economics controls
 • Mother working before child enrolled in PelCa: the indicator variable (0/1).
 • Father working before child enrolled in PelCa: the indicator variable (0/1).
 • Mother's firm size if employed: (0, 1, 3.5, 8, 15.5, 35.5, 75.5, 300.5).
 • Father's firm size if employed: (0, 1, 3.5, 8, 15.5, 35.5, 75.5, 300.5).
 • Family average income: before child enrollment in PelCa (0, 50, 200, 350, 450, 600, 800).
Child controls
 • Birth order (1,…,10).
 • Child age (5,…,14).
 • Number of young siblings in 2005 (0,…,3).
 • School fixed effects
