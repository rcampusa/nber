        Longer lifespans are generally seen as a positive outcome of economic growth. Yet life extension
also means that more people face the risk of living too long -- that is, outliving their assets and means of
support. A range of financial products exists currently or can be envisioned for the future that would be
useful in helping to protect people against having to dramatically curtail consumption in old age. This
paper reviews the usefulness of life annuities in providing protection against longevity risk.

                       The Role of Annuity Products in Financing Retirement

                                                Olivia S. Mitchell


        Driven by the prospect of a global aging boom, researchers and policymakers throughout

the developed world have devoted substantial effort to exploring what motivates household asset

accumulation patterns. It is during the accumulation phase that a society seeks to build up

resources adequate to finance retirement. More remains to be learned about this process, but even

less is known about what happens to people later in life, during which they are confronted with the

need to decumulate their resources in an orderly manner in retirement. To understand this

decumulation process better along with the factors that influence it, this paper explores a particular

financial tool that helps protect against key financial risks at the end of life. Specifically, I

examine the role of the life annuity, a financial contract in which the purchaser exchanges a certain

sum of money for a continuous stream of benefits until he dies. The insurer, or annuity provider,

pools longevity risk across all contractholders and is thus able to offer longevity insurance for the

customer population.

        Financial contracts that pay off in the event of survival have been in existence for

centuries, with the tontines devised under Louis XIV’s reign and life annuities appearing in

Europe as early as the 1300’s. 1 In modern times, life annuities have become a substantial

component of the life insurance market, but only a few of the products labeled annuities are, in

fact, “true” life annuities. For instance in the United States, purchases of life annuities totaled

almost $120 billion in 1999, but the vast majority of the market consists of variable annuities

rather than products paying out income for life (Brown, Mitchell, Poterba, and Warshawsky,

1One famous German tontine, that of Gotha in 1752, has been called the “perfect illustration of rococo finance”. In
exchange for a purchase price, the plan promised surviviors a fixed income of 3% per year plus a variable amount
determined by lottery and mortality outcomes (Jennings and Trout, 1982).

forthcoming; henceforth BMPW). In the UK and Australia, annuity markets also appear relatively

small (Finkelstein and Poterba, 2000; Murthi, Orszag and Orszag, 1999; Doyle, Mitchell and

Piggott, 2001). Recent interest in annuity markets has come from Latin America, resulting from

more than a dozen countries having converted their pay-as-you-go national defined benefit (DB)

pensions into mandatory funded defined contribution (DC) pensions (Mitchell and Barretto, 1997).

Similarly, European pension reforms now underway are demanding that similar attention be paid

to these insurance markets as well (Blake 1999; Disney 2000; Disney and Johnson 2000;

European Commission 1997)

       Under a DC pension plan, retirees are typically offered a range of choices regarding how to

convert their accumulated assets into retirement payouts. Usually the plan offers a portion of the

money as a lump-sum, and may also provide an option to disburse some funds as either a periodic

payment or an annuity. Perhaps inevitably, whenever annuities come to play a key role in a

nation’s retirement system, questions come up regarding how these products should be structured

and priced, and the extent to which governments should supervise and regulate the market for

these products. For example these debates surfaced in the most recent US presidential race, where

advisers to President Bush formulated individual account defined contribution proposals that

included annuity promises as a cornerstone (Feldstein and Ranguelova 2000).

       In what follows, I explore lessons from research on the annuity market over the last decade

and discuss its relevance for aging, financial markets, and government policy. In particular I pose

and answer the following questions:

   n How can annuities help retirees finance retirement?

   n What problems arise in annuity markets?

   n How could the functioning of these markets be enhanced?
                                                                                                     3


The discussion proceeds in five sections. Section 1 summarizes the economics of annuities, while

Section 2 sketches the methods commonly used to value annuities. Section 3 presents empirical

results from a range of countries, and Section 4 addresses the question of how the functioning of

these markets might be enhanced. A final section concludes.



1. Handling Retirement Wealth Decumulation

       Many critics have decried Westerners’ inability or unwillingness to save for their own

retirement, with the US often identified as the most spendthrift country due to its low and

oftentimes negative saving rate. Nonetheless the strong US econo my over the past 25 years has

provided older generations with substantial wealth on hand as they look to retirement. Thus pre-

retirement wealth for US households in their 50’s amounts to $360,000 exclusive of Social

Security (in 1992$), with the median at $192,000 (see Table 1). If these households retire at age

62, their non-Social Security assets would be anticipated to amount to $438,000 on average

($239,000 at the median). Of this total, at least $100,000 of retiree assets and perhaps more will

have to be managed during retirement.

Table 1 here

1.1 Assessing the Money’s Worth of Life Annuities

       Having found that many elderly people will have assets to spread over their retirement

period, the next question is how people can manage their portfolios to ensure old-age economic

security. One way to proceed is to simply divide available retirement wealth by one’s life

expectancy, a fractional consumption pattern known as “periodic withdrawal” sometimes found in

pension payout schemes. For example, Table 2 indicates that a 65-year old man could anticipate

living another 16.4 years on average, and a 65-year old woman 19.6 additional years. The
                                                                                                     4


problem is that were a retiree to divide his age-65 retirement wealth by the number of years

remaining to him at age 65, he would be exposed to substantial risk of exhausting his funds before

he died. Thus a 65-year old man who would anticipate dying at age 81 still faces a one-third

chance of living to age 85, and almost a 20% chance of surviving to age 90. For his female

counterpart whose expected age at death is age 85, there is almost a one-third chance of surviving

to age 90. Hence the periodic withdrawal approach is likely to leave retirees short of funds.

Clearly the periodic withdrawal approach does not insure a steady flow of retirement income until

death.

Table 2 here

         One way to enhance retirement security is to purchase a life annuity that guarantees an

income stream until the insured’s death. Such a financial product provides the retiree with an

opportunity to insure against outliving his assets, in exchange for a premium paid to an insurer.

The insurer pools assets across those with similar longevity expectations but who then experience

different actual survival outcomes. In this way the life annuity provides income insurance to a

homogenous insured retiree population.

         How valuable is a life annuity to the retiree? A financial answer to this question can be

ascertained by computing the expected present discounted value (EPDV) of the life income

benefits paid to annuitants, in relation to the annuity premium cost or purchase price. In the

literature this is known as the “money’s worth” of the life annuity. To illustrate the concept, we

may assume that the product under examination is an immediate single- life annuity that pays out

$A per period for life, in exchange for an initial purchase price (e.g. $100,000). The payout

amount may vary across annuity policies on offer, and it may further be fixed in nominal terms for
                                                                                                                      5


the life of the annuity contract or it may be linked to some underlying real asset (which would then

generate a real rather than a nominal annuity).

         In the case of a nominal annuity, we follow Mitchell, Poterba, Warshawsky and Brown

(1999: henceforth MPWB) in defining qa,t as the probability that an a- month-old individual who is

alive at the beginning of month t will die during that month. Future mortality experience is

expressed by letting Pj be the probability that someone who is 65 years old at the time when he

purchases an annuity survives for at least j months: 2

(1)               P j = (1 − q780,1 ) * (1 − q781,2 ) * ...* (1 − q780+ j1,j ).

(To compute the EPDV of an annuity purchased by a 65-year-old, we need to forecast this

individual's future mortality probabilities. This point is taken up in the next section.)

         We denote the EPDV of a life annuity with monthly payout A purchased by an individual

of age b as Vb(A). This may depend on a term structure of interest rates, ik , expressing the

nominal short rate k periods into the future:

                                          A* P j
                  V b ( A) = ∑ j=1
                              600

                                         k =1   (1 + i k )

In most of our research, we use the term structure of yields on Treasury bonds to estimate the time

series of expected future nominal short-term interest rates, 3 though we have also explored the

sensitivity of results to flat term structures, with the discount rate given variously by the ten-year

Treasury bond yield, the thirty-year Treasury bond yield, and the BAA corporate bond yield. In

addition we have evaluated the sensitivity of results to taxes, since in the US at least the federal

upper limit on lifespan.

  Nominal yields on US Treasury bonds with fixed maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years are used to estimate
the term structure of expected short-term interest rates; the expected nominal short rate in each future period is
computed as the nominal short rate that would satisfy the expectations theory of the term structure for the two adjacent
long-term bonds.

tax treatment of annuities is quite complex, governed by specialized rules described in BMPW

(forthcoming). 4

         In the case of real annuities, equation (2) must be adapted to reflect the fact that the amount

of the payout is time-varying in nominal terms but fixed in real terms. As shown in BMP

(forthcoming), the simplest approach is to let Ar denote the real annual payout, and to replace the

nominal interest rates in the denominator of equation (2) with corresponding real interest rates rk .

Hence to compute the EPDV of a real annuity the equation becomes:

                                115− b      A r * Pj
(3)                Vb (A r ) = ∑ j=1                      .
                                         Π k=1(1 + rk )
                                           j



         The “money’s worth” of an annuity may then be specified as the ratio of the EPDV of the

annuity’s payout stream to its purchase price. For a nominal annuity selling for $100,000, for

instance, the money’s worth may be expressed as Vb(An )/100,000. These money worth ratios have

proven useful in the literature, since they represent a currency-independent metric for comparing

annuities across different groups, over time, and across countries.

1.2 Equivalent Wealth Valuation: Measuring the Utility of Longevity Insurance

         Before reporting money’s worth results for a range of countries and time periods, we note

that risk-averse consumers will value annuities more highly than the simple financial money’s

worth approach implies. This is because people derive utility from insurance protection per se. In

our research we develop a metric for evaluating how a risk-averse consumer might value an

annuity in utility terms, using the equivalent wealth concept (MPWB, 1999). Specifically, this

represents the amount of wealth that a consumer would need if he did not have access to an


4
  Specifically the US tax authority specifies the expected number of years over which the annuitant can expect to
receive benefits, T', based on the annuitant's age at the time payouts begin. Tax law then defines an inclusion ratio
that determines the share of annuity payments in each period that must be included in the recipient's taxable income
until T’; after that all annuity income is subject to tax. The inclusion ratio is designed to measure the fraction of each
annuity payout that reflects the capital income on the accumulating value of the annuity premium.

annuity market, in order to achieve the same lifetime expected utility level that he could achieve

by using that wealth to purchase a nominal annuity.

       As developed in MPWB (1999) and summarized in Brown and Warshawsky (2000), the

consumer is posited to maximize an expected utility function V by choosing an optimal

consumption path {C t } from time 0 to time T (the maximum possible lifespan), given his rate of

                                                                                                      T
                                                                                                             PtU (Ct )

If not, the constraint is that the present va lue of future consumption, discounted using the riskless

interest rate r, must be equal to his initial wealth, W0 : W0 = ∑                      . If he could purchase an

                                                                                        Pt Ct
actuarially fair annuity, his budget constraint would become: W0 = ∑                                 . The difference
                                                                                t= 0   (1 + r )t
between the two budget constraints is due to survival probabilities: without an annuity, the

retiree’s actual present value of future consumption must not exceed his initial wealth, but with an

annuity, his expected present value of consumption cannot exceed his initial wealth. In other

words, an annuity reduces the relative price of future consumption.

       Evaluating how much a consumer values access to an annuity requires the researcher to

assume a functional form for the utility function and to evaluate a range of risk-aversion

parameters. In much of our research we assume that the one-period utility function, U(C t ), exhibits

                                             Ct1− β
constant relative risk aversion: U (Ct ) =          , where β is the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of relative
                                             1− β

risk aversion, and 1/β is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption. Using the

indirect utility function V(.) corresponding to each budget constraint, we can then evaluate the
                                                                                                                8


maximum utility that the individual could achieve by following the optimal consumption path as a

function of all parameters. Last, we can assess the consumer’s utility gain in dollar terms, by

computing how much additional wealth he would need if he lacked access to annuities, to make

him as well off as if he had annuities available. This is accomplished by finding α such that:

V0 (α W0 )                  = V0 (W0 )           . Here α is termed the “Annuity Equivalent Wealth ” and deriving
             no annuities            annuities




it requires dynamic programming algorithms described in MPWB (1999) for the case of a single

individual, Brown and Poterba (2000) for the case of couples, and BMP (forthcoming) for the case

in which returns and/or inflation are uncertain.



2. Valuing Annuities in Practice

        Moving from theory to practice, several types of data are required to value annuity

products. These include information on actual annuity premiums and payouts, and on current as

well as projected mortality risks. We investigate each of these in turn in this section.

2.1 Annuity Premiums and Payouts

        To understand how annuity markets work, it is important to obtain data on actual payouts

for life annuities and the premiums charged for these annuity promises. Information on average

monthly nominal annuities for the US by sex over time appears in Table 3. Here we find, not

surprisingly, that men can expect to receive higher payouts than women because of their shorter

life expectancies conditional on purchase at age 65. The table also indicates that monthly payouts

appear to be falling in the US market over time.

Table 3 here

        Evidence from other countries is supportive of these findings. Information for the UK

appears in Table 4, where we display data for different purchase ages as well as nominal and real
                                                                                                        9


annuities. Patterns are as expected. Benefit payouts for younger people are, logically, lower than

for older people, due to the longer life expectancy for younger purchasers. Once again, payouts for

women are below those for men. Payouts for a nominal annuity purchased at age 65 are similar in

the UK and the US. The monthly payouts for the real benefit stream in the UK are lower than for

the nominal annuity, again with women receiving less than men. Average nominal payouts for 55-

year olds in two other countries with good data, Singapore and Australia, appear in Table 5.

Tables 4 and 5 here

2.2 Mortality Processes5

           To value an annuity payout for life, we must have data on the probability of the

purchaser’s survival into the future, yet it is not a simple matter to obtain projected mortality (or

life) tables. This is because a mortality table is typically derived by obtaining actual data on the

number of deaths by age and sex occurring in a given population over a specific period of time.

The probability qx that a group member of age x will die in the next year of life is then estimated

by either fitting a hazard model to the empirical distribution of deaths in the population, or by

applying a smoothing algorithm to the raw maximum likelihood estimates of qx. Then the

smoothed estimates of qx may be used to construct a complete mortality table. In the developed

world, mortality is extremely rare at most ages, so a large number of lives must be observed in

order to obtain reliable estimates.

           A concern that arises in developing mortality projections for valuing annuities is that

mortality processes may be heterogeneous across subgroups of the population. For example

insurers worry about adverse selection, which arises when annuity purchasers are more likely than

average to live a long time in retirement. In this case, using mortality rates derived for the

population as a whole would seriously overstate mortality among annuitants. One factor that may

                                                                                                       10


play a critical role in this context is the extent to which annuitization is optional or mandatory. For

example in the UK, occupational pension benefits must be partly annuitized on a mandatory basis,

so dedicated annuitant mortality tables exist in the UK for voluntary as well as compulsory

annuitant populations (Finkelstein and Poterba, 1999; Murthi et al, 1999). In the US, federal

Social Security payments are by law (real) life annuities, while defined benefit company pensions

are usually paid out as life annuities (though lump sum cashouts are becoming more popular in

recent years; cf Mitchell 1999). As a consequence, US mortality tables are available for group and

individual (retail) annuitants, as well as for the general population (BMP 2000).

           Not only do mortality tables differ across population subgroups: they also change over

time. On the whole, mortality among older people has fallen steeply in developed countries over

the last century and this process seems likely to continue in the future. 6 The actuarial profession

therefore projects future mortality trends by estimating so-called period mortality tables from past

data, and then devising separate, forward-looking, cohort mortality tables by extrapolating trends

in mortality. Of course, anticipated future declines in mortality built into cohort tables are only

estimates and could be wildly in error; nevertheless, future mortality estimates are essential in

order to value annuity benefit flows for people alive today as they age into the future.

           There is no single universally accepted method of comparing mortality tables across

subgroups and over time, though it is clear that selecting the “right” mortality table has a profound

effect on the value placed on a life annuity. One perspective is provided in Figure 1, illustrating

the distribution of expected age at death for US males conditional on surviving to age 65. The

graph clearly illustrates that the population curve has greater mortality at younger ages, with the

annuitant curve being shifted to the right. An obvious disadvantage of the graphical comparison is

that it does not provide a measure for “how far apart” the two tables might be and what financial

difference they would make in annuity valuation.

        Other ways to compare mortality over time and across different groups include the A/E

(“A over E”) and the IRR measures. The first, A/E, expresses the number of deaths expected in a

population with a given age structure using one table (“the benchmark”) and then compares that to

the expected number of deaths in a population of the same size in a second mortality table. When

presented as a ratio multiplied by 100, the measure is equivalent to a ratio of the weighted average

probabilities of death for the two mortality tables, using a specific population structure for the

weights. In recent research (Mitchell and McCarthy, 2001) we use as the base the US Male period

                                                                   x

an individual of age x dies according to the table in question, and q x is the probability that an

individual of age x dies according to the US Male period population table. The weights, wx , are

set so that w65 = 100,000, and wx = wx −1 (1 − q x−1 ) .

        Alternatively one could view the mortality process as akin to a mathematical discount rate,

where if $1 of today’s money were to be divided in five years time between survivors of a group

of one million people alive today, each individual survivor’s share would grow over time with

mortality, just as it would with compound interest. To compare mortality tables in this

perspective, we may use one mortality table to solve for the internal rate of return (IRR) required

to equate the present value of a life annuity computed using a second mortality table (at some

fixed interest rate). In other words, this approach solves for the r in this expression:
                                                                                                                                   12

                           p 65 ⋅ q x = ∑ a x5+%1− 65| ⋅ x− 65 p *65 ⋅ q65
                                                                        *
                                                                           = 10.18079 where   x−65   p 65 is the probability that an
 x                                      x


individual alive at age 65 lives to at least age x according to the mortality table in question; q x is

the probability that an individual alive at age x dies before reaching age x+1; a xr+%1− 65| is the

present value at r percent per year of an annuity certain paid continuously for x-65+1 /2 years; and

x −65   p *65 ⋅ q *x is the probability that an individual alive at age 65 dies aged x according to US Male

population period mortality. This technique requires both a benchmark mortality table and an

interest rate. Our analysis uses as a benchmark the US Male population period table and an interest

rate of 5 percent per year, and solves for the interest rate required to equate the annuity in present

value with some other mortality table (Mitchell and McCarthy, 2001).

2.3 International Comparisons

            Comparisons of US and UK mortality tables are given in Table 6, with results for

annuitants shown in the top panel and for the population as a whole in the bottom panel. Using

the A/E metric, annuity mortality proves to be 10-15% below the base population group, with

differences for men exceeding those for women. Also it is interesting to note that seemingly small

mortality differences translate into relatively large implied internal rates of return (IRRs). Hence

the figure of 6.55% associated with the US male annuitant cohort mortality table may be

compared to the 5% return assumed in valuing a $1 life annuity payable using the US male

population period table. In other words, the lower mortality for US male annuitants can be thought

of as using a discount rate 155 basis points above the 5 percent base rate. In the UK, where

mortality rates are higher for UK male compulsory annuitants, this is mathematically equivalent to

discounting with an interest rate 100 basis points above the benchmark. In other words, a US

insurer would have to earn approximately 100 basis points more on invested assets for men, and
                                                                                                   13


59 basis points more for women, to provide the same payout as the UK compulsory annuity

product.

Table 6 here



3. Valuing Annuity Flows

       Having in hand the requisite data on annuitant mortality and annuity payouts, we are now

in a position to provide information on the financial value – money’s worth – of annuity products,

along with their utility values for risk averse consumers.

3.1 Empirical Results on Money’s Worth

       Table 7 summarizes findings on money’s worth ratios from a range of US and UK studies

on nominal annuity products that use population mortality tables. Panel A indicates that in

exchange for a $1 initial investment in a retail annuity product, the typical age-65 US male could

anticipate receiving a pretax value of $0.835 from a life annuity, with the value slightly higher in a

tax-qualified plan ($0.85). In other words, the “loading” implied by these figures amounts to

about 15 cents per dollar premium. Women’s longer life expectancies drive up their money’s

worth to around 89 cents on the dollar, so the loading implied is lower, at around 11 cents. These

US figures are comparable to those for the UK given in Panels B and C, where loadings again

stand at around 10-15 cents on the dollar.

Table 6 here

       These results would not be precisely relevant for a consumer considering whether to

annuitize his retirement wealth voluntarily, since as demonstrated above, people buying annuitie s

tend to live longer than average. This difference, termed adverse selection, is captured in Tables 8

and 9, where we report money’s worth values obtained with annuitant as well as population
                                                                                                     14


tables. In the US case shown in Table 8, the male annuity purchaser could expect a benefit flow

some 7-13 percentage points higher than would someone in the population at large. In other

words, the insurance load drops from 10-15 cents on the dollar to 7-9 cents on the dollar after

correction for the differential survival rate of annuitants. Results for men and women are quite

similar. Evidence for the UK, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland appears in Table 9, where once

again the loading implied with population mortality is much attenuated by using annuitant

mortality tables. Indeed these annuity products appear quite valuable for annuitant purchasers,

with estimated values close to and occasionally exceeding 1.0 in a few cases. In general, therefore,

a financial assessment of these life annuity products indicates that (a) adverse selection explains a

substantial portion of the load perceived by potential purchasers in the general population, and (b)

these products are rather valuable to annuitants, though in most cases their money’s worth is still

less than 1.0.

Tables 8 and 9 here

        Thus far, the discussion has focused on nominal annuities, since they tend to be the

dominant form of annuities in much of the developed world. Yet real annuity products are on

offer in some countries, and it is useful to consider how to value them, since retirees presumably

seek to preserve not only nominal but real consumption levels over the retirement period. Inflation

is a concern in old age to the extent that even small inflation rates undermine real consumption

paths over time. Thus a 3.2% annual rate (the US average from 1926-97) could halve the real

value of a nominal annuity over 22 years. To some extent, annuity sellers can offset this concern

by means of graduated products that grow over time at some fixed rate. On the othe r hand,

inflation is a concern in retirement because of uncertainty in its realization. Hence it is important

to allow for persistence in inflation over time, when assessing the money’s worth of a real annuity
                                                                                                     15


product. Of course for risk-averse consumers, the impact of inflation uncertainty would be

expected to make real annuities even more attractive.

        The results in Table 10 review results for real annuities on offer in the UK and the US,

where we see that the money’s worth of a real annuity is below that for a nominal annuity. In the

US there is only a single firm offering a real annuity, while in the UK many more insurers offer

real products. The fact that the UK discount associated with the real annuity is smaller, on the

order of 5 percentage points, suggest that a more active market in the products narrows price

differentials.

Table 10 here

        The fact that there is any discount in the money’s worth of real versus nominal annuities

probably indicates that at the margin nonpurchasers are unwilling to pay extra to ensure a flat real

consumption stream during retirement. 7 This finding may challenge a widely- held view that

pension participants should be required or encouraged to elect real life annuities in lieu of

programmed withdrawals.

        Another way to think about annuity values assesses money’s worth ratios for particular

population subgroups having mortality experiences that differ from the average. Thus in the US,

for instance, blacks tend to have higher mortality probabilities than do whites, and hispanics are

more likely to live longer than average. Brown (1999) takes into account differential ethnic

mortality patterns, and his results are summarized in Table 11. He finds that US white and

hispanic women tend to be subsidized on average when the y purchase annuities, while US black

males receive less. In a related study, Finkelstein and Poterba (2000) find that annuity purchasers

who buy graduated products tend to live longer than those who buy flat nominal products.


7Of course it might also indicate that nonpurchasers are constrained in some way from entering the
market; this is not directly testable give our data.
                                                                                                                  16


Table 11 here

        What these findings imply is that differential mortality expectations influence how people

value these life income products, and these different expectations, in turn, shape what types of

annuity products people buy when given a choice. Despite this, or sometimes because of this,

government policy often requires that a particular mortality table be used for purposes of pricing

life payouts, to limit perceived adverse selection and/or discrimination against members of

particular groups. This is the case in the UK, for exa mple, where unisex mortality tables (using a

blend of male and female rates) must be used for pricing pension annuities, 8 and in the US where

annuity taxation requires that unisex tables be used to assess the taxable portion of the benefit

(BMPW, 1999). As a result, government policy toward mortality tables in annuity pricing tends to

generate a degree of cross-subsidization, if the product purchase is mandatory, and exacerbates

adverse selection, if the product purchase is voluntary.

3.2 Equivalent Wealth Computations

        Above we argued that risk-averse consumers may value annuities more highly than the

simple financial money’s worth approach implies since people would be expected to derive utility

from insurance protection per se. Is this section we report results on the annuity equivalent

wealth values, which represent how much wealth a consumer would need, if he did not have

access to an annuity market, to achieve the same lifetime expected utility level that he could

achieve if he used that wealth to purchase a nominal annuity.

        In order to evaluate this measure, we must assume a particular form for the consumer’s

expected utility function and compare the utility value of full annuitization with no annuitization.

We conduct these evaluations using a range of risk aversion parameters since there is no clear


8
 Strictly speaking unisex tables must be used in pricing only the “protected rights” component of the pension system;
see Blake (1999).
                                                                                                                       17


guidance from the literature as to just how risk-averse consumers may be. We also acknowledge

that the value of a new life annuity depends on the existence of other types of life income streams.

This is relevant where an older consumer could anticipate receiving lifelong retirement benefits

from a company and/or governmental pension program, so the marginal utility of a new life

annuity would be expected to be less than for someone entirely lacking in access to any retirement

annuity. 9

         The results of our analysis appear in Table 12. What the table shows is that annuity

equivalent wealth values prove to be quite substantial. Going down the first column, for instance,

a consumer with a logarithmic utility function (CRRA = 1) and no other pre-existing annuity

would assess the annuity equivalent wealth of a real life annuity at 1.502. What this means is that

this consumer would be indifferent between having $1 in a real lifetime annuity, and $1.50 in non-

annuitized wealth. At higher levels of risk aversion, the annuity equivalent wealth value rises to 2,

meaning that access to a real annuity is worth double the wealth that value invested in a nominal

annuity. In other words, annuities are valued more highly than in strictly money’s worth terms.

Table 12 here

         Our results also indicate that a real annuity is worth more than a nominal annuity to the

risk-averse consumer. Thus with CRRA=1, the consumer would value the real annuity at 5-8 cents

more on the dollar as compared to a nominal annuity, whereas with CRRA=10, the gap is 40-60

cents. The effect differs with the inflation process, however, since the annuity equivalent wealth

for the consumer is 1.451 in the case of i.i.d. inflation, and 1.424 in the case of persistent inflation.

9
  This calculation is carried out by first finding the maximum utility V* the consumer could attain when he can fully
annuitized his wealth, and then re-computing the dynamic programming problem solving for utility V when annuities
are not available. Then one can evaluate the additional wealth (i.e. ∆W) that would have to be given to the consumer
to leave him at an equivalent level of utility: V(W*+ ∆W|no annuities) = V*, and the annuity equivalent wealth would
then be α = ((W* + ∆W)/W*). For more discussion see Brown (2001). The calculations in Table 12 therefore
represent not the marginal value placed on the first dollar of an annuity, but the full utility value of annuitization (and
hence would be expected to understate the marginal value of the first dollar of annuitization).
                                                                                                       18


Not surprisingly the real annuity is more highly valued when the inflation process is more

persistent.

        It is interesting that the monotonic relationship between annuity equivalent wealth and risk

aversion does not hold for nominal annuities in the presence of uncertain inflation. This is

because risk aversion works in opposing directions in the face of inflation uncertainty. On the one

hand, higher risk aversion makes the consumer value an annuitized payout more highly since he

avoids the risk of outliving his resources, and this is all that matters in the case of the real annuity.

On the other hand, a risk-averse consumer dislikes the uncertainty introduced into the nominal

annuity stream by stochastic inflation. Increased variability in the real value of the nominal

annuity payouts reduces utility, and this effect is larger for those with the highest degree of risk

aversion. At low levels of risk aversion, the first effect dominates, and the annuity equivalent

wealth for a nominal annuity rises with risk aversion. For example, moving from CRRA=1 to

CRRA=2, the annuity equivalent wealth increases from 1.451 to 1.553 in the i.i.d. inflation case,

and from 1.424 to 1.501 in the persistent inflation case. However, as risk aversion rises, the

second effect becomes stronger, and the annuity equivalent wealth begins to decrease with risk

aversion (BMP forthcoming).

        Our results are also informative regarding how consumers might value annuities if some

substantial portion of their retirement assets were already annuitized. In the extension of our

model, we posit that half of retiree wealth is annuitized. This seems reasonable in view of the

finding that the median US older household holds about this fraction of its retirement resources in

the form of expected future Social Security benefits, and these are payable only as a real life

annuity (Moore and Mitchell 2000). In this case, a consumer who is already half annuitized still

values access to the additional annuity, but the value is lower than before. For instance, a
                                                                                                     19


relatively non-risk-averse half-annuitized consumer (CRRA=1) is indifferent between $1 in a real

annuity and $1.33 in non-annuitized wealth. In other words he would require only a 33%

increment to his wealth to be made as well off as if he had a real annuity, compared to 50% in the

case where he lacked an annuity altogether. Clearly having a pre-existing real annuity affords the

consumer insurance against very low consumption values and drives down the value of additional

privately-purchased annuities.

       If the annuity on offer were nominal instead of real and inflation followed an i.i.d. process,

the results prove to be similar. More striking is the result with persistent inflationary process,

since at high levels of risk aversion, having a real pre-existing annuity provides insurance against

very low consumption. Here the utility cost of having persistent high inflation eat into the nominal

annuity is lower, so his willingness to buy the nominal annuity would be greater.

       Because many investors seem to believe that equity- linked variable annuities are superior

to traditional nominal annuities, we have also compared annuity equivalent wealth measures for

these products. In the US the variable annuity has been around since the 1950’s, initiated by the

TIAA-CREF and VALIC companies (Brown 2000). In the UK, “unit- linked” or “with-profit”

annuities appear to be more recent entrants on the insurance scene (Blake 1999).

       In terms of the retiree’s perception, a higher expected mean return on a variable annuity

product might make it more appealing, though the greater risk could provide an offset. To assess

this tradeoff, we must model the mean return associated with portfolios of risky securities and the

variability of returns around this mean. Accordingly, we have developed an indexed portfolio of

common stocks using two alternative assumptions on the mean real return on equities: 6% real

(i.e., a 3 percent premium over the indexed bond return), and 9% real. (Both assume an equity

premium smaller than the U.S. historical 1926-1997 average, to be on the conservative side.) We
                                                                                                             20


also assume the standard deviation of real returns on equities equals its historical average value of

20.9 percent per year. 10 We compare these with fixed real retirement annuities in Table 13.

Table 13 here

        We give results with and without pre-existing annuitization. When real returns on equities

average 6%, the consumer having logarithmic utility would value equity- linked variable payout

annuities more highly than real annuities. Without a pre-existing annuity, his annuity equivalent

wealth from accessing a variable annuity is $1.62, larger than that for the real annuity previously

described ($1.50). On the other hand, more risk-averse people who might have placed all their

wealth in a variable annuity would be worse off than not annuitizing at all. This can be seen by

annuity equivalent wealth values below unity.

        These findings imply that one segment of the older population might favor a variable

annuity linking payouts to equity returns in retirement, rather than a real annuity. The higher

anticipated returns from the variable annuity would compensate these consumers for (some of) the

inflation risk borne. But more risk-averse retirees would still be expected to prefer a fixed life

annuity over a variable product (and a real product over a nominal one).



4. Can Annuity Market Performance Be Enhanced?

        Our analysis thus far indicates that annuities deserve an important role in many retiree

portfolios. This is particularly evident if government-based social security benefits cannot be

relied on to support a major portion of old-age consumption. Nevertheless, people might value

annuities less than our models imply for several reasons.




10
  For further elaboration of the estimating procedure see BMP (2000) and BMPW (forthcoming). Real equity returns
are assumed independent over time.
                                                                                                        21


       One explana tion for under-purchase of annuities is that they may be seen as “too

expensive.” As we have shown, however, adverse selection is rather small in the insurance

markets examined. It is true that insurers levy charges to cover administrative costs and insurer

reserves, contributing to the perception that these products are costly. Yet our analysis indicates

that in the US and UK at least, these charges are relatively low and appear to be falling over time.

As a result, the types of loads currently charged by insurers would not be expected to offset the

substantial utility values associated with insurance against longevity risk. Yet as new markets for

annuities develop in Europe and Asia, it will be important to pay close attention to loads and

adverse selection to ensure that these do not discourage market growth unnecessarily.

       Public policy can also play a key role in structuring the way in which these markets

develop. In the UK and Sweden, for instance, unisex mortality tables must be used to compute

pension payouts (for those benefits provided under the “protected rights” legislation). In this

instance, expected mortality differences between men and women may not be used to price retiree

payouts differentially. While this produces cross-subsidization between male and female retirees

on average, it also restricts the amount of adverse selection that occurs at the annuitization stage.

In the US, while unisex tables are required for employer pension calculations, they are not

imposed on individual annuitants purchasing their life payouts on the retail market. Furthermore,

many pension-covered workers are permitted to take a lump sum cashout from the employer

pension at retirement. As a result, an informed and rational consumer anticipating a shorter life

expectancy (e.g. a male retiree) has an economic incentive to cash out his employer pension rather

than take it as a life annuity stream, in order to avoid remaining in the (increasingly female) group

mortality pool. In this sense pension and insurance regulations can powerfully affect the appeal of

life annuities versus other retirement assets (Mitchell, 2000b).
                                                                                                                  22


        Another factor shaping the demand for annuities is retiree interest in maintaining financial

liquidity in old age. Having relatively large amounts of cash on hand is deemed especially

important in countries such as the US where nursing home benefits are not provided by the

government as a matter of course. With over one-quarter of the 65+ population needing long-term

care at some point and nursing home fees exceeding $50,000 per year, it is not surprising that

older Americans would want to keep a portion of their assets liquid instead of annuitizing all their

wealth. In response, some insurers have begun to devise new financial products that will integrate

a life annuity with nursing home insurance for the elderly (Warshawsky, Spillman and Murtaugh,

forthcoming). The demand for cash in old age is also generating some interest in reverse annuity

mortgages, financial contracts that allow an older person to obtain an annuity by pledging the net

equity in his home (Caplin, forthcoming). Of course, such products have been a “hard sell” since

the owner-occupied home is often used as a tax-preferred vehicle for bequests. 11

        Above we argued that sensible regulation and supervision can strengthen the development

of annuity markets. Conversely, institutional and regulatory problems have sometimes impeded

their growth (Bodie, Hammond and Mitchell, forthcoming). For example, in the developing

country arena, insurers are frequently poorly supervised and regulated, so retirees may not view

them as reliable institutions for old-age assets (Mitchell 2000a). In the developed world,

regulation varies across countries (e.g. within Europe) and by state (in the US) regarding reserve

and reporting requirements, investment restrictions, guaranty fund programs, and tax policy. This

makes it difficult for investors and annuity consumers to evaluate insurance competitiveness

across national boundaries (cf Lemaire, 1997).

11
  Among economists there is little agreement over how to model bequests (Gale and Slemrod, forthcoming), so it is
not clear precisely how the bequest motive should be incorporated into a model of the demand for annuities. Brown
(2001) argues that most specifications imply that full annuitization is no longer optimal. To the extent that some
people may be over-annuitized (e.g. through Social Security), purchase of life insurance may be beneficial. Further
mandatory annuitization acts like a tax on such persons.
                                                                                                         23


       Another area where policymakers can fundamentally influence annuity market functioning

is in the intersection between public and private old-age programs. For example Doyle, Mitchell

and Piggott (2001) devise annuity loadings for Australia and Singapore and find adverse selection

far stronger in Australia. This difference is attributed, in part, to the existence of a means-tested

and quite generous old-age safety net in Australia, while no minimum consumption is guaranteed

in Singapore. In other words, the extent to which people seek to annuitize retirement

accumulations from defined contribution plans will be influenced by guarantees offered by the

public sector.

       When enumerating possible obstacles to annuity markets, the discussion would be

incomplete without recognizing that older people might be laboring under some misinformation

regarding the relative advantage of annuity investments versus other financial products. For one

thing, people might underestimate their longevity prospects which would lead them to undervalue

protection against longevity. In fact however, survey evidence suggests that older people are quite

well- informed about their survival probabilities, and their expected survival patterns track

actuarial tables quite closely (Hurd and McGarry, 1995). Of course there remains the problem of

cohort mortality risk: that is, if an entire cohort lives longer than anticipated by those selling the

products, insuring firms would experience excess costs. Some have argued that this problem can

best be resolved by having governments issue “survivor bonds” inasmuch as private insurers have

no financial mechanism adequate to diversity this type of risk (Blake, Burrows, and Orszag,

forthcoming). A similar argument was made by financial experts and economists seeking to

encourage the US government to issue inflation- linked bonds (Brynjolfosson and Fabozzi, 1999).

Retiree demand for these products in the US has been modest but of course inflation has been very

low of late. In other pension markets, including the UK and Israel, inflation- linked bonds have
                                                                                                              24


become a mandatory component of the retiree portfolio and demand for these assets has been more

substantial.

        A final factor driving the size and development of annuity markets is how people feel

about alternative investments. Retirees may believe that they can manage their money better than

do institutional investors, a perspective that may have contributed to what the British have called

pension “misselling.” Here participants in company-based defined benefit plans switched their DB

accruals into individual-account defined contribution plans at the behest of insurers and other

financial advisers, and in some cases this switch proved financially deleterious (Ward, 1996). At

issue and still not unsettled in this arena is how well those who switched plans understood what

the switch meant, including their foregone defined benefit plan accrual and differences in how

longevity risk was handled in the two environments.

        Due to adverse selection in annuity markets, as well as participant inability to make

informed decisions on retirement decumulation, some policymakers have argued that all pension

participants should be required to annuitize at least a portion of their assets at retirement. 12 For

this reason it is of interest to examine the case of Chile, which more than two decades ago closed

down its traditional national pay-as-you- go defined benefit program in favor of a mandatory

defined contribution individual accounts system. As such, Chile is providing an interesting test-

case for those seeking to design better old-age retirement programs. Of particular interest in the

present context is the way in which the retirement asset decumulation process is working, now that

the Chilean system has been in place long enough to have people reaching retirement age with a

reasonably long working career under the new program. Thus far, early retirees and disabled

persons constitute the bulk of the retired population: only 38% of program affiliates in payment

12
   For example several members of the 1994-6 Social Security Advisory Council in the US urged mandating annuities
if a portion of the national Social Security system were to be privatized; see http://www.ssa.gov.
                                                                                                        25


status left work via regular retirement, while 45% were early retirees and 17% were on disability

(Diaz and Edwards 1999). Of most interest, however, are the payout patterns. With over a decade

of data available, it appears that a minority -- 40% -- of Chilean bene ficiaries have elected a life

annuity, while 60% opted for the “programmed withdrawal” or graduated payment approach that

does not guarantee benefits for life (see Figure 2). While the fraction of recipients electing life

annuities has grown over time, the se are mostly early rather than normal retirees. Whether and

how annuity pricing policy under the Chilean system and other national, mandatory, defined

contribution pension programs influences these outcomes are a subject deserving of further study.

5. Final Thoughts

This overview of annuity market functioning suggests several lessons. One is that annuity

products have an important role to play in helping people manage their assets into retirement. Risk

averse individuals will value annuities at well above their purchase price. We also find that that

adverse selection is not large and insurance loadings have been falling over time, in countries

where we have had adequate data to measure these. Last, there is a wide range of annuity

products that can enhance retirement security. Here we emphasize the role of inflation-indexed

annuities and related products protecting real consumption streams into very old age.

       Without a doubt, many developed and developing nations will face the need to restructure

their retirement systems in the next two decades: Germany has already made some progress in this

vein, Greece is confronting political pressures around this topic, and the US has announced a new

effort to examine individual accounts. During this reform process, it will be critical to devote

careful attention to the role of annuity markets in this new environment. Protecting economic
                                                                                                26


security during a long retirement period requires more attention to the long-term consequences of

regulatory, financial, and social insurance programs than has heretofore been noted by most

reformers. Additional study would be helpful on the risks affecting retiree consumption and how

people can make better- informed decisions about decumulating assets in retirement. New

financial products to help retirees draw down their lifetime savings more sensibly would be

helpful, but with them arise new challenges for financial system and insurance regulators.

Notes: Data on compulsory annuitants for the UK refer to those compelled to annuitize a certain
fraction of pension benefits; in the US, data cover pensioners in retirement plans. Columns 1 and 3
use US male population period mortality as reference category, while columns 2 and 4 assume a
5% return for base annuity.

Note: The annuity equivalent wealth calculation for the nominal annuity assumes inflation takes
one of six possible values, roughly capturing the distribution of inflation outcomes over the 1926-
1997 period. Inflation shocks are assumed independent across periods in the i.i.d. case and follow
a stylized AR(1) process in the persistent inflation case.
