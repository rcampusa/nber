                                              ABSTRACT

During the contraction from 1929 through 1933, the Federal Reserve System tracked changes in the
status of all banks operating in the United States and determined the cause of each bank suspension.
This essay analyzes chronological patterns in aggregate series constructed from that data. The analysis
demonstrates both illiquidity and insolvency were substantial sources of bank distress. Periods of heightened
distress were correlated with periods of increased illiquidity. Contagion via correspondent networks
and bank runs propagated the initial banking panics. As the depression deepened and asset values declined,
insolvency loomed as the principal threat to depository institutions.

Introduction

       During the Great Contraction, depository institutions departed from the banking business

more rapidly than at any other time in United States history. Of the roughly 24,000 institutions in

operation in January 1929, only about 14,000 remained when the banking holiday began in

March 1933. Banks failures were clustered during events that contemporaries described as

panics, but banks closed their doors in large numbers at other times. What caused the banking

system to contract so suddenly and severely?

       Economists, politicians, and pundits have debated this question since the early 1930s.

Innumerable explanations have been offered. The scholarly debate now revolves around two

competing theories. A traditional school of scholarship maintains that the underlying causes were

withdrawals of deposits, illiquidity of assets, and the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to act. A

contagion of fear, a flight to cash holdings, and withdrawals en masse drained deposits from

banks and pushed financial institutions towards collapse. Federal Reserve mistakes exacerbated

the credit crunch (Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, 1963; Elmus Wicker, 1996). A

contending school concludes that banks failed because the economy contracted. Asset prices fell.

Loan default rates rose. Banks became insolvent. These fundamental forces accentuated a

process of bank liquidation and that began during the 1920s (Peter Temin, 1976; Eugene White,

1984; and Charles Calomiris and Joseph Mason, 2003).

       Scholars support both suppositions with extensive evidence. The evidence corroborating

the traditional Friedman-Schwartz illiquidity hypothesis consists of data on bank suspensions

aggregated at the national or regional level. This data reveals bank failures clustered in time and

space, often coinciding with turning points in macroeconomic time-series such as indices of

industrial production, the money supply, the money multiplier, interest rates, and the deflation




                                                 1
rate. Narrative sources from the 1930s characterize many of these clusters as banking panics

(Friedman and Schwartz, 1963; Wicker, 1996).

       The evidence supporting the Temin-White insolvency hypothesis consists of data at

lower levels of aggregation, or disaggregated data consisting of samples of national banks, or

panels of banks from within individual cities, states, or Federal Reserve districts. Temin (1976)

regresses state-level bank-failure data on characteristics of the state and national economies,

including proxies for poor loans and agricultural distress. White’s (1984) pioneering study

examines a panel of data drawn from national banks. The most recent and comprehensive work

(Calomiris and Mason, 2003) analyzes a panel of data for all Federal Reserve member banks.

These studies reveal significant correlations between the characteristics of banks, the

environments in which they operated, and their chances of surviving the contraction.

       Differences in data sources are one reason these contending hypotheses coexist. The

different sources illuminate different dimensions of the banking industry and highlight different

points in time and space, leading to different depictions of events. Another reason that the

hypotheses coexist is that the extant sources share several weakness. All of the sources provide

imperfect information about changes in banks’ status. The extant evidence distinguishes neither

temporary from terminal suspensions, nor voluntary from involuntary liquidations, nor

institutions afflicted by illiquidity from banks suffering insolvency. The extant evidence contains

information neither on the causes of bank suspensions nor the number of bank mergers. The

extant evidence neglects consolidations of banks in financial difficulties and seeking to avoid

suspension. The samples are neither random nor representative. The microdata from bank

balance sheets comes almost entirely from national and Federal Reserve member banks, whose

experience differed from state-chartered institutions. The microdata indicates the financial health




                                                 2
of the institution only at annual (or longer) intervals, and not at the time of distress. For

aggregate data, the smallest period of aggregation at the national level is the month and at the

Federal Reserve District is the year. Key terms remain undefined, leaving much open to

interpretation.

       This essay examines a new source of evidence that provides a comprehensive view of the

ways in which banks departed from the banking business and the reasons that banks suspended

operations. The new source covers all banks – including Federal Reserve members and

nonmembers, national and state, incorporated and private – from the onset of the contraction in

1929 and until the national banking holiday in March 1933. The new source contains

observations for an array of events, including closings, reopenings, and consolidations, and

indicates the cause of suspension for all banks. The source is the archives of the Federal Reserve

Board of Governors, whose Division of Bank Operations tracked changes in the status of all

bank operating in the United States, analyzed the cause of each bank suspension, and recorded its

conclusion and financial information for each bank on (or near) the date of suspension.

       This essay analyzes aggregate series derived from the St. 6386 database using non-

parametric methods. The goal is filter the data as little as possible, allowing the evidence – and

the hundreds of bank examiners, accountants, receivers, economists, Federal Reserve agents, and

others who collaboratively created this data set – to speak for itself. Summary statistics, charts,

and graphs demonstrate that some types of bank distress were less prevalent than the

conventional wisdom suggests; other types of bank distress, which according to the conventional

wisdom seldom (or never) occurred, did in fact occur and may have played a pivotal role

propagating the banking crisis. For example, some of the most eminent economists of our time,

including Ben Bernanke (1983, pp. 259-260) and Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz (1963),




                                                   3
assert that temporary bank suspensions did not occur during the contraction, but temporary bank

suspensions did, in fact, occur in large numbers during the banking crises in the fall of 1930 and

1931.

        The evidence presented in this essay helps to answer a fundamental question concerning

the collapse of the banking system: why did banks fail? This question can be restated in terms of

the current academic debate as: did illiquidity or insolvency cause the collapse of the financial

system? An accurate answer to this question must be extended, because the nature of the banking

crisis changed over time. Before October 1930, the pattern of failures resembled the pattern that

prevailed during the 1920s. Small, rural banks with large loan losses failed at a gradually rising

rate. In November 1930, the collapse of correspondent networks triggered banking panics in the

center of the nation. The largest counter-party cascade stemmed from the collapse of the

Caldwell conglomerate. Runs rose in number and severity after prominent financial institutions

in New York and Los Angeles closed amid scandals covered prominently in the national press.

More than a third of the banks which closed their doors to depositors during this crisis soon

resumed normal operations. Following Britain’s departure from the gold standard in September

1931, the depression deepened. Asset values declined. Insolvency loomed as the largest threat

facing depository institutions. During the financial crisis in the winter of 1933, almost all of the

banks that failed were liquidated at a loss.

        Overall, between the Great Crash and the Banking Holiday, both illiquidity and

insolvency were substantial sources of bank distress. Nearly three-fourths of the banks that

closed their doors due to financial difficulties were insolvent. Slightly more than one quarter

were solvent, and without outside financial assistance, reopened for business, or repaid all of

their depositors and creditors, or merged at face value with other institutions. Heavy withdrawals




                                                  4
were a primary cause of nearly one half of all bank suspensions and a contributing cause of

another one sixth. Frozen and devalued assets were a primary cause of approximately one half of

all bank suspensions and a contributing cause of another one quarter.

       The rest of this essay substantiates this depiction of the banking crises of the Great

Contraction. Section 2 describes the data, defines key concepts, and discusses issues important

for interpreting empirical work based upon this new and unique source. Section 3 presents

chronological patterns for the four categories of bank distress: terminal suspensions, temporary

suspensions, consolidations due to financial difficulties, and voluntary liquidations. Section 4

presents chronological patterns for the principal causes of bank suspensions: heavy withdrawals,

problematic assets, closure of correspondent banks, defalcations, and mismanagement. This data

demonstrates that surges in bank suspensions coincided with periods of increased illiquidity.

Section 5 discusses the implications these chronological patterns, which corroborate some

conjectures, cast doubt on others, and raise new questions concerning the causes and

consequences of the collapse of the banking system during the Great Depression.


2: Data Source and Definitions

       From 1929 through 1933, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Division of Bank

Operations recorded information about changes in bank status on three forms. Form St. 6386a

reported bank consolidates. Form St. 6386b reported bank suspensions. Form St. 6386c reported

all other bank changes. The Division of Bank Operations gathered this data through a nationwide

reporting network that it established during the 1920s. The network’s purpose was to collect

uniform and comprehensive information about all banks operating in the United States – national




                                                 5
and state, member and nonmember, public and private. The complete series of St. 6386 forms

survives in the National Archives of the United States.1

         As part of its data collecting endeavors, the Board of Governors developed a lexicon for

discussing changes in bank status and bank distress. In the Federal Reserve’s lexicon, a

suspension was a bank that closed its doors to depositors and ceased conducting normal banking

business for at least one business day. Some, but not all, suspended banks reopened for business.

A liquidation was a permanent suspension. A liquidating bank closed its doors to the public,

surrendered its charter, and repaid depositors, usually under the auspices of a court appointed

officer known as a receiver. A voluntary liquidation was a category of closure in which banks

ceased operations and rapidly arranged to repay depositors the full value of their deposits.

Voluntary liquidations did not require the services of receivers and were not classified as

suspensions. A consolidation (or merger) was the corporate union of two or more banks into one

bank which continued operations as a single business entity and under a single charter. The

categories of bank distress were typically construed to be temporary suspensions, terminal

suspensions (i.e. liquidations), voluntary liquidations, and consolidations due to financial

difficulties.2

         The Federal Reserve’s lexicon also covered common causes of bank suspensions. The

Federal Reserve attributed most suspensions to one (or more) of five common causes. The first

was slow, doubtful, or worthless paper. The term worthless paper indicated an asset with little or

    The forms may be found in the National Archives, Record Group 82, Federal Reserve Central Subject File, file
    number 434.-1, “Bank Changes 1921-1954 Districts 1929-1954 - Consolidations, Suspensions and
    Organizations-St. 6386 a,b,c, (By States) 1930-1933.” The forms are filed alphabetically by state, name of town
    or city, and name of bank. Multiple entries for individual banks appear in chronological order. To avoid
    repeated, lengthy citations in the body of the essay and this appendix, after quotations from the archival data, the
    information required to locate the form (i.e. name of state, town, bank) is indicated in brackets.

    Contemporary publications often employed the terms failure and closure as synonyms, which typically (but not
    universally) referred to the sum of temporary and terminal suspensions.



                                                           6
no value. The term doubtful paper meant an asset unlikely to yield book value. The term slow

paper meant an asset likely to yield full value in time, but whose repayment lagged or which

could not be converted to full cash value at short notice. The second common cause of

suspension was heavy withdrawals, the typical example being a bank run. The third was failure a

banking correspondent. Correspondents were banks with ongoing relationships facilitated by

deposits of funds. A typical example is a county bank (the client or respondent) which kept its

reserve deposits within and cleared its checks through a national bank in a reserve city (the

correspondent). The fourth common cause was mismanagement. The fifth was defalcation, a

monetary deficiency in the accounts of a bank due to fraud or breach of trust.

       Completing the St. 6386 forms (and determining the cause of a bank’s suspension)

involved implementing algorithms designed to classify complex transactions. The algorithms

evolved over a four-year period, from 1925 through 1929, during which the Division of Bank

Operations sought comments from bankers and examiners about the accuracy of its procedures.

When determining the causes of failures, the Board of Governors sought to gather information

about suspensions from the man on the spot who knew the facts of the issue at hand. The Board

gathered information from examiners, receivers, correspondents, state banking departments,

court officers, the bank’s own management, and local and national publications. This array of

sources, now no longer extant, provided the Board of Governors with an array of information,

now unavailable to economic researchers, such as the health of a bank’s assets on the date of

suspension, the deposits lost by the bank in the period preceding suspension, the lawsuits (or

criminal charges) pending against bank management, and the links that the failed bank had to

other financial institutions. Therefore, the Federal Reserve agents could determine whether the

bank had experienced a run, whether closed due to inability to maintain cash flow or due to fear




                                                 7
of impending insolvency, whether the loss of correspondent linkages forced it our of operations,

or whether the bank closed due to the dishonesty of its management. Modern scholars cannot

observe these phenomena.3

         The following sections examine chronological patterns in the rediscovered archival

evidence. Because the database covers the entire population of banks and contains information

on all of the ways in which those banks could depart from the banking business, the typical

problems of probabilistic inference – such as extrapolating from samples, sample selection, and

censoring – are not concerns. Thus, the examination can proceed in a straightforward manner.

The goal is to allow the data to speak for itself. I should emphasize that I make no judgments

about the reasons why particular banks failed. Those judgments were made by contemporary

experts possessing far more information about each event than is available to scholars today. In

this essay, I merely report their conclusions, both in their own lexicon and after translating the

conclusions into terms used by modern economists.


3: Categories of Bank Distress

         This section examines chronological patterns on categories of bank distress. Table 1

presents annual data. Several patterns appear prominent. The majority of bank changes due to

financial distress were terminal suspensions (72.9%). The remaining changes were divided

    A companion paper discusses the quality of this evidence. It describes in detail how the Board of Governors
    determined the cause of each bank’s demise. The method involved gathering financial data for each institution;
    talking with the regulators, examiners, receivers, correspondents, and bankers who knew the facts of the issue at
    hand; applying a set of algorithms devised to determine the cause of the failure; and reporting the results in a
    lexicon devised to convey the conclusions clearly, concisely, and consistently. The companion paper provides
    examples of the algorithms and copies of the blank forms. The companion paper describes when, where, why,
    and how the Board of Governors collected the necessary information and issues important for interpreting
    empirical work based upon this new and unique source. The discussion emphasizes the lexicon that the Board of
    Governors devised during the 1920s to facilitate their analysis, the methods that Federal Reserve agents
    employed to ascertain the causes of bank suspensions, the scope and scale of the data collection process, and the
    procedures that the Federal Reserve used to validate and cross-check the evidence.



                                                          8
between temporary suspensions (12.3%), consolidations due to financial difficulties (9.7%), and

voluntary liquidations (5.2%). Temporary suspensions occurred at a higher rate early in the

depression, when more than one in five suspended banks reopened for business, and usually

occurred during surges of bank suspensions which contemporary observers classified as banking

panics. Consolidations due to financial difficulties followed a different pattern. Struggling banks

were least likely to merge in 1930 and most likely to do so in 1931. The rate of voluntary

liquidations followed no discernible trend.

       Figure 1 displays patterns of terminal and temporary suspensions from January 1929 to

March 1933. The rates of both types of suspensions remained near pre-depression levels until

November 1930, when the rates rose suddenly. The rise in temporary suspensions was

particularly pronounced. Few temporary suspensions occurred during typical weeks; many

weeks witnessed none. Almost all temporary suspensions occurred during waves of bank failures

such as the banking crisis of fall 1930, when more than 40% of all institutions which closed their

doors to depositors soon reopened for business. The percentage fell as the depression progressed.

Less than 20% of the banks which closed their doors during the fall of 1931 later reopened. Only

a small fraction of the banks which suspended operations during 1932 and 1933 reopened, and

most of those that did manage to resume operations did so after receiving infusions of cash from

stockholders, depositors, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and other sources.

       Figure 2 displays patterns of voluntary liquidations and consolidations due to financial

difficulties. Kernel-smoothing illuminates trends over time. Consolidations rose during the

waves of bank failures and peaked at the end of 1932. Voluntary liquidations varied greatly from

week to week, and no trend is discernible.




                                                 9
        Figure 3 indicates rates at which banks departed from the banking business each year.

The horizontal axis divides the rates into solvencies and insolvencies. The share of solvent

departures appears above the axis. The numerator of this ratio consists of banks in each year

which (i) voluntarily liquidated and (ii) consolidated due to financial difficulties (dark gray area)

plus (iii) the number of mergers of banks not in financial distress (light gray area). The number

of mergers is a lower-bound approximation, because the series equals ‘mergers’ minus ‘new

bank openings.’ The denominator is the number of banks in operation at the beginning of each

year.

        The share of insolvent departures appears below the axis in Figure 3. The numerator is

the number of terminal suspensions. The denominator is the number of banks in operation at the

beginning of each year. The values for 1933 include banks which ceased operations in January,

February, and March with the exception of those closed due to banking holidays declared by

state and federal governments. The dotted outlines indicate the annualized rate of departure

during the first three months of 1933, or in other words, what would have happened had the

departure rate during the first quarter continued throughout the year. The last column indicates

the rates of departure averaged over the entire contraction.

        Figure 3 shows that for the period January 1929 through March 1933, departures from the

banking business were split about evenly between solvent and insolvent. Solvent departures –

principally mergers but also voluntary liquidations and consolidations under duress – were

concentrated during the first two years of the contraction (i.e. 1929 and 1930) and during the first

half of 1932, a period during which the Federal Reserve System pursued an expansionary policy.

Insolvent departures gradually increased during 1930 and peaked in 1931 following Britain’s

departure from the gold standard, to which the Federal Reserve reacted by raising the discount




                                                 10
rate and contracting the money supply. Insolvent departures continued at a high rate in 1932 and

spiked upwards during the months before the Roosevelt administration declared a national

banking holiday in March 1933.

       Together, Figures 1 through 3 demonstrate that during the depression, bank distress

occurred in many forms. Some forms for which data has been available – such as the liquidation

of insolvent banks – have been studied extensively. Other forms for which data has not been

extant – such as temporary suspensions and consolidations due to financial difficulties – have not

been analyzed. The hitherto unobserved forms of distress were concentrated during surges of

bank suspensions which contemporaries characterized as panics. The concentration suggests that

the causes of suspensions during panics differed from the causes during ordinary times. The next

section, which examines evidence on the causes of bank suspensions, strengthens that

supposition.


4: Causes of Bank Suspensions

       The previous section documented when and how banks departed from the banking

business. This section determines why banks did so by analyzing chronological patterns in the

causes of bank suspensions. A series of tables and figures present the key findings. Table 2

presents annual figures. Row (a) indicates the total number of banks suspending operations. Row

(a.1) indicates the total number of banks suspending operations due to problems with assets and

liabilities. Imbalances often arose on one side of the balance sheet, but could arise

simultaneously on both sides. Rows (a.1.1) through (a.1.5) display the possible combinations:

(a.1.1) slow, doubtful, or worthless assets listed as the primary cause of suspension; (a.1.2) assets

listed as the primary cause and heavy withdrawals listed as a contributing cause; (a.1.3) both

withdrawals and assets listed as primary causes; (a.1.4) heavy withdrawals listed as the primary



                                                 11
cause and assets as the contributing cause; and (a.1.5) withdrawals alone as the primary cause of

suspension. Row (a.2) indicates the number of banks suspending due to the closure of a

correspondent. Row (a.3) indicates the number of banks suspending due to defalcations,

mismanagement, excessive loans to officers and directors, excessive investment in building and

facilities, and similar circumstances. Row (a.4) indicates the number of banks suspending due to

other or multiple causes. The latter consists in part of complex cases which do not fit into the

mutually exclusive categories above, often because they spanned two or more classifications. An

example is a poorly managed bank which failed to enforce collections on its slow farm loans and

which experienced runs after local newspapers revealed that its president embezzled funds from

savings accounts.

       In Table 2, several patterns appear prominent. The share of suspensions due primarily to

problems on the asset side of the balance sheet fell through 1931, rose in 1932, and fell again in

1933. The share of suspensions due primarily to withdrawals rose through 1931, fell in 1932, and

rose again in 1933. The ratio of assets over withdrawals varied over time. Withdrawals’ role in

the collapse of the banking system peaked in 1931, while before and after, asset problems caused

the majority of suspensions. The share of suspensions due to defalcation and mismanagement fell

throughout the depression, perhaps because corrupt and poorly-managed institutions lacked the

resources needed to weather the initial storm. The share of suspensions due to the closure of

correspondents peaked during 1930.

       Figure 4, which plots the number of suspensions each week due to the closure of

correspondents (and for sake of comparison also plots total changes due to financial distress),

reveals why. The typical week witnessed few, if any, suspensions from this source. The weekly

mode and median were zero. The mean was one. The weekly number rose during July of 1929,




                                                 12
when the Mediterranean fruit fly epidemic produced a banking panic in Florida, but remained

near zero until November 1930, when it spiked sharply upwards.

       Figure 5 paints an analogous picture for suspensions whose primary cause was heavy

withdrawals. Suspensions due to withdrawals were rare during the initial year of the depression

but rose following the collapse of correspondent networks in November 1930. During 1931,

when bank suspensions surged repeatedly, withdrawals were a significant cause of suspensions.

Thereafter, withdrawals continued to cause suspensions during periods of acute banking distress,

but the ratio of withdrawals relative to other causes declined.

         Figure 6 examines the share of suspensions due to correspondents, withdrawals, and

assets for the depression as a whole. The left-hand pie chart presents data for banks which

suspended operations temporarily. The right-hand pie chart presents data for banks which

suspended operations permanently. The shades of gray indicate the percentage of banks

suspending for different reasons. The color black denotes banks which suspended solely due to

heavy withdrawals (in key, WITHDRAWALS) but which were in fine financial shape before

depositors’ demanded repayment of deposits. Most of these banks experienced sudden and

severe runs. Three-quarters gray denotes banks forced out of operations by heavy withdrawals

and also afflicted by asset troubles that exacerbated their condition, but which were not severe

enough to have necessitated suspension in the absence of withdrawals (WITHDRAWAL +

assets). One-half gray indicates banks in double trouble. Problems severe enough to necessitate

suspension existed on both sides of the balance sheet (WITHDRAWALS & ASSETS). One-

quarter gray indicates banks whose slow, doubtful, and worthless assets forced them to close

their doors and where withdrawals exacerbated the situation. Examples include (i) banks forced

by continuous, slow withdrawals to sell their profitable assets leaving them with a problematic




                                                 13
portfolio, and (ii) banks headed towards failure whose demise was accelerated by depositors’

demands (ASSETS + withdrawals). Lightly-dotted gray indicates banks forced to suspend solely

due to problematic assets (ASSETS).

       Figure 6 demonstrates that for the contraction as a whole, heavy withdrawals were the

primary cause of more than a half of all temporary suspensions. The closure of counterparties

caused another sixth of all temporary suspensions. Asset problems were the primary cause of less

than a third of the temporary suspensions. For terminal suspensions, the pattern differed. Asset

problems were the primary cause of more than half of all bank suspensions and a contributing

cause of another one-quarter. More than eight in ten of the banks which went out of business, in

other words, were judged to have problematic assets.

       Together, Figures 4 though 6 illuminate the causes of the initial surge of bank

suspensions during the fall of 1930 and winter of 1931. Before the surge, the pattern of bank

suspensions resembled the pattern of failures throughout the 1920s. Banks failed at a steady rate.

The principal cause was problems with asset quality. The pattern changed dramatically in

November 1930, when the rate of suspension rose suddenly. The collapse of correspondent

networks emanating from Caldwell and Company caused the initial increase. Thereafter, runs (or

fear of runs) forced scores of banks to close their doors, and adverse circumstances pushed many

weak banks into insolvency. The number of runs increased after the failure of The Bank of

United States, which was the fourth largest bank in New York City, the eighth largest bank in the

nation, and possessed one of the nation’s largest branch networks (57 branches).

       During the crisis that began in the fall of 1930, forty percent of the institutions that closed

their doors to the public soon reopened. Since they reopened without receiving infusions of

capital or other outside assistance and survived the remainder of the depression, they were




                                                 14
solvent. Moreover, some banks that closed permanently at this time might have been solvent, if

they had not been forced to liquidate when similar institutions in neighboring communities

dumped assets on the market, driving down prices, and when a national liquidity crunch forced

hundreds of banks (which suspended operations) and thousands of others (beset by withdrawals

but able to continue without interruption) to sell bonds and securities, which were their most

readily marketable assets, and whose prices fell when their supply suddenly expanded. These

events are symptoms of a banking system suddenly suffering withdrawals and lacking liquidity.

       Lack of liquidity also bedeviled the banking system during the spring of 1931, when

suspension surged in Illinois in an event that Friedman and Schwartz (1963) named the Second

Banking Crisis. During this period, the Federal Reserve determined heavy withdrawals to have

been the primary cause and slow or frozen assets to have been a contributing cause for almost all

bank suspensions. On most of the forms, Federal Reserve agents stated laconically that the bank

closed its doors after depleting its cash reserves. These comments indicate an epidemic of

illiquidity. Banks’ assets were frozen. Depositors wanted cash. Banks closed when they failed to

make ends meet.

       The pattern of causation changed as time passed. In September, Britain abandoned the

gold standard. Fear that the United States might also devalue its currency triggered the flight of

financial assets abroad. In October, to combat the external drain and defend gold, the Federal

Reserve raised the discount rate from 1.5% to 3.5% and sold substantial quantities of government

securities, which reduced the money supply and raised market interest rates. These actions

weakened the financial positions of banks throughout the nation. Depositors grew increasingly

apprehensive about the health of depository institutions. Bank suspensions surged once again,

and suspension rates remained elevated through the winter of 1932. During this period, banks




                                                15
failed for a wide array of reasons. Heavy withdrawals from healthy banks caused 20% of the

suspensions. Heavy withdrawals from banks beset by portfolio problems caused 40% of the

suspensions. Depreciated assets caused 24% of the suspensions. For many of these banks, written

comments indicated that droughts, declines in agricultural prices, depressions of local industries,

and depreciations of bonds’ values and securities’ prices had reduced the value of the bank’s

portfolio so far as to necessitate suspension.

       During the spring of 1932, the Federal Reserve initiated an open-market purchase

program in an attempt to reinvigorate banks and reinflate the economy. The attempt lasted only a

few months. During that period, suspensions fell to their lowest level since the fall of 1930.

Withdrawals also eased. Liquidity appears to have been available. The majority of the banks that

suspended operations did so principally due to problems on the asset side of their balance sheet.

       This pattern held true even during the month of June, when a banking crisis plagued the

city of Chicago and surrounding environs. During that panic, some solvent banks experienced

runs, but the solvent institutions which suspended operations soon reopened. Devalued assets

were the primary cause of most terminal suspensions, while withdrawals were noted as only a

contributing condition, if they were mentioned at all. Written comments on the suspension forms

indicate that banks were struggling due to declines in the values of securities, bonds, and real

estate and losses due to uncollectible and defaulted loans. In other words, during this event, most

banks which experienced runs were either insolvent or teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.

Illiquidity and runs did not destroy solvent institutions. Real economic forces caused their

demise.

       In November 1932, Franklin Roosevelt won the presidential election. Expectations that

the new Democratic administration would abandon the gold standard induced foreigners to ship




                                                 16
funds abroad and Americans to convert deposits to precious metals. The Federal Reserve lacked

the resources to counter these external and internal drains. Some districts (e.g. Atlanta) extended

credit freely to ailing institutions. Other districts (e.g. New York) had to choose between aiding

banks and preserving their dwindling stocks of gold. Policies lacked consistency across districts,

and some districts (e.g. Chicago) refused to cooperate with others despite their statutory

obligation to do so. Bank suspensions rose steadily during this period. Banks failed for many,

and usually multiple, reasons. Three-out-of-four suspensions suffered both asset problems and

heavy withdrawals. Only a handful of banks that suspended operations ever reopened, and in

every case, their resurrection required outside financial assistance.

       Figures 7 through 9 address a key question concerning the contraction: did (a) illiquidity

and contagion or (b) fundamentals and falling asset values cause banks to fail? The answer is that

both were important sources of bank distress. Failures due to illiquidity were concentrated during

times when bank suspensions surged, during which illiquidity caused between one-third and one-

half of all suspensions. Failures caused by declining asset values and loan defaults predominated

before November 1930, during the lulls between crises, and after Britain abandoned the gold

standard, forcing the Federal Reserve embarked on a contractionary policy to counter gold

outflows. Outside of panic periods, in other words, contagion and illiquidity caused a small

fraction of all suspensions, while insolvence caused the preponderance.

       Figure 7 provides two estimates of banks failing due to contagion and illiquidity. The

lower bound is 1,376 or approximately 22% of the 6,063 banks which suspended operations

between January 1929 and March 1933. The lower bound estimate consists of all banks which (i)

temporarily suspended operations and reopened within three months without outside financial

assistance, (ii) permanently suspended operations after experiencing heavy withdrawals and for




                                                 17
no other reason (i.e. examiners judged their assets to be in good condition), (iii) permanently

suspended operations after being forced to close by the closure of a counterparty. A more

complete accounting is 2,739 or approximately 45% of all suspended banks. The estimate

consists of banks in categories (i), (ii), and (iii) plus banks which suspended operations

permanently (iv) after experiencing heavy withdrawals and possessing assets which examiners

judged to be frozen or slow, (v) because they had exhausted their borrowing capacity, were

unable to borrow, or failed to obtain loans from their correspondent, or (vi) because they had

exhausted their cash reserves. Written comments on the St. 6386 forms identify banks in

categories (v) and (vi).

       Figure 8 provides two estimates of the number of banks failing due to insolvency and

declining asset values. The lower bound is 1,458 or approximately 24% of all banks that

suspended operations during the contraction. The lower bound consists of all banks that

suspended operations because their assets were slow, doubtful, or worthless and for no other

reason. A broader definition yields the figure 3,055 or just over one-half of all suspended banks.

This broader accounting includes all banks in the lower bound plus banks whose failure was

attributed to (a) the accumulation of slow, doubtful, or worthless paper with heavy withdrawals

as a contributing cause, (b) the depreciation of assets, (c) the depreciation of real estate, (d) the

depreciation of stocks and bonds, (e) inability to collect on loans, (f) impaired capital, (g) local

crop failures, (h) low crop prices, or (j) local industrial or agricultural depression. The banks in

categories (b) through (j) were identified by written comments on the St. 6386 forms.

       A comparison of Figures 7 and 8 illuminates differences between the patterns of failures

due to illiquidity and insolvency. Figure 9 highlights these differences. The figure’s bottom half

indicates the total number of banks experiencing distress in each week from July 1930 through




                                                  18
March 1933. The top half indicates the share of banks failing due to illiquidity relative to the

share of banks failing due to insolvency. This share is calculated with the following formulas,

                 Lt               St
        Rt =                −                     (1)
                      Zt               Zt

And

        t +6               t +6
                                   Lt            St
               Rt 13 =                       −             13        ( 2)
        t −6               t −6
                                        Zt            Zt

where Rt is the share under consideration, which I refer to as the illiquidity-insolvency ratio. Lt

equals number of suspensions due to illiquidity in week t. St equals number of suspensions due to

illiquidity in week t. Zt equals the total number of suspensions for all causes in week t. Note also

that Lt + St     Zt, because a fraction of banks failed for reasons that could not be clearly identified

as illiquidity or insolvency, such as defalcations on the part of the management, and a fraction of

banks suspended while they suffered from both illiquidity and insolvency.

                       t +6
        The sum,              Rt 13 , is a thirteen-week moving average of the illiquidity-insolvency ratio.
                       t −6


The moving average is useful for separating high-frequency oscillations from broader trends.

The number of banks in distress oscillated widely from week to week. The mean of the series

was 32. The standard deviation of the series was 27. The largest increase from one week to the

next was 115. The largest decrease was 86. The illiquidity-insolvency ratio also varied widely

from week to week. For the lower-bound estimate, the mean was -0.071. The standard deviation

was 0.179. For the broader definition, the mean was -0.142. The standard deviation was 0.286.

Both series also exhibited trends. The moving averages plotted in the top half of Figure 9

illuminate these trends. The lower-bound estimate of the illiquidity-insolvency ratio rises during

the fall of each 1930, 1931, and 1932. The broader definition rises during the same periods and



                                                                19
also during the spring of each year. To focus on these trends, this essay employs a moving

average of thirteen weeks, because the periods of heightened distress lasted, on average, for three

months (i.e. approximately 13 weeks). Series smoothed with different filters and bandwidths

yield similar results.

        Figure 9 illuminates several pertinent patterns. First, periods of acute bank distress were

correlated with periods when illiquidity was a more common cause of bank distress. Banking

crises were, in other words, periods when lack of liquidity forced large numbers of banks to close

their doors. The banking crisis in the fall of 1931, in particular, was the peak period of illiquidity

relative to insolvency. Second, during non-panic periods, insolvency was the principal threat to

depository institutions. When depositors were not withdrawing funds en masse, in other words,

the majority (and often the preponderance) of the banks which ceased operations did so because

their assets no longer covered their liabilities and bankruptcy loomed on the horizon.

        These conclusions can be put on a firmer footing by examining the statistical properties

of the series. Table 3 indicates the number of banks in distress during weeks when the share of

banks suspending due to illiquidity exceeded the share suspending due to insolvency (i.e. Rt

above 0) and weeks when the insolvent share exceeded the illiquid share (i.e. Rt below 0). On

average, the number of banks in distress during the weeks in which illiquidity was the principal

form of distress exceeded by sixty to eighty percent the number of banks in distress during the

weeks in which insolvency was the principal form of distress.

        As Figure 9 and Table 3 suggest, the two series – the number of banks in distress and the

illiquidity-insolvency ratio – are highly correlated. The correlations exist for both the raw and

smoothed series and for both the lower-bound and broader estimates. For the lower-bound

estimate of the insolvency-liquidity ratio, the correlation coefficient (calculated using Pearson’s




                                                  20
product-moment method) with the number of banks in distress is 0.36. For the lower-bound’s

moving average, the correlation coefficient is 0.57. For the broader definition, the correlation

coefficient is 0.25. For the broader definition’s moving average, the correlation coefficient is

0.42.

        Table 4 summarizes these correlations. Its four columns report the results of ordinary-

least-squares regressions in which the standard errors have been corrected for autocorrelation

using the Newey-West procedure. In each case, the dependent variable is the number of banks in

distress. The unit of observation is the week, beginning with the seventh week of 1929,

continuing for 210 weeks, and ending with the ninth week of 1933. The first six and last six

weeks are dropped from the sample to accommodate the thirteen-week moving average. The

independent variable in each case is a measure of the illiquidity-insolvency ratio. In all four

regressions, the coefficient on the illiquidity-insolvency ratio is significant in statistical and

practical terms. The hypothesis that periods when larger number of banks experienced distress

coincided with periods when illiquidity caused a larger portion of suspensions cannot be rejected.

The signs and significance levels of the coefficients vary little when the dependent variable is

changed to other measures of bank distress, such as the number of terminal bank suspensions, the

number of temporary bank suspensions, or the total number of bank suspensions. In sum, the

correlation is clear. Periods of increased bank distress were correlated with periods of heightened

illiquidity from the fall of 1930 until the winter of 1933.


5: Discussion

        Scholars have long debated the causes and consequences of bank failures during the

Great Contraction. Some argue that widespread withdrawals, financial contagion, and lack of

liquidity were the principal reasons that banks suspended operations. Others argue that declining



                                                  21
asset values, large loan losses, and the agricultural and industrial depressions were the principal

reason that banks went out of business. Partisans on both sides of the debate push their theories

to the limit, asserting that illiquidity or insolvency was not just the principal or the predominant

source of distress, but that illiquidity or insolvency was the only source of distress.

        The evidence presented in this essay indicates that mono-causal theories concerning the

causes of bank closures are inconsistent with the evidence. Illiquidty was not the sole source of

bank distress. Many depository institutions did not experience deposit losses, but failed because

the value of their assets declined until the value of their liabilities exceeded the value of their

resources. Insolvency was not the sole source of bank distress. Many depository institutions had

assets in good condition, but closed their doors because their depositors demanded funds, which

the bank could not supply, because it could not quickly convert assets into cash, and it lacked

access to sufficient lines of credit.

        Both illiquidity and insolvency, in other words, were substantial sources of bank distress.

The nature of the banking crisis varied across institutions, time, and place. Different portions of

the banking industry experienced different forms of distress. None of the data samples previously

studied by scholars has captured the complexity and dynamism of events.

        The temporal patterns roughly follow the description of events outlined by Friedman and

Schwartz (1963) with modifications made by Temin (1976) and Wicker (1980 and 1996). Before

the fall of 1930, bank failures were concentrated in agricultural areas among banks that had

experienced large investment losses. The initial banking panic in the fall of 1930 – with its

cluster of temporary bank suspensions, bank runs, and collapsing correspondent networks –

appears to have been a credit crunch triggered by counter-party cascades and propagated by the

public’s flight from deposits to currency. During later surges in suspensions, distress of




                                                  22
depository institutions appears to have been driven in part by depositors’ fears for the safety of

banks and in part by declines in the values of banks’ assets. Between crises, banks that closed

their doors typically did so due to problems with their portfolios and fears of impending

insolvency.

       Why did the nature of the banking crisis change over time? The archival evidence

illuminates the initial impetus. During the fall of 1930, Caldwell and Company’s correspondent

network collapsed. Neighboring correspondent networks collapsed at the same time. Bank runs

radiated from the locus of these counter-party cascades. The rate of runs increased after the

failure of The Bank of United States. During the spring of 1931, runs struck large numbers of

banks in Illinois, particularly several large banking groups centered in the city of Chicago.

       What explains the continued contraction of the banking system? Answers to this question

can be divided into two classes. The first follows the logic of Friedman and Schwartz (1963).

The liquidity crisis grew like a snowball rolling down a hill. The initial credit crunch forced

some banks out of business. Fear of further failures induced depositors to withdraw additional

funds, which forced banks to sell more assets, which drove asset prices even lower, which forced

more banks to fail, which confirmed depositors’ fears in a continuing cycle of self-fulfilling

pessimism. The snowball stopped only when Roosevelt declared a national banking holiday in

the winter of 1933 and restored confidence in the safety and soundness of the financial system.

       The second follows the logic of Temin (1989). Shocks – droughts, tariff wars,

contractionary policies, beggar-thy-neighbor devaluations, declines in autonomous consumption

and investment – battered the economy in the early 1930s. England’s departure from the gold

standard was a particularly severe stimulus. These shocks reduced asset values and pushed




                                                 23
marginal banks into insolvency. The banking crisis came to an end only after economic recovery

began in 1933.

       Both of these theories are consistent with the data presented in this essay. Both probably

explain a portion of events. Their relative explanatory power remains one of the key unanswered

questions concerning the depression. Other questions raised by the evidence presented in this

essay are: why did correspondent networks collapse in November and December 1930 but

endure even greater shocks during the following three years? Why did some banks which

suspended operations reopen for business, while others whose owners and managers also strove

to reorganize and reopen, fail to reopen their doors? Why were banks in some states able to avoid

suspension by merging with healthy institutions at the last minutes but not in others? Did the

policies pursued by state banking departments and Federal Reserve Banks influence the

categories and causes of bank distress? Future essays will employ the new archival evidence to

answer such questions and to advance our efforts to understand the causes and consequences of

banking crises during the Great Contraction.
