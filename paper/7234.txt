Expectations, Credibility, and Time-Consistent Monetary Policy

NBER Working Paper No. 7234
July 1999
JEL No. E31, E52, E61

                                                ABSTRACT

        This paper addresses the problem of multiple equilibria in a model of time-consistent monetary
policy. It suggests that this problem originates in the assumption that agents have rational expectations and
proposes several alternative restrictions on expectations that allow the monetary authority to build credibility
for a disinflationary policy by demonstrating that it will stick to the policy even if it imposes short-run costs
on the economy. Starting with these restrictions, the paper derives conditions that guarantee the uniqueness
of the model’s steady state; monetary policy in this unique steady state involves the constant deflation
advocated by Milton Friedman.
