     This paper examines the effect that the coexistence of small and large

banks, with different interests   in the international market, has on the debt

renegotiation process. Making use of a reputational model, we argue that the

presence of small banks implies that debtor countries have a harder tine

obtaining new money than what they would have absent the small banks.

            BANK   SIZE, REPUTATION AND   DEBT RENEGOTIATION




1. Introduction

     The failure of several LDC's to meet the original payment

schedule on their loans from foreign banks ushered in the "debt

crisis' at the beginning of the 1980's.        Since then various theories

have been proposed to explain the causes of this crisis.            These

theories have stressed alternatively the macroeconomic shocks faced by

LDC's (as a consequence of a US economic policy after the second oil

shock that resulted in high real interest rates, a world wide

recession, and unfavorable terms of trade)       ,
                                                     the   failure of LDC

governments    to adjust to the new economic environment, and the

existence of market imperfections (resulting, for example, from

collective action problem within syndicates and the threat of

default) 1

     The problems and the factors that influence the renegotiation

process, however, have received far less theoretical attention.             A   few

exceptions are Sachs (1983), Krugman (1985), and Bulow and Rogoff

(1986).

     Sachs shows that if banks possess an increasing marginal cost of

loans and if each bank negotiates separately with the debtor country,

default is a possible competitive equilibrium when the country faces a


          See Kahier (1986) for a review of these theories.
                                                                 2


temporary liquidity crisis although the country is not insolvent.

This occurs because it may not be in the interest of any individual

bank to extend a further loan to the debtor to allow it to avoid

default if the bank expects all other banks to stop lending.     If all

banks have the same expectation, the result is self—confirming.

     Krugmsn shows that collusive action on the part of creditors can,

by allowing banks   to offer lower interest rates and large enough new


loans, avert the debt crisis that may arise if creditors acted

competitively.   He points out the free—rider problem that may exist,

however, if creditors aren't perfectly collusive.

     Bulow and Rogoff use Rubinstein'a (1982) bargaining model to

examine how a debtor country and a bank may bargain over repayment of

a loan.   The perfect equilibrium is characterized by both parties

achieving an agreement instantaneously and, if the solution lies in

the "bargaining region," the relative shares of each party are in

inverse proportion to their respective rate of impatience in reaching

a settlement.

     None of the above analyses, however, have examined the effect

that reputational considerations may have on negotiations.     These are

an extremely important element in reality, as can be seen by the fact

that favorable terms obtained by one country are almost always

referred to in subsequent negotiations by other countries.2

     Rescheduling is an extremely complicated process involving

hundreds of banks and loans of various maturities and terms.     In a


    2 For
           example, the terms obtained by Mexico in 1986 were thought
to be concessionary and were demanded in subsequent negotiations by
Brazil and Argentina.
                                                                 3



typical scenario, a troubled debtor approaches a major creditor and

asks for changes in its repayment schedule.    This bank then consults

with other important creditors and a creditor committee is set up.

The syndication and collective bargaining technique employed by banks

enable thea to reapond to many of the adverse selection, moral hazard,

and endogenous default problems endemic to international lending.     The

sharing of information lowers its cost and allows for greater

monitoring of borrowers.   Moreover, the cost of default to borrowers

is increa ed since collective sanctions are now feasible.3

     There does not exist any simple harmony of interest among

creditors, however.   Tkey are a heterogeneous group characterized by

different degrees of exposure to the various countries, by different

economic riea to each borrower, and by different roles played within

the field of international banking.   This paper seeks to examine how

existing asymoletries among creditors influence the negotiation proceas

between creditors and debtors.   An obvious differentiation among banks

is by size:    there is a small group of very large international banks

such as Citibank, Chase, Lloyds, etc. and then a much larger group of

small banks.   Renegotiation is essentially carried out by this group

of larger banks.   It is they who sit on the creditor committee, engage

in data collection, come up with how much "new money" must be included

in the rescheduling package, and reach an agreement with the debtor

country.   It is then up to the smaller banks to ratify the agreement.


       Equilibria such as the one derived by Sachs are ruled out since
the syndicate will not adopt solutions that are collectively
irrational.
                                                                 4

     Although the small banks have not had too much problem in

accepting the new terms proposed by the large banks on outstanding

loans, they have been much more unhappy about providing the new loana

required as part of the rescheduling package.     US regulations require

that loans on which interest payments have not been made to be

downgraded after ninety days.     Therefore US banks have an additional

incentive to keep interest payments current and hence to engage in

"involuntary loans" in order to enable the debtor country to do ao.

To ensure that on     bank's involuntary loans are not used to pay off

the interest on another bank's loan, participation in involuntary

loans takea a pro rata form,    i.e. each bank participates in all new

loans in proportion to its existing exposure.

     Not all banks are equally sanguine, however, about extending new

loans.     The larger banks have a much greater stake in the

renegotiation process than do the smaller ones.    Not only are they the

largest creditors, but also their exposure relative to capital is much

higher.4     Moreover, as emphasized by Lipson (1986), large banks

perceive themaelves as having permanent interests in the stable

operation of international capital markets.    They have long—standing

ties both to other major institutional players and to many of the

debtor countries.    Their relationship often extends to state agencies,

local firms, and to the domestic banking system of the debtor country.

To the extent that there is a long run benefit from maintaining these

relationships and a greater vulnerability to any writedown in the


       For example, in 1985 the nine major US banks' exposure to
problem debtors in Latin America was 148.6% of capital as compared to
36.9% of all other banks (excluding the top fifteen banks). Source:

                                                                      5


value of outstanding loans, a large bank will be more willing to

participate in involuntary loans than a small bank with less exposure

and with no such ties to the international community or to a sovereign

debtor.

     The greater reluctance of smaller banks to participate in

involuntary loans often implies that the larger banks must resort to

pressuring the latter in order to ensure participation.       An attempt by

a small bank to hold out can be met by the threat of blacklisting from

future internati,nal lending and, more importantly, by    a   threat to

their domestic operations since large banks provide important services

to small banks in the domestic market.    As a last resort, as recounted

by Kraft (1984) in the Mexican case,    the Federal Reserve or the

Treasury may also bring pressure to bear.

     This paper seeks to examine how differences among banks'

interests influences rescheduling.     We attempt to show that the

presence of small banks and the existence of uncertainty on the part

of the country as to how much pressure a big bank may be able to exert

over a small one results in harsher terms for the debtor.       The

presence of asymmetric information gives rise to a reputation effect

and to a dynamic game in which partial defaults may occur.



2. The Model


     Reflecting the reality of the negotiation process, negotiations

are thought of as occurring between big banks and the debtor country

over the terms of repayment of all loans, and between big and small

banks as to the degree of participation of small banks in new
involuntary loans.     The large banks are assumed to act collusively.

The small banks, however, are perfect competitors; they take the terms

of agreement reached by the large banks and the country as given and,

since small banks are not legally required to participate in

involuntary lending, simply decide whether they wish to participate or

not.     It is assumed that participation takes a pro rata form.    Non-

participation implies, however, that the small banks may then incur

the costs that can be imposed on them by the large banks.     These costs

can result from being blacklisted from future international lending

and,   more importantly, from domestic loan participation and from the

use of banking services provided by the big banks.     Big banks are

assumed to incur zero transaction costs in applying pressure to small

banks.

       The country is engaged in paying interest on its debt over     N

periods.     In each period rL of the debt payment is renegotiated.       The

country attempts to obtain new loans in order to finance this

repayment.    These can be conceived of as being new long—term loans

which will then be refinanced in the future (with a low probability of

repayment), or alternatively as a partial writedown of the debt.          The

country can also choose to partially default, however, by refusing to

repay that portion of the debt that has come up for repayment.        The

costs incurred in doing so, D>O, reflect the costs of being restricted

to barter trade and from any form of international lending during that

period.
                                                                        ]

     The payoffs to banks and country in any one period is as follows:


                   —rL +
                   —D
                                            if agreement
                                            if no agreement

                                            if no agreement

where 6 is the cost to small banks imposed by the large banks,

LLb+Ls, LLn0+.5,       denotes involuntary loans/writedowns, and

subscripts b and s signify big and small banks respectively.            It is

assumed for notational simplicity that there is only one large and one

small bank.

     It may be very difficult, however, for a country to know how much

pressure big banks can apply on small banks.          It is sensible to

assume, therefore, that the country is uncertain about the maximum

amount of pressure that the large bank can exert.            For simplicity we

assume that the maximum cost that big banks can inflict on small

banks, 6, may be either high or low, i.e. &E(6H,6L), 5H>6L

     It is well known that the equilibria of a strategic non-

cooperative game played between two agents is very sensitive to the

institutional framework in which the game is embedded.           Furthermore,

the analysis required is quite complex.          As a result, there have been

few explicitly strategic analyses of the debt crisis (two exceptions
                                                                        8

are Bulow and Rogoff, and Fernandez and Rosenthal (1988)).            In this

paper we do not undertake to solve the bargaining problem between the

large bank and the country in each stage of the game.          Instead, we

assume that the solution to this bargaining problem is given by the

Nash bargaining solution.         While this is an ad hoc assumption (with

the unappealing property that it imposes a cooperative solution), we

argue that the particular solution concept adopted is not essential

for our results; what matters is the ranking of the payoffs in a way

that will be made explicit further on in the paper.         This allows us to

treat our problem as a finitely repeated game with asymmetric

information.

     Any solution to the bargaining problem between debtor and

creditor naturally depends on the true value of 5, 5*, and on the

country's belief as to the value of        5.   We assume that the country

and the bank can give instructions to their respectiwe negotiating

teams to negotiate as if 5* were either 5H or 5L' regardless of the

true value of    5,   and that if both negotiating teams agree on the

value of   5,   the bargaining outcome reached is given by the Nash

bargaining solution.

     The game played between the big bank and the country is of the

following form.       In each period the country first declares whether it

wishes to take a "tough" stance, that is it declares that it will

negotiate as if       55H'   or a "conciliatory" stance, that is it declares

that it will negotiate as if        =5 (the reasoning behind   this

terminology will become evident below).         The big bank is then also

given the same choice of negotiation strategies with the reverse
                                                                        9


terminology associated with the respective negotiating positions, i.e.

the claim     =8    is conciliatory whereas the claim   —8 is tough.
      If both the big bank and the country play tough (i.e. the bank

declares    =8 and the country     8=8H no agreement is reached and a
default is declared for that period.      The country suffers a default

penalty (which is assumed to he greater than the total amount of money

owed by the country in that period, i.e. D>rL).         If both parties agree

to negotiates as if 8=8L (i.e. the country adopts a conciliatory

position) then the payoffs are C and     W   respectively for the country

and big bank.       If both players agree to negotiate as if            the

country receives T and the big bank receives ZL or ZH depending on

the true value of the maximum amount of pressure that the big bank can

apply on the small bank.       If the big bank can only apply a maximum of

88L   then,   although it negotiated as if 88H' if L is large enough

the big bank will be forced to make part of the loans which if

the small bank would make.       It is assumed that the big bank respecta

the pro rata rule and does not attempt to extract a greater proportion

of loans from the small bank than that which is stipulated by this

requirement.       That is, the maximum amount that the big bank can

extract from the small bank is min(8*,aL5) where a is the percentage

of the big bank's original loan that the big bank pays as an

involuntary loan.      The complete set of one—period payoffs is presented

in the game tree in Figure 1.

      By assumption, the values of C, T, and         are given by the

solution to the Nash bargaining problem in (2).         That is,   L   is chosen

to solve
                                                                                       10

                 Max     [iL)      +   D][lrb(L)]                                    (2>

        The small bank's contribution to L                  depends   on the magnitude of

   relative to       .     Note    that   f.   can   be written as



           A     f (Lb)
           L=
                 .     +aI                                               (3)




according to whether or not the large bank has needed to apply the

maximum amount of pressure that it states it can.5                       Hence the

maximization problem may be divided into two paicts depending on

whether the a that maximizes (2) is greater or smaller than S/L5.

        For msS/L5 (2) can be written as


        Max [—rL     + a(Lb+       L) + D]     [rL,0
                                                       —
                                                           aL,0]        (4)


The first order condition yields

   a=[(2rL -     D) - A]/2L                                             (5)



          0,             — a   0,                —         — 0
    A           6/L5                   A(8/L5        a)
where A is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint.

Note that if 2rL<D, a is negative.                   This solution to (2) implies that

the country pays more than what it owes in order to avoid default.                          We

rule this out by imposing an additional constraint on (2):                      1.     0.
For a     S/L5 (2) can be written as


         Max {—rL    +              + D][rLb_aL,0]
                         aL,0+ S                                               (6)




       This formulation assumes that when the small bank drops out of
making further loans, it still contributes £ since that is the
maximum that the big bank can extract.

   The first order condition yields

        Whether the solution is given by (5) or (7) depends on the

parameters of the model.              We can distinguish among five cases:

Case 1:       The Nash solution is the constrained solution for both

Case 2:       The Nash solution is the constrained solution for                        and

an interior solution with a<SH/L5 for



        SSL o8J'L                b[r(sL/L5)IhD            c(&LAs)_r]

                a is given by (5) with A—0

Case 3:       The Nash solution is characterized by a>SL/L5 for                        and

                             Note that in this case the big bank's payoff
a<&H/Ls for      65H
under    85L    may be larger or smaller than with                     whereas the

country's payoff is necessarily smaller.

Case 4:       The Nash solution for                    is a>SL/LS and for 5=5H is

              Here both the big bank and the country's payoffs are greater
a>SH/L5.
if 5=6H (this can be seen graphically by noting that the slope of the

level sets of      (ire

Case 5:     The Nash solution for           is m<SL/Ls.     Here the payoffs are

the same for both values of 5.

for case 2.      Note that in all cases the country's payoff is larger if



        In order for a reputacional effect to come into play, two

conditions must be met:          1) W>ZH and 2) ZL<O.   The first condition

conciliatory position) than if both parties agree to negotiate as if

                 the country adopts a tough position and the big bank is
55H      (i.e.

conciliatory).      That is, the big bank's payoff should be greater if it

can "convince" the country that it is not able to extract a large new

loan     (or forgiveness) from the small bank than if the country

believes that it lies within the big bank's power to apply a large

amount of pressuce on the small bank.          This condition is always met in

cases 1 and 2 above and may be met in case 3.             In case 4, ir when

equal regardless of the value of             We shall restrict our attention

to those cases for which the first condition is satisfied.             The second

condition stipulates that when the big bank negotiates as though

         if in reality 5*=&L the big bank's payoff should be lower than

the cost of no agreement.          For the second condition to be met the

difference           must be "large".      We shall assume this to be the

case.

if              where the first term in the parenthesis refers to the

negotiation stance taken by the country and the second to that taken

by the bank.         The reason for this is that when 6*_SL and the latter is

common knowledge, the big bank cannot credibly threaten to play tough

since, if called upon to do so, it would be made worse off than by

acquiescing and being conciliatory.                     Subgame perfection rules out

equilibria based on incredible threats. The fact that this game is

played over N peciods (in each period rL of the debt is negotiated)

and that the country does not know 6* implies that there may be an

incentive for the bank to take a tough position, i.e. to play as if

68L       even if 86H' in the hope of convincing the country that it has

little bargaining power over the small bank.                      As has been shown by

Kreps and Wilson (l982b)          ,   for   a large enough N the reputational effect

comes into play.

          The general structure of the game is as follows.                   There are N

periods in which the game shown in Figure 1 is played.6                        Time is

indexed backwards so that first stage N is played, then N—i                                    then

1.       The possible payoffs of the big bank depend on 6*, whereas those

of the country are independent of 6*.                    The bank knows the true value

of   .      The country,     on the    other    hand,    starts   out with   an initial

belief      as to   the probability      that    c5*..SL.

         As in Kreps and Wilson, we look for a sequential equilibrium.

This has the following properties:7 a) Every extensive game has at


    6 Another
               interpretation of the game is that in each period a
different country's debt comes up for renegotiation (with N countries
in total) with the same big bank.

sequential equilibria.

least one sequential equilibrium. b) If a set of beliefs and

strategies for the players constitutes a sequential equilibrium, then

the set of strategies constitutes a subgaae—perfect Nash equilibrium.

        Three conditions must be fulfilled for a sequential equilibrium:

1) Each player called upon to make a move has a probability estimate

of what previously occurred.      2) The estimate satisfies Bayes' rule,

whenever the later applies.      3) At every node, including nodes off the

equilibrium path,     the players follow optimal strategies given their

probability assessment of that node and contingent on the prior

history of moves.

      The game begins with Pg     the initial probability assigned by the

country to the possibility that     5*._SL,   exogenously specified.     A

sequential equilibrium to the game is given below.          It is described by

a function         a strategy for the country, and a strategy for the big
              n'
bank.    We shall then proceed to show that these constitute a

sequential equilibrium.

b). If both the country and the bank play tough in stage n+1, then

c).   If the country plays tough in stage n+l and either the bank adopts

a conciliatory position or     n+l°'     then

  This describes how     n is computed      at every node of the game.

Strategies:

The country:     At each atage n, the country compares         the

country is tough.

The big bank:      If it has little power over the small bank (5*=SL),

always takes a tough position.       If it has a lot of power over the

small bank (6*=SH), then:       If the players are in the last stage of

                                                                  If n>l and
negotiation, that is, if n=l, the bank is conciliatory.

         the bank plays tough.       If n>l and Pn<b''1   the bank

randomizes and takes a tough position with probability Xnt where

   [Pn_bn ]/[ (l_pn)bn_lI.
     The beliefs and strategies described above constitute a

sequential equilihriun.       This can be demonstrated by showing that the

beliefs of the country are consistent with the strategy of the bank

(in the sense that Bayes' rule holds wherever it applies) and that,

givem one agent's strategy, the other agent is following a payoff

maximizing strategy.

     The consistency of beliefs can be verified by noting that when

the country is conciliatory no information is gained, so          nl=n             If

                                                                     =

that reality is * and where Pr(*) is the country's prior assessment of

the probability that the big bank's power over the small bank is          .
This    confirms that beliefs and strategies are Bayesian consistent.

        Bayes' rule does not apply for two different scenarios:

                  and the bank adopts a conciliatory stance,   and

part of the bank demonstrates, once and for all, that the true vsloe

of & is          While in Kreps and Wilson (1982b) this assignment of

beliefs off the equilibrium path is somewhat arbitrary, in the context

of our problem if we assume, very plausibly, that the involuntary

loans made by the big bank and the small bank can be observed

separately by the country, then conciliatory behavior on the part of

the big bank does indeed reveal

possibility that S truly equals 5L                By Bayes' rule, however,     X

there no longer exist any dynamic considerations (i.e. there is no

reputation to be gained by being tough) and the payoff for being tough

jf 5*=SH is smaller than the payoff for being conciliatory.                  Hence,

       We can now verify                 that    the players'   strategies    are   optimal.        It

is   easy   to    show that        if     the country's estimate V (where           V=p+(l_p)X
                 of the probability that the big bank will be tough is less

than b, then the country's expected payoff in that period is strictly

greater if the country adopts a tough position rather than a

conciliatory one.             If     Pbnl,          the bank is tough with probability one.

Hence it is optimal for the country to be conciliatory since the

country does not gain information by being tough and would also suffer

a loss in expected payoff for that period.                          If                     the bank is
                                                                         b<p<b1,
conciliatory with a positive probability but with a probability less

than 1—b.        Hence, once again it does not pay for the country to play

tough.

       We must also show, however, that the country cannot gain a long—

run benefit by being tough when                      bfl<P<br.         That is, we must show

that there is no long—run informational gain for the country by being

tough in this case.

This, combined with the fact that the country suffers a loss in its

expected payoff in period   n   if it is tough that period, implies that

the country is following an optimal strategy by being conciliatory

when bn<pn<bn_l.

     If pn=bn, the big bank is conciliatory with probability 1—b, so

the country is indifferent and randomizes.       An analysis similar to

that conducted above confirms that there is no long—run benefit to be

gained by the country from being tough with probability one.

     The above analysis can also be extended to show that the expected

payoff in any period n—m, m<n, is also invariant to the negotiating

position chosen in period n.        This follows from the fact that the

expected payoff in stage n—i is independent of       n—l       Hence there is

no dynamic advantage to be gained by altering the strategy.          This

verifies the optimality of the country's strategy.

      The optimality of the big bank's strategy if
                                                   5*=SL is easily
 shown.    If in any period the big bank is ever conciliatory, this

results in more future tough positions taken by the country than does

being tough.      Since in the short run fighting is better for the bank

and in the long run fewer defaults are better, always fighting is the

optimal strategy for the big bank.

     The expected payoffs to the big bank with               from following

its strategy from stage     n   to 1 is given by the following function of




                                              if

                                              if    Pn1               (23)

  b=[n—k(pn)+lJW + (k(Pn)_UZH                 if bn<pn<bk(Pn)_l

  b=[n—k(pn)+lJW + k(pfl)ZH                   if bn<pn_bk(Pn)_l

where k(p).=inf(n:bn<pn) for Pn>O and         is understood to be calculated

for the entire n periods of the game.

  The first two payoffs are obtained from equations (19) and (20).

The third is found by noting that as long as bn<pn the country is

conciliatory and the big bank receives W in each of those periods.

The last period in which this occurs is nk(pn).           Hence the bank

receives   W   for N_k(Pn)+l periods.   If in stage k(pn)_l we have

                 then in each period thereafter,             to 1, the bank
                                                    k(pn)l
receives an expected payoff of ZH.       The last equation is the same as

the third except that in period                      (pn)1. instead of the
                                     k(pn)l   pn_

prior inequality.      Therefore the bank receives an expected payoff of

2Z1 instead of ZR in that period.

    Suppose that the country is tough in stage n.          By being
                                                                 22

conciliatory, the bank receives ZH in that period and in every period

thereafter.   By being tough, the bank receives zero in that period and

future expected payoffs of (n—l)ZH if   n°'   nZH if O<pnbn_i., and more

than nZH if              Thus, the big bank (with &**5H) is optimizing by

following the strategy described.

3. Implications

     Our model allows us to make a number of predictions about the

negotiation process.     Most significantly, negotiations will not be

smooth and agreements will not be reached instantaneously; there will

be extended periods during which negotiations regularly break down.

This result is independent of the true value of the big bank's power

over the small bank.     If the bank has £*_8H, then during the period in

sthich the big bank defends its reputation, that is from the first

period in which   pNb"   until the period in which the bank first adopts

a conciliatory stance, a default will occur at least every other

period.   This is clearly seen from the country's strategy set and its

probability estimating function.     Whenever the bank adopts a tough

position, this causes the country's reassessment of the probability

that &*                    .
           to be such that in the next period the country randomizes.

If the result of this randomization is conciliatory behavior on the

part of the country, in the following period the country is tough with

probability one.   If instead the randomization had resulted in the

country being tough then, if the bank were also tough, randomization

would again occur next period.     On the other hand, if the bank has

      it never adopts a conciliatory position.     Hence default occurs

at least every other period commencing with the first period in which
                                                                           23




        The introduction of a reputational effect into the negotiation

process leaves the big bank which has         a   great deal of power over the

small bank (6*=SH) at least as well off as absent this effect.                  If

                                       in terms of its expected
pN<b, the big bank is just as well off

payoff as without the reputation effect since the complete certainty

equilibrium has 1rbZH.      If   pbN,      the bank's payoff is greater with

the reputational effect.     This follows from (23) where the payoffs

given by the last three equations are all greater than NZH (since

           Thus the big bank's expected payoff is unambiguously larger
W>ZH).

with    the reputational effect.    The small bank's payoffs move in tandem

with    the big bank's.   Therefore, the same conditions for the

                                                                If the big bank

has little power over the small bank (i.e. &*_SL), the big bank is

made worse off by the introduction of asymmetric information since for

each period in which a default occurs it loses W.

        The country is clearly worse off as a consequence of the

reputational effect.      If default never occurs, the game is a zero—sum

         with default it is a negative—sum game.         We have already
game;

established that given &*_SH the big bank is never worse off as a

consequence of the introduction of a reputational effect.            Moreover,

the expected number of periods in which default occurs is greater than

zero (unless initial beliefs are such that the country never

challenges the bank).      Hence the country's expected payoff is

                                                             If 5*_&L, the big

period in which it challenges the big bank, default occurs,

occasioning a loss of C+D.

     The existence of small banks is detrimental for the country.           If

there were no small banks involved in the negotiation process i.e.      ,    if
all banks, big and small, were to act collusively as a single big

bank, the country's payoff in a single period would be greater than or

equal to its payoff given the existence of small banks.   The new

solution would be given by m'—(2rL—D)/2L).   Consequently, the total

amount of involuntary loans/forgiveness would be greater and the

country's psyoff correspondingly larger.   The big bank, however, would

not necessarily be worse off since the small bank's participation

would now be pro rata.

4. Conclusion

     The experience of the last few years has demonstrated that debt

rescheduling negotiations between debtor nations and their creditora

are far from smooth.   Despite the cost to both parties, the flow of

new loans and interest payments have been regularly disrupted.        The

reluctance   of the small regional banks to agree to rescheduling terms

and the concern of the large international banks of the effect that

the terms of negotiation may have on future negotiations with same or

with other countries has been an important source of the problem.

     This paper highlights the role played by the presence of small

banks and asymmetric information in contributing to the existence of a

reputational effect and hence permitting rocky negotiations.     The

principle implication of our analysis is that the country is always

made worse off as a consequence of the reputational effect.    It also
                                                                 25

provides a possible explanation for the recent introduction of exit

bonds by Argentina.   These long—term, lower interest bonds, targeted

at the regional banks, would allow the purchaser to be exempt from

participation in further rescheduling and lending.   The bonds

themselves would not be rescheduled, nor would they be included in the

base that determines the obligation Co provide new money.   As shown   by
our   analysis, the elimination of the reputational effect that this

would allow makes the country better off.   Also, provided that these

bonds are not themselves evaluated by the small banks as being too

risky, they would also make the small banks better off.
