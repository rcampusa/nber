        INTERNATIONAL RISK SHARING AND THE CHOICE OF EXCHANGE RATE REGIME




                                    Abstract




    This paper examines the argument that the fixed exchange rate regime

should be preferred to the flexible rate regime because the former allows

risk sharing across countries while the latter does not. The analysis

is performed in a two-country overlapping generations model, where markets

are incomplete under either exchange regime. In this second best world, it

is demonstrated that the ability to share risk across countries in the

fixed rate regime does not necessarily lead to higher welfare than the

inability to share risk in the flexible rate regime.

1 •   Introduction

       One argument which has been advanced in favor of the fixed exchange rate

regime over the flexible rate regime is that the former allows risk sharing

across countries (See Mundell [1973]). This is not necessarily welfare

improving, however, when the set of markets are not complete (in an Arrow—

Debreu sense) in either regime.

       This paper makes use of a two—country overlapping generation model similar

to that in Karekan and Wallace [1981], and outlined in Section 2. Individuals

in one country face an exogenous uncertainty in their endowments, while individ-'

uals in the other country receive a nonrandom endowment. The flexible rate

regime, discussed in Section 3, permits no risk sharing. The fixed rate regime,

on the other hand, forces agents in the country with nonrandom endowments to

share the risk of agents in the country with random endowments, as explained in

Section 4. Explicit welfare comparison in Section 5 shows that the choice of

the exchange rate regime rests on the degree of relative risk aversion. Some

concluding remarks are offered in the final section.


2. The de1 and Notation

       There are two countries, denoted A and B, and one nonstorable con-

sumption good. All agents are identical,!' live for two periods, and receive

an endowment of the good only in the first period. Each agent is indexed by a

vector (i, t h), where i is the country of residency, t the current date,

and h his age. A young person is denoted by h = 1,       and an old person by

h =   2.   There are Na agents in each generation residing in country A,

and Nb in country B.


     .iLThe case where preferences are different across countries is considered
later. It does not alter any results of the paper.
                                            2



        When young, an agent of generation t in country i receives w1(t)

units of the consumption good, which depends on the state of nature z(t).

For simplicity, there are two states of nature, denoted by "one" and "two",

occuring with probability q and (1 - q) respectively. Each draw of z(t)

is stochastically independent of any other draw. An A—young gets w units in

state one, and w units in state two. Without loss of generality, assume

w > w. Each B—young gets the same endowment in both states, i.e.,
 b       b
Wi = W2.

        He consumes c'it, 1) units when young, selling the rest for m1(t)

units of real balance. Money is the only store of value. Each country issues

its own currency, the nominal quantities of each are fixed at M1. An agent

is allowed to hold only money of his own country..Y When old, he purchases

c1(t + 1, 2) units of consumption, leaving no bequest.

        The problem faced by each young person is to maximize his expected hf e—

time utility, which is separable in the two periods:21


(2.1)            maximize U(c1(t, 1)) +      E[V(c1(t    +   1,   2))]



                  subject to        c1(t, 1) =   w1(t)   —   m1(t)

                               c1(t + 1, 2) =    t)p]t)/pl(              + 1)


                               c'it, 1), ci(t + 1, 2), &(t) > 0


The agents know the current prices, Pa(t) and pb(t), and the distribution

of prices in the next period. E[        I   is   the expectations operator.


     .YOther regimes, allowing agents to hold money from both countries are
considered in Karekan and Wallace. The equilibria under these regimes all
lead to a constant exchange rate, and can be identified with the "fixed
exchange rate regime" of this paper.

     2/This is not essential, but simplifies the mathematics.
                                                 3


        We consider actions of agents only in stationary equilibria. A

stationary equilibrium is one in which the sante prices, a and b, occur

whenever the state of nature is z. It is completely characterized by the

ratios of prices in the two states,
                                                a =    a a
                                                      p1/p2    and     b= bb4/
        An individual born in state one will solve the first-order condition:


                                               + (1 —
(2.2)              U'(w —    m)
                                  =
                                      qV'(m)            q)V(m1),           i     a, b


and it is straightforward to show that the optimal real balance, m(4), is

a decreasing function if R < 1, a constant function if R = 1, and an

increasing function if R > 1, where R is the degree of relative risk

aversion of the second period utility:


(2.3)                                 R(x) =   —xV"(x)/V'(x)

as defined in Pratt [1964]. His expected lifetime welfare is:


(2.4) w(4) = U(w         —
                             m())       +
                                            qV(m(4?))
                                                         + (1 —
                                                                  q)V(m($1)4),          i =   a, b

        An individual born in state two will solve the first—order condition:


                                                 + (1 —                          a, b
(2.5)         U'(w —   m)4 = qV'(m/)                      q)V'(m)4,        i =


The optimal real balance, m(), is an increasing function if R < 1,                             a

constant function if R = 1,           and a decreasing function if R > 1. His

expected lifetime welfare is:


(2.6) W(1) = U(w         —
                             m())       +
                                            qV(m(4)/cf)       + (1 —
                                                                       q)V(m(4)),       i =   a,   b




    !"        is   a measure of uncertainty of prices. A rise in 4                      increases
the mean and variance of prices.

        From (2.4) and (2.6), we can calculate the expected lifetime welfare of

an unborn individual:


(2.7)                      W1() =      W(4)      + (1


W'(4) is a convex function when R < 1, a constant function when R = 1,

and a concave function when R > 1. This fact is crucial in the comparison of

welfare in the two exchange rate regimes.


3.    uilibrium under the Flexible       Rate Regime


        Each country has its own central bank. In the flexible rate regime, the

sole function of the central banks is to distribute money to the old at time

t =   0.   They do not intervene in the exchange market. The trade balance in

the two countries must therefore be zero, since agents are not allowed to hold

the other country's money. Hence prices are random in A, and nonrandom in B.

        In country A, the goods market at time t clears when the money market

clears:


(3.1)           Napa(t)ma(t) =   NaPa(   —   1)ma(t - 1) =     Ma



The stationary equilibrium is a price pair (pt, p), which satisfies:


(3.2)                             = Ma/ENama],          z = 1, 2


where m and m are the optimal real balances in the two states. We can
          a
show that m2 > am1, and wa —       a
                                  m2
                                          a
                                       > w1 —
                                                  a
                                                 in2,    i.e., A—young born in state

"two" will save and consume more. So the stationary equilibrium price ratio
 a=     a a    a a
      p1/p    m2/m1 is greater than unity.

        In country B, there is no uncertainty in the stationary equilibrium.

Hence prices and real balances are constant:

(3.4)
                            p p =      Mb/[Nbm]

The equilibrium price ratio is:


(35)                                          =   1




        The equilibrium exchange rate in state z is given by the "law of one

price" :/

(3.6)                                  z"z' z =           1, 2


which is the B—currency price in terms of A—currency. The crucial result is

that the exchange rate is different in the two states:


(3.7)                            si/s2 =      a       >



4.   ui1ibriu under the Fixed Rate Regime
        In the fixed rate regime, the central banks cooperatively fix the ex-

change rate at S forever, and are willing to trade any amount of currencies

at this rate. This fixes the world private stock of money at M                     Ma + SMb,

whose composition is determined by demand conditions. The world goods market

clears when the money market clears:


(4.1)       (t)[Nama(t) + Nbmb(t)] =   ir(t   -
                                                      l)[N%a(t   - 1) + Nbmb(t -
                                                                                   1)]   = M


where ir(t) is the price of consumption in units of A—currency.




     !/we assume that there are no barriers to trade, i.e., no transport
costs, tariffs, quotas, etc. Therefore goods arbitrage ensures the validity
of the "law of one price."
                                              6


        The stationary equilibrium under this regime is a price pair                       it2)
which satisfies:


(4.2)
                                      raa+ Nbbi
                                 = M/LN                       z = 1, 2



where i4g         p,      and     are the optimal real balances in the two

                                                      =
states. The equilibrium price ratio,                       1t1/1t2 is   the fixed point of

[Nam() + Nbm($)J/[Nam() +             Nbm()].         It   can be shown that            is between

   =    1   and •a > 1.     (The proof is outlined in Appendix 1.)

        There are several interesting points about this equilibrium. One, the

real balances and the price ratio are independent of the money supplies and

the (fixed) exchange rate. Second, the larger the population of A relative
                                  *               a

                                                                            is       b = 1.
population of A relative to that of B, the closer 4                              to c
       Third, A—young born in state two desires to hold a higher real balance

than those born in state one. In fact, they hold a higher nominal balance:

        > iru. (A proof is furnished in Appendix 1.)

       Four, the nominal trade balance is zero on average, while the real trade

balance is positive (negative) for country A (B) on average. This comes from

the previous observation. There are three cases: (a) If the state of nature

was "one" last period and "two" this period, the current A-young will want to

accumulate a higher nominal balance than the current A—old. They sell some of

their endowment to B—old, running a trade surplus. (b) Conversely, if the

state of nature was "two" last period and "one" this period, A will run a

trade deficit of an equal nominal amount. (c) When the same state of nature

occurs consecutively, the trade balance in the second period is zero. Since

the events (a) and (b) occur with equal probability, the nominal trade balance

is zero on average. But the real trade balance is nonzero, since A tends to
                                         7


run a surplus when the price of consumption is low, and a deficit when it is

high, which implies that A expects to run a real trade surplus.

      Intuitively, the fixed regime unifies the currency and goods markets,

forcing B—residents to share the endowment risks of A—residents. In a good

state, i.e., z = 2,     A "gives" B consumption by running a trade surplus.

In a bad state, i.e.,    z = 1,   A "takes" consumption from B by running a

trade deficit. This risk sharing arrangement increases the mean consumption

in B, i.e., A expects to run a real trade surplus.


5.   Comparison of Exchange Rate Regimes


     First,   we compare the distribution of random variables under the two
regimes.   From the point of view of country B, the fixed rate regime

increases the price variance, because the disturbance is external to country

B. On the other hand, the fixed rate regime reduces the price variance for

country A, since the disturbance is internal to country A. It is also easy

to show that the mean and variance of aggregate consumption are lower (higher)

in country A (B) under the fixed rate regime. This agrees with the usual

findings, as in Fischer [1977].

     Second, we compare the expected lifetime welfare of an unborn agent,

W1(), between the two regimes. As noted in Section 2, W1() depends on

 the degrees of relative risk aversion. The various cases are exhibited in

 Figure 1, and summarized as follows:

         (1)    If R < 1, w1() is convex. Wa() is decreasing over the

               interval (1, p),      for    some    4i between 1 and 4a    and increasing

               over p, co•     wb() is decreasing over (0, 1), and increasing

               over (1, co)
                              1
         (2)   If R = 1,      W ()     is   constant.

         (3) If R > 1, W1() is concave. Wa(,) is increasing over the



               over ,   .
               interval (1, iv),




               over (1, ).
                                     for   some

                                           is
                                                   i4i
                                                         between 1 and ca and decreasing

                                                increasing over (0, 1), and decreasing



         (4)   If either R < 1 or R > 1,                 Wa(l) >   Wa()
(The proofs are in Appendix 2.)

      Clearly, B—individuals prefer the fixed regime if R < 1. They are

indifferent if R = 1,        and they prefer the flexible rate regime if R > 1.

These results are simple to explain. For a given increase in both the mean

and variance of consumption, B—residents are better off if they are not very

risk averse, and worse off if they are very risk averse.

      The cases for A—re5idents are not so clear. If they are highly risk

averse, i.e., R > 1, they prefer the fixed rate regime, because the reduction

in the variance of consumption more than compensates for the reduction in the

mean of consumption. If R = 1,              they are indifferent. But if they are not

very risk averse, i.e., R < 1, then the case is ambiguous. When A is large,
  *                a
      is close to c ,      and they prefer the flexible rate regime. When A is
          *                    b=
small,         is close to        1,        and they prefer the fixed rate regime.

      Thus far, the analysis has assumed that preferences are identical across

countries. All the results will obtain, when we allow preferences to differ

across countries (but remain identical within each country). Table 1 gives the

welfare comparisons. The polar cases are the most interesting ones. For example,

Ra >   1   and Rb < 1 imply that both countries prefer the fixed rate regime.

When Ra < 1 and Rb > 1, and when A is large, both prefer the flexible rate

regime. There are also examples where the countries disagree——when Ra > 1       and

Rb > 1, or when Ra < 1 and Rb <       1   with A large compared to B.


5.   Concluding iinrks

       When there are no missing markets under either exchange regime, money plays

no essential role in the model, and so the allocation of real resources is

invariant to the exchange regime.2! In this case, there is no reason to prefer

either regime. On the other hand, when some markets are missing under both

regimes, it is not clear that the ability to share risk across countries in the

fixed rate regime improves welfare over the flexible rate regime which prevents

any risk sharing. This is a standard result in a second best world, and is

likely to be robust against all modifications of the model as long as markets

remain incomplete in both regimes.

       By the same token, there are circumstances in which one exchange regime has

a complete set of markets while the other regime does not. We then opt for the

regime which attains the first best equilibrium. For example, we can introduce

a forward exchange market into our model, thus completing the set of markets in

the flexible regime but not in the fixed regime, making the former preferable.

Another modification isto include random endowments in country B, such that

w = w, w =           and Na = Nb.
                w,                   There will be no aggregate uncertainty in the

fixed rate regime, which makes it preferable over the flexible rate regime.

Proof: Define h() = cfm'(4) -                 m()/.        Dropping the superscripts to save

notation, we have:


                        h'    =   {i +   m/m]mi ÷ [i             m2/m2][n2] 0

it   is easy to show that          [i + 4rn/m1} > 0, and             [1 —
                                                                            m/m2J > 0. Thus, h' > 0.
Now h(1) = 0.       Thus h() > 0 for 4                >    1, h(4) < 0 for            < 1.         Q.E.D.


Corollary 1:                             m() > m() when                  > 1.

tion, we have:

Clearly,     h' > 0, for the same reasons as in Lemma 1. Note that h(1) < 0,

since m(1) < m(1).
       Also h(4) > 0,         since aa(a) = a($a) > m()/. Therefore, there
exists a unique 4        between 1 and •a, such that h(4) =                      0.

m(1)     > m(i), and m(1) =             ui(i).    Also, fct,a < 4a

                          Hence         f(4a) < a if and only if m(4)                  <

Lmm 3: Let f(x) = xV'(x),                   where V(             )     is increasing and concave.

Then ft(x) > 0 if R(x) < 1, f(x) =                       0       if R(x) = 1,              and f'(x) < 0 if

R(x) > 1.


Proof: f'(x) =           V'(x)   + xV"(x) =     V'(x)[1+         XV"(X)] =       V'(x)[l—R(x)].              Q.E.D.


      Now, define:


                          =                                  =              —                                —
g.(q.) =       E[w1()]        qw(4)    + (1 —
                                                q)w(4)               qU(w       m(4))       + (1 —
                                                                                                     q)U(w       m(4))
                              ÷ q2V(m(4)) ÷ q(1 —                                + q(l —
                                                             q)V(m(4))                        q)V(m()/4)
                              ÷ (1 —

Note that g(4) = q(1 — q)                m()V'(4n($)) —
Consider the case for i = b.                At • = 1,                g,(1) =    0.       Suppose     < 1. Then

           <                  by Lemma 2. Suppose R < 1. Then

< [m(4)/4]V'(m($)/$), by Lemma 4.                    In other words, g,() < 0 for                                < 1.

Similarly, g() > 0 for c > 1.                       This means that Ewb(cf)) is increasing

over (0, 1), and decreasing over (1, °°), reaching a maximum at t                                        = 1.

The other cases for B are shown analogously.

      Now consider the case for i = a.                       By Lemma 2 we know there exists 4

between         1   and •a such that                 =                          Hence g(4i) = 0.         Suppose

  < .          Then    m($) ( m(4)/, by Lemma 3. Suppose R > 1. Then

                          > [m(4)/4]V'(m($)/), by Lemma 4. So, g($) > 0 for

  < .          Similarly,      g'($) < 0 for         > 4. This means E[wa()] is

decreasing over (0, ), reaching a minimum at                                    =    ,     and increasing over

(p,   ). The          other cases for A are shown analogously.
