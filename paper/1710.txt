                   Issues in National Savings Policy



                                ABSTRACT




     This paper reviews a number of issues relating to the policy goal of

increasing national saving s.      The first    sect i on   considers the measurement

and definition of nati onal savings. Co mpari sons of current US savings

rates with those of other countries and with the past US experience are

presented. The sec ond sec tion consi ders possible avenues through which

public policy can i ncrease   nat i onal   savi n gs.    Whi le most discussion has

centered on the eff ects of changes i n the rate of return received by

savers, this is far from t he only ch annel through which policy can effect

savings.    I conclude that changes in publ ic savin gs or dissavinq through

budget surpluses or defici ts are the most potent and reliable policy tool

for altering the say ings r ate. The third secti on of the paper examines a

crucial savings poli cy question        Wh ere w ill extr a savings go? Both

empirical estimates and econome tric model           si mul at ions   suggest that a

surprisingly small s hare of md uced extra savings will find their way into

increased   p1 ant and equipment    i nves tAlent.    A major effect of increased

savings would be to reduce capital inflows and improve American

competitiveness

       The al location of resources between present and future consumption — or

savings —       s perhaps the most fundamental choice facing any economy. Just as

an econoe y faces a c hoice betw een guns and butter today, i t faces a choice

between c onsumpti on today and consumption in the future.        And the stakes

involved in this ch oice are ex tremely large. Most of nati onal wealth will

be spent on future as opposed to present consumption. The rate of savings

determine s the rate of economi c growth a country can enjoy         As we will see,

it can al so have an important influence on a nation's competitiveness on

I nternat i onal   markets.

       The protection of generations yet unborn is often held to be ore of the

most fun damental roles of government.         Public policy affect s the national

savings decision in man y ways: through direct public sa ving or dissaving,

through the effects of taxat ion on the rates of return available to private

savers, through the effects of financi al regulatipns on the public's ability

to dissa ye and borrow, and through the effects of socia 1 insurance programs

on incen tives to self—insure through p rivate savings — to name just a few of

the   most important examples.    In many areas of economic policy, it is

possible for the government to be neut ral, leaving the private economy to

determi n e the allocation of resources.        In the context of savings policy,

this is impossible Any set of tax an d spending rules must necessarily

influence the rate of savings.       There is no natural benchmark of

neutral i ty.


       This paper surveys some of the issues that are critical in thinking

about national savings policy. A major theme of much of the analysis is the

importance of thinking not just about the level of national savings but also

its allocation. While increases in national savings and increases in

productive plant and equipment are often equated in popular discourse, there

is a substantial difference. National savings go to finance residential

     be used to attain any given target for national savings remains an important

     one.

     saving in the United States           is rath er 1 ow.   The reasons why the US say i      ngs

I. NATIONAL SAVINGS IN PERSPECTIVE


     Table 1 presents estimates of         the net and gross savings rate in the

United States over the post World War         II       period. Information on the

components of national savings is also presented.                The data are drawn from

the national income accounts and so are            subject to a number of problems.

All government spending and cons umer spe nding            on durable goods are excluded

from savings. No adjustment is made for                the effects of inflation or nominal
interest payments. This leads t o an und erstatement of the saving of the

government and corporate sectors           since they are net debtors, and to an

overestimate of personal savings since the               household sector is a net

creditor. It does not, however,          af fec   t the calculated level of national
savings.
     The data in     Table 1 suggest several conclusions. First, the share of

depreciation    in GNP   has increased substantially                        time causing the

trends in gross and net savings to diverge. This is a conseq uence of the

rising   capital o utp ut   ratio in recent years that has resulted from the

slowdown in prod uct ivity growth, and a shift in the              c   ompositi on of investment

 towards short ii ved assets.          In recent years, gross pri vate savings has

 been relatively high by historical standards whereas net                    pri vate   savings has

 been relatively low.                                                  in   the policy debates


 of recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the rate of dissaving

 by government.      This   is   wholly the result       of Federal defici ts since state

     It is important to rote that US savings rates are rather low in long

term hi stori cal perspective.         Eel dstei n       (1977), drawing on the work of Simon

Kuznets       pro cents some estimat ed saving s rates                 pre—Wor ld War II

Feldstein reports a net capita 1 formati on rate of 13.2 percent for the

decade of the 1890's and 10.1 percent 4 or the decade of the 1920's.                  This


finding is perhaps surprising.            Much mo dern theory emphasizes the role of

saving for retirement. Yet re tireinent was an almost non-existent phenomenon

in the ear ly part of the 20th century.                                       weak evidence

in favor of the argu ment of K.otlikoff and Summers (1981) that bequests are                   a



dominant motive for savi ngs.

      Just as cii rren t US savings rates appear relatively low in hi stori cal

perspective, so do they appear relati vely low in international perspective

as well. Table              presents some figur es on national savings rates for the

United States,       the European members of the DECD, and Japan. The data do not

agree exactly w i      th    those in Table 1 because Table 2 is based on the United

Nations System of National Account S.                The data in Table 2 show that the

Amer Ic a n   savings rate lags far beh i     nd     that of Europe and Japan. During the

 1970's,      the national savings rate in the US was only 53 percent of that in

Europe and 31 percen t of that in 3 apa n                 The only major European country

with a savings rate as low as that of the United States was the UK, which

       Why are there such large dif ferences in savings rates across dev eloped

 economies? The question has been i nvesti gated, but is far from resol ved.

the story. Differences jr Social Security systems may also provide a

partial explanation. But at this point            econoinists are forced to fall back

on the weak explanation of differences in tastes for savings. These tastes

may not be wholly exogenous. Under the lingering influence of Keynes,

concern about stagnation due to oversavi ngs has perhaps had more influence

on national attitudes towards savings in the US             and UK, than in Japan or

continental Europe.

     By the standards of both history and          other nations current US savings

turn to an investigation of what poli ci     es    coul d be undertaken to increase

national savings. Then we turn to an eval uati on of whether or not the US

savings rate is   too   low.

II.   PUBLIC POLICY AND NATIONAL SAVINGS


      This section c onsi ders the efficacy of possible policy approaches to

increasing nati onal savings.    The problem of how to increase national

savings is very different from the problem of isolating the cause of our low

national savi ngs rate. Just as we do not reinf late the leaky part of flat

tires, there is no reason why the cause of low savings rates need be

associated wi th poli cies to increase savings. Moreover, many potential

determi nants of the savings rate such as the age structure of the population

and the rate of tech nical change are not readily alterable through public

policy. Nor is the problem one of merely finding the most potent policy

lever for inc reasi ng national savings. The theory of economic policy

suggests that policy targets should be assigned to instruments which can

influence them significantly, without incurring substantial collateral

costs.   It   would be inappropriate for example, to try to manipulate the savings

rate by ab olishing life insurance contracts because of the collateral costs

involved, even though the policy might be quite effective. So too, measures

such as th e issuance of savings bonds cannot play a major role, because

while they do not have large collateral costs, they do not have much effect

on savings either. The problem of savings policy is to find policy measures

which can be carried far enough to significantly increase national savings

without giving rise to significant costs.


?1ic iog            Piying
      The most direct tool at the governments disposal for altering the

national savi ngs rate is changes in the level of public saving or dissaving.

As we saw in the previous section, public saving is one of the three

components of national saving.

      Except f or the possibility, considered in some detail below, that increases

the level of public Saving is sub ject             to       direct public control           through

changes in the level of taxat ion arid g ov er n if C nt cx pend iture.                    The effects of

given policy changes can be g auged wi th                  a great      deal of precision.

          The potentially direct 1 ink ages bet we en the rate of public saving and

the level of national saving suggest              that       if   altering the rat e of rational

saving is a policy goal, this goal sh ould be assigned to defi cit policy.                                 Indeed,

if the deficit can be altered without col ate ral costs, and i ts effects on

national saving can be gauged accurat ely, the theory of econo mic policy as

described in Brainard (1967) or Theil                  (19 71) suggests that it alone should

be used to influence the level of national s avings. Other in struments

should be set to achieve other goals wit hout regard to their effects on the

 necessary to achie ye gi yen goals, an d extreme movements are more likely

 have other effects than are more mod crate changes.

           In standard Keynesi an macroeconomic models, there is a clear and direct

 linkage between national savings and public savings. Consider for example a

 personal tax increase which reduces the government budget deficit.                               If




                                                       9
government spending is kept constant, public savi ngs is increased by the

revenue raised through the tax increase. Private savings is reduced only to

the extent that the reduction in disposable incoai e caused by the tax

increase reduces private savings. As long as the marginal propensity to

save of the household sector is low, this offsett ing effect is likely to be

very minor.

     This view of the effects of budget defic its on nat ional savings has

been challenged in recent years by Robert Bar ro (1974) and a number of other

authors. Their argument runs as follows. In the long run, the present

value of the government's tax receipts must e qual the present value of its

expenditures. Increases in taxes today, with expenditures held constant,

entail reductions in taxes tomorrow. The present value of the taxes that will

be collected from consumers is unaffected by a tax change.          Thi s means that

their wealth is unchanged and therefore that they should not al tar

their consumption decisions. Hence a tax inc rease should have no effect on

national savings. The argument may be stat ed another way. On Barro's view,

which is often referred to as the Ricardian Equivalence view!          government

debt is not net wealth.    The value of the government bonds tha t consumers

hold is exactly offset by their knowledge of the tax liabiliti es that will

ultimately be borne to se rvice or pay off the nation al debt        Changes in

government debt, because they cannot affect consumer s weal th, cannot affect

their spending decisions, and so cannot have any imp act on the level of

national savings.

     Thus the Ricardian e qui   v alence   argument suggest s that policies which

change public savings whi le h aving no effect on the level of public spending

can have no impact on the nat ional savings r ate. Th is arg ument lirni ts

severely the efficacy of defi cit policy as a tool of savin gs policy.        Is it

valid? This has been the subject of a raging controversy over the past


                                            10
decade. Much of the debate has revolved around the commonplace observation

that consumers have finite lifetimes. Therefore, holds the keynesian

argument, some of the tax 1 iabilities engendered by the national debt will

be borne by future generations. Those alive at present will spend more

because t hey are w ealthier on account of the gov ernment bonds they hold.

Persons y et unborn can hardly save in anticipati on of their tax liabilities.

As a resu lt, incre ases in government debt increa se private consumption and

thereby r educe nat ional savings. Proponents of the Ricardian equivalence

view disp ute this analysis holding that those al ive today are likely to

adjust th ci         r   bequests to reflect any tax liabilities that are foisted on

their des cendants.

         Whi 1 e    the Ricardian equi valence debate has generated a great deal of

interest in th e determinants of intergeneration al transfers             it seems

u n I i k e 1 y    that the nature of b equest motives is really of fu ndamental

i sport    ance in determining the effects of govern ment budget deficits on

nation al savings. The typica 1 adu lt consumer has an ex pected life span of

about 3Z years.              If the debt is in creased, mo st of the burden of servicing

or rep aying the debt will be borne within his lifetime.              The present value

of the de bt burden that he wi 11 av oid by pass ing it on to his offspring is

very smal 1.             The case for the view that gover nment savi ngs influences

nati onal          savings must rest on some grounds ot her than    the finiteness of

i rid i vi d u a   I li fetimes

           My read ing of the       evidence suggests that changes in g overnment

deficits are likely to              have important impacts on national savings.       They

affect th e le vel of nat ional savings because consumers appe ar not to

consider the eff ects of future tax policies when they determine their

consumpt ion deci sions.            Even when 4 uture tax changes have been legislated,



                                                  11
consumers appear not to be much affected. This is illustrated by recent

experience. In the summe of 1 981, a three year program of sub stanti al

reductions in income taxes was enacted.              If cons umers acted in a forward

looking way, one would hay e cx ected consumption to surge imme diately and

then not to change much at all when the tax cuts actually took place. This

is not what has occurred.        Per sonal consumption expenditures r ose at a 1.7

percent rate during 1981 when the tax cut was en acted, and at a 2.5 percent

rate in 1982 when it began to take effect, and at a 5.1 percen t rate in 1983

when it fully came on stre am         The savings rate was higher in 1981 before

the tax cuts than in 1922 or 1 923 after the tax cuts.                Simil ar patterns

may be observed in other cases where tax policies have been announced in

advance.

      Recall that the Ricard Ian equivalen ce proposition that consumers

internalize not only announc ed tax change s but a1o the yet unannounced

changes that will ult i   matel y   be needed to balance the government budget.

Imputing this degree of rati onal ity to consumers strains credulity. Of

course, i n many case s even i f ho useh old s foresaw future tax changes, they

would not change their behavi or in anti cipation o4 them.             Many households

are liqui dity   constrai ned   and es senti al ly spend all of t heir current

disposabl e income. Mo vements in       cx p cc t   ed futur e income cannot affect their

consurnpti on or saving since they do riot save an d cannot borrow.           On balance

it seems reasonable to conclude that in creases in curre nt taxes will have a

substant i al influence on the level of national savings.             hny offset due to

reduced private savings because of reduced future tax 1 iabilities seems

likely to be small.

     The analysis here has concentrated on the effects of changes in taxes

which leave government spending unaffected. Quite obviously, even on the

Ricardian equivalence view, changes in government spending might affect


                                              12
national savings. But such changes also alter the mix between private and

public c onsumpt ion.       They are t hus less suitable as a policy instrument for

manipula ting the nat I    onal     saving s rate.

      It appears that throu gh its           debt policy the government can

systemat ically and f airly predi c tably manipulate the level 0+                 national

savi ngs.   The questi on of COl 1 at eral costs remains. Before assigning the

target a 4 the nati ona 1 savi ngs r ate t o debt policy, it is necessary to

consi der whether i ncr eases in pu blic         savings to   raise national savings might

have oth er adverse co nseque nc       es   which would make them infeasible. An obvious

risk is the Keynes ian      + ear    that increases in public savings will lead to

stagnati on due to ins uffici ent           aggregate demand. Whatever the are the merits             of


this argument in the contex t of the post— Depression period, the fear of

excessive say ings is not an           important one today. The ability of monetary
policy to sti mulate a ggrega te        demand    has been amply demonstrated. Any

reductions in demand due          to   increased gov ernment savings can easily be

offset by exp an   s ion a ry   monet ary policies        Indeed, on the plausible view

that monetary policy targets nominal GNP de facto, increases in qovernment

savings will have no effect on nati onal               savings even w ithout changes in

monetary policy.        Moreover,      as Greg Mank iw and I (1984       have recently argued,

increases in tax es may a ctually raise aggregate demand if the marginal

propensity to ho ld money for consumpti on exceeds that + or other components

of GNP.

      There are three other potential problems wi th dedi cat ing de+ icit policy

to the achievement of a national say ings target.                First    r   ai sing   taxes to

increase public savings involves excess burden.                 All   re al world t axes

involve some distortion of economic behavior and theref ore impose                       costs   on


the private sector in excess of the revenue coll ected.                  0+ course       increased


                                                  13
taxes at present r educe government interest payments, reducing the need for

tax revenue in the future. Nonetheless, usi ng tax pol icy as ar instrument

for controlling pub 1 i c savings is likely to requir e that taxes be varied in

a way which causes di stortions, and th is is a coil ateral cost.                 Second, if

increases in public s avings were used to achieve a major increa se in

national savings, to levels anywhere n ear those ob served in Eur ope, the

national debt would b e eliminated.       It    would then be necessary for the

government to invest directly in the p rivate sect or which might pose

political problem of different sorts.           Third, it might be pout i          call y


impossible for the government to run c hronic budQ et surpluses i n an effort

to increase national savin gs.     As the New Republi c's recent con clusiori that

"the nation can no longer afford curre nt 5tudent loan programs" evi dences,

the fiscal situation of th e government ha5 an imp ortant impact on public

spending decisions. Chroni c surpluses         C ay   well be impossible b ecause of the

pressures they create for new spending programs.                 In this case     it will be

infeasible to increase nat ional savings greatly th rough increa ses in public

savings and it might be un desirable as well

     The analysis in this subsection suggests that the public savings rate

should be the principal po licy tool used to a chieve any given                 nat i anal


savings target. Increases in public savings have a predictabl e potent

effect on national savings       And at 1 east so me changes in nati onal savings

could be achieved without significant coil at era 1 costs. However, achieving

large increases in nationa 1 savings to level           se yen   approaching those

observed in Europe through increases in publ ic saving might not be feasible.

Moreover, policymakers app ear unwilling to u se deficit to achieve a rational

savings target.   It therefore is useful         to examine other possible pos iLy

instruments for aff ecting the    nat i anal    savings rate.

Tax Reform

     In   recent   years, mary public finance experts have advocated that our

current income tax system be replaced with a consumption tax. One of the

arguments advanced in favor of a consumpti on tax is that it wou Id p romote

saving at the expen se of consumption. Mor e general ly, it has b een argued

that the tax system should be reformed to promote s aving at the exp ense of

consumption. These ideas have found legi sl             ati   ye cx pression in the IRA

provisions of the 19 81 tax act, in the re ducti ons i n top margin al r ates, and

in the generous tax treatment of private pensi ons.                 Nonetheless    th e

argumen t that tax re form can significant ly af fect the level of nat ional

saving si s far from universally accepted.              Man y experts bel i eve tha t savings

decisi on; are not se nsitive to rates of return and that tax ref o r               ms    can

theref ore have only very limited effects on th e national sa vings ra te.

Until qut te recently this pessimistic vie w of the potent i              al   for tax policy


to in crea se national savings was general 1        y    a   ccepted.

     The   convent i on a I   wisdom that changes in the rate of return to 5 avers

caused by tax policy are unlikely to have mu c h impact on the savings rate is

buttressed by both th eoretical and empiri cal arguments.                The theoreti cal

argument is that incr eases in the rate of ret urn availab Ic to savers have

two potentia I effects.         On the one hand, they make savin g more attrac tive.

On the other they redu ce that amount that mus t be saved to hit any gi yen

future wealth target.          in economists' jar gon, substi tuti on and income effects

 conflict. Th e empiric al argument is that stu dies which add interest rate

 variables to aggregate consumption functi ons typically f md those var i                       abl es


 to have 1 i ttl e impact a nd not to enter in      as tat       isticall y significant way

      Else w her e, Summers      1981), (1982) •(1984)          have considered these

 arguments in detail. My conclusion is that they are not valid. Increases

 in the rate of return to savings such as might be achieved through tax

                                                      fect on t he private savings
 rat e.    The standard theoretical argument           summar i z   ed above, by assuming that
 all   labor income is received in the first of two
                                                    periods, neglects the human
 wea Ith effect of inc reases in rates of return.               Increases in rates of return

 reduce the prese nt valu e of households' f uture 1 abor incom
                                                                e tending to
 reduce cons umpt       I   on and increase savings.   Fur the rmore, the standard argument

considers t he ef fects of uncompensated changes i n rates of return.

Compensated increases in rates of return, such a 5 would be associated with a

shift from income taxa tion towards consumption taxation can be shown to

unambiguous ly increase savings. Finally, it is importa nt to recall that

increases i n the rate of return
                                 have an unambiguously negative effect on

borrowing.       This poin t is empir ically significant.             In 1981, interest
deductions      reported on persona 1 tax returns exceeded interest income.

Reductions in borrowi ng have cx actly the same effect on national savings as

increases i n personal savings.

       Nor is the empiri cal evidence in favor of the view that rates of
                                                                         return

have negligi ble effect 5 on savings very strong.               The historical experi ence

reflects lar gely trans itory changes in rates of return which would be

expected to have much smaller effects on savi

that would be associated with             structural tax reforms. There are also

         in addition to their eff ects on rates of return             a v a i 1 a b 1 e    to private
             there are a number     of other channel s through which chan ges                  in tax
savers,
                                                                  in corpo rate           taxes which
pol icy     might affect private savings. Reduct ions

raise corporate cash flow wi 11 increase corp or           at e    savings unless, a s seems

uni i k ely,   dividends are adj usted rapidly.          It i s an open         question          whether

and a ver what horizon, households adjust t heir saving to                    of + set      the       saving

done on their behalf by corporation 5.              Unless they ad just fully and

i mine   diately, reductions in corporat e ta xes will raise nat i onal savi ngs.

          An alternative example is prov i    ded    by IRA's.      Th                            g


insurance is sold not bought. One won d ers whether th e same is not tr ue of

retirement savings. It seems likely that tremendous volume of adv ert ising

inducing consumers to open IRA's, which has become a sure sign of spr ingtime

in America, has at least some ef+ ect on some savings decisions.

          On balance, it seems likely that t ax re+orms co uld well increase the

national savings rate. This of course does not mea n that they should be

used for this purpose. Tax re+orms hay e a host of e ffects on both economic

 efficiency and equity, of which their impact on nati onal savings is not

 necessarily the most important.           If t he desired nati onal           savings rate can be

 achieved through public savings, there is no reason to manipulate the tax

 system towards      t hi s   end   Rather, the tax structure should be selected to

 maximize effici ency and equity goals.             If, however, public savings cannot or

 will not be used to achieve a target rate 0+             nation

 case for tax reforms to encourage national savings.


 Social insurance

           Beyond the effects of direct public savings

system.       Social Security promises citizens a very substantial level of

support after they retire.         It is natural to conjecture following

Fel dste in (1974), that Social Sec urity there by reduces private sa vi          n   gs.

 Indeed, Feld stein originally esti mated that the existence of Soci al Security

might r educe the private saving s rate in the United States by as muc h as 50

percent        This ar gument has gen erated a large literature over the la st

decade.       Theoreti cal work has e mphasized that promised Social Secu ri ty

benefit s are unli kely to reduce pri vate savi n gs dollar for dollar.               Unlike

pri vate savings, Social Security      pro vides supp ort for retireme nt in indexed

annuiti: ed form.       Social Securit y•s effect s on savings may be off set by its

tendency to encou rage early reti reme nt, or by i ts effects on bequest

behavi or       Empiri cal work using time   ser i e   s dat a, internation al cross

section evidence, and data o n individual househ olds has been somewhat

inc onc 1   usive as w eli.

      Th e signific ance of thi s debat e is unclear. If, as seems likel
                                                                         y,

Socia 1 Security h as had the effect of reducing national savings, it is not

clear w hat policy response, is app ropriate. The program exists beca use of a

social desire to make transf ers to the elderly and to provide certai n types

of insu rance. The provision of these types of insurance and transfer 5 may

affect the nation al savings rate. But as long as these effect; can be

offset with other policy instruments without undue costs, there is 1 ittle

reason to interfe re with the provision of insurance in order to infl uence

the nat ional savi ngs rate. Of course, Social Security reform may be

appropr iate on it s own terms. But, unless increasing national saving5                     is
seen as an urgent goal, and no other policy instrument is available, there

is no c ase for So cial Security reform on the grounds of national savi ngs.

Social      Security p olicy should be directed at goals other than national

savings.       Its effects on national savings are very uncertain, and there are


                                             18
large collateral consequences associated with using it to alter national

savi rig;.

      A similar ar guiiient     ap   plies to most other pub lic policies that impact on

national savings.      Ref orm       of the regulations on t he interest rates that

financial institutions are allowed to pay, for cx ample, might influenc               e


national savings        But it seems inappropriate to base decisions on these

reforms on consi derati ons of national savings, gi yen the multiplici ty of

instruments avai lable to influence national savings and the paucity of other

tools available for regul ating financial institut ions. This is not to

endorse deposit ceilings.             Rather, the argument i s that they should be set

on grounds.




       The theory of economic poli cy dictates that policy instruments should

be assigned to targets if their effect on the target is relatively

predictable, ar d if changes in t he use of an instrument do not involv e large

collateral cost s, either because they have minor effects, or because the

effects can be offset through the use of other policy instruments. These

criteria sugge st that the primary instrument of national savings policy

should be publ ic savi ngs. Increases in public savings are likely to

translate fair ly dire ctly into increases in national savings with relatively

little uncerta i   nty.       Changes in the rate of public savings are not likely to

have important     col 1 at   eral costs.

it is not clear that it should be used for this pu rpose un less increases in

III.     THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED NATIONAL SAVINSS


       Any policy judgment about the desirability of increasing national

savings must depend on a judgment about the allocation of increments to

nationa 1 say ings.     Thi   S   issue    is parti c ularl y important g iven the in creasing

in tegr a tion   of world c apital mark ets.           Consi de r the case of a small open

economy in a world whe re capital was pe rfect 1 y mobile.               Increases in

nati ona 1   say ings would have no ef fect on the d omestic ca pital stock. Since

capital mobi lity would equalize r eturns around the world any, incremental

savings woul d be sprea d thinly ar ound the world.                Increa ses in domestic

savings woul d not tend to increase domestic investment.                  Such an analysis is

clearly appr opriate in considering             i ncr eases   in savan g within a single US

state.       Capi tal is mobile across state boundaries and any state is small

relative to the US economy.               It is less clear how rel evant it is to the US

economy whi ch is large relative to the world economy, and whose savings may

not be c omp letely mobile iruternati onal         1 y


       Eve na part from the internati onal allocation of incremental savings,

there is t h e question of where say i          ngs    which increase the domest ic capital

stock will fall as well.            Many of the arguments adduced to supp ort

increased capital formation do not real ly apply if extra savings do not lead

to extra i nvestment in plant and e quipm ent. Other forms of capit al

formation are not penalized by the tax system and are less likely to pr omote

technol ogi cal    innovation. This secti         on     considers first the implication s for

savings po licy of the openness of the U S economy and then examines the

likely all ocation of increases in domestic capital formation.                  Finally,

estimates of the effects of reduced budget deficits on the composition of

output based on both reduced form equations and econometric simulations are

presented.

    Assessing the degree of internat ional capital mobility is crucial in
judging the effects of an increase in n ational savings.              If capital is

perfectly mobile, one would expect that only a share of increased savi ngs

equal to the US share of the world econo my would fall on domestic c api              tal


formation. The remainder would go to fi nance investment abroad, or

equivalently to purchase capital in the United States now held by

foreigners. The United States accounts for about one—third of th e output of

the world's capitalist economies.      Thus, if capital is perfectly mobile,

most of any increase in national savings will go to finance forei gn

investment.

         Increased US financing of forei gn investment has a necessary

concomitant. The balance of payments identity hold; that the current and

capital accounts must sum to zero.      I   ncreased   cap'i ta 1   outflows or reduced

capital inflows must necessarily be b alanced b y impr ovements in the trade

balance. Exports must rise and i mport s must fa 11 imp roving the

competitiveness of US industry.      The mechanism throu gh which these changes

will occur is simple. Increased savi ngs will reduce the return available on

US assets making them less attra ctive to forei        gn cr5   and reducing the demand

for dollars. This will lead to an cx change ra te dep reciation which in turn

improves US competitiveness. Th us if capital is mt ernationally mobile a

major effect of any increases in US savings Wi         11   be an improvement in US

competitiveness, or alternativel y stated a deterioration in our terms of

trade.

     Alternatively, if capi   tal   is not internationally mobile, increases in

US savings will lead to equal i ncreases in US capital formation. The

extent of international capital mobility then becomes a critical issue.

have presented my views on this question in some detail in Summers (1985)


                                            21
have presented my views on this question in some detail in Sumers (198;

and just summarize them here. Evidence can be marshalled in support of

various positions about the degree to which capital is interciatior.ally

mobile. The flourishing Eurodollar market, the large US current account

deficit, and the substantial internatior.al flows of gross investment bely

the view that capital is inherently immobile.

     On the other hand, as Feldstein and Horioka (199Q have emphasized the

correlation across countries between rates of savings and investment is

extremely high. High savings countries are also high investment countries

on a very consistent basis. This proposition is illustrated in Table 3

which presents national savings and investment rates for a number of

countries.   While the 1 ong run average savings rate varied across countries

between 17.3 percent and 34.9 percent, the largest average :urrent account

deficit was only 4.4 percent and the largest surplus was only 1.7 percent.

The correlation between domesti: savings and investment rates was .91. For

various sample periods, regressions consistently suggest that the propensity

to invest out of domesti c savings exceed; .9. domestic nvestmert rates or,

domestic savings rates consistently suggests that the propensity t o invest

out of domestic savings exceeds .9.

     It is not clear how the observed high correlation of dowestic savings

and investment rate; can be reconciled with high degree of :apitai mctiiity

that seems apparent. Su rely, it is unlikely that coincidence leads to the

strong association of savings and investnr.t rates.     In Sumiers (1595;, I

argue that the observed association between savings and investment rates is

a reflection of national economic policies.     For reasons that are not

entirely clear, nations are unwill irig to accept large current e:count

imbalances for sustained periods.     This leads them to use the ieers of

economic policy to achieve extern;l balance. This iCCi      to   a close

association between national savings and investment rates.       For example, it

appears that within the OECD, nations where private savings exceeds domestic

investment tend to run budget deficits on average, while na tions where

private savings fal is short of investment tend to run surpiuses on average.

     This interpret ation of the data suggests that nations are unlikely to

pursue policies whi ch substantially increase national savings without also

attempt ing to stimulate national investment. However, it suggests that if

such a policy were attempted, the result would be only smal 1 increases in

capital formation, and a large effect on the trade balance        In a sense, the

United States has pursued this policy in reverse in recent years, as the

Federal budget deficit has mushroomed. The result has been large capital

inflows from abroad which have enabled domestic investment to be extremely

strong on a cyclically adjusted basis.

      If   the primary effect of increases in nation'al savings is to reduce

capi tal   inflows or increase capital outflows with r elati vel y little impact

on nati onal investment, the question arises of whe ther or n ot they are

desirab le. This depends on why they are being adv ocated.      Investment abroad

will no t increase the productivity of American wor kers. No r does the tax

system create a wedge between the private and Amer ican soci al return to

foreign mv estment.     On the ot her hand, increased foreign i nvestment does

pass wealth on to future gener ati ons an d in this sense may be beneficial.

Furthermore increased capital out flows or reduced capital i nflows will be

associated with improvements in the competitiveness of domestic firms on

world markets.

      The analysis in the preceding section suggests that a large part of any

increase in domestic savings would flow abroad.        What about the component

that went to finance investment in the United States? One reasonable first

approximation is that it' would be spread rd atively evenl y across the

components of n ational wealth.           Inf or mat ion   on the asset compositi on o f

national weal th may be gleaned       f   rom the Nati onal Balance Sheets pr epar ed by

the Federal R ese rye system.     T he y reveal        that     at the end of 1983, the net

worth of the Uni ted States wa s $ 11.4         tn    11 ion        This $11.4 trilli on was

comprised of ao. 9 trillion in re sidentia 1 str uctures and consumer
             • -T                                                                        durab 1 es,


$3.1 trillion    in   plant and equip ment ,$3. 3 tn ilion i n land, and $ B trillien

in inventorie sa s well as a seal 1 positi ye cl aim on foreigners.

     Despite the natural ten denc y to thi nk of plant and equipment spending

as the princi pal disposition of savings, less than 30 percent of                       national
wealth is hel d in this form.         At market value rath er than replace cent cost,

the share of plant and equipme nt would b e even lower. Ev en among

reproducible assets       the share       of plant and e quipment is less than half.

It seems likely, therefore, that much of any                   i   ncrease in national savings that

was brought about by public policy would be al located to residential

structures and consumer durables.             In add ition           the reduc ed interest rates

that would be associated with inc reases i n say ings would lead to incr eases

in the value of non—reproducible assets 1 ike                  1   and. The resulti ng increases

in wealth would then tend to increase consumpt ion, partially of fsetting the

initial i ncr ease in savings.

     This analysi s suggests that on the basis of a priori                     reasoning, one
should   an ti cipate   that increases in national s avings will               have only a
relativel y minor effect on plant and equipment spendi ng.                     Much of any

increase in savin g will go to finance increase s in foreign                    investment.       And


savings a ilocated domestically will go in subs tantial part                    to    increase the

value of land, and to investment in residential structures.                          Below,   I test
these ideas by examining the relationship between changes in Federal budget

deficits and the composit ion of national output. Changes in Federal budget

deficits to a large exten t represent exogenous charges in national savings.

By examining their impact on the composition of output, we can gauge the

likely allocation of incr emental national savings.


Federal Deficits and the c2Q1QntI9fl Qf tI9il

        The starting place + or our analysis is the national income identity:


(1)     D =      —      = PS   +
                                   (I   —
                                            G)   +   NFl     —   I


where D represents the Federal deficit, PS is private saving, 65—T5 the

deficit of non—Federal governments, NFl is net foreign investment and I is

domestic investment.           In the absence of official reserves transactions, NFl

will be Just the negat ive of the current account balance. This identit y

demonstrates that with 6NP held constant reductiotis in Federal savings must

raise private savings, increase state and local surpluses, draw funds i n

from abroad by crowding out net exports, reduce investment or have some

combination of these effects.

        I estimate the effects of increases in Federal savings on                   e


composition of national output by fitting reduced form equations of the

type:


(2)           = a + b          + c1Cycle1 + c2Cycle2 + U




where Z., i=1—4 rep resent components of GNP and Cyclel and Cycle2 are
                                                                     t                  t

its lagged value,       and      real GNP growth        rates were used to proxy for cyclical

conditions. Equations wer e estimated using both the standard deficit as

reported in the National A ccounts and an inflation adjusted deficit which

accounts for inflations's erosion of the real value of outstanding debt.

The sample period was 1949 —1982 excep t in the case of the net foreign

investment equation which was estimat ed over the 1973—1982 period to allow

for the effects of the shi ft to float ing exchange rates. Results are shown

in Table 4.

     The results di ffer somewhat across equation; but several reasonably

robust conclusions emerge. Budget deficits call forth increased private

saving. Such saving rises by about 30 cents for each dollar of Federal

deficits. This extra saving ref 1              ects      the effects of increased di spo sable

income for consumers, the effect s Of                   ncre ases in rates of ret urn ca used by

Federal bor rowing and possibly t he eff ects of ant icipated tax liabil ities.

Each dollar increase i n Federal di ssav i                ng   appears to increase state and

local savin g by about fi ye cents. This may reflect substi tution of local for

Federal act iv ity on eith er the tax or spending side.

     The re su Its confirm the predicti on that increased deficits

crowd out n et exports by attra cting f oreign capital inflows.                    It i 5

suggest a significantly greater effect of budget deficits on net foreign

investment.

     Finally, the estimates suggest that each dollar of Federal deficits

crowds out about 40 cents of net invest ment. Th e average estimate in the

table is somewhat greater than this but negl ects the effects of deficits on

foreign capital inflows which have only become I mportant in the last decade.

The estimates in the final row of the table mdi cate that a little less than

half of the crowded out investment is p lant and equipment with the remainder

being inventories and housing.   An extr a dollar of Federal saving, according

to these estimates, will only generate about 20 cents in extra plant and

equipment investment.

     There are a number of possible problems with reduced forms of the type

presented above.   Movements in the budget deficit may not be exogenous.

Variables affecting the composition of           output may

omitted. An alternative approach to estimating the effect of changes in

Federal saving on the composition of national output is through simulation

 of a large econometric model. To this end, Table 5 reports the results of

 some recent DRI simulations of the effects of a deficit reform package.     The


 deficit reform package which DRI considered reduced the Federal deficit as a

 share of BNP by 3.5 percent over the 1986—1989 period through a balanced

 combination of tax increases and spending cuts. DRI also estimated the

 effects of its package on the components of SNP.

      The results in Table 5 tend to corroborate the estimates just

 presented. About one—third of the effects of deficit reduction is offset by

 decreases in private saving. A little less than a third is offset by

 increased state and local surpluses and reduced net foreign investment.

 Just over a third of deficit reductions flow into increased net investment,

 with about two—thirds of this total devoted to residential investment.      This

with abott two—thirds of this total devoted to residential investment. This

means that each dcllar of deficit reduction leads to about a fifteen cent

increase in net plant and equipment investment. It is encouraging that

these large econometric model estimate; are so close to those obtained from

reduced forms. While each methodology has its problems for an exercise of

this sort, the error; should be relatively independent.

     On balance, these empirical Exercises confirm the hypotheses sketched

at the beginning of this section. In:reases in national saving are likely

to have a variety of effects. In part, exogenous increases will be offset

by the effects of lower interest rates, in part net foreign investment will

decline, and residential and nonresidential investment will increase. As a

very rough approximation, these four responses will occur to about an equal

extent. The conclusion is that increases in national saving are a relatively

ineffective way of stimulating business investment. This conclusion would be

reinforced if Keynesian effects of increased saving! on aggregate demand

were considered, or if more weight were given to the current episode of

strong investment performance in the face of large budget deficits.       The

next section considers the implication; of these results for policy.

increase      th     ICV    1    of riatlcjnal       savings. Reductions in government borrowing

       There are strong considerations suggesting that deficit reduction

should be a high priority. Government                                     deficits            5 percent of GNP

loom over a ny foreseeable horizon.                       It    seems i riconcel V able t hat eco noel c

Feldstein (1977) argues that       policy        shoul      d be used to sub at ant iallv      increase

the    national savings rate.    H is   arousent            is that the avai I abl a   rate 0+

return, which he estimates at £2 percent                     is great enou gh that acre savings
are desirable unless we discount the uti lity                  of future consumption at a very
high rate. The estimated 12 percent ret urn                    15 based on   tfle observed profit
rate    of non—financial corporations              There      are a number of reasons to

bell eve that i.t substan tal ly     0', e r   states th e return to         incresental national
saving.     Fir ;t, the rat e of p rof it has dccl med dramati cally                 in recent
years *    4 mo re reasonab Ic cur rent        est i   mate would be in      the 9   percent range.

Second, as I have empha sized! most             i ncremen tal savings would not flow into

the cor porate sector. The re is every reason to expect that return on other

uses of saving is lower th an the retur n on corporate in vestment. Americans

receive only the after tax return on f oreign investment.                       Corporate      capital
is taxe d more heavily than housing or consumer durable;.                       Third,     some

part of the rate of profit represents a risk premium.                         One plausible

measure of the certainty e quivalent re turn on extra savi ngs is the real

return on nearly risk free investments such as Treasury bills. While this

figure is perhaps 5 percent at present                   it has averaged less than 1 percent

over the past 40 years.

        On balance, it seems likely that the current risk adjusted social

return to increased savings is probably well below 9 percent, and perhaps is

less than the economy's growth rate.

        At such rates, it is not clear that the social gains from increased

national savings would be large. There does not seems to be a

compelling case for raising investment in houses or the value 0+ land.                             Nor,

except for current exigencies is there a clear case for reducing net foreign

investment in the United States. While there are strong economic arguaents
for increased investment in plant and equipment                increasing national savings

is a very indirect way to br ing it about.

      The arguments presented in Section 3 about the allocation of

incremental savings suggest the desirability of policies directed

specifically at stimulati ng d omesti c plant and equipment investment. All

the analysis im plies that the supply of saving s to the corporate sector is

very elastic.      Even if sa vings do not respond sharply to increases in the

rate of return, there is subst antial scope for portfolio reallocations to

finance increas es in bus i    ness   i nvestm ent. Hence      measures which stimulate

investment are unlikely to be crowded out by ri sing interest rates. The

returns to priv ate inve stment in plan t and equi pment exceed those on other

investment. And there is at least some reason to think that there may be

substantial tech nological cx ternal ities associated with plant and equipment

investment       The extremely h igh correlat ion      between nati onal rates of growth
and nation al investment rates may wel 1 reflect the embodiment of technical

change or learning by doing effects.

      The m ost obvious policy measure available f or encouraging plan t and

equipment mv estment is corporate tax reform.             By    i   ncreasing the in vestment

tax credit or accelerating depreciati on allowan ces, it is possible to

sti mul ate   investment without conferri ng windfal 1 ga ins on the owner o              of
existing c apital.      From this perspect    i ye    the recent Treasury Tax proposal
is rather unsatisfactory.       It reduces the       tax burden on old capital        by

cutting t he corporate ta::i r ate    and of f cr1 ng dividend relief, and it
                                                 -

and scaling back depreciation schedules.

    There appear to be stronger econ omic arguments                 for measures drccted
at encouraging p1 ant and equIpment i nvestuient        than for measures directed at
i ::r;asi     ;t crnal savings general iv.     It shoul i be not ed however! that

 ncenti yes   for 1 nvestsent    can univ be offset by increased r ational savings.

There   say then be a case for increasing savings as part of       a policy mix

directed at i ncreasi n.y busi re;;. But the case for a major      policy effort to

raise the long term national savings rate without other pol icy        changes is

rot very stronQ.
