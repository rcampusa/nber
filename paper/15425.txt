FINANCIAL CRISES AND LIQUIDITY SHOCKS: A Bank-Run Perspective

                                                ABSTRACT

This note is motivated by trying to understand the macroeconomic implications of assuming that periods
of financial bonanza and turmoil are driven by financial innovation and collapse in line with the “bank
run” literature of the Diamond-Dybvig (1983) variety. Bypassing a host of important but, for the present
purposes, secondary details the note assumes that the initial effects of financial innovation and crash
can be summarized by a parameter that determines the “liquidity” or “moneyness” of land or capital.
This simplification helps to shed light on some issues that are at the center of the policy debate. In
particular, one can show that preventing price deflation is not enough to offset asset meltdown. Furthermore,
lower policy interest rates increase asset prices and steady-state output which, however, gets reversed
as liquidity is destroyed. An interesting result is that, in the neighborhood of a first-best capital allocation,
an increase in the moneyness of capital may lower the welfare of the representative individual, even
if the higher liquidity of capital is sustainable and, hence, not destroyed by future crash. Moreover,
an extension of the basic model supports the conjecture that low policy interest rates may have given
incentives to the development of “shadow banking.”

                                             I. Introduction

         Few would deny that we are living in extraordinary times. Where opinions start

to differ is about what is behind current events. The popular press, not surprisingly,

stresses fraud and crony capitalism, while better informed observers blame inadequate

financial supervision. Both have a share of the truth. However, these opinions may miss

a central fact, namely, that financial systems are, as a general rule, prone to eventual

collapse if they don’t have a “lender of last resort,” LOLR. Diamond and Dybvig (1983)

made that point in terms of a simple and elegant banking model (for a recent exposition,

see Diamond (2007)). Thus, under this optic the present financial troubles could be

traced to the existence of a “shadow” banking system that developed without enough

supervision and, critically, without a LOLR. This is the main conjecture that inspires the

present note.1 A second conjecture is that the shadow system succeeded in “printing

money” through devices like collateralized debt obligations, CDOs. This is formalized

by assuming that financial innovation succeeded in making land or capital more “liquid,”

e.g., by making them more useful as a means of payment. These assumptions or

conjectures are then employed to trace the general equilibrium implications of an increase

or collapse in land’s or capital’s liquidity – the central comparative-dynamic exercise – in

a rational expectations setup.2

         There are many models in which capital market imperfections contribute to make

business cycle fluctuations deeper and more persistent (see, for example, Bernanke and

Gertler (1989) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)). This literature stresses agency problems

1
  See Brunnermeier (2008) for a highly didactic exposition of the Subprime crisis that supports the view
that the financial collapse has Diamond-Dybvig characteristics.
2
  Rational expectations may look like an awkward vessel to encapsulate the discussion. However, in this
paper liquidity crises are taken as exogenous and unanticipated. Thus, our agents will be rational but
ignorant of the central driving force, i.e., the sudden demise of liquidity-enhancing financial instruments.


                                                                                                               1
in which first-best credit allocation is not achieved because of, for instance, asymmetric

information of debtors and creditors. A financial crisis of the kind we are experiencing

could be modeled in that context by assuming that there is a sudden deterioration in

agency problems. There is no doubt that the Subprime crisis itself has contributed to

worsening the creditworthiness of individuals and firms but it would be hard to argue that

the initial kick was given by a sudden deterioration of agency problems. Financial

institutions increasingly engaged in non-transparent activities but this did not occur

overnight; these activities took years to reach pre-crisis characteristics. Thus, available

models fail to meet a central analytical challenge for rationalizing the current crisis,

namely, developing a case in which behavior discontinuity could be justified in an

intuitively plausible manner.3 The challenge is better met by the model discussed in this

paper, because the Diamond-Dybvig bank-run story which underlies the model displays

equilibrium multiplicity (in absence of a LOLR).4 A financial crisis could erupt just

because people expect that other people expect that financial instruments issued by

shadow banks will be bereft of liquidity. This equilibrium fragility is not obtained by

superimposing an ad-hoc assumption to the original model (as it would be the case in the

asymmetric-information approach),5 but as a result of an essential characteristic of the

underlying bank-run model. No real shock is needed for crisis to happen in this context.

Thus, the model provides a rationale for the fact that the triggers behind big-time

financial crises in the 30s and late 80s – and even the Subprime crisis’ global

3
  This challenge is also faced by the literature on Sudden Stops in emerging capital markets (see Calvo
(2007). The challenge is less critical, however, because the initial kick took place outside most of
emerging capital markets.
4
  Granted, central banks eventually came to the rescue of “shadow banks,” but their action would have been
much more timely and effective, had rescue operations clearly been mandated in their charters.
5
  It would not be hard to generate equilibrium multiplicity in asymmetric-information models. However,
macro models in that vein do not explore that feature and, thus, implicitly assume uniqueness of
equilibrium.


                                                                                                        2
ramifications, not just crisis in the tiny subprime mortgage market – are so hard to

identify. In addition, the model puts a concept like “liquidity” up front in an explicit and

straightforward manner. This is important given the relevance of liquidity issues in

current debate.6

           Implications are straightforward and serve to highlight the macroeconomic impact

of phenomena like financial innovation and meltdown. In particular, in the basic model,

in which land is in fixed supply, an increase in land’s liquidity increases its relative price,

helping to explain a run-up on real estate prices triggered by financial innovation.

Likewise, a financial meltdown results in a sharp decline in land price – a bursting of the

bubble explained by underlying financial fundamentals, not Ponzi games. Moreover, the

model shows that preventing price deflation may fall short of avoiding serious financial

difficulties because the policy may be incapable of restoring the relative price of land.

           Moving from land to capital and allowing capital to accumulate in a neoclassical

manner, I will show that higher capital’s liquidity brings about capital accumulation and

higher output. This is in line with the literature supporting the view that financial

development and output growth are positively correlated (see, e.g., Demirgüç-Kunt and

Levine (2008)). However, I will show an example in which increasing the liquidity of

capital may be detrimental to social welfare, even ignoring the social costs of an eventual

liquidity crunch. Moreover, left to its own devices, the financial sector becomes

suboptimally large. The example, however, presupposes that capital allocation is not

hampered by distortions and could achieve the first-best allocation in absence of financial

intermediaries. Otherwise, enhancing the liquidity of capital could be socially beneficial.

This suggests that liquidity enhancements could be especially helpful in the context of

    An analytical advantage of the present approach is that it displays an extremely simple dynamic structure.


                                                                                                             3
highly distorted capital markets, if the probability of a financial meltdown can be kept

sufficiently low.

          The model is extended to study the impact of central bank’s interest rate policy.

Following Calvo and Vegh (1995), the central bank’s policy is made equivalent to paying

interest on money, where the interest rate is the central bank’s policy interest rate, e.g.,

the Fed’s Federal Funds Rate. In this setup, the central bank could raise the relative price

of land by lowering interest rates, even though monetary policy is conducted under

perfectly flexible prices.

          The model is capable of rationalizing the statement made by several observers

that Greenspan’s lax monetary policy after September 2001 is responsible for the housing

bubble, at least in the U.S. (see Taylor (2009)). Of course, if that explains the bubble,

raising interest rates would have burst the bubble, which helps to explain (but not justify)

Greenspan’s reluctance to raising interest rates. More generally, this result supports the

view that monetary policy could be effective in lowering the costs of an eventual

financial meltdown by timely raising interest rates, and thus putting a damper on asset

prices.

          The note is closed with a summary of central implications.

                                     II. The Basic Model

          Consider a standard infinitely-lived, representative-individual model with time-

separable utility. The instant utility function depends on consumption c and liquidity;

liquidity is produced by real monetary balances (in terms of consumption), m, and pk,

where k and p stand for land and its price (relative to consumption), respectively. More

concretely, liquidity (in terms of consumption) = m + θpk, 0 ≤ θ < 1, where θ is an index




                                                                                               4
of the “moneyness” of land (the linear form is assumed to simplify the exposition and

without loss of generality). This assumption is central, and represents the main

expository innovation in this paper. It captures a central macroeconomic implication of

the Diamond-Dybvig model, namely, that financial intermediaries enhance the liquidity

of real factors of production. But, at the same time, in absence of a LOLR or equivalent

arrangement, such liquidity could quickly evaporate in a bank run, possibly causing credit

unraveling and output collapse. Thus, parameter θ increases the liquidity of land when it

rises, but it could as well destroy it when it falls.7 The literature has focused on

arrangements to avoid this “bad” equilibrium, but the macroeconomic implications of

liquidity swings have remained relatively unexplored. The present paper attempts to start

filling that gap.8

         At time 0, the utility function takes the following form:9

                                 ∞

                                 ∫ [u (c ) + v(m + θp k )] e
                                                               − δt
                                       t         t      t t           dt , δ > 0                         (1)
                                 0


where utility indexes u and v are twice-differentiable, strictly concave and increasing

over the positive interval, and δ > 0 stands for the constant subjective rate of discount.

         At time t the individual’s financial wealth in terms of consumption, a, satisfies:

                                           at = mt + pt kt + bt ,                                        (2)




7
  Notice that, by making θ < 1, real assets are inferior transaction vehicles that would never be demanded as
such if they were unproductive. This ensures that multiple equilibrium à la Kareken and Wallace (1981)
does not hold in this model despite the linearity assumption.
8
  Interestingly, the link between liquidity and crisis appears to have been largely ignored in the growth
literature. For example, in a useful recent survey of the literature, Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine (2008)
discuss several theories establishing the link between liquidity and growth without mentioning the
possibility that liquidity could be conducive to financial crisis.

  Time 0 denotes the start of the planning period, and does not refer to a fixed calendar time. The
individual will thus face the same utility function as he/she replans in the future.


                                                                                                           5
where b denotes the stock of (instant maturity) “pure” bonds, i.e., bonds that are not a

source of liquidity, in terms of consumption. The instantaneous real interest rate on pure

bonds is denoted by r.

           Output y is produced by land, and the production function is linear and satisfies y

= ρk, where ρ is a positive constant. Therefore, the evolution of financial wealth a

satisfies:

                                          a&t = (ρ + p& t )kt + rt bt − ct − πt mt + σt                        (3)

where π stands for the instantaneous (consumption) rate of inflation, and σ denotes lump-

sum subsidies; seigniorage is fully rebated to the public and will equal σ. For simplicity

and without loss of generality, the government is assumed to hold no net wealth.

           Using equations (2) and (3) and ruling out Ponzi games, one obtains a familiar

intertemporal budget constraint:
                         t                                                                      t

                         ∫
                        − rs ds              ∞
                                                                                                ∫
                                                                                               − rs ds

                                  dt = a0 + ∫ [(ρ + p& t − r t pt )kt + σt − (πt + rt )mt ]e
                                             0
                                                                                                0
                                                                                                         dt.   (4)


Notice that π + r = nominal interest rate = opportunity cost of holding real monetary

balances; and rp − (ρ + p& ) is the opportunity cost of holding land, rp, minus its return,

ρ + p& .

Remark 1. The above budget constraint assumes the existence of perfect capital markets, an

assumption that may sound implausible given that the model is intended to cast light on

financial crises. This apparent weakness of the model, though, has the advantage of helping




                                                                                                                6
to show that liquidity effects by themselves go a long way in explaining real-estate bubbles and

other stylized facts of financial crises.10

           Maximization of utility (1) with respect to c, k and m, given initial condition a0

and the path of the pure interest rate r, subject to budget constraint (4), yields the

following first-order conditions:

                                 u′(ct ) = λDt                                   (a)


                                 v′(mt + θpt kt ) = λ (πt + rt ) Dt              (b)                       (5)


                                 v′(mt + θpt kt )θpt = −λ (ρ + p& t − rt pt ) Dt (c)

where λ is the Lagrange multiplier (a constant) corresponding to constraint (4),
               t

           ∫ ( δ−rs ) ds
and Dt = e 0             .

           In what follows I will focus on interior solutions, make some inconsequential

simplifications, and skip some obvious steps in order to streamline the presentation. I

will assume that the supply of land is constant overtime, and the subjective rate of

discount equals land’s marginal productivity, i.e., δ = ρ. Moreover, I will assume that

nominal money supply is constant over time (this will be relaxed in Section III.1). One

can show that these assumptions ensure that the steady state is the only converging

equilibrium path, and that equilibrium inflation π = 0.11 Correspondingly, and without

loss of generality, the following analysis will focus on steady states.

           From equations (5b) and (5c), we have, setting p& = 0,

10
   This model strategy is similar to that followed in several papers addressing the Great Depression and the
current crisis. See, for example, Cole and Ohanian (2004).
11
   See Calvo (1979) for a more detailed analysis of monetary models with perfect foresight. Using similar
techniques, one can show that the present model boils down to two differential equations (in m and p), with
no initial conditions. The linear approximation at the steady state displays two positive characteristic roots,
which ensure that the only converging equilibrium path is the steady state.


                                                                                                             7

                                              p=        , 0 ≤ θ < 1.                                    (6)
                                                   1− θ

An alternative, more direct and intuitive, derivation of equation (6) is as follows. At

optimum, the representative individual must be indifferent between holding an additional

unit of liquidity in any of the two available instruments: money or land. One additional

unit of liquidity in the form of land calls for setting d(θpk) = 1, which implies that d(pk) =

1/θ and dk = 1/θp, where d denotes the differentiation operator. Therefore, the cost of the

additional unit of land is rd(pk) - ρdk = r/θ - ρ/θp; the first term in each of the last two

expressions is the opportunity cost of holding land, rd(pk), while the second, ρdk, is its

return. On the other hand, the cost of holding an additional unit of money is just r, given

that the equilibrium inflation rate is zero. Equation (6) follows from equating the

marginal costs of land and money, and recalling that at steady state r = δ = ρ.

            Hence, if land offers no liquidity services, θ = 0, the equilibrium price of land

would be p = 1. On the other hand, if θ > 0, the price of land p > 1 and rises with θ. This

result is intuitive because liquidity services add value to land holdings. In a dynamic

setting in which θ rises over time (expectedly or not), one can show that land prices will

be increasing over time.

            Consequently, this model can explain higher land’s relative price as a result of

financial engineering that makes land or derivatives associated with land (e.g., CDOs)

more liquid. However, like in the standard banking model without a LOLR, there could

exist a “bad” equilibrium in which, for example, θ collapses to 0. Thus, the present



12                                                                                              θ

model has all the basic ingredients to produce price bubbles geared to the expansion and

collapse of the financial sector (this is fully in line with the empirical findings in Taylor

(2009)). Notice that by increasing money supply (or QE, quantitative easing) the

monetary authority could help to prevent price deflation. However, that policy will have

no effect on the price of land relative to consumption. Thus, preventing price deflation

may not save the economy from financial turmoil associated with the collapse of some

key relative price.13

         A once-and-for-all increase in government consumption financed by lump-sum

taxes has, by equation (6), no impact on the relative price of land p. This holds even if

taxes are raised to buy land. Thus, in this context a fiscal stimulus package would be

neutral.14

Remark 2. Short-run impact on output from a fall in θ could easily be generated by inserting

liquidity as a factor of production, following Fischer (1974), for example. In this fashion, the

model would display output collapse as θ falls after a bank run, for example.

                                III. Extensions of the Basic Model

         The basic model can be extended in several interesting directions, as illustrated by

the following examples.

     1. Interest Rate Policy. Monetary policy in advanced economies is not conducted by

         directly controlling monetary aggregates but, instead, by manipulating a key

         (usually short term) interest rate. Consider the type of model developed in Calvo

         and Vegh (1995) in which the central bank interest rate would be equivalent to

13
   Under strict representative-individual conditions, a sudden change in relative prices does not cause
financial trouble, because net borrowing is always zero. However, extensions to heterogeneous consumers
with positive net lending are straightforward.
14
   Of course, distortionary taxes will have an effect on p, but that is not the main thrust behind a stimulus
package.


                                                                                                            9
         paying interest on money.15 Let the latter be denoted by im. The stock of money

         is assumed, once again, constant over time.16 In contrast to much of the modern

         theory of monetary policy (see Woodford (2003)), I will assume that prices are

         perfectly flexible. This assumption is not prompted by realism, but by trying to

         focus as sharply as possible on the model’s new ingredient, namely, liquidity of

         productive assets.

                  Thus, first-order condition (5b) would now read

                               v′(mt + θpt kt ) = λ(πt + rt − im ) Dt                                   (5b’)

         Hence, by equations (5b’) and (5c), expression (6) becomes (noticing that at an

         interior equilibrium im < ρ + π)

                                                          ⎛ 1⎞
                                       θ(ρ + π − im ) = ρ⎜⎜1 − ⎟⎟.                                        (6’)
                                                          ⎝   p⎠

                  Therefore, for a given π, a fall in im brings about an increase in the relative

         price of land p. The intuition is that a fall in the return on money im shifts demand

         for liquidity in favor of land, raising its price. This result can be used to

         rationalize the common statement that easy monetary policy in the U.S. could be

         blamed for contributing to the real-estate bubble; or to show that monetary easing

         could offset a meltdown in real estate prices if θ > 0.

15
   This can be derived in a model in which m is a composite of non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing
liquid assets, the latter being, for instance, short-term treasury bills, see Calvo and Vegh (1995). The Calvo-
Vegh approach is an alternative to the more popular approach discussed at length in Woodford (2003), for
instance, in which the monetary authority is typically assumed to control a “pure” short-run interest rate.
The advantage of the Calvo-Vegh approach is that it does not imply arbitrage conditions (between, say,
short- and long-run, or domestic and foreign interest rates) which are strongly rejected by empirical
evidence (unless one is prepared to make assumptions on random errors that have no clear economic basis).
For a recent application of this approach, see Canzoneri at al (2008).
16
   In terms of the model outlined in footnote 15, this assumption would be consistent with a situation in
which the aggregate stock of the two types of monies is constant, but its composition is determined by the
private sector taking into account the return on the interest-bearing component. This is consistent with
standard procedures followed when interest rates are used as instruments for monetary policy.


                                                                                                           10
                  Another policy that may succeed at lifting the relative price of land would

         be a helicopter-type monetary expansion at, say, a constant rate μ > 0 in order to

         generate inflation – a policy advocated by Krugman for Japan in the 1990s (see

         Krugman (2009)). One can show that this implies that, once again, the unique

         converging equilibrium for the model is the steady state, and that the associated

         rate of inflation equals μ. Moreover, equation (6’) becomes, setting im = 0,

                                                      ⎛   1⎞
                                         (ρ + μ)θ = ρ⎜⎜1 − ⎟⎟.                                           (6”)
                                                      ⎝   p⎠

         Hence, an increase in μ yields a higher p, validating Krugman’s conjecture.

         However, this policy as well as the interest rate policy examined above would fail

         in the extreme case in which land becomes totally illiquid, i.e., θ = 0.17

                  On a separate note, notice that at steady state the rate of return on pure

         bonds is invariant to im. This straightforward result is interesting because it shows

         that the Calvo-Vegh approach is capable of rationalizing the famous “Greenspan’s

         conundrum,” i.e., a situation in which a rise in the policy interest rate has no

         impact on some of the other interest rates in the system.

     2. Capital Accumulation. Suppose that variable k stands for physical capital, and

         that the latter can be accumulated without adjustment costs (being, thus, of the

         “putty-putty” variety). To ensure existence of a robust case of interior solutions, I

         will assume that the production function satisfies y = f (k), where f is a standard

         strictly concave neoclassical production function. Focusing on interior solutions,


17
  It is worth noting that if θ = 0, the model boils down to the standard model in which k yields no liquidity
services. Therefore, the effects on the price of land stemming from central bank interest rates or inflation
highlighted in the text would not hold in the standard model, showing that the results highlighted in this
note are intimately linked to financial/liquidity considerations.


                                                                                                           11
         one can prove that starting at steady state, a once-and-for-all increase in the

         liquidity of capital, θ, will induce capital accumulation and higher steady-state

         welfare. Characterizing steady states is straightforward because first-order

         conditions (5) hold intact if one interprets ρ as the capital rental (no longer a

         parameter but an endogenous variable); thus, at a competitive no-distortions

         equilibrium f’(k) = ρ and p ≡ 1 (because capital is putty-putty and, by assumption,

         the equilibrium solution is interior). Moreover, at steady state, we have that the

         rate of interest on pure bonds r = δ, the subjective rate of discount. Hence,

         equation (6) becomes

                                                 f ′(k ) = δ(1 − θ),                                    (6’’’)

         which, again, makes sense only for θ < 1. Clearly, for positive θ, f ′(k ) < δ; and

         the higher is θ, the higher will be steady-state capital k. This trivially shows that,

         despite its risks, financial liberalization may have some redeeming value.18

     3. Welfare Effects of θ. In contrast, welfare, as measured by expression (1), may

         decline. To show this important implication in a simple manner, I will now turn

         to an open-economy version of the model in which the economy is open to

         frictionless trade and capital mobility. In addition, I will assume that the

         exchange rate is constant over time. To make things more interesting, I will

         assume that the policy interest rate is equivalent to paying interest on money (as

         in subsection 1); once again, I will denote it by im. Seigniorage, net of interest on

         money, is lump-sum rebated to the public, and the international price level is

18
  The role of banks in the creation of liquidity and in facilitating more productive investment projects is
well understood in the literature, e.g., Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Allen and Gale (2007). The value
added of the present model is to discuss the output effect in a standard neoclassical framework and, as I
will next show, establish its welfare implications.


                                                                                                              12
constant over time – implying that π = 0. Moreover, I will make the standard

simplifying assumption in open macro models that the subjective rate of discount

equals the international interest rate. This is equivalent to setting δ = r.

       Under these assumptions, it follows that first-order conditions (5) become

(recalling that at equilibrium p = 1)

                             u ′(ct ) = λ                                (a)


                             v′(mt + θk t ) = λ(δ − im )                 (b)       (7)


                             v′(mt + θk t )θ = λ[δ − f ′(kt )].          (c)

It follows that c, m and k are constant over time and (6’’’) becomes

                             f ' (k ) = δ(1 − θ) + im θ.                       (6’’’’)

       Moreover, since seigniorage is fully rebated, the budget constraint for the

economy as a whole becomes (assuming, without loss of generality, that initial

total financial wealth is zero)

                             ∞

                             ∫ [ f (k ) − δk
                             0
                                    t          t   − ct ]e −δt dt = 0.             (8)


Thus, since k and c are constant over time, we have

                            c = f(k) – δk                                          (9)

We are now ready to examine the welfare implications of a once-and-for-all

increase in the liquidity parameter θ. By equation (6’’’’), an increase in θ brings

about an instantaneous increase in the capital stock k if the economy starts below

Friedman’s optimal quantity of money (i.e., if δ > im), the case on which I will

focus the following discussion. By (6’’’’) and (9),




                                                                                   13
         ∂c / ∂k = [ f ′(k ) − δ] = (im − δ)θ < 0, if θ > 0. In words, if capital is endowed with

         some degree of liquidity, equilibrium consumption falls as capital rises.

         Therefore, an increase in θ results in a fall in consumption c. Moreover, by (7a)

         and (7b), v′ = (δ − im )u ′(c). Hence, by concavity of functions v and u, the fall in c

         raises u ′(c), which by the equality expression in the previous sentence implies that

         at equilibrium v′ rises and, hence, v falls. Consequently, both utility indexes u

         and v decline, which, recalling utility function (1), implies that welfare must go

         down.

                  Half of the intuition for this result is that as capital becomes more liquid, a

         larger amount of capital is accumulated to serve as a means of payments. If the

         economy starts from a situation in which the rate of interest on pure bonds

         exceeds the marginal productivity capital, capital accumulation will result in

         lower sustainable consumption. The other half of the intuition is that, by

         assumption, consumption and liquidity are normal goods, and the opportunity cost

         of liquidity holding in terms of consumption, r = δ, does not change as θ rises.

         Therefore, the demand for liquidity falls in tandem with consumption, pushing

         down welfare as measured by expression (1).19 Notice that since k rises with θ

         and the demand for liquidity, m + θk, falls, it follows that the demand for money,

         m, falls by more than the increase in θk. In words, the development of more

         sophisticated financial liquidity-enhancing instruments crowds out old-fashioned

         money (thus, actually, destroying liquidity). It is interesting to note that an

         increase in the liquidity-enhancing parameter θ is welfare-reducing even though,

19
 The second part of the intuitive argument is essential for the result. To prove it, notice that in a non-
monetary economy in which m = 0, an increase in θ always gives rise to higher, not lower, welfare.


                                                                                                             14
   by assumption, the system fails to achieve the optimum quantity of money, i.e., v’

   > 0 holds – and, hence, more liquidity should be welcome. The explanation is

   that in an undistorted environment, welfare could increase by lowering the rate of

   inflation because its marginal cost is zero. The same cannot be said about an

   increase in θ because it induces an increase in k, which marginal cost is δ > 0,

   larger than its marginal productivity, f’(k). Incidentally, does it follow that a

   collapse of θ would be welfare enhancing? The model implies that, if the

   economy starts from a situation in which f’(k) < δ, there is a case for orderly

   lowering the size and compass of the financial sector. However, it would be a

   mistake to infer that a fall in θ associated with financial meltdown is welfare

   enhancing, because the model is too simple and ignores the serious collateral

   damage associated with those types of crises.

          In this example, if θ = 0, the economy will reach a first best in which the

   marginal productivity of capital equals the rate of interest, f ′(k ) = r = δ. This

   situation will not hold under distorting output taxes, poor contract enforcement,

   etc, that could make f ′(k ) > r . Under those circumstances, an increase in θ could

   be welfare improving since it could help to offset the market distortion.

4. Endogenizing θ. Liquidity-enhancing parameter θ is a result of individual

   decisions which are affected by social convention and interaction. The

   effectiveness of new financial instruments in liquidity creation depends on their

   acceptability as a means of payments. The latter cannot easily be ensured by

   individual agents, especially if they are atomistic.




                                                                                         15
        Although a satisfactory model in which θ is endogenously determined

exceeds the limits of the present note, one can make some progress by considering

the case in which, somewhat unrealistically, individual agents can endow their

own land or capital with liquidity properties summarized in parameter θ (ignoring

a possible systemic collapse in θ). Think of θ as a brand name that can be

attached to land or capital and that makes them more readily accepted as a means

of payments. In an open, emerging market economy, for example, the brand

name could be provided by some prestigious international financial institution (a

fading breed these days!).

        Consider the open-economy model in the previous subsection. I will

assume that θ carries a consumption cost per unit of pk (i.e., the market value of

land or capital in terms of consumption) which is given by function φ(θ), where

φ(0) = φ’(0) = 0, and φ’’ (θ) > 0. One can show that, in an interior solution, θ is

determined by the following condition

                         ϕ′(θ) = v′(m + θk ) = δ − im .                              (8)

Thus, θ rises as im falls. As shown in previous subsection, the rise in θ lowers

welfare even if φ(θ)k is offset by, say, foreign donors’ transfers (and a fortiori if it

isn’t) . This illustrates the possibility – often heard in the debate about the origin

of the Subprime crisis – that low interest rates after 2001 induced the

development of new financial instruments, like CDOs. In an undistorted situation

the development of those financial instruments lowers welfare, even in a scenario




                                                                                     16
         in which there no financial meltdown.20 The unrealistic case studied here makes

         this result especially interesting, because it does not involve financial market

         externalities. Parameter θ does not come from heaven (or hell). It is determined

         by utility-maximizing individuals. The reason why despite their thorough

         knowledge of the situation these individuals choose a level of θ larger than the

         social optimum (θ = 0) is that they do not internalize the lump-sum subsidies they

         will loose as the demand for m falls. This is a familiar externality in monetary

         models, which makes an interesting come-back in the present context.21 Notice,

         once again, that the suboptimality of the financial sector holds even though the

         analysis has completely ignored the costs of financial meltdowns.

                                           IV. Final Words

         The simple framework discussed in this note can help to explain some central

stylized facts in recent financial crises, including the Subprime and several emerging

market crises. The following points illustrate some central implications of the model.

     1. The development of new liquid financial instruments linked to the real estate

         sector may raise relative real estate prices. This helps to explain the recent

         housing boom in advanced economies, and in emerging markets after the creation

         of the market for Brady bonds and the subsequent development of the Emerging


20
   For the sake of completeness, notice that Friedman’s optimal quantity of money is achieved if im = δ or,
more generally, im – π = 0. In such a case, θ = 0 which, in an undistorted environment, corresponds to the
first-best solution.
21
   The model is a close relative of the one discussed in Ayagari, Braun and Eckstein (1998). In their model,
the financial sector endogenously creates a class of goods that requires credit, as opposed to cash in
advance. Their model shows, among other things, that higher inflation generates a socially-suboptimal
larger range of credit goods. In the present model, inflation is also welfare-reducing in an undistorted
environment because it induces capital over-accumulation. I conjecture that introducing im in the Ayagari
et al model, one should also be able to show that if im falls, the range of credit goods expands, lowering
welfare – which would be fully in line with the results presented here. I am thankful to Zvi Eckstein for
alerting me about the existence of that paper.


                                                                                                         17
   Markets bond market (see Calvo (2007)). It also helps to explain a collapse in

   housing prices as financial engineering turns sour, and gives rise to a “bank run.”

   Under this interpretation, the collapse in housing prices is not necessarily due to

   the uncovering of faulty or corrupt trades but to the absence of a LOLR that

   would otherwise help to coordinate the “good” no-bank-run equilibrium.

2. High interest rates can be effective in putting a damper on assets’ relative prices,

   even though all prices (and wages) are perfectly flexible.

3. Preventing deflation may be useful to stave off Irving Fisher’s Debt Deflation.

   However, it may not be a solution to the liquidity/credit problem generated by the

   meltdown of real estate relative prices, especially if the policy interest rate hits the

   zero bound, but not exclusively under those conditions. For example, interest rate

   policy may become ineffective if real assets become illiquid, as it may turn out to

   be the case under severe financial crisis.

4. Once-and-for-all issuance of helicopter money or Quantitative Easing in the

   present jargon, without changing the policy interest rate, may prevent price

   deflation but it is ineffective in changing the relative price of land. However, the

   relative price of land could be raised if helicopter money generates inflation,

   provided land is not totally bereft of liquidity.

5. Assets’ liquidity enhancement can lead to higher output. Moreover, if initial

   conditions in the capital market are not first-best, liquidity enhancements could

   generate Pareto improvement. However, excessive liquidity enhancement that

   results in lower social welfare cannot be ruled out, even if financial meltdown can

   be kept in check.




                                                                                        18
6. An extension that may be worth pursuing is to endogenize financial crises in

   which liquidity-enhancing parameter θ suffers a sudden collapse, as in the

   Diamond-Dybvig world of multiple financial equilibria. This could be done, for

   example, by marrying the present model with the approach discussed in Morris

   and Shin (1998) to pin down a unique equilibrium solution.
