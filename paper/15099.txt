                                             ABSTRACT

This paper considers the extent to which crime in the 19th century was conditioned on body weight.
With data on inmates incarcerated in the Tennessee and Illinois state penitentiaries between 1831 and
1892, we estimate the parameters of Wiebull proportional hazard specifications of the individual crime
hazard. Our results reveal that consistent with a theory in which body weight can be a source of labor
market disadvantage, crime in the 19th century does appear to have been conditioned on body weight.
However, in contrast to the 20th century, in which labor market disadvantage increases with respect
to body weight, in the 19th century labor market disadvantage decreased with respect to body weight,
causing individual crime hazards to decrease with respect to body weight. We find that such a relationship
is consistent with a 19th century complementarity between body weight and typical jobs that required
adequate nutrition and caloric intake to support normal work effort and performance.

1. Introduction

        Although early attempts by criminologists to link criminal propensities with

physical attributes have been discredited, modern economic studies have linked such

propensities with weight and attractiveness (Price 2009; Mocan and Tekin 2006). What

separates the modern economic approach from earlier approaches is that economists do

not offer deterministic explanations in that certain features are associated with inherent

criminal tendencies. Rather, economists posit a connection between individual physical

attributes, labor market opportunities, and the expected rewards of criminal activity.

        This paper employs previously unexploited data from two nineteenth century

penitentiaries to investigate the association between body weight and the age at which an

individual enters into criminal activity. We follow the approach laid out in Price (2009)

who argues that being overweight is consistent with an increased probability of entering

into criminal activity due, in part, to having fewer and less remunerative legitimate job

market opportunities. Unlike the twentieth-century experience in which obesity is

associated with greater probability of criminal activity, we find that relatively heavy

individuals in the nineteenth century had lower probabilities of criminal activity at every

age. We offer two explanations for this phenomenon. First, most weight-for-height

measures, such as the body mass index (BMI) 1, cannot distinguish between those who

are overweight due to excess body fat and those who are overweight due to high

proportions of lean muscle mass (Burkhauser et al 2009). An uninformed application of

the body mass index to professional athletes, for example, would incorrectly conclude

that the (admittedly selected) sample is unhealthily overweight. In the nineteenth century


1
 BMI is measured as the ratio of an inmate’s weight (in kilograms) to height in meters squared or BMI =
kilograms/meters2


                                                  2
a high BMI value may have been associated more with lean muscle mass than body fat

and, therefore, with greater productivity in physically demanding jobs. High BMI people

had more attractive labor market prospects and were less likely to turn to crime. Second,

even if body mass index values from the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are

measuring the same thing, namely excess body fat, the relatively high and rising real cost

of food in the mid-nineteenth century implies that individuals with relatively high BMI

values were probably economically better off than those with lower BMI values and

found entry into crime less attractive.



2. The Economics of Human Physiology and Crime

       For nearly two centuries, social scientists have attempted to link crime and human

physiology, an approach sometimes labeled biological positivism (Gottfredson and

Hirschi 1990). Nineteenth century physiognomy and phrenology, which linked criminal

propensities with either facial features or bumps on the skull, as well as Cesare

Lombroso’s early twentieth century atavism, or degenerative evolution, are now

scientifically discredited (Vold and Bernard 1986; Curran and Renzetti 1994). But

Lombroso’s approach inspired Charles Goring’s (1913) research in which he uncovered a

correlation between a combination of short stature and low body weight and criminality.

Although he rejected Lomroso’s notion that there was a discernible physical criminal

type, Goring’s conclusions, too, are now largely discredited because he hypothesized that

small physical size indicated an unobserved underlying genetic inferiority that led to

criminality.




                                             3
        In the subsequent three decades Ernst Kretschmer (1925) and William Sheldon

and associates (see particularly Sheldon, Hartl and McDermott 1949) offered theories

based on broadly defined body types rather than specific measurements. Although the

Kretschmer and Sheldon approaches differed in some respects, each divided individuals

into three broad body types: athletic (mesomorphs), thin (ectomorphs) and fat

(endomorphs). Both men contended that individuals with more athletic builds were more

likely to engage in criminal activity, though neither developed a compelling explanation

for the association.

        No biological positivist approach has withstood sometimes withering criticism

largely because, although grouped together as biological positivism, each offered a

variant of biological determinism. Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) and other modern

criminologists reject the positivist approach, first, because there is no solid modern

evidence linking crime with genetic predispositions and, second, because none of these

approaches offered a theory of criminality that generated clearly articulated testable

hypotheses. Without a theory, “positivism is reduced to endless examination of lists of

possible physiological, anatomical, and constitutional variables that may or may not be

correlated with behavior” (Gottfredson and Hirchi 1990, p.53). In modern statistical

parlance, the failure to produce a guiding theory meant that researchers often confounded

left-hand and right-hand side variables in a potential regression equation. And later

studies that offered formal statistical tests provide “minimal” or “near zero” evidence that

inherited or genetic factors (such a height or weight or body type) correlate with criminal

activity (p.60).




                                             4
       That modern criminological theory rejects biological determinism does not mean

that biology, particularly human physiology, has no bearing on criminal activity.

Economists have recognized that heritable physical features, such as attractiveness,

translate into differential labor market opportunities (Hammermesh and Biddle 1984).

Once differential job prospects are linked with criminal propensities, as in Becker (1968),

economics offers a theoretical link between human physiology and criminal activity. The

economic approach (discussed in more detail below) posits the rational criminal who,

when faced with an opportunity to engage in either legitimate or criminal behavior, will

opt into criminality when the payoff to legitimate labor market activity is lower than the

payoff to crime.

       Mocan and Tekin (2006) offer the quintessential test of the link between

attractiveness and criminality and find that people considered unattractive by

disinterested observers commit more crime than average looking people. Moreover,

attractive people commit less crime than average looking people. They argue that this

association exists because attractiveness is rewarded in the legitimate labor market so that

attractive people earn a wage premium. Criminal activity is less appealing because the

opportunity cost of criminal activity is higher for attractive than for unattractive

individuals.

       There is also abundant empirical evidence that individuals outside the normal

height and/or weight-for-height standards (often measured by the body mass index,

hereafter BMI) suffer several premarket and market penalties. Persico, Postlewaite and

Silverman (2005) and Case and Paxon (2008) uncover educational and wage penalties for




                                              5
shorter individuals. Not only are tall people believed to be more attractive than short

people, they are believed to be more productive and thereby receive a wage premium.

Although Mocan and Tekin (2006) argue that being overweight and being unattractive

are not coincident, health and labor economists have uncovered a link between obesity

and lower wages, as well as obesity and success in the marriage market, particularly for

women (Averett and Koreman 1996; Cawley 2004; Cawley and Danziger 2005; Morris

2006; Han, Norton and Stearns 2009). Further, Averett and Korenman (1996) and

Cawley (2004) find some evidence of an inverted U-shaped distribution of male wages or

employment probabilities on weight. That is, underweight and obese men both pay a

wage penalty. Han et al (2009) posit, but do not prove, that the observed wage penalty for

underweight and overweight individuals follows from customer and employer distaste for

individuals with extreme BMI values. Their conjecture reflects American prejudices

against individuals with extreme BMI values, which appear to influence labor market

outcomes.

       If the economic theory of crime holds, people outside the normal BMI values,

may have greater crime propensities than people in the normal weight-for-height range

not because of any genetic predisposition among ectomorphs or endomorphs toward

crime, but because poorer labor and/or marriage market outcomes lower the opportunity

cost of crime. Two existing studies are broadly consistent with this prediction. Although

Maddan et al. (2008) suggest that BMI is a poor predictor of criminality among Arkansas

prisoners, BMI values are correlated with crime type. High BMI prisoners are less likely

than normal BMI prisoners to have been imprisoned for violent acts. In a related study

that used a sample of prisoners housed by the Mississippi Department of Corrections,




                                             6
Price (2009) finds a correlation between obesity and the age at which an individual

transitions into criminal activity. Heavy people have greater probabilities of entering into

criminal activity than people of normal weight. Thus, there is evidence connecting body

type or BMI with criminality, an association readily explained by modern economic

theory. This paper offers an historical investigation of the connection between the

transition into crime and individual BMI values.



3. Theory and Methodology

   We follow the approach of Kiefer (1988), Gyimah-Brempong and Price (2006), and

Price (2009), and adopt a continuous-time approach to criminal activity. It is assumed

that over their life-cycle, individuals are presented with opportunities for criminal

activity, and engage in it if it is in their best interest. Individual transitions into crime are

viewed as a hazard that consists of the product of two probabilities or h(t) = ηπ where η is

the probability that an individual faces an opportunity for criminal activity, and π is the

probability that the opportunity for crime is acceptable.

        To the extent that body weight is associated with wage penalties (Cawley, 2004;

Morris, 2006) and/or constrains employment outcomes (Cawley and Danziger, 2004;

Han, Norton, and Stearns 2009), the acceptability of criminal activity for individuals

could be a function of their body weight. Suppose the probability that criminal activity is

                                 ∞
acceptable is given by π =   ∫   y*(φ )
                                          f ( y )dy , where f(y) is the probability of earning y from


criminal activity, ϕ is a monotonic measure of an individual’s weight, and y*( φ ) is an

individual’s reservation earnings from criminal activity defined as the minimum level of

earnings from crime at which he or she would engage in criminal activity.


                                                       7
         If body weight conditions labor market opportunities, then ∂y *(φ ) / ∂φ ≠ 0. In

general, the effect of body weight on the individual transition into crime is ∂π / ∂φ =

∂π / ∂y *(φ ) × ∂y *(φ ) / ∂φ . If body weight does not matter for labor market opportunities,

then as ∂y *(φ ) / ∂φ = 0, ∂π / ∂φ = 0, or body weight does not condition individual

transitions into criminal activity. Otherwise, if body weight is associated with labor

market disadvantages, then either ∂y *(φ ) / ∂φ > 0, and the individual crime hazard

increases with respect to body weight, or ∂y *(φ ) / ∂φ < 0, and the individual crime

hazard decreases with respect to body weight.

         Our econometric approach to examining the effect of body weight on individual

transitions into crime assumes that individual crime hazards in the 19th century were

similar to those in the 20th century in that individual crime hazards are a monotone,

perhaps decreasing function of time (Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990). We adopt a Weibull

proportional hazard regression specification of the form h(t) = h(o)exp(∑iβkXk), where

h(o) = pt p – 1exp(βo), p is a shape parameter, t is time, and exp(βo) is the scale parameter.2

For a given explanatory variable Xk , its effect on the individual transition into crime is

given by βk. Given that we observe an individual making a transition into criminal

activity at time t, our econometric specification of individual crime hazards allows us to

2
  Let T be a non-negative random variable measuring the time to an event, the survivor function—the
reverse cumulative distribution function of T―is S(t) = 1 – F(T) – Pr(T > t), where F(T) = Pr(T ≤ t). If
survival probabilities have a Weibull distribution, then S(t) = exp(-λtp),where λ is a scale parameter, and p
is a shape parameter. If we let λ = exp(βo), The unconditional hazard function is:

           h(t) = [∂S(t)/∂t)]/S(t) =[ exp(βo) ptp-1exp(-exp(βot p)]/exp(-λtp) = exp(βo)ptp-1

conditioning h(t) on a vector explanatory variables ∑iβkXk          results in a Wiebull proportional hazards
regression model (Cleves, Gould, and Gutierrez, 2004):

       h(t| X) = [∂S(t)/∂t)]/S(t) =[ exp(βo) ptp-1exp(-exp(βot p)]/exp(-λtp) = exp(βo +∑iβkXk )ptp-1

where X is a vector of explanatory variables.

determine the impact that body weight has on the probability of making a transition into

criminal activity.



4. Data

        To study the historical association between individual BMI values and the

transition into crime, we make use of records generated at the Tennessee state

penitentiary between 1831 and 1870 and the Illinois state penitentiary at Joliet between

1847 and 1892 (Sherrill and Sherrill 1997; Illinois Genealogy Trails 2006). Existing

studies have used nineteenth-century prison records in studying racial or ethnic

discrimination in sentencing and systematic racial or ethnic differences in prisoner BMI

and well-being, but to our knowledge no previous study has used these records to

understand factors influencing the transition into criminal activity (Bodenhorn 2009;

Carson 2007; Carson 2009).

        When a convicted felon was delivered to the penitentiary to serve his or her

sentence, clerks recorded general and personal information in ledgers or registers. In the

Tennessee records, for example, the clerk assigned each prisoner a number, recorded his

or her name, the date he or she arrived, his or her crime (which ranged from petit larceny

to first-degree murder), the court-assigned sentence the prisoner was expected to serve,

and the county of conviction.3 In addition, the clerks recorded the prisoner’s age at

intake, his or her pre-conviction occupation, nativity (US or foreign), race, marital status,

as well as his or her height and weight. The Illinois records included all of this

information and, in addition, recorded whether the prisoner was literate and whether he or

3
  Each prisoner’s sex was inferred from given names: prisoners with names like James, William or Robert
were considered to be men; those with names like Sarah, Ann or Mary were considered to be women. Only
a handful of ambiguous or barely legible cases (Francis versus Frances) were excluded.


                                                   9
she was intemperate. Clerks did not report weights for every prisoner, but the Tennessee

and Illinois records generate 1019 useable observations.

        Table 1 reports the definition, mean and standard deviation of the covariates

utilized to estimate the effects of body weight on individual crime hazards in the 19th

century. Our measure of body weight is an inmate’s Body Mass Index (BMI). We also

consider the effects of being in distinct weight classes based on the BMI: Underweight

(BMI<20), Normal Weight (20≥BMI>25), Overweight (25≥BMI>30), Obese (BMI≥30),

and Heavy (BMI≥25), which combines the usual Overweight and Obese categories. As

control variables we include binary measures of an inmate’s sex, race and ethnicity.

Our dependent variable is an age-specific hazard, and it measures the age at which the

inmate entered prison at his or her most recent conviction. We do not know whether a

particular inmate is serving time for his first conviction, or if he has committed crimes

previously that either went undetected by law enforcement or were punished by a

sentence served at a county jail. Our age at incarceration measures the age at which an

individual entered the state penitentiary for a crime, but this may or may be the age at

which he or she initially entered into criminal activity. Thus, our parameter estimates

capture the effects of the explanatory variables on the individual transition into prison

and not necessarily that individual’s initial entry into criminal activity. That we cannot

account for recidivism should not introduce a notable bias because, in his study of

offending and sentencing in nineteenth-century Pennsylvania, Bodenhorn (2009) finds

relatively few recidivists, though there were high recidivism rates among the few

recidivists.




                                             10
5. Results

         Table 2 reports simple Wiebull proportional hazard parameter estimates—as

hazard ratios―for the effects of 6 different measures of body weight on the individual

transition into illegal activity. As diagnostic measures, Table 2 also reports a chi-square

test for the significance of the overall regression, and a Wald Test for a constant

(proportional) hazard.4 The regressions are significant, and the Wald Tests for a constant

hazard is rejected―suggesting that a Wiebull specification for individual crime hazards

is adequate. With the exception of Underweight and Obese, the estimated hazard ratios

are significant. Estimated hazard ratios on BMI, Overweight, and Heavy are less than

one, which implies that individuals who were “fat” along these dimensions were less

likely to transition into criminal activity.5 In contrast, the hazard rate associated with

Normal weight is greater than one and statistically significant, which implies that not

being thin or heavy accelerated the age at which an individual made a transition into

criminal activity. The last column reports estimate with three of our overlapping binary

measures of obesity with normal weigh being the excluded body weight measures. The

pattern of significance is generally consistent with the other estimates―being fat relative

to a normal weight reduces the likelihood of an individual making a transition into

criminal activity.

         The parameter estimates in Table 2 identify a causal effect of body weight on

individual crime hazards if there are no unobservables or individual heterogeneity that

matter for our crime specification. Even if we interpret the hazard ratios as a partial or

4
  In particular the Wald Test is for the hypothesis Ho: ln(p) = 0, which is equivalent to Ho: p = 1. Because a
Weibull distribution assumes that individual hazards are monotonically increasing or decreasing over time,
a rejection of the null hypothesis is an indication that a Weibull distribution is adequate for explaining the
individual transitions into crime.
5
  We use the term “fat” reluctantly for reasons offered below.


                                                     11
marginal effect, all else equal, our estimates may not provide a true causal effect for two

reasons. First, if there are important unobservable variables correlated with body weight

that also condition entry into criminal activity, the simple Weibull parameter estimates

may be biased upwards. Second, our sample consists of criminals who were arrested,

tried, convicted and sentenced to the state penitentiary and, as such, might represent a

selected, non-random sample. Because we do not observe criminals who did not reach the

end of the criminal justice procedure, the parameter estimates reported in Table 2 might

be subject to sample selection bias.

        We control for possible biases in the parameter estimates in Table 2 by estimating

the Weibull hazard specification with unobserved frailty―defined as an unobservable

and random risk factor measuring unobservable individual predisposition toward crime

that modifies the crime hazard function of individuals.6 Viewed as a random effect,

introducing individual frailty into a Weibull proportional hazard specification identifies

causal effects because it is assumed that the individual frailties are uncorrelated with the

explanatory variables. If individual frailty also accounts for the unobserved and

unmeasured covariates that are potentially important determinants of success in criminal

activity, parameter estimates of a Weibull individual crime hazard specification with

individual frailty will also mitigate any sample selection bias.



6
 For an overview of proportional hazard models with unobserved frailty , see Cleves, Gould and
Guitierrez (2004, Chapter 9), and Wienke (2003). For specific applications of proportional hazard models
with unobserved frailty see Price (2008) and Price, Darity, and Headen (2008) In general, a Weibull
proportional hazard specification with individual frailty is:

                           h(t| X) = αi h(t| X) = αi exp(βo +∑iβkXk )ptp-1

where αi is the frailty individual i―some unobserved individual specific effect—assumed to have a mean
of unity, and a variance of θ > 0.



                                                   12
         Table 3 reports Wiebull proportional hazard parameter estimates with individual

frailty—again as hazard ratios―for our six measures of body weight on the individual

transition into criminal activity. The distribution of the frailty is assumed to be inverse

Gaussian.7 Table 3 also includes a diagnostic chi-square distributed test for a zero frailty

variance―which is rejected.8 The overall regressions, corrected for frailty, are

significant, and the Wald Tests for a constant hazard are rejected, which again suggests

that a Wiebull specification for individual crime hazards is appropriate.

         Even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity―omitted variables that may

matter for individual transitions into criminal activity, and may be correlated with getting

caught and incarcerated―the results are nearly the same as those reported in Table 2. The

individual crime hazard is decreasing in BMI, and lower for individuals classified as

Overweight and Heavy. The magnitude on Normal weight remains significant and greater

than unity, again suggesting that not being “fat” made an individual more likely to make

a transition into criminal activity. These results accord with findings dating back to

Kretschmer (1925) and Sheldon et al (1949) that those with athletic frames were more

likely to engage in criminal activity. It is also consistent with Maddan et al.’s (2008)

findings that mesomorphs are more likely to engage in violent, as opposed to nonviolent,

felonies. Finally, as was the case for the parameter estimates in Table 2 being fat relative

to a normal weight reduces the likelihood of an individual making a transition into

criminal activity.



7
  Estimating the parameters of a Wiebull proportional hazard model with individual frailty requires
imposing a mathematically tractable distribution function for the unobserved frailty. Two distributiona1
choices are available in STATA: 1) Gamma distribution and 2) Inverse Gaussian distribution. None of our
specifications achieved convergence when the Gamma distribution was selected.
8
  Given individual unobserved frailty with mean of unity and variance of θ, rejecting Ho: θ = 0, implies that
unobserved heterogeneity in the population conditions the crime hazard.


                                                    13
         Our parameter estimates are interpretable within a theoretical framework that

allows legitimate opportunities, such as employment in the labor market to be

conditioned on an individual’s body weight. As such, the parameter estimates in Tables 2

and 3 suggest that in the 19th century, successful employment outcomes were positively

related to an individual’s body weight. Such a finding runs counter to the one existing

estimate of the effects of weight on crime hazards in the 20th century. Price (2008) finds

that increases in individual body weight increase the likelihood of criminal activity. His

finding is consistent with fat or obese individuals facing labor market disadvantages with

respect to employment and/or wages, which lowers the return to legitimate labor market

activities relative to illegitimate criminal activities, and thereby increases individual

crime hazards. To the extent that being fat is a component of beauty that employers do

not value, our results also seemingly run counter to that of Mocan and Tekin (2006), who

find that criminals are physically less attractive than non-criminals. Our results are,

however, consistent with Madden et al (2008) who find that high BMI individuals

(endomorphs) are less likely to have participated in violent crime.

         We suspect that our parameter estimates measure a different labor market

consequence of weight, which we are reluctant to label “fatness” (at least for the

Overweight group) in the 19th century. We believe that in the 19th century, there was a

complementarity between body weight and jobs on average, given the physical exertion

or “brawn” required of many jobs, such as farming, construction, and common labor, in

an age before mass mechanization.9 Komlos (1984) estimated that US aggregate food


9
  There is evidence of a complementarity between body weight and job type. Both Everett (1990) and Puhl
and Brownell (2001) found that employers perceived the suitability of employees for jobs that required
face-to-face contact to be a function of their body weight, with obese individuals viewed as less suitable for
such jobs.


                                                     14
production in 1849 was consistent with a caloric intake of about 3,400 calories per adult

male day. This caloric intake represents more than enough fuel to support normal

(modern) work effort, but it was barely sufficient, at best, for the physical exertion

demanded of many 19th century occupations. We know, for example, that slaves on

southern plantations regularly consumed as much as 4000 to 5000 calories per day to

provide the fuel necessary to put in the work demanded of them (Fogel and Engerman

1974).10 Although free labor was probably not driven at the same grueling pace as

plantation slaves, Komlos’s (1984, p.912) study of West Point cadets found that most

were underweight. Their low weights indicate “that the claims on their caloric intake

must have been enormous.”

        What makes Komlos’s result all the more compelling is that West Point cadets

were, by and large, from relatively well-off families. Imagine the caloric intake necessary

to fuel a day working a team of horses, or felling trees or digging a canal, as well as the

lean muscle mass necessary to engage in this labor for many hours a day for months at a

time required of less well-off individuals. Regular employment in heavy, nonmechanized

labor was likely to result in 19th-century workers with much more lean muscle mass than

follows from most 20th-century employments. Because lean muscle mass is denser than

body fat, it is important to recognize that BMI values in excess of 25 may not be

measuring the same physical characteristics then as now (Bodenhorn 2009 makes a

similar argument). We might then think of “Overweight” individuals more akin to

modern athletes, whose regularly report BMI levels well in excess of the normal range of


10
  We are unaware of any data set containing both slave heights and weights (height data alone are
abundant), so we cannot calculate slave BMI. Extant photos of slaves, most of which were taken shortly
after emancipation, reveal thin, very muscular frames, which is consistent with elevated weight-for-height
or higher BMI values than would be considered normal today.


                                                    15
20 to 25 and yet who are in incredible physical condition. Saint Onge et al (2008), for

example, find historical BMI values of American Major League baseball players to have

been greater than the general population.

       We contend that our hazard model results are consistent with “relatively

underweight” (what might now be considered normal weight) people exhibiting a greater

propensity toward criminal activity than relatively normal individuals because their

relatively low weight made them appear unproductive to prospective employers. Many

19th century occupations required “brawn” and those workers who appeared well fed, and

sporting lots of lean muscle mass earned a wage premium, which allowed them to

continue to purchase the nutrients needed to sustain their productivity advantage.

       Not only did physical requirements of daily work effort alter people’s body types,

economic factors were at work as well. Komlos (1984) documented that per capita food

production actually declined in the 1840s and it did not recover its 1840 level again until

1880. The ratio of wages to food prices also peaked in the 1820s and it is possible that

declines in the prices of manufactured goods relative to food prices further encouraged

substitution out of food consumption and into other products. Both the rising real prices

of food and its increasing relative price would have encouraged diminished food

consumption. The result of which was declining adult stature and low weight-for-height

measures.

       In addition, Bodenhorn’s (2009) study of the BMI values of mid-nineteenth

century New York legislators reveals that these relatively economically privileged

individuals were heavy , with an average BMI values of approximately 24, compared to

the general US male population average of about 22.5 in the early twentieth century




                                            16
(Fogel 1994). Thus, unlike modern Americans for whom BMI values tend to be inversely

related to income or economic status, nineteenth-century Americans demonstrated a

positive relationship. It is not surprising then that individuals in the Overweight category

were less likely to enter into crime. They likely faced better labor market opportunities.

       The sorts of job-related nutrition and caloric demands in the nineteenth century

stand in stark contrast to modern times in which sedentary service jobs, which

presumably require little “brawn,” account for much modern employment. For example

Li, Wang, and Zhai (2003) show that in 1890 the service sector accounted for just over 10

percent of total U.S. employment, whereas in 1998 it was approximately 60 percent. The

historic contrast between the late 19th and 20th century in the employment share of the

service sector suggests that the physical brawn requirements of jobs over time were

different. Given different perceived or actual physical brawn requirements, and if

employers at least have a discriminatory preference for different body weights in

employees, a possible mismatch between individuals and jobs emerges—a mismatch that

can possibly create labor market disadvantages that impact upon individual crime

hazards.

       We can test this hypothesis because our data report for each inmate in the sample,

a broad job description of each inmate’s job held prior to conviction. We exploit this

information to examine how body weight conditioned the probability of being employed

in jobs that required in our view, physical brawn in the 19th century. Each inmate was

assigned one of the follow occupational classifications: Clerical, Craftsman, Farmer,

Laborer, Operative, Professional, Proprietor, Sales, Service, and No Occupation. We

created two categories of job-types: one that in our view required significant brawn in the




                                             17
19th century and one that did not. An inmate’s job category required significant brawn if

he reported his occupation as Craftsman, Farmer, Laborer, Operative, and No

Occupation. A binary value of one was assigned to an inmate if he was employed prior to

prison entry, in a job that required significant brawn.11

        Table 4 reports population-averaged Logit fixed effect parameters estimates on

the effects of body weight on our binary measure of an inmate being employed in a job

that required significant brawn prior to prison.12 Diagnostically, the regression is

significant overall for all specifications. Similar to the crime hazard parameter estimates

in Tables 2 and 3, for all but two measures of body weight—Underweight and Obese—

the estimated parameters are significant. The signs on BMI, Overweight, and Heavy are

positive, suggesting that being fat along these dimensions increased the probability of

being employed in a job that required brawn. In contrast, the sign on Normal Weight is

negative, suggesting that being relatively “less fat” along this dimension decreased the

probability of being employed in a job that required brawn.

        The pattern of sign and significance for the parameter estimates in Table 4

suggests that the mechanism by which being relatively “less fat” mattered for crime is

that in the 19th century, many jobs probably required brawn. This suggests that there was

a complementarity between a “fat” body weight and jobs. If BMI represents a measure of

   We implement a fixed effects estimator to control for observed heterogeneity and omitted variables that
could lead to biased parameter estimates. Our choice of a population-averaged Logit estimator was driven
by convergence considerations―we could not obtain it with a simple Logit fixed effect estimator. A
population-averaged Logit estimator implements the fixed effect by parameterizing it through panel-level
covariance, instead of subject-level covariance from the standard fixed effect estimator (Hardin and Hilbe,
2003). The fixed effect is based on inmate literacy groupings―a variable that indicates whether or not the
inmate is literate. This assumes that any unobserved heterogeneity associated with the type of job held
prior to prison entry is correlated with whether or not the inmate is literate—which is correlated with
individual general and specific human capital.

the ratio of nutrition to work effort, as Carson (2009) contends, low-BMI individuals

could be mismatched to a job that required high expenditures of physical energy. Thus, in

the 19th century, if an individual had a relatively low BMI, he likely faced disadvantages

in the labor market which increased the probability of transitioning into crime.



6. Conclusions

       We consider the extent to which crime in the 19th century was conditioned on

body weight. Parameter estimates from Wiebull proportional hazard specifications reveal

that consistent with a theory in which body weight can be a source of labor market

disadvantage, crime in the 19th century does appear to have been conditioned on body

weight. However, in contrast to the 20th century, in which labor market disadvantage

increases with respect to body weight, our results suggest that in the 19th century, labor

market disadvantage decreased with respect to body weight, causing individual crime

hazards to decrease with respect to body weight. In our view, this is consistent with a

19th century complementarity between body weight and typical jobs that required

adequate nutrition and caloric intake to support normal work effort and performance

       Our parameter estimates are identified if the assumption that all individual

heterogeneity is an unobserved frailty―a predisposition toward criminal activity—with a

known mean and variance. As our parameter estimates of the individual crime hazard

support this assumption, our results suggest that being relatively “less fat” in the 19th

century, had a causal effect on individual criminal behavior. Nonetheless, a causal

interpretation could be compromised by prisoners gaining weight in prison, causing our

body weight measures to be endogenous as a result of reverse causality. As our




                                             19
dependent variable is age at prison entry, if inmate weight was measured at the date of

prison entry, which we believe it was, then our inmate body weight measures, and

parameter estimates of their effect on individual crime hazards are not biased.
