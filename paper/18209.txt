                                               ABSTRACT

We study the effect of financial integration (through banks) on the transmission of international business
cycles. In a sample of 20 developed countries between 1978 and 2009 we find that, in periods without
financial crises, increases in bilateral banking linkages are associated with more divergent output cycles.This
relation is significantly weaker during financial turmoil periods, suggesting that financial crises induce
co-movement among more financially integrated countries. We also show that countries with stronger,
direct and indirect, financial ties to the U.S. experienced more synchronized cycles with the U.S. during
the recent 2007-2009 crisis. We then interpret these findings using a simple general equilibrium model
of international business cycles with banks and shocks to banking activity. The model suggests that
the relation between integration and synchronization depends on the type of shocks hitting the world
economy, and that shocks to global banks played an important role in triggering and spreading the
2007-2009 crisis.

1        Introduction

A central question in international macroeconomics is how financial integration affects the inter-
national transmission of country-specific shocks. This question is at the heart of the debate on
how the 2007-2009 global financial crisis spread and on the implications of cross-border financial
linkages for business cycles within the Euro area. Yet, both the empirical and theoretical literatures
give ambiguous, and sometimes conflicting, answers.

        Empirically the literatures on the correlates of business cycle synchronization and on how con-
tagion spreads evolved separately. On one hand, the business cycle synchronization literature fo-
cuses on long-term averages trying to identify the effect of financial integration, and other (mostly
bilateral) factors, on business cycle synchronization using cross-country (and cross-country-pair)
variation. This literature in general finds a positive relation between financial integration and syn-
chronization independently on whether the sample includes financial crisis episodes.1 Yet, recent
work by Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou and Peydro (2012) shows that in a sample of developed
countries before the pre-2007 crisis when financial crises were rare (or absent for most countries),
within country-pair increases in cross-border financial linkages are associated with less synchro-
nized output cycles.2 The contagion literature, on the other hand, limits its focus on crises periods,
primarily in emerging markets, studying how financial shocks spread via trade or financial links.
Overall this body of work provides compelling evidence that crises spread contagiously from the
origin mostly via financial linkages.3

        Theoretical models make opposing predictions on the effects of financial integration (through
banks) on the synchronization of economic activity, depending on whether real or financial shocks
are the dominant source of aggregate fluctuations. Suppose that, in a financially integrated world,
firms in certain countries are hit by a negative real (say, productivity) shock. Global banks would
decrease lending in the affected countries and increase lending in the non-affected countries, thereby
causing a further divergence of output growth.4 In contrast, if the negative shock is to the efficiency
of the banking sector in some countries, globally operating banks would be hit and they would pull
out funds from all countries, including the ones not hit by the shock. This transmits the financial

shock internationally, making international business cycles more synchronized.5

      Our paper aims to contribute to both the empirical and the theoretical debate on the relation
between financial integration on the synchronization.


      Empirical contribution        Our main empirical contribution is to show that the relation be-
tween business cycles correlation and financial/banking integration is different in “tranquil” (no
financial crisis) times and in times of financial turmoil (crises). For our analysis we use a unique bi-
lateral panel data-set of cross-border banking linkages from the Bank of International Settlements’
(BIS) and data on business cycles for 18/20 developed economies over the period 1978−2009; hence
our analysis covers several episodes of financial crises, including the 2007 − 2009 global financial
crisis. Importantly our data allows us to measure not only direct cross-border banking linkages
(e.g. the exposure of U.K.-based banks in the U.S.) but also indirect ones (U.K. banks holding
U.S. assets both directly but also through the Cayman Islands).

      Our first finding is that during “tranquil” times there is a significant negative association be-
tween banking linkages and the synchronization of output cycles within pairs of countries. This
result is in line with the recent evidence in Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou and Peydro (2012). Our
second, and most novel, finding is that the association between banking integration and business cy-
cle synchronization, conditional on being in a financial crisis, is much closer to zero, suggesting that
a financial crisis is an event that induces co-movement among more financially integrated countries.
This is true both for the recent global 2007 − 2009 financial crisis and also during previous crises,
such as the banking crisis in Finland and Sweden in the early 1990s and in Japan in the mid/late
1990s. Third, we find that during the recent financial crisis there has been a positive association
between output synchronization and exposure to the U.S. financial system. Importantly, however,
the positive correlation between output synchronization and financial linkages to the U.S. emerges
only when, on top of direct links to the U.S., we also consider indirect links via the Cayman Islands,
the main off-shore financial center of the U.S. economy.

      These empirical findings bridge the literatures on business cycle synchronization and on conta-
gion as they show that financial crises spread in a contagious way through banking linkages and
that this spread manifests in a higher business cycle synchronization for country pairs that are
more financially connected. Our findings are also in line with the conventional wisdom that the
during the 2007-2009 crisis a negative credit shock in the U.S. capital markets spread to the rest of

the world via financial -banking in particular- linkages. We find our results interesting especially
because the existing empirical evidence on whether the crisis spread via financial linkages from
the U.S. to the rest of the world is, so far, inconclusive. In particular Rose and Spiegel (2010,
2011) find no role for international financial linkages in transmitting the crisis both for developed
countries and for emerging markets.6 The lack of systemic evidence linking financial globalization
with output decline during the past years has even led some authors to argue that financial factors
might not be an important driver of this crisis (e.g. Chari, Christiano and Kehoe 2008; Mulligan
2009).

       A key challenge in identifying a correlation between financial integration and output synchronic-
ity during the 2007 − 2009 global crisis is to isolate the effect of bilateral financial linkages from a
(potential) large common to all advanced countries shock. For example Imbs (2010) shows that the
degree of international correlation in national business cycles since the end of 2008 is unprecedented
in past three decades, suggesting the presence of a common shock. Focusing on the asset backed
commercial paper market, Acharya and Schnabl (2010) show that all big international banks had
positions with similar risk profiles before the crisis, making the roll-over of their debt quite hard
when they started experiencing losses, and hence causing a large common financial shock. Since
common shocks and contagion are quite often observationally similar, it is quite hard to separate
out one from another in an empirical setting (see Reinhart and Rogoff 2009a).

       In our analysis we try to isolate the effect of financial linkages on business cycles from the role
common shocks using the richness of our data. First the panel structure allows us to condition
on common to all countries shocks. Second since our data goes back to the late 1970s we can
investigate the effect of financial integration on output synchronization during financial crises in
advanced economies that did not have massive global implications. Third, having a better measure
of financial integration (that includes both direct and indirect through small financial off-shore
centers linkages between countries) we can identify more precisely the role of financial integration
on business cycle synchronization.


       Theoretical contribution         On the theoretical side our contribution is to develop a stylized
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of international banking. The first objective of the
   6
     In contrast, Cetorelli and Goldberg (2011) find that lending supply in emerging markets was affected through a
contraction in cross-border lending by foreign banks. Employing global VARs, Helbling, Huidrom, Kose and Otrok
(2010) find that the U.S. credit market shocks have a significant impact on the evolution of global growth during the
latest episode. Chudik and Fratszcher (2011), again using a global VAR approach, find that while the tightening of
financial conditions was a key transmission channel for advanced economies, for emerging markets it was mainly the
real side of the economy that suffered due to the collapse of worldwide economic activity.

model is to illustrate a concrete mechanism through which exogenous changes in financial integra-
tion affect business cycle synchronization, and to study how this mechanism works under real and
financial shocks. We find that the model’s can reproduce the empirical relation between financial
integration affect business cycle synchronization quite well, suggesting that our empirical findings
are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the hypothesis that exogenous changes to fi-
nancial integration have significant effects on business cycle synchronization, both during tranquil
times (where more integration leads to less co-movement) and during crises periods (where more
integration leads to more co-movement). The second purpose of the model is to use our empirical
findings to identify the underlying sources of aggregate output fluctuations. Our theoretical model
implies that the sign and the magnitude of the estimated relation between financial integration
and output synchronization crucially depend on the nature of shocks hitting the economy; as a
consequence the estimated relation can be used to identify the shocks. In particular the evidence
on the change of the relation during the period 2007 − 2009 suggests that aggregate fluctuations
during that period were mostly driven by shocks to financial intermediation rather than firm’s pro-
ductivity shock. Our model is related to the theoretical contributions in a series of recent papers
that study co-movement and financial integration in the 2007-2009 crisis. In particular see, among
others, the recent works by Dedola and Lombardo (2010), Devereux and Yetman (2010), Devereux
and Sutherland (2011), Kollmann, Enders and Müller (2011) and Perri and Quadrini (2011). Its
main innovation relative to these contributions lies in the way we model banks, banking shocks and
their effect on economic activity, which allows for a flexible yet simple illustration of the relation
between financial integration and co-movement.

   Overall our theoretical and empirical results suggest that financial integration has an important
effect on the transmission of business cycles, and that this effect changes, depending on the nature
of shocks. They also suggest that the at least part of the 2007 − 2009 world recession was the
outcome of a credit shock in the U.S. capital markets that spread contagiously to other industrial
countries with strong linkages with the U.S. and its main off-shore center, the Cayman Islands.

pirical methodology and discusses our data on output synchronization and international banking
linkages. Section 3 reports the empirical results. Section 4 lays out the theoretical framework.

2     Methodology and Data

2.1    Specification

The goal of our empirical analysis is to uncover the association between business cycle synchro-
nization and banking integration, and see how this relation has potentially changed during times
of financial crises. To do so we estimate variants of the following regression equation:

                                                                                 0
        Synchi,j,t = αi,j + λt + βLinkagesi,j,t−1 + γP ostt × Linkagesi,j,t−1 + Xi,j,t Φ + i,j,t .


Synchi,j,t is a time-varying bilateral measure reflecting the synchronization of output growth be-
tween countries i and j in period (quarter) t; GDP data to construct growth rates come from
OECD’s statistical database. Linkagesi,j,t−1 measures cross-border banking activities between
country i and country j in the previous period/quarter. P ostt is an indicator variable for the crisis
period that switches to one in all quarters after 2007 : q3, when the financial crisis in the U.S. mort-
gage market started unfolding.7 In all specifications we include country-pair fixed-effects (αi,j ), as
this allows to account for time-invariant bilateral factors that affect both financial integration and
business cycle synchronization (such as trust, social capital, geography, etc.).8 We also include time
fixed effects (λt ), to account for common to all countries shocks. In some specifications we replace
the time fixed-effects with country-specific time trends (trendi and trendj ), to shed light on the
importance of common global shocks versus country-specific shocks. We also estimate specifica-
tions including both time fixed effects and country-specific time trends to better capture common
shocks and hard-to-observe country-specific output dynamics. We control for other factors, such
as the level of income, population, bilateral trade, etc.9 Yet since most of the usual correlates
of output synchronization are either time-invariant (distance, information asymmetry proxies) or
slowly moving over time (similarities in production, bilateral trade), with the exception of lagged
   7
     We also estimated models where the P ostt indicator switches to one after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in
the third quarter of 2008. The results are similar. Since we do not have many post crisis observations, we prefer for
our baseline estimates the earlier timing.
   8
     Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou and Peydro (2012) show that accounting for country-pair fixed-factors is funda-
mental. Working in a similar to ours sample of advanced economies during tranquil times (i.e. non crisis years), they
show that the typical cross-sectional positive correlation between financial integration and output synchronization
changes sign when one simply accounts for time-invariant country-pair factors. Including country-pair fixed-effects is
needed because both the literature on the correlates of cross-border investment (e.g. Portes and Rey (2005); Guiso,
Sapienza and Zingales (2009); Buch (2003); Papaioannou (2009)) and the literature on the determinants of output
co-movement (e.g. Baxter and Kouparitsas 2005) show that time-invariant factors, related to geographic proximity,
trust, and cultural ties are the key robust correlates of financial integration and output synchronization.
   9
     In all panel specifications we cluster standard errors at the country-pair level, so as to account for arbitrary
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation within each country pair (Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan 2004).



                                                          5
GDP per capita and population, no other variable enters the specification with a significant point
estimate.

       In many specifications we augment the empirical specification with measures reflecting the
banking exposure of each country-pair to the U.S. financial system both before and during the
recent financial crisis. This allows us to examine whether synchronization has increased during the
recent crisis between pair of countries that were strongly exposed to the U.S. In contrast to most
previous works, we examine the effect of both direct and indirect via financial centers exposure
to the U.S. financial system. As argued in detail by Milesi-Ferretti, Strobbe and Tamirisa (2010),
most available data on bilateral external positions (and our data) are based on the concept of
residence—the guiding principle of balance of payments statistics—they overstate exposure to and
from small financial centers (and understate exposure to the U.S. and the U.K.).10 To deal with
indirect exposure to the U.S. via financial centers, we construct a lower and upper bound for the
exposure to the U.S. As a lower bound we use direct banking linkages between each country-pair
and the U.S. As an upper bound we add exposure to the direct exposure linkages to the Cayman
Islands (since we have data going back in the early 1980s).


2.2      Output Synchronization

We measure business cycle synchronization (Synch) with the negative of divergence in growth rates,
defined as the absolute value of GDP growth differences between country i and j in quarter t.


                          Synchi,,j,t ≡ −|(ln Yi,t − ln Yi,t−1 ) − (ln Yj,t − ln Yj,t−1 )|.                         (1)

       This index, which follows Giannone, Lenza and Reichlin (2010), is simple and easy-to-grasp.
Moreover, it is not sensitive to the various filtering methods that have been criticized on various
grounds (see Canova 1998, 1999). In contrast to correlation measures that cross-country studies
mainly work with, this synchronization index does not (directly at least) reflect the volatility
of output growth and, therefore, allows us to identify the impact of banking integration on the
covariation of output growth. Another benefit of this index is that, as we do not have many post
crisis observations, the rolling average correlation measures are not very well estimated (see Doyle
  10
    Data on ultimate exposures can in principle be constructed only for bank assets (creditor side) for a limited set
of countries by comparing our locational statistics to the consolidated statistics that are also reported by BIS and
nets out lending by affiliates. See Milesi-Ferretti, Strobbe and Tamirisa (2010) and Kubelec and Sá (2010) for such
an exercise. There are still remaining issues though such as position vis-a-vis non-banks and the issue of non-affiliate
banks. See McGuire and von Peter (2009).

and Faust 2005).11


2.3      International Banking Linkages

To construct the bilateral financial linkages measures we utilize proprietary data from the Bank
of International Settlements’ (BIS) Locational Banking Statistics Database. The database reports
investments from banks located in up to 40 countries (the “reporting area”) into more than 200
countries (the “vis a vis area”) at a quarterly basis from the late 1970s till present. Yet data for
around 20 “reporting area” countries are available only in the past decade or so. We thus limit
our attention to a homogenous group of 18/20 advanced economies that we have (almost) com-
plete coverage since 1978. These countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland,
Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lux-
embourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and the United States.12 Thus we have a rich bilateral
panel dataset on banks’ positions spanning from the first quarter of 1978 to the last quarter of
2009.

       The data is originally collected from domestic monetary authorities and supervisory agencies
and includes all of banks’ on-balance sheet exposure as well as some off-balance sheet items. The
database follows the locational principle and, therefore, also includes lending to subsidiaries and
affiliates. Thus the Locational Banking Statistics reflect more accurately the international exposure
of countries (and banks) than the consolidated statistics database of the BIS that nets out lending
and investment to affiliate institutions. The statistics capture mainly international bank to bank
debt instruments, such as inter-banks loans and deposits, credit lines, and trade-related lines of
credit. The data also covers bank’s investment in equity-like instruments as well as foreign corporate
and government bonds.13
  11
      For robustness and for comparability with the work of Morgan, Rime and Strahan (2004) on the impact of banking
integration on the evolution of business cycles across states in the U.S., we also experimented with an alternative
(though similar) synchronization measure finding similar results. To construct the Morgan, Rime and Strahan (2004)
synchronization index we first regress GDP growth separately for country i and j on country fixed-effects and period
fixed-effects and take the residuals that reflect how much GDP (and its components) differs in each country and
year compared to average growth in this year (across countries) and the average growth of this country over the
estimation period. The absolute value of these residuals reflects fluctuations with respect to the cross-country and
the across-year mean growth. Second we construct the business cycle synchronization proxy as the negative of the
divergence of these residuals taking the absolute difference of residual growth.
   12
      In most empirical specifications we exclude Luxembourg and Switzerland, because these countries have excep-
tionally large financial systems and international financial linkages. The results are almost identical if we were to
include these two financial hubs in our analysis (see Table 2, for example).
   13
      Assets include mainly deposits and balances placed with non-resident banks, including bank’s own related offices
abroad. They also include holdings of securities and participation (i.e. permanent holdings of financial interest in
other undertakings) in non-resident entities. Data also include trade-related credit, arrears of interest and principal



                                                          7
    While not without drawbacks, our data offers important advantages compared to other interna-
tional investment databases that are essential for understanding the impact of financial globalization
on the transmission of the recent crisis. First, the BIS statistics have by far the most extensive
time coverage from all similar database on cross-border investment holdings (as a comparison to
the IMF CPIS database that reports bilateral cross-border financial flows and stocks after 1999).
Second, the data reports bilateral financial linkages between each country in the world and the
U.S., where the crisis originated. This allows us to investigate the direct impact of the credit shock
in the U.S. on the rest of the world. Third, the data includes information on banking activities
between almost all countries in the world and some key financial off-shore centers. As a sizable
bulk of the U.S. financial transactions are channeled via the Cayman Islands (as well as some oth-
ers off-shore financial centers), this allows us to better measure the exposure of countries to the
U.S. Fourth, while the data mostly cover banking activities, according to most commentators and
anecdotal evidence banking linkages played a prominent role in the international transmission of
the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

    The main limitation of our dataset is that it reports the aggregate international exposure only
of the banking system.14 As such our dataset does not include portfolio investment by mutual funds
and the shadow financial system (hedge funds), foreign direct investment and other international
transactions (see Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2007). Yet, cross-border banking activities have been
by far the largest component of cross-border investment in the 1980s and the 1990s, and even
nowadays it consists of the bulk of international finance. The country-level aggregate statistics of
Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) indicate that the stock of cross-border banking is more than 50%
of the overall amount of international holdings (that includes also FDI and portfolio investment).
For the 1980s and 1990s banking activities were more than two-thirds.

    As long as there is a high correlation between international banking and other forms of portfolio
investment (equity flows, FDI, and debt flows), our estimates will not be systematically biased.
According to the latest vintage of the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti data-set of aggregate (at the country-
level) foreign holdings, the correlation of total debt, portfolio debt, banking, FDI and equity in
levels (either expressed as a share of total assets or as a share of GDP) is the range of 0.75 − 0.99.
Other country-pair datasets on foreign capital holdings also suggest a strong correlation of the
that have not been written down and holdings of banks own issues of international securities. They also cover portfolio
and direct investment flows of financial interest in enterprizes.
  14
     Another limitation is that the BIS does not distinguishes between traditional banking activities, equity investment,
and holdings of international debt. As such we cannot examine the effects of the different types of financial integration
on output synchronization.

various types of international investment. For example, Kubelec and Sá (2010) document that
the correlation between our BIS data and IMF’s CPIS (Coordinated Portfolio Investment Surveys)
bilateral debt data, which has a broader coverage of debt assets and liabilities, is 80%.

      We measure cross-border banking activities/linkages (Linkagesi,j,t−s ) in two ways. First, we
use the sum of bilateral assets and liabilities between countries i and j standardized with the sum
of the two countries GDP in each quarter.15
                                                                                                       
                                     Assetsi,j,t + Liabilitiesi,j,t + Assetsj,i,t + Liabilitiesj,i,t
                Linkages/GDP =
                                                        (GDPi,t + GDPj,t )

Second, we use bilateral assets and liabilities between countries i and j over the sum of the total
external assets and liabilities of each country in each quarter.

                                          Assetsi,j,t + Liabilitiesi,j,t + Assetsj,i,t + Liabilitiesj,i,t
    Linkages/T otalLinkages =
                                    T ot Assetsi,t + T ot Liabilitiesi,t + T ot Assetsj,t + T ot Liabilitiesj,t

We finally measure banking exposure to the U.S. financial system with the sum of bilateral assets
and liabilities of each country-pair vis a vis the U.S. divided by the sum of the two countries’
GDP in each quarter (variable U.S. Linkages/GDP in table 1 below). Since we have complete
data coverage for the international banking activities with the Cayman Islands, we also construct
a broader indicator of linkages to the U.S. where we also add to the exposure of each country-pair
to the U.S. the exposure to the Cayman Islands (variable U.S. Broad Linkages/GDP in table 1
below).16 Table 1 gives descriptive statistics for the variables employed in the empirical analysis.



3      Empirical Results

In this section we first present some preliminary evidence on the relation between integration and
business cycle correlation during the recent crisis and then report the results of our empirical
analysis in the period 1978 − 2009. We then examine whether financial linkages to the U.S. has
affected the synchronicity of output during the recent crisis. We conclude the empirical part of
  15
     We have also experimented with gross flows, finding similar results. We prefer working with stocks, because
theoretically it is more appealing. Note that changes in stocks may not solely reflect increased/decreased investment,
as stocks (assets and liabilities) may change due to valuation effects arising from movements in the exchange rate or
the market value of international investment.
  16
     For robustness we also constructed broader indicators of exposure to the United States using data from Panama,
Bermuda, and Virgin Islands. Yet since we do not have complete coverage from these off-shore centers we decided to
report results of exposure to the U.S. financial system simply adding to the U.S. numbers the exposure to and from
the Cayman Islands.

      our analysis investigating whether the association between output synchronization and banking
      integration during the 2007 − 2009 crisis is similar to previous financial turmoil episodes that have
      hit advanced economies.


      3.1       Preliminary evidence before and after the recent financial crisis

      To get a first-pass on the data patterns on the correlation between financial integration and output
      synchronization, we run simple difference-in-difference type specifications in the period just before
      and during the recent financial crisis. Specifically, focusing on a group of 20 advanced economies
      over the period 2002 − 2009, we split the sample into two 4-year periods and for each time-span we
      estimate the correlation of real per capita GDP growth between each country-pair using quarterly
      data (over 16 quarters). We then regress the correlation in output growth on a bilateral index of
      banking integration based on the total assets and liabilities of banks in the two countries in the
      beginning of each period (in 2006 and in 2002) allowing the coefficient on the banking integration
      measure to differ in the two periods. As we condition on country-pair fixed-effects, these specifi-
      cations examine whether within country-pair increases in banking integration are associated with
      a lower or a higher degree of business cycle synchronization; by allowing the coefficient on the
      banking integration to differ in the beginning of each period, we examine whether this association
      has changed during the recent crisis.

          Table 2 reports the results from our preliminary empirical analysis. Some noteworthy patterns
      emerge. First, the coefficient on the second period time effect (the crisis dummy) that captures
      the effect of the financial crisis on output synchronization is positive and highly significant. This
      reflects the fact that during the period 2007 − 2009 correlations have increased tremendously (see

                                                             10
also Perri and Quadrini 2011). Our estimate suggests that output growth correlations increased by
around 0.4 − 0.5 during the recent crisis period (as compared to the four year period just before).
Second, the coefficient on banking integration in the simple specification in column (1) is negative
and highly significant. This suggests that conditional on common to all countries shocks, within
country-pair increases in banking integration are associated with less synchronized output cycles.
Third, when we allow the coefficient on banking integration to differ in the two 4-year periods
(which most likely are characterized by different types of shocks), we find a positive and significant
coefficient of the interaction between banking linkages and second period dummy: this implies that
country pairs that were strongly integrated via the international banking system at the start of the
2007 − 2009 crisis (in the beginning of 2006) experienced more synchronized contractions during
the crisis. Notice that, while the partial effect of financial integration on output synchronization
during the recent crisis is positive, the total effect is negative. So the crisis makes the relation
between financial integration and output synchronization less negative.




3.2    Financial Integration and Output Synchronization

Table 3 reports our benchmark estimates on the effect of financial integration on output syn-
chronization in the period 1978 − 2009. The estimates in column (1) are in line with the simple
difference-in-difference estimates reported in Table 2, where we used the correlation of GDP growth
as the dependent variable and focused on the period just before and during the recent financial
crisis (2002 − 2009). In tranquil times, there is a significantly negative association between bank-
ing integration and output synchronization. Note that this association does not necessarily means
that integration causes low synchronization, as it is conceivable that causality runs from synchro-
nization to integration.17 To control for this (and other endogeneity) concerns, Kalemli-Ozcan,
Papaioannou and Peydro 2012, for the period 1978 − 2006, use instrumental variables using an
exogenous structural index of financial integration based on legislative/regulatory harmonization
policies in financial services as an instrument for cross-border banking linkages (see also Kalemli-
Ozcan, Papaioannou and Peydro 2010). They show that reverse causation is not quantitatively
important. Unfortunately, however, the structural index of financial integration is not available
  17
    As the benefits of international diversification are larger when the output cycles of two countries are asynchronous,
the negative correlation could reflect causality running from output divergence to financial integration (see Heathcote
and Perri 2004 for a theoretical exposition).

  Notes: The table reports panel (country-pair) fixed-effect coefficients estimated in two non-overlapping 4-year
periods, in the period 2002q1–2005q4 and the period 2006:q1–2009q4, using 20×19 country-pairs. The dependent
variable is the pair-wise correlation of real GDP per capita between country i and country j in each of the two periods.
The crisis indicator equals one for the second period (and zero in the first-period). Financial integration is measured
by the log of the share of the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities between countries i and j in quarter t relatively to
the sum of the two countries’ GDP in the beginning of each period (Linkages/GDP). Column (3) omits Luxembourg,
and Switzerland. All specifications also include the log of the product of the two countries’ GDP in the beginning
of each period and the log of the product of the two countries population. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors
are reported in parenthesis and corresponding t-stats are below.


for the recent crisis period, and as such we cannot implement their proposed panel instrumental
variables approach.

       The coefficient on banking integration changes sign when we focus on the recent financial crisis
period. The estimate on the interaction term between bilateral banking activities and the recent
crisis period implies that during the 2007 − 2009 years an increased degree of banking integration
was followed by more synchronized cycles. In column (2) we include time (quarter) fixed-effects to
account for common global shocks, while in column (3) we include time fixed-effects and country-
specific time trends. In both specifications, the coefficient on banking integration continues to
enter with a negative and significant estimate; the coefficient changes sign and turns positive (and
significant) in the recent crisis period. In column (4) we control for bilateral trade in goods.18 The
coefficient on goods trade is small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Most importantly
  18
    The bilateral trade index is the sum of the logs of real bilateral exports and imports between the two countries
in each quarter. Data come from OECD monthly statistical database on trade.



                                                             12
conditioning on goods trade does not affect the coefficient on banking integration both during
tranquil periods and during the recent financial crisis.19

       The total effect of financial integration (β + γ) on output synchronization is negative, with
the exception of specifications (1) and (5), where we do not account for common shocks with the
inclusion of time fixed effects. This is important since as we argued above our results can be
interpreted as the negative effect of financial integration on synchronization being weakened during
the 2007 − 2009 crisis. This is not the case in column (1) and (5), where the total effect (β + γ) is
positive. However this positive effect is spurious since it is driven by the simple fact that all boats
sinked together, something not accounted for in these permutations. This indicates the utmost
need to include time fixed effects so as to separate the effect of financial contagion, if there is any,
from the impact of common shocks. As shown in the tables, with the exceptions of three columns,
the difference between the two coefficients is not significantly different than zero most times though.

       The estimates in Table 3 imply an economically significant effect. Since the banking integration
measure is expressed in logs and the dependent variable is in percentage points, the estimates are
semi-elasticities. The coefficient in column (3) implies that for a typical rise in bilateral integration
from the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile of the distribution, which is similar to the increase
in integration between Italy and Portugal during our sample (a tripling), is followed by an average
decrease in GDP synchronization of 0.6 percentage points of these two countries in tranquil times.
Yet during the crisis for the same pair the effect of banking integration on output synchronization
turns positive; a 0.3 percentage point increase in synchronization. Given the median degree of
synchronization (2.7%) these are significant effects. The effects are also sizeable from the perspective
of changes. The actual average increase in synchronization is 1% during the crisis period of 2007 −
2009. Thus, our estimates can explain up to 30% of the actual changes in output convergence
during the crisis.20

       In columns (5)-(8) we report estimates that are otherwise similar to the ones in columns (1)-(4)
using the alternative banking integration index, the log of the share of bilateral banking assets and
liabilities to the total amount of external banking assets and liabilities of each pair. The results
are similar to the ones in columns (1)-(4). In tranquil times a higher degree of banking linkages is
  19
     A priori it looks important to account for differences in bilateral trade, as previous works show that trade in
goods and financial services tend to move in tandem (e.g. Rose and Spiegel 2004; Aviat and Coeurdacier 2007) and
that trade has a significantly positive effect on business cycle synchronization. Yet in the high-frequency quarterly
dimension there is no significant within country correlation between goods trade and business cycle synchronization.
  20
     There are some outliers in the dependent variable (GDP growth divergence exceeding 15%; see Table 2). We
thus re-estimated all models windsorizing the dependent variable at the 1% and 5%. The estimates are similar to the
ones reported in the main tables.

           associated with less synchronized, more divergent, output cycles. The negative association between
           banking integration and output synchronization during the recent financial crisis is attenuated
           during the 2007 − 2009 crisis period.

Notes: The table reports panel (country-pair) fixed-effect coefficients estimated over the period 1978:q1–2009:q4, using 18×17 country-
pairs omitting Luxembourg and Switzerland. The dependent variable (GDP Synchronization) is minus one times the absolute value of the
difference in the growth rate of GDP between countries i and j in quarter t. In columns (1)-(4) financial integration is measured by the
log of the share of the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities between countries i and j in the previous quarter relatively to the sum of the
two countries’ GDP in the previous period (Linkages/GDP). In columns (5)-(8) financial integration is measured by the log of the share
of the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities between countries i and j in the previous quarter relatively to the sum of the two countries’
external assets and liabilities in the entire world in the previous period (Linkages/Total Linkages). The Crisis indicator variable equals one
in all quarters after 2007:q3 (and zero before that). All specifications also include the log of the product of the two countries’ GDP in the
beginning of each period and the log of the product of the two countries population. The specifications in columns (4) and (8) also include
the sum of the logs of real bilateral exports and imports between countries i and j in the previous quarter (Trade). The specifications in
columns (1) and (5) include country-specific linear time-trends. The specifications in columns (2) and (6) include time fixed-effects. The

3.3      U.S. Exposure and Crisis Transmission

The recent financial crisis started with the problems in the U.S. sub-prime market in the summer
of 2007 and intensified in 2008 when Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers (and many other banking
institutions) experienced massive losses. Many commentators and policy makers have argued that
financial linkages enabled the quick transmission of the crisis from a corner of the U.S. capital
markets to the rest of the world. Yet, recent works fail to find evidence for the importance of
financial ties to the U.S. for the severity of the crisis (e.g. Rose and Spiegel 2010).

       In Table 4 we examine whether output synchronization during the recent financial crisis has
been stronger among country-pairs that had stronger linkages to the U.S. banking system relative
to the pairs that have weaker connections. Controlling for direct exposure to the U.S. has no major
effect on our evidence in Table 3. The coefficient on bilateral banking linkages between the two
countries is negative and significant, implying that in tranquil times an increase in banking linkages
is followed by more divergent output cycles. The coefficient on bilateral banking linkages changes
sign and becomes positive and significant during the recent financial crisis. In contrast to the
bilateral banking integration measures that enter with stable and significant coefficients, columns
(1)-(3) show that direct U.S. banking linkages variable enters with an insignificant coefficient both
before and after the recent financial crisis. The insignificant coefficient on U.S. banking linkages
during the recent financial crisis is in line with the recent work of Rose and Spiegel (2010), who,
using alternative (cross-sectional) techniques and data also fail to find a systematic correlation
between international linkages to the U.S. and the magnitude of the recessions across countries in
2007 − 2009.

       In columns (4)-(6) of Table 4 we report otherwise similar to columns (1)-(3) estimates, but we
now use a broader measure of exposure to the U.S. that incorporates not only banking activities
of each country-pair with the U.S., but also linkages to the Cayman Islands.21 Accounting for
indirect links to the U.S. financial system appears fundamental. The coefficients on the U.S.
linkages measures that were insignificant in the analogous specifications in columns (1)-(3) enter
now with significant estimates. In all three permutations the post crisis estimate on the U.S.
linkages variable—that now incorporates assets and liabilities in the U.S. and the Cayman Islands—
is positive and statistically significant at standard confidence levels. This implies that country-pairs
with strong linkages to the U.S. financial system experienced more synchronized cycles during the
  21
    The results are similar if we also add Bermuda, Panama, and the Channel Islands. We prefer the estimates only
with the Cayman Islands because the BIS database records these transactions since 1983. In contrast data for the
other financial centers are available only after 2000.

The dependent variable (GDP Synchronization) is minus one times the absolute value of the difference in the growth
rate of GDP between countries i and j in quarter t. Financial integration is measured by the log of the share of
the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities between countries i and j in the previous quarter relatively to the sum
of the two countries’ GDP in the previous period (Linkages/GDP). In columns (1)-(3) we measure U.S. linkages by
the log of the share of the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities between each country and the U.S. in the previous
quarter relatively to the two countries’ GDP in the previous period (U.S. Linkages/GDP). In columns (4)-(6) we
measure U.S. linkages by the log of the share of the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities between each country-pair
and the U.S. and the Cayman Islands in the previous quarter relatively to the two countries’ GDP in the previous
period (U.S. Broad Linkages/GDP). The Crisis indicator variable equals one in all quarters after 2007:q3 (and zero
before that). All specifications also include the log of the product of the two countries’ GDP in the beginning of
each period and the log of the product of the two countries population. The specifications in columns (1) and (4)
include country-specific linear time-trends. The specifications in columns (2) and (5) include time fixed-effects. The
specifications in columns (3) and (6) include time fixed-effects and country-specific linear time-trends. Standard
errors adjusted for panel (country-pair) specific auto-correlation and heteroskedasticity and corresponding t-statistics
are reported below.

recent crisis period. Most importantly this effect seems to work on top of the positive effect of
bilateral banking activities on output synchronization during the 2007 − 2009 crisis and the total
effect becomes positive for the countries that are tightly linked to U.S., when we add all the
coefficients. This appears consistent with the transmission of the crisis from the U.S. to the pairs
that are highly exposed to the U.S. and in turn to other countries. Moreover, the negative and
significant coefficient on U.S., banking linkages in column (6) suggests that increases in financial
integration between a country-pair and the U.S. financial system in tranquil periods are followed
by more divergent cycles.


3.4      Is this Time Different?

Our finding that during the recent financial crisis period the negative relation between banking
integration and output synchronization is weakened raises the question on whether a similar pattern
was present during previous financial crisis episodes. While we focus on a group of advanced
economies in a period of relative financial stability up until the recent crisis of 2007−2009, there were
some episodes of systemic banking crises in our sample. Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) argue that the
2007 − 2009 financial crisis has been comparable (to some at least degree) to some previous banking
crises episodes in other advanced economies, namely Spain (1977 − 1985), Finland (1991 − 1994),
Sweden (1991 − 1994), and Japan (1997 − 2001).22

       We thus estimated specifications allowing the effect of banking integration to differ when one
of the two countries in each pair was under a major banking crisis in each quarter before the
2007 − 2009 crisis. Table 5 reports the results. In columns (1) and (2) we use the Reinhart and
Rogoff (2008) banking crisis classification, while for robustness in columns (3) and (4) we use the
banking crisis chronology of Laeven and Valencia (2010). The effect of banking integration on
output synchronization is positive during banking crises, even before 2007, although the total effect
is still negative. The coefficient is estimated quite precisely, and appears significant at the 99%
confidence level in all permutations. The coefficient in column (2) where besides including country-
pair fixed-effects and time-effects, we also include linear country trends (−0.10) implies that a
doubling in the degree of financial integration leads to an increased synchronization of output by
one percentage point. The magnitude of the coefficient is also quite similar with the coefficient on
banking integration during the recent financial crisis (in column (2) is −0.11), thus suggesting that
the mechanisms under play during the 2007 − 2009 crisis were not fundamentally different than
  22
    Reinhart and Rogoff (2009b) also list Norway’s banking crisis in the late 1980s as comparable, but Norway is not
included in our sample.

that of previous financial crises. In all specifications we can not reject the null hypothesis that the
two coefficients on banking integration during financial crisis episodes are the same.

Notes: The table reports panel (country-pair) fixed-effect coefficients estimated over the period 1978:q1-2009:q4. The
dependent variable (GDP Synchronization) is minus one times the absolute value of the difference in the growth rate
of GDP between countries i and j in quarter t. Financial integration is measured by the log of the share of the stock
of bilateral assets and liabilities between countries i and j in the previous quarter relatively to the sum of the two
countries’ GDP in the previous period (Linkages/GDP). We measure U.S. linkages by the log of the share of the stock
of bilateral assets and liabilities between each country-pair and the U.S. and the Cayman Islands in the previous
quarter relatively to the two countries’ GDP in the previous period (U.S. Broad Linkages/GDP). The Crisis indicator
variable equals one in all quarters after 2007:q3 (and zero before that). The Previous Crisis indicator variable equals
one when a major financial turmoil episode is present in country i or j in period/quarter t. In columns (1)-(2) we
identify previous crises using the Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) classification of main financial turmoil episodes, while
in columns (3)-(4) we use the Laeven and Valencia (2010) classification that includes both systemic and non-systemic
banking crises. All specifications also include the log of the product of the two countries’ GDP in the beginning of each
period and the log of the product of the two countries population. Standard errors adjusted for panel (country-pair)
specific auto-correlation and heteroskedasticity and corresponding t-statistics are reported below.


    Note that once we control for the previous crisis, the total effect of financial integration on
synchronization is positive in the case of the current crisis for the pairs of countries that are strongly

tied to the U.S. (conditional on time fixed effects and country-specific trends). This is an extremely
strict specification, since we can separate contagion from the common shock. To the best of our
knowledge this result is the first evidence that shows transmission as a result of financial/banking
integration for pairs of countries that are strongly integrated with the U.S. financial system.



4     A model of international business cycles with banks

In this section we develop a simple international business cycle model where global banks interme-
diate funds from households/consumers/savers to firms/borrowers. There are two types of shocks
driving economic fluctuations: a standard productivity shock and a shock that affects the value of
risky assets held by banks and, through this channel, their ability to intermediate funds. We refer
to the latter shocks interchangeably as credit or banking shocks.

    The model serves two purposes. The first is to precisely spell a causal link between financial
integration and business cycle synchronization. Our empirical section documents a relationship
between the two that changes during crisis times, but does not speak about the mechanism and the
direction of causation. Here we will use the model to derive quantitative results that show how the
empirical findings are indeed consistent with the hypothesis that exogenous changes to financial
integration have significant effects on business cycle synchronization, and that the magnitude of
these effects depends on the structural shocks hitting the economy. The second purpose of the
model is to show that our empirical findings can be used to identify sources of output fluctuations,
and thus to shed light on the causes of the triggering and spreading of the 2007-2009 crisis. Our
framework is similar in spirit to recent models that introduce global banks in an international
business cycles set-up (see, for example, Kollmann, Enders and Müller 2011). One innovation
of our set-up is that it models the relation between banking integration and co-movement in a
very simple fashion; as such the set-up is well-suited to analyze the effects of a changing level of
cross-border banking integration on business cycle synchronization, under different types of shocks.


4.1   The economy

We consider a two-countries, two-sectors, one-good world. Figure 1 contains a stylized representa-
tion of the economy. In each country (foreign country variables will be denoted by ∗ ) and in each
sector (denoted by i = 1, 2) there are households (Hi and Hi∗ ), which supply labor to firms and
save with banks in the same sector. Firms (Fi and Fi∗ ) hire labor, make investment decisions, and


                                                 19

pay dividends and wages to households in their sector, which in turn borrow from banks in the
same sector. Finally there are banks which intermediate funds between households and firms. The
difference between the two sectors is banking integration. Sectors 1 in each country are financially
separated from the rest of the economy and banks in that sector ((B1 , B1∗ ) in figure 1) intermedi-
ate only between consumers and firms within the sector. Sectors 2 are financially integrated; all
consumers and firms in sector 2 in both countries have financial transactions through the same
set of banks (BG ). Banks in sectors 2 are global banks as, since the sectors are integrated, their
national identity does not matter. The two sectors have size 1 − λ and λ, respectively, so λ is a
stylized measure of the degree of banking/financial integration. Note that for the extreme value of
λ = 0 the model nests the case of financial autarky in which all banks only operate domestically
and there are no financial flows between the two countries. At the other extreme (when λ = 1
there is a maximum level of financial integration) all banks are global and intermediation markets
are fully integrated between the two countries. Besides financial integration the two sectors in each
country are identical in every respect; they are subject to the same country-specific (idiosyncratic)
shocks to productivity (z and z ∗ ) and to credit (R and R∗ ).




                                                 20
In the rest of subsection we first describe the consumers/workers problem; we then describe the
firms’ problem, and conclude with the description of the banking sector. Our model of banks is
highly stylized: our objective is not to provide a detailed description of how the world banking
system operates and of the underlying forces of banking shocks, but to provide a simple set-up in
which shocks to banking activities can have real repercussions in multiple countries. Moreover our
modeling of banking/financial integration is simplified as the degree of internationalization of the
banking system is captured by the exogenously given parameter, λ.


4.1.1   Households

In each country and in each sector there is a continuum of identical infinitely lived households
whose preferences are given by

                                          ∞
                                          X
                                      E         β t U (cit , lit ),       i = 1, 2                  (2)
                                          t=0


where E represents expectations across time and possible states of the world, cit denotes consump-
tion, lit is labor effort, 0 < β < 1 is the discount factor and U (., .) is a standard utility function.
Households in each sector enter each period with an amount of bank deposits, Dit , carried over from
the last period; they also receive labor income wit lit (where wit is the wage rate), and dividends dit
from firms in their sector.23 In each period consumers allocate resources between consumption and
savings in the form of domestic bank deposits, which yield a gross rate of return Rit . Consumers’
budget constraints in the two sectors are

                                     Dit+1
                             cit +         = wit lit + dit + Dit ,                i = 1, 2          (3)
                                      Rit

Consumers’ problem is to choose sequences for consumption, labor, and bank deposits to maximize
(2) subject to (3) taking as given the sequences for bank deposit rates, wages, and dividends, as well
as the initial conditions for bank deposits). Consumers in country 2 solve an analogous problem.
Financial integration implies that consumers in sector 2 can shop for banks in the two countries so
the deposit rate for sector 2 consumers is equalized across countries i.e.

                                                  ∗
                                           R2t = R2t ,                for all t
 23
   Throughout this paper we assume 100% home bias in equity markets. The results presented below are not
dependent on this assumption.




                                                            21
Notice that in this simple set-up deposits are effectively constituted by physical goods, set aside by
consumers in banks, so we can think of them (and also refer to them) as banking capital.


4.1.2    Firms

Firms in both sectors and both countries operate, on behalf of consumers in that sector, a constant
return to scale technology F (., .), which uses capital (kit ) and labor (lit ) to produce a consumption
good. Production in each sector is subject to stochastic, country specific, but common across
sectors, productivity shocks zt and zt∗ . The crucial assumption that connects banks with the real
economy, is that firms, in order to undertake production, need to borrow from banks an amount of
working capital equal to the wage bill. This assumption is usually motivated by a timing structure in
which firms need to pay workers before they receive the proceeds from their sales (see, for example,
Christiano and Eichenbaum 1992 or Neumeyer and Perri 2005). The real world correspondence
will be the liquidity requirements of firms.24 Firms in sector i pay a gross lending rate Rit
                                                                                           e on bank

                                                                                           e is not,
loans. As it will become clear later, due to the intermediation process, the lending rate Rit
in general, equal the deposit rate Rit . Firms’ dividends dit are thus given by the value of production
minus the wage bill (including interests) and minus investment:


                                     dit = ezt F (kit , lit ) − Rit
                                                                 e
                                                                    wit libvt − xit                              (4)


where xit represents investment in physical capital. The capital stock evolves according to
                                                                                     2
                                                                         xit
                          kit+1 = (1 − δ)kit + xit − φkit                    −δ              ,       i = 1, 2    (5)
                                                                         kit

where δ is the depreciation rate and φ determines the magnitude of capital adjustment costs. Finally
we assume that the log of productivity follows a bivariate auto-regressive process

                                                                                     εzt

                                                     = Az                    +           ∗                       (6)

     According to many commentators and anecdotal evidence the recent banking crisis has indeed led to a severe
contraction of the liquidity of firms. Moreover recent evidence suggest that part of the severe contraction in output
across most advanced economies over the 2007 − 2009 crisis was due to the deteriorating conditions in the financing
of international trade credit.

where Qit = β t Uc (cit , lit ) is the marginal rate of substitution of domestic consumers in sector i

In the financially integrated sectors firms can shop for banks in both countries. So lending rates
will be equalized.

4.1.3    Banks

To complete the model we now describe how banks intermediate funds from consumers to firms/managers.
In each sector there is a continuum of identical competitive banks. Banks in the financially seg-
                                                ∗

mented sector raise deposits       R1t   and    ∗ ,
                                               R1t        respectively from consumers in those sectors. Banks
in the financially integrated sectors are “global banks” and raise deposits/banking capital from
consumers in the financially integrated sector in both countries, i.e. global banks’ deposits are
                   ∗
           D2t+1 +D2t+1
given by       R2t      .   We assume that the activity of raising deposits is costly and banks need to
pay a fraction ι of deposits to cover intermediation costs. Banks allocate deposits to two types of
assets: country-specific risky technologies (which are intended to capture returns on assets held by
banks and not explicitly modeled here, such as mortgages or stocks), and risk-free loans to firms,
as described above. In sector 1 banks only lend to firms in that sector and in that country and
only invest in the risky technology of that country. In sector 2 (the global banks sector) banks
lend to firms in both countries and invest in a diversified international fund, which contains equal
shares of the risky technologies of both countries.25 We denote with Rtm and Rtm∗ the stochastic
gross returns on risky technologies in the two countries, which we assume to have equal mean in
each country. Banks first, without knowing the realizations of returns Rtm , Rtm∗ , decide how much
to invest in the risky asset. We assume that the expected return on the risky asset is always high
enough so that each bank invests in it the maximum share of its deposits allowed by bank regulation
  25
    This is a very simple way of capturing the idea that in general global banks will be affected by shocks in the
risky technology in both countries.


                                                                   23
i.e. 0 < m̄ < 1.26 After returns Rtm , Rtm∗ are observed (but not cashed in), banks compete offering
loans to firms in their sector. Since firms borrow to finance the wage bill, equilibrium loans of banks
Lit and L∗it are given by


                                                 L1t = w1t l1t , L∗1t = w1t
                                                                         ∗ ∗
                                                                            l1t
                                                 L2t = w2t l2t , L∗2t = w2t
                                                                         ∗ ∗
                                                                            l2t


At the end of the period banks receive the proceeds from lending to firms and from risky investments;
banks also pay back deposits plus interests to consumers and intermediation costs. Competition
between banks insures that equilibrium interest rate on loans is such that bank profits are 0.

    To complete the description of the banking problem we have to specify a process for shocks to
the return to risky assets: we assume that they follow a bivariate auto-regressive process given by

                                      Rtm                    R̄m                   m

    Caveat        We have modeled banks portfolio decision in a rather stark fashion, basically assuming
that banks invest a constant fraction of their portfolio in risky assets. Obviously in reality bank
can, and do, change the composition of their portfolio. If, however, one interprets our model as a
representation of the entire financial sector then the assumption that the proportion of risky and
safe assets is rather constant through time is not too far-fetched. The crucial ingredient in our
theory is that banks are always exposed to some additional risk that interferes with their lending
to firms; the assumptions that the size of this risk is constant and that the loans to firm are risk
free are made for analytical simplicity.

4.3      Parametrization

The equilibrium described above does not admit analytical solution. So to characterize its proper-
ties we need to assign functional forms to utility and production, numerical values to the various
parameters and then derive a numerical solution using standard linearization techniques. Func-
tional forms for utility and production, preference and technology parameters are set in a standard
fashion in this literature, so to match long run zero growth in hours worked, constant shares of
labor income and volatility of investment relative to GDP. They are reported in table 6 below. The
productivity process is also standard but, as we consider two versions of the model, one with only
productivity shocks, the other with productivity and banking shocks, we consider two values for
the variance of innovation of productivity: the two values are chosen such that the two versions of
the model have the same volatility of GDP growth (to facilitate comparison across them).




       Since the parameters characterizing the banking sector are less standard, we briefly describe how
we set them. The parameter λ, which determines the degree of financial integration between the
two countries and m̄, which determines the share of assets banks invest in the risky technology are
set so that model with only productivity shocks generates volatility of net exports (relative to the
percentage volatility GDP) roughly equal to 40% and a correlation of net exports and GDP which
is about −0.4: these values are consistent with statistics computed for U.S. and other developed
countries.27 .

       Next regarding the stochastic process for credit shocks we assume that innovations to credit
  27
    It is easy to see how the parameter λ affects directly the volatility of net exports, as when λ is 0 the economies
are closed and the volatility of net exports is 0. Why does the parameter m̄ affect the correlation between net exports
and output? The parameter m̄, even in absence of banking shocks, affects the sensitivity of domestic lending rates
Re to changes in the deposit rates R (see equation 16). The larger m̄,the more Re raises in response to an increase
in R due to a productivity shock. This implies that firms do not hire much in response to higher productivity and
hence do not invest much. This in turns implies that the country as a whole imports less goods to finance investment
and that makes the correlation between net exports and output less negative than in the model with low m̄

model with two types of shocks we set the standard deviation of the innovations to banking shocks
 ε so that banking shocks alone are responsible for a standard deviation of growth rate of GDP
σR
of about 0.3%. To obtain this number we have observed that the standard deviation of quarterly
growth rate of U.S. GDP increased from about 0.5% in the period 1984 − 2006 to about 0.8% in
the period 2007 − 2010 and so, attributing the entire increase in U.S. volatility to credit shocks,
yields the target number.
  28
    We recognize that these are rather arbitrary assumptions. Our key results on the impact of integration under
two different types of dominant shocks are robust to significant perturbations in these assumptions.

       This simple procedure yields a value of σR
model, to identify the data equivalent of returns on risky investments undertaken by the banking
sector and the volatility of returns on these risky investments. The simple calibration approach
though suggests that in order for these shocks to explain a significant fraction of GDP volatility,
the volatility of returns on these risky investments in the banking/financial sector has to be large:
much larger than the volatility of productivity shocks and comparable to the volatility of stock
returns.

       We finally set the average return on risky assets in the model, R̄m , to match an average real
return on observed risky assets (such as stocks) of around 6%, and set the banking intermediation
cost ι = 4% of deposits so, in the model with banking shocks the spread between lending and
deposit rate is 3% on average and positive 95% of the times.29


4.4      The effects of shocks

4.4.1      Productivity Shocks

Productivity shocks in this model operate as in a standard two country real business cycle model.
Consider, for example, a negative productivity shock in the home country. In sector 1 (the seg-
mented one) the shock lowers labor demand and investment and hence output at home, but, absent
spillovers in the productivity itself, has no effects abroad. In sector 2 (the financial integrated one)
a negative domestic productivity shock reduces labor demand and output but also reduces global
demand for credit, which causes a fall in the (common across countries) deposit and lending rates.
The fall in the lending rate causes an increase in labor demand and employment abroad and the fall
in the deposit rate induces an increase in investment abroad. The larger the financially integrated
sector (i.e. the larger λ) the more inter-connected the two economies are; as such the more a nega-
tive productivity shock at home has an expansionary effect abroad and hence the less the economies
are correlated. By enabling resource flows from the less productive to the more productive country,
financial integration reduces the output correlation between the economies. The top two panels of
figure 2 show the impulse responses of a negative domestic productivity shock. The home country
GDP contracts and foreign country GDP expands (panel a). The foreign economy expands because
interest rates in the financially integrated sector (the lines R2∗ and R2∗e in panel b) fall.
  29
    We experiment with several values of these last two parameters, in particular with the returns on risky assets
ranging from 2% to 10% and the intermediation costs ranging from 0% to 8%. The business cycle statistics produced
by the model vary very little within this range.

Credit shocks are shocks to returns on risky bank assets Rtm and Rtm . To get some intuition
on how these work it is useful to first focus on the segmented sector, say, in the home country.
Recall that the two key interest rates, R1t , the rate depositors receive, which determines the cost
                                 e , the lending rate banks charge to firms, will not be equalized.
of raising funds for banks, and R1t
The reason why these two rates differ in equilibrium, even though banks make zero profits, is that
banks make losses or gains on investment in the risky technology. These gains/losses plus the zero
profit conditions drive a wedge between Rt +ι and Rte . And this wedge, through the working capital


                                                                                                              29
                                                                    e in (7) to get
channel, has an effect on economic activity. To see this solve for R1t

                                    e        1                  m̄
                                   R1t =          (R1t + ι) −       Rm .                           (16)

Equation (16) shows that

  1. Unless m̄ = 0 (i.e. banks are prohibited to invest in risky assets) or Rtm = R1t + ι (i.e. the
        return on the risky technology is the same as the equilibrium deposit rate plus intermediation
        costs), the rate banks charge to firms is different from the depositors rate plus intermediation
        costs. The presence of the intermediation costs guarantees that, on average, the spread
                                           e − R is positive.
        between lending and deposit rate, R1t   1t


  2. Negative shocks to the return to the risky asset (rate) increase the spread between depositor
        rate and lending rate.

  3. The larger the share invested in risky assets, m̄, the more sensitive is the lending rate to
        shocks in the risky rate. Banks make up for losses on risky assets by charging a high interest
        rate to firms. If bank portfolio contains a large share of risky assets interest the rate hikes
        necessary to cover the losses are larger.


4.4.3     Graphical illustration of the impact of credit shocks

To further understand the effect of a financial shock figure 3 below represents equilibrium in the
financially segmented sector. The positively sloped line ZP represents combinations of deposit
rates and lending rates that yield zero profit for banks (equation 16), for a given level of k1 , z,
and Rm . The line is positively sloped because a high deposit rate induces, ceteris paribus, a high
lending rate so that banks break even. The negatively sloped line represents the locus of lending
and deposit rates that constitute an equilibrium in intermediation markets (equation 13). It is
negatively sloped because a higher R1 induces a higher supply of deposits D1t and thus requires a
lower R1e to induce a high demand for credit from the firms. The graph allows to easily understand
the effect of shocks. Consider for example a fall in Rm . The fall lowers revenues for banks and
thus implies a shift up of the zero profit condition from ZP to ZP 0 . In equilibrium this will
result in a fall in deposit rates from R1 to R10 and an increase in lending rates from R1e to R1e0 .
Higher lending rates, through the working capital channel, reduce firms labor demand and hence
equilibrium employment. Consequently, as a result of the shock to the risky revenues of the banking

   The effects of a negative shock to Rm in the financially integrated sector is similar, with the
difference that the shock now gets transmitted in the financially integrated sector abroad through
the common interest rate. Since financially integrated sectors share both deposit rates and lending
rates, the rate changes that caused the reduction of economic activity at home also cause a reduction
of economic activity abroad. The bottom panels in figure 2 show how in response to an adverse
credit shock economic activity in both countries contracts (in panel c both GDP and GDP ∗ fall). In
the home country economic activity contracts in both sectors, because lending rates in both sectors
raise; in foreign country economic activity contracts because the lending rate in the financially
integrated sector, R2e∗ , increases (see panel d). One important thing to notice is that, in response
to a credit shock, interest rates in the model raise substantially. Again this is due to the stylized
nature of our model: in the real world besides the interest rates additional conditions in credit


                                                 31
markets, such as borrowing restrictions or bank failures (as well as monetary policy), are likely to
manifest in credit markets as a result of shocks. Since our model completely abstracts from those
additional variables, interest rates need to be volatile for credit conditions to have sizeable effect
on economic activity.



5     Quantitative Results

5.1   Shocks and business cycles

We first use the model to assess the effects of credit shocks on several properties of both local and
international business cycles. Table 7 reports the results of the quantitative analysis. The rows
labeled “Productivity only” report standard business statistics for the model with only productivity
shocks. The model generates business cycles statistics quite similar (thereby sharing successes and
failures) to those generated by a standard international real business cycle model. The rows labeled
“Productivity & credit” in table 7 report business cycles statistics for the version of the model with
both productivity and credit shocks.

    Three differences between the two versions of the model are worth noticing. First, the model
with both credit and productivity shocks displays more internationally correlated GDP and GDP
components than the model that only admits productivity shocks. In the segmented sectors the
correlation in economic activity is simply driven by the correlation of the shocks (which for expo-
sitional purposes and simplicity we have assumed to be the same for both shocks). However, the
correlation between the financially integrated sectors across countries depends on the composition
of the shocks: with dominant productivity shocks, the financially integrated sectors tend to be
negatively correlated, while with dominant banking shocks they tend to be positively correlated.
Since the overall GDP correlation of the two economies is a combination of the correlation in the
two sectors, the economies with both shocks co-move more relative to the economies with only
productivity shocks. Interestingly introducing credit shocks increases the international correlation
of output, employment and investment more than it does the correlation of consumption; so the
models can partially explain the so-called “quantity anomaly” i.e. the fact that the model predicts
that consumption patterns are more correlated than output internationally while in the data usu-
ally the opposite is observed. We conjecture that a reason for this feature is that, for our baseline
parameters, credit shocks have a stronger effect on employment dynamics than on consumption
dynamics.


                                                 32
      Second, the model with both shocks generates more volatile employment relative to GDP than
the model with only productivity shocks (0.77 v/s 0.67). This is due to the fact that credit shock
induces movements in lending rates that cause, through the working capital channel, autonomous
(i.e. not driven by productivity) movements in employment. This feature of the model is qualita-
tively consistent with evidence from the recent crisis showing that much of decline of U.S. GDP
during the crisis is due to employment changes.

      Third, the model with both banking and productivity shocks displays net exports that are less
volatile and less (in absolute value) correlated with GDP. This is because credit shocks, due to their
stronger international transmission, hit both countries similarly and thus reduces international flow
of resources (net exports).

      We would like to add a final consideration about the way we model credit shocks. The main
channel through which credit shocks affect economic activity is by raising the borrowing rate of
       e (see equation 16). But inspecting equations 10, 11 and 12 it is easy to see that credit
firms Rit
shocks also increase the resources of the economy.30 For this reason we have also considered a
version of the model in which credit shocks are modeled as a pure transfer. In particular we assume
that stochastic returns on risky assets held by banks are provided by the government, which finances
them by raising lump sum taxes/transfers on households; so, for example, for sector 1 in country 1
we define
                                                    D1t+1
                                            T1t =         (m̄(Rtm − 1))
                                                     R1t

      We thank an anonymous referee for pointing this issue to us.



                                                         33
and subtract T1t from the budget constraint of households in that country and in that sector. In
this version of the model credit shocks are the same as in the baseline version; the difference is that
                           ∗
their realizations Rtm , Rtm do not change the amount of resources in the economy and, as such, do
not appear in the resource constraints of the economy. We found that this perturbation changes the
quantitative properties of the model very little, suggesting that the main channel through which
credit shocks operate is not by changing the aggregate resources of the economy, but rather by
changing the inter-temporal prices faced by households and firms.

   Overall the results from the calibration show that introducing a simple form of credit shocks
in a standard international business cycle model generates plausible business cycles, and helps
understanding some of the features that the standard model has trouble with.


5.2      Banking Integration and Co-movement

We now connect directly the quantitative results of the model with the empirical results in the
first part of the paper. We do this in two ways: first we simply conduct a simple comparative
static exercise on how in the model banking integration affects co-movement, under different type
of shocks. Second, to see whether the casual relation in the model is consistent with data, we will
run on artificial data from the model the exact same regressions we run in the data.


   Comparative static We consider the two parameterizations of the model described above
(productivity shocks alone and productivity and banking shocks) and for each parametrization we
vary the degree of banking integration from no integration (λ = 0) to complete financial integration
(λ = 1). For each value of the financial integration parameter we report the international correlation
of GDP growth rates. The results of this exercise are reported in figure 4.

   In the version of the model with only productivity shocks, the slope of the line is always negative;
a higher degree of banking integration leads to less correlated output cycles. This result is consistent
with our regression estimates in tables 2 and 3, where we found that during tranquil, “non-crisis”
periods, increases in cross-border banking linkages are followed by more divergent output growth
rates.

   In the version of the model with both productivity and banking shocks the association between
financial integration and output synchronization is initially positively sloped and then declining.
This suggests that, in times when output fluctuations are driven by both types of shocks, the
overall effect of banking integration on output co-movement is ambiguous. Notice, however, that

the difference between the lines of the model with both shocks and the model only with productivity
shocks is always positive and increasing. This is in line with the results in tables 2 − 5 showing
that the marginal effect of banking integration on output co-movement in crisis times is positive.


   Regressions in model and data To make the link between the theoretical model and the
empirical results tighter, we use artificial data generated by the model to run a similar regression
to the one we run in the empirical part of the paper. In particular we simulate the model for ten
couples of countries, varying the banking integration parameter (λ) smoothly from 0 to 1. For each
pair of countries we simulate the model for 200 periods (quarter), allowing only for productivity
shocks (tranquil times) and allowing for both productivity shocks and banking shocks (crises times).
We then construct the same measure of GDP synchronization we used in the data analysis (table
3) above and then regress it on the log of financial integration (log of λ), on a dummy for crisis
times and on an interaction between crisis times and log of financial integration. Column (1) in
table 8 reports the results.

   When we run the regression on simulated data from the model, we find that (i) overall a higher



                                                                                                   35
degree of financial integration leads to lower level of output synchronization, as reflected in an
integration coefficient of -0.35 and (ii) that the coefficient on the interaction term between financial
integration and the crisis dummy is positive, suggesting a positive marginal effect of integration,
that is in times of crisis (i.e. in periods where banking shocks are important) more integration
induces more co-movement. For comparison in table 8 we also report the coefficients on the same
regression using actual data. In particular in columns 2 through 4 we report specifications (1), (2)
and (3) from table 3. The comparison between coefficients in the first column and the coefficients in
the other columns suggest that the relation between financial integration and output co-movement
implied by our model is statistically close to the one we estimate in the data.

   Summary       There are two main lessons from the theory. First in the model there is a causal,
structural link from banking integration to business cycle co-movement. This link manifests itself
in estimated regression coefficients that relate international output correlations to cross-border
financial integration, both in normal and in crises times. The regression coefficients estimated on
artificial data from the model are statistically close to the ones estimated on actual data. Although
this does not formally prove that financial integration is indeed a causal driver of international
business cycle correlation, it shows that this hypothesis is entirely consistent with the data patterns
revealed in Section 3.

   The second lesson from the theory is learned by noting that the key ingredient needed in the
model to weaken (as it did during the period 2007 − 2009) the negative link between financial
integration and correlation is the presence of credit shocks to globally operating banks. This leads
us quite naturally to conclude that indeed large credit shocks to financial intermediaries could have
been the underlying source of the global contraction in economic activity that took place during
the 2007 − 2009 global crisis.

                                                  36
6    Conclusion

We study the role of global banks in transmitting the recent crisis of 2007 − 2009 from the corner
of the U.S. financial markets to the rest of the developed world from both an empirical and a
theoretical standpoint. In the first part of our analysis we use quarterly data on country-pair
banking linkages from a sample of 20 advanced countries between 1978 and 2009 to examine the
effect of cross-border banking integration on business cycle synchronization. We find that while the
relationship between bilateral banking integration and output synchronization has been historically
negative, it has turned positive during the crisis period of 2007 − 2009. Moreover, we find evidence
consistent with the transmission of the recent crisis from the U.S. to the rest of the industrial
countries through cross-border banking linkages as we find that countries with stronger financial
ties to the U.S. and its main off-shore financial center, the Cayman Islands, experienced more
synchronized cycles with the U.S. during the period 2007 − 2009. We also find a similar association
between banking linkages and output synchronization during previous large financial crisis episodes
in advanced economies, such as the banking crisis in Scandinavian countries in the early 1990s.

    In the second part of our paper we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model of international
banking with both productivity and credit shocks. Our theoretical model includes the standard
mechanism of the workhorse international real business cycle model (e.g. Backus, Kehoe and
Kydland 1992) where financial integration magnifies total-factor-productivity shocks leading to
more divergent output cycles, and the contagion mechanism of recent international macro models
(e.g. Perri and Quadrini 2011; Mendoza and Quadrini 2010) where financial shocks may spread
globally among interconnected economies.

    The model spells a mechanism linking bilateral financial integration with business cycle synchro-
nization and helps interpreting the empirical evidence. The theoretical model shows that exogenous
changes to financial integration can have significant effects on business cycle synchronization; cru-
cially the sign and magnitude of these effects depend on the nature of the structural shocks hitting
the economy. The theory suggests that the fact that during the recent crisis stronger financial
linkages resulted in more synchronized business cycles is an indication that the drivers of the recent
crisis were financial shocks.

    The model finally proposes a simple mechanism through which capital losses to the financial
sector have repercussions on domestic and foreign economic activity. This highlights the importance
of, in terms of future research, the analysis of the effectiveness and desirability of policies geared
toward reducing capital losses of the financial/banking sector, like the 2008 bailout. Our study could


                                                 37
also shed light on the path of intra-Europe (Germany v/s countries of the European south) and
U.S.-Europe divergence that has manifested after the 2007 − 2009 crisis. Our approach implies that
the increased degree of financial integration during the last few decades has resulted in divergent
output cycles within Europe and between Europe and the U.S. until the major credit shock hit the
U.S. Although the U.S. and the European countries moved together during 2007-2009 as a result
of this dominant credit shock as opposed to before, they have continued drifting apart since then,
given the absence of further credit shocks.
