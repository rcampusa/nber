       We argue that management sells assets when doing so provides the cheapest funds to
pursue its objectives rather than for operating efficiency reasons alone. This hypothesis suggests
that (1) firms selling assets have high leverage and/or poor performance, (2) a successful asset
sale is good news and (3) the stock market discounts asset sale proceeds retained by the selling
firm. In support of this hypothesis, we find that the typical firm in our sample performs poorly
before the saie and that the average stock-price reaction to asset sales is positive only
                                                                                     the when

proceeds are paid out.

 1. Introduction.

         Existing empirical evidence shows that asset sale announcements are associated with

 positive stock-price reactions. Alexander, Benson and Kampmeyer (1984), Hue, Owers and

Rogers (1987) and Jam (1985) document significant average abnormal returns between 0.5% and

1.66%. A theory advanced in the literature to explain this empirical evidence, most explicitly by

Hite, Owers and Rogers (1987), is that asset sales promote efficiency by allocating assets to

better uses and sellers capture some of the resulting gains. With this view, which we call the

efficient deployment hypothesis of asset sales, firms only manage assets for which they have a

comparative advantage and sell assets as soon as another firm can manage them more

efficiently.

         In this paper, we provide empirical results inconsistent with the efficient deployment

hypothesis and advance an alternative explanation for asset sales consistent with our new results.

First, we show that firms selling assetstend to be poor performers and/or have high leverage. In

particular, for our sample, median net income normalized by total assets is insignificantly different

from zero in the year before the sale, even though we exclude from the sample bankrupt finns

and firms in default. This result suggests that the typical firm selling assets is motivated to do

so by its financial trouble rather than by the discovery that some other firm has a comparative

advantage in operating the assets. Second, contrary to the efficient deployment hypothesis, we

find that the stock-price reaction to successful asset sales is strongly related to the use ol the

proceeds. In our sample, the stock-price reaction to asset sales is positive for those firms

expected to use the proceeds to pay down debt but negative and insignificant for firms which are

expected to keep the proceeds within the firm.

       We argue that our results are inconsistent with the efficient deployment hypothesis

because asset sales are undertaken by management which pursues self-serving objectives and


                                                 1
  views asset sales as a source of funds. We call this alternative hypothesis the financing

  hypothesis of asset sales and show that it is supported by our empirical results. If management

  values firm size, diversification or its reputation, one expects it to be reluctant to sell assets for

 efficiency reasons alone.' For such management, a more compelling motivation to sell assets is

 that asset sales provide funds when alternative sources of financing are too expensive,possibly

 because of agency costs of debt or because information asymmetries make equity sales

 unattractive. With this view, the completion of an asset sale is good news about the value of the

 asset because if the value of the asset had turned out to be low, the sale would not have taken

 place. Moreover, when agency costs of managerial discretion are high, one expects the market

 to discount proceeds of asset sales retained by the firm.

        Section 2 provides a theoretical analysis of the information content of asset sales. Section

 3 presents our sample of large asset sales and reports the characteristics of the firms in our

 sample. Section 4 shows that abnormal returns associated with asset sale announcements differ

 substantially between firms that have performed poorly and use the proceeds to repay debt and
those that do not. Section 5 uses cross-sectional regressions to explore the robustness of our

main results. Concluding remarks are presented in section 6.



SectIon 2. The Information content of asset sales.

       Part 2.1 discusses the information content of asset sales in the absence of agency costs.

Part 2.2 presents the financing hypothesis. Finally, part 2.3 collects our testable hypotheses and

relates them to the existing empirical evidenceon asset sales.




    Boot (1992) and Weisbach (1993) argue that management postpones asset sales because
abandoning an unsuccessful strategy impacts the market's assessment of managers' ability.
Weisbach (1993) shows that divestitures are concentrated around management changes.

                                                 2
 2.1. The efficient deployment hypothesis.

         We assume in this subsection that: (Al) management maximizes shareholder wealth, (A2)

 the transaction costs of selling assets are greater than those of issuing new securities, and (A3)

 low risk debt financing is available. tMth these assumptions, management sells an asset if the

 price the purchaser is willing to pay exceeds the asset's value in its current use. A firm may learn

 over time that it is not well-suited to operate an asset and seek to sell it or some other firm may

find out that it could operate the asset more profitably and attempt to buy it.

        With our assumptions, an asset sale announcement has a positive stock-price reaction

if, before the announcement, the market has an unbiased estimate of the asset's value in its

current use and investors are surprised by the announcement that the asset is worth more to

somebody else. The stock-price reaction for a spedruc sale could be negative because the market

is disappointed with the price fetched by the asset. If investors know that the finn is trying to sell

an asset, however, the expected stock-price reaction is zero if the market's expectation of the sale

price is unbiased, If a firm knows that other firms can obtain greater cash flows from an asset and

the market for assets is competitive, it will sell the asset even if it finds out that the asset is worth

less than expected because the asset is nevertheless worth more outside the firm. Finally, with

the efficient deployment view, the use of the proceeds does not matter unless it conveys

information about the availability of positive NPV projects. In this case, retention of the proceeds

is good news because management which maximizes shareholder wealth would pay out the

proceeds if it did not have positive NPV projects available.



2.2. The financIng hypothesis.

       We now consider the case where a firm is trying to raise funds to pursue managerial

objectives which need not be consistent with shareholder wealth maximization. We assume that


                                                  3
 the firm cannot sell low risk debt because it has high leverage and/or poor performance.

 Outsiders know that the fimi wants to raise funds. Such a firm may find it expensive to use the

 capital markets for at least three reasons. First, it may face the underinvestment problem

 described by Myers (1977) or the asset substitution problem analyzed by Jensen and Meckling

 (1976). Second, raising outside funds may be costly because of the adverse selection costs

 modeled by Myers and MajIuf (1984). Third, the cost of outside funds may be high because of

 agency costs of managerial discretion. In particular, if management may use funds to pursue

 objectives of doubtful value to capital providers, they require a higher promised rate of return or

 restrictions on the use of funds.

        For management, asset sales may provide a source of funds preferable to capital markets

 even with high transaction costs. First, informational asymmetfles may be less important for the

asset the firm wants to sell than for the firm as a whole. Second, selling an asset may avoid the

recapitalization costs that would have to be paid to raise funds on capital markets if the debt

overhang is large. Third, if management pursues its own objectives, selling an asset provides

kinds with potentially fewer restrictions on managerial discretion.

        If a firm sets out to sell an asset to obtain cheaper funds than on capital markets, it may

fail. With uncertainty about the asset's value to outsiders, the sale price the firm can obtain after

shopping the asset may be too low to justify selling it. This could be because the asset is worth

too little to outsiders relative to its value in its current use. Alternatively, as emphasized by

Shleiler and Vishny (1992), the market for an asset may not be liquid1 so that a quick asset sale

may require a large discount. 1-lence, if the firm succeeds In selling the asset at a price which

makes the transaction worthwhile, this is good news about the asseEs value even if it is known

that the firm wants to sell the asset. This is in contrast to the efficient deployment view where

planned sales always take place and hence their completion conveys no news on average.


                                                4
         If the intended use of the proceeds is a positive NPV project for the shareholders and iF

 the firm does not have a more advantageous source or funds, a successful asset sale means that

the firm can carry out the positive NPV project with the cheapest funds. For a rum in distress, this

project might be to pay back debt to avoid default. Alternatively, For a firm suffering from the

undednvestment problem, it may mean taking advantage of a valuable Investment opportunity.

Hence1 For firms with good projects for which an asset sale offers the cheapest financing, the

announcement of a successful asset sale is good news about the ability of the firm to invest.

        For some firms, however, the proceeds from the sale could be put to uses that do not

increase shareholder wealth. In this case, the good news about the value of the asset sold is

tempered or negated by the market's expectation that some of the proceeds will be wasted by

management. For instance, a finn with core operations that suffer massive losses and should be

changed dramatically may sell assets to finance these losses to avoid making necessary

changes. Hence, for firms where agency costs of managerial discretion are important, the stock

market views asset sales where the proceeds are paid out to debtholders or shareholders more

favorably than those where the proceeds are kept within the finn.

        So far, we have assumed that the stock market knows that management lacks funds to

pursue its objectives. If this is not the case, the first announcement concerning an asset sale can

convey information about the firm's financial health. This effect is similar to the one discussed by

Miller and Rock (1985) for the case where a firm sells securities. In this case, since the firm would

not be raising funds if its earnings were higher or if it could get attractive terms on financial

markets, the first announcement regarding an asset sale provides negative information about the

firm's financial situation unless it is accompanied by news about valuable investment opportuni-

ties.




                                                 5
 2.3. Testable hypotheses.

         We can summarize our hypotheses and their empirical implications as follows:

         1. Efficient deployment hypothesis. a) Unanticipated asset sales improve shareholder

 wealth on average. b) Proceeds retained by the fum are discounted by the stock market.

         2. FInancIng hypothesis. a) Firms sell assets when doing so Is the cheapest source oF

 funds given managemenrs objectives. In particular, asset sales take place for firms that cannot

 raise funds cheaply on capital markets. e.g.. highly levered andior poorly performing firms. b)

 Successful asset sales convey good news about the value of the assets sold. c) With significant

 agency costs of financial discretion, the market discounts the proceeds from asset sales retained

by the firm. With the financing hypothesis, a potential confounding effect is that the asset sale

may reveal information about the financial situation of the firm or about investment opportunities.

         The financing hypothesis has no implications about the relative efficiency of the buyer and

the seller in operating the asset sold. Hence, it does not preclude that the asset sold goes to a

user with a comparative advantage in operating it. With the efficient deployment view, however,

management always compares the productivity or assets under its control to the productivity the

assets would have if sold and sells an asset whenever it loses its comparative advantage in

operating it. Hence, management's reluctance to sell assets (see Boot (1992) and Weisbach

(1993)) is evidence against the efficient deployment view. Wth the financing hypothesis,

management is pushed to sell assets by the firm's financial situation. Assets are not sold for

efficiency reasons alone, so that managers of some firms keep assets for which the firms have

no comparative advantage and make no attempt at selling them as long as the firm's financial

situation is good enough. Obviously, in some cases, the firm's financial situation Is such that it

becomes an attractive takeover target, which leads management to sell assets it operates

inefficiently so that it can retain its position.

        With the efficient deployment view, the use of the proceeds should not matter. In contrast,

with the financing view, proceeds paid out to debtholders or shareholders are valued more if

agency costs of managerial discretion are significant. The only empirical evidence we know of that

distinguishes among uses of proceeds is provided by Brown, James and Mooradian (1993) and

Meyers and Singh (1993). Brown, James and Mooradian (1993) focus on a sample of finns in

severe distress, most of them in default. They find that asset sales where the proceeds are used

to pay back creditors affect shareholders adversely, indicating that, for firms In default, asset sales

are made to benefit creditors rather than shareholders.

       Meyers and Singh (1993) look at announcements of asset sale programs as well as at

announcements of completed asset sales. When a firm announces that it Intends to sell assets,

there is lithe or no infon'nation released about the sale price of assets. Hence, outsiders mostly

learn that the firm wants to raise funds and the proposed use of the funds. Mayers and Singh

(1993) find that the proposed information is important to the stock market. They find a large

positive stock-price reaction when the firm announces that it intends to use the proceeds to

finance a stock repurchase; a positive significant announcement effect when the firm intends to

re-invest the proceeds and a negative effect when the firm intends to repay debt The magnitudes

of the effects they observe seem to be similar to the stock-price reaction one would observe if

these announcements were not accompanied by the announcement of asset sale programs: stock

repurchase announcements have large positive effects, announcements of investments have

small positive effects, and announcements of leverage decreases have small negative effects.2

At the time of the completion of the sale, the market learns only that the sales price is large

enough for the sale to succeed since the firm announced earlier the Intended use of the

                                                   7
  proceeds. One would therefore expect the sales announcement effect to be positive when firms

  announce the completion of an asset sale, which is what they find.



 Section 3. CharacteristIcs or large asset sales and of the fIrms that make them.
 Section 3.1. The sample.

         In this paper, we investigate asset sales reported to the SEC in BK forms as identified

 through the NEXIS database.3 NEXIS reports all 8K filings from October 1988 but only selected

 abstracts are included from 1985 through October 1988. The UK form requires that theregistrant

 furnish specific information if it or "any of its majority-owned subsidiaries hasacquired or disposed

 or a significant amount of assets, otherwise than in the ordinary course of business." Hence, asset

 sales reported in BK loans are ideally suited to address the issues raised in thispaper since the

 firm deems the sale to be both significant and unanticipated.

        We identity 151 asset sales taking place from 1984 to 1989 for firms for which data is

available on the Compustat files. We want to study voluntary asset sales and therefore eliminate

firms that are in default, in a corporate control contest, in voluntary or involuntary liquidation or

have filed for reorganization under Chapter 11. Further, we omit all asset sales of less than $ I

million. Finally, we eliminate all firms for which stock returns could not be found on the CRSP files

for NYSE and AMEX stocks. Of the 151 asset sales, 93 sales made by 77 firms satisfy our

additional criteria. The Appendix provides detailed information on each sale in our sample; the

reader can refer to this appendix when we mention specific sales in our discussion. The average

number of asset sales per year (15.3) in our sample is substantially smaller than in the Jam

(1985) sample, but substantially larger than in the Alexander, Benson and Kampmeyer (198.4) and

Hit., Owers and Rogers (1987) samples. We use as the announcement date the eatiiest of the


   'The NEXIS search used the key words "asset' within 10 words of "sale" and "divestitures?

                                                8
following three dates: (1) the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) announcement date (44 cases); (2) the

Dow Jones News Retileval Service announcement date (25 cases); (3) the agreement date as

reported by the 8K filing (24 cases).

       Since we are interested in the differences between firms expected to pay out the proceeds

and those that are not, we use information From the 8K filings, annual reports, the S&P Standard

Stock Reports and the WSJ to determine why the asset was sold and how management expects

to use the proceeds. The sample has 40 asset sales by 35 firms with proceeds paid out to

creditors and/or shareholders and 53 sales by 43 firms (one firm makes one sale of each type)

with proceeds retained by the firm. We call this sample 0(40 sales the "payout sample." and the

sample of 53 sales the "re-invest" sample throughout the paper. For 22 asset sales by 18 firms

where the proceeds are paid out, information about the use of the proceeds is given by the 6K

filing or the press articles contemporaneous with the announcement Of these 22 sales, there are

12 cases where the source for the announcement date is the WSJ or the Dow-Jones Wire and

the use of funds is given in the WSJ and 4 cases where the announcement date is the date of

the 8K filing and the 8K form gives the use of funds. Though we generally focus on the 40 asset

sales where the proceeds are paid out, we report confirming abnormal returns evidence for these

16 sales in table 5 since they correspond to our cleanest subsample where investors learn

simultaneously about the sale and the use of the proceeds. For the other 18 asset sales where

the proceeds are paid out, our sources describing the use of funds are not contemporaneous with

the sale announcement. These sources are the annual report (12 times), an 8K filing subsequent

to the announcement date (4 times) or the S&P Standard Stock Reports (2 times).

       In general, we rely on the full sample of firms paying out the proceeds because we

presume that investors have rational expectations at the time of the asset sale announcement,

in the sense that, on average, they expect the proceeds to be paid out when a subsequent


                                              9
announcement to that effect is made. To the extent that the probability that such a statement will

be made is less than one, the effect of the planned use of the proceeds on the announcement

of the sale is reduced and our tests are len powerful. There is no noticeable difference for the

source of the announcement date between the sample of firms that pay out the proceeds and the

sample of firms that do not. In both samples, roughly 75% of the observations come from the

Dow-Jones Wire and the WSJ. Hence, the difference in the stock-price reactions between the two

samples cannot be attributed to a difference in how investors leam about the event.

        If the financing hypothesis applies to the sales in our sample, one would expect the

proceeds paid out to be used to pay down debt rather than to distribute cash to shareholders. If

a firm is excessively levered in managements eyes, management has a strong motivation to sell

assets to reduce leverage and avoid possible costs of financial distress. In contrast, if most

proceeds were used to pay dividends to shareholders in the absence of pressures from the

market for corporate control, one would view this evidence as consistent with the absence of

agency costs of managerial discretion and supportive of the efficient deployment hypothesis

where management pays out to shareholders funds it cannot invest profitably within the firm. We

have only five cases where there is evidence that management plans to pay some of the

proceeds to shareholders: Allied-Signal, Culbro Corp, Federal Mogul, Koppers Co. and Union

Carbide. Since we have only five observations where shareholders receive some of the proceeds

directly, there is little we can say in this paper about the stock-price reaction difference between

paying the proceeds to shareholders and using the proceeds to pay down debt. Although we

include these observations in the payout sample, the results in this paper do not depend on these

five observations.

       Even though there is no indication that management expects to pay out part of the

proceeds to shareholders, there could still be an indirect connection between asset sales and


                                                10
payouts to shareholders. For instance, management could sell assets to replenish liquid assets

used for repurthases or to repay debt incurred to finance share repurchases; altematively, It could

change its mind about the use of the proceeds after the sale and repuchase shares. A careful

reading of the case histories provided In the appendix shows that the evidence in favor of an

indirect connection is limited. After the sale, only two firms not paying out proceeds. John Fluke

and Varo Inc., announce that they will undertake a stock repurchase. For 10 firms paying out

proceeds, there are repurchase announcements In the year before the sale. Six of these

repurchases are targeted repurthases where the company buys out a major shareholder, which

raises suspicion of entrenchment.

        There is some indication, though, that dividend payments may be affected by asset sales

in our sample. Irrespective of the use of the proceeds, approximately twice as many firms

increase dividends in the year after the sale as they do in the 12 months before the sale (5

relative to 3 for firms that pay out proceeds and 11 relative to 5 for those that do not). Two firms

that pay out the proceeds decrease dividends in the 12 months before the sale and one in the

following 12 months; in contrast. 3 firms that retain the proceeds reduce dividends in the year

before the sale and one in the year following.

       In our sample. finns provide a number of different reasons for selling assets. In some

cases, they sell assets explicitly to reduce debt. In other cases, they give other reasons to sell

assets but still pay out the proceeds. If a firm sells an asset and pays out the proceeds, though,

the asset sale typically reduces the finn's diversification and If the asset is an unrelated division

It necessarily does so. Hence, to understand the effect on shareholder wealth of the motivation

of a sale, it is better to focus on the case where the proceeds are retained by the firm so that the

effect is not confounded by the disbursement of proceeds effect. For the 53 sales made by firms

which do not plan to pay out the proceeds, the following reasons to undertake the sales are given


                                                 11
for at least five sales in our sample:

        1. FocusIng on core businesses. For instance, Warner Communications Inc sold

Franklin Mint in 1984 because this business was not part of Its core businesses. In total, we have

15 firms (21 asset sales) where this motivation is prevalent.

        2. SellIng unprofitable or slow-growing businesses. An example of this would be the

sale of United inns inc's car wash business in 1988 for $ 17 million. Thirteen firms (14 asset

sales) fit this explanation.

        3. To finance acquisItions or expansion. Primark Corp soid its TVleasing business for

$ 37.9 million in 1988 to generate cash for a pending acquisition. This explanation seems

appropriate for 6 firms (9 asset sales).

        With the financing hypothesis, asset sales by finns focusing on core operations or selling

unprofitable operations have a different impact on shareholder wealth depending on whether the

proceeds are retained by the finn or not For instance, it could be that a firm chooses to sell

assets to finance losses on core businesses and postpone value-increasing changes in these

businesses, in which case the proceeds of asset sales made to focus on core activities would be

discounted by the stock market Later, we provide evidence that ass!t sales made to focus on

core activities or to shed unprofitable businesses do not significantly Increase shareholder wealth

in our sample when the proceeds are retained by the firm.

       It is noteworthy that many companies seem to sell assets while engaged in a program of

acquisitions so that the asset sales provide cash for these programs, even though management

may motivate the asset sale using different considerations, such as eliminating unprofitable

divisions or focusing on core activities. These cases are certainly consistent with the view that

management might be raising funds to pursue its own objectives. An example of such a sale is

the sale by Canal Capital Corp of its stockyard business for dose to $ 7 million in 1989. The


                                               12
annual report mentions that the stockyard business was not pmfitable but at the same time the

firm had moved (according to its annual report) from a stockyard firm to a diversified firm

interested in real estate development, trading securities and investing in ancient arti



Section 3.2. FIrm characteristics.

        In table I • we provide data on the 93 asset sales and the firms that made them for the full

sample and also on the basis of the use of the proceeds. In the following analysis, we discuss

how the characteristics of firms that pay out the proceeds differ from those of other firms.

Although we report both means and medians, we focus on the medians because the sometimes

large difference between means and medians indicates that the distribution of the variables is not

symmetric and hence the medians are likely to be more informative about the typical sample firm.

The median asset sale in our sample represents 23% of the value of the selling firm's equity.

There is a significant difference (at the 0.01 level) between the median sale proceeds as a

fraction of the equity value for firms that pay out proceeds (42%) and the other firms (13%). We

investigate later whether the difference In abnormal returns between finns that pay out proceeds

and those that do not Is due to differences In the magnitude of the sale relative to equity and find

that this is not the case. The difference in the size of the sale relative to equity Is partly due to

the fact that the median market value of equity for the firms that retain the proceeds is higher than

for the firms that do not. There is no significant difference, however, between the median book

values of total assets of the two groups of firms. Finally, we report the average accounting gain

or loss on sale, which turns out to be small for the typical firm irrespective of the use of the

proceeds.

       Finns in the payout sample have a lower average and median interest coverage ratio than

firms in the re-invest sample. The median coverage ratio of firms that pay out the proceeds Is

1.56, indicating that for the typical firm earnings exceed interest payments by 56%. In contrast,

the median coverage ratio for the other firms exceeds 3. Hence, the typical firm paying out the

proceeds is dose to being unable to pay interest out of earnings. This suggests that firms paying

down debt may have a powerful motivation to sell assets, providing evidence consistent with the

financing hypothesis.

       For the whole sample, the average ratio of the sum of short-term and long-term debt to

the book value of total assets, 0.31, is larger than the average ratio reported in Bernanke and

Campbeli (1988) for the 1986 universe of Compustat firms (0.28), providing some evidence that

our sample firms have above-average leverage. Using the ratio of the book value of long-term

debt to the book value of total assets, there is no difference between the firms that intend to pay

                                                 15
 out the proceeds and the others using the median lest. There is also no evidence that firms

 paying out the proceeds have significantly more short-term debt or short-term liabilities. However,

 the ratio of short-term and long-term debt to total assets is significantly higher for firms that pay

 out the proceeds for the mean and the median.

        The firms in the sample perform poorly before the sale. Their average net income is

 negative and their median net income is trivially small. Their cumulative net of market return over

 the preceding year is negative. Finally, their Tobin's q is low. Moreover, the performance of firms

 paying out the proceeds Is significantly worse than the performance of the other firms at the 0.05

level when measured by net income to total assets. In addition, the firms that pay out proceeds

typically lose money in the year before the sale. Cumulative net of market returns for the year

prior to the sale are also lower for these firms at the 0.05 level. Finally, the firms in the payout

sample have a significantly lower Tobin's q ratio indicating that the firms that retain the proceeds

have better investment opportunities. For the firms in the re-invest sample, median net income

divided by total assets is extremely small and median cumulative net of market returns are

positive. Median q is below one for these firms.

       Though asset sales by firms in distress have been studied in a number of papers recently

(Asquith, Gertner and Scharfstein (1991), Brown, James and Mooradian (1993) and Ofek (1994)).

it is important to note that the firms in our sample were not selected because of distress or poor

performance. Further, as explained earlier, we removed from the sample those firms that were

bankrupt at the time of the asset sale announcement. Only one firm files a Chapter 11 petition

lithe year following the asset sale. Seven firms defaulted on their loans or restructured their debt

lithe year before the sale; four of these firms paid down debt from the proceeds. Two firms

renegotiated loans in the year before the sale and these two firms paid down debt with the

proceeds. Two firms defaulted after the sale and both used the proceeds to pay down debt.


                                                16
Hence, the typical sale in our sample is not undertaken to cure a default or as part of a workout.

The median firm is. however, a poor performer whose net Income is just about zero and whose

stock price is not keeping up with the market.

           There is some weak evidence that being a takeover target makes it more likely that a firm

will pay out the proceeds of an asset sale. In the 12 months preceding the asset sale, there is

evidence of takeover activity for g firms and 5 of these firms paid out the proceeds of the asset

sale. Further, there is evidence of takeover activity for 5 firms following the sale and 3 of these

paid out the proceeds.

          One question of importance given our theoretical analysis is whether managers that sell

assets and retain the proceeds have fewer incentives to maximize shareholder wealth. Table 1

reports average managerial ownership for the firms that retain the proceeds and for the ones that

do not. Managerial ownership is significantly higher for finns that pay out the proceeds, so that

agency problems may be smaller in these firms because it is more costly for management to

pursue its objectives. Because of the difference in the market value of equity between firms that

repay debt and those that do not, it turns out that, although managers own a larger fraction of

shares in firms that repay debt, their dollar stake is smaller.



Section 4. The stock-prIce reaction of asset sales.

          To measure stock-price reactions to asset sales, we estimate the market model from 250

to 50 days before the announcement. Table 2 reports the stock-price reactions for the full sample

and also on the basis of the use of the proceeds. Our finding for the full sample of significantly

positive cumulative returns (1.41%) for days -1 and 0 is comparable to the findings in the earlier

papers.

          The stock-price reaction differs significantly between sales in the payout sample and sales

in the re-invest sample. Though those firms that pay out the proceeds experience a significant

increase in value, the announcement of asset sales in the re-invest sample has little valuation

effect on the firms in our sample, except on day -2 where there is a significant positive effect for

these firms. To make sure that our conclusions are robust to taking into account this effect on day

-2, we later make sure that they also hold when we use cumulative returns for the period from

day -5 to day +5.        -


       The significantly higher announcement effect for sales in the payout sample is consistent

with the existence of significant agencycosts of managerial discretion. However, the interpretation

of the results of table 2 is rendered more difficult by the fact that firms in the payout sample

typically have poorer performance than the firms in the re-invest sample. Hence, the result in

table 2 might reflect that firms that perform poorly and sell assets have a positive stock-price

reaction irrespective of the use of the proceeds. This would be the case If for such firms, any

asset sale reduces the casts of financial distress. In this case, the results of table 2 would not be

supportive of the role of agency costs of managerial discretion for the use of the proceeds. To

investigate this, table 3 provides mean and median cumulative abnormal returns for various

subsamples of asset sales. This table confirms that the mean and median cumulative average

abnormal return for the payout sample are significantly higher than for the re-invest sample.

       In all subsamples in table 3, the cumulative average return Is higher for the firms that have

some prior evidence of poor performance or financial difficulties than for the other firms. However,

for the traditional window of days -1 and 0, the difference in cumulative average returns between

the firms that have prior evidence of poor performance or financial difficulties and the other firms

is never significant (except barely so at the 0.10 level for firms that have negative news in the

WSJ). For the longer window of days -5 to +5, the mean average abnormal return is significantly

higher for firms whose WSJ announcement includes negative news, for finns with negative net

income for the year before the sale and for firms with negative cumulative net of market returns

for the year before the sale. Firms with coverage ratios lower than the sample median have

cumulative abnormal returns insignificantly different from firms with higher coverage ratios. There

is therefore no dear indication from table 3 that the higher abnormal returns of firms paying out

the proceeds are due to the fact that these firms have had greater difficulties or exhibit poorer

performance than the other firms.

       Table 3 shows that there is substantial overlap between the firms that pay out the

proceeds and those that exhibit poor performance and/or financial difficulties. This overlap does

not affect the intepretation of the results for the shorter window since there the only way to split


                                                21
the sample to obtain a significant difference between abnormal returns is to divide the sample

according to the use of the proceeds. However, for the longer window, other ways of dividing the

data yield significant differences in abnormal returns. To understand better the impact of firm

performance and use of the proceeds on the stock-price reaction, we divide the sample into four

mutually exclusive groups in table 4. We define as poor performers firms with negative net of

market cumulative returns the previous year. negative net income over the previous year and/or

a WSJ sales announcement that provides some evidence of difficulties, such as negative

earnings. For the 1 1-day window, asset sales have a significant positive average stock-price

reaction only for poorly performing firms in the payout sample. This stock-price reaction is

significantly different from the other three subsamples. The same conclusion holds with the 2-day

window, except that firms paying out the proceeds and not performing poorly have a positive

significant stock-price reaction that is significandy lower than the poorly performing firms that pay

out the proceeds. Given that there are only 7 firms that pay out the proceeds and are not

performing poorly. such a result has to be interpreted with caution.

       Poorly performing firms that retain the proceeds have insignificant abnormal retums on

average. Hence, the positive abnormal returns in our sample are not driven by the financial health

of firms but by the use of the proceeds. The firms in our sample that neither repay debt nor

perform poorly experience insignificant abnormal returns. The results from our sample are

inconsistent with the view that positive abnormal returns of asset sales result solely from man-

agements decision to reallocate corporate resources towards better uses within the corporation.

Instead, our evidence suggests that asset sales where the proceeds are paid out rather than used

to increase liquid assets under managerial control increase shareholder wealth. This evidence

supports the view that agency costs of managerial discretion affect the stock-price reaction to

asset sales.

A concern with table 4 is that the sample of poocly performing firms inthe payout sample might

be dominated by firms that are facing immediate financial difficulties, so that the positive average

abnormal return reflects the ability of these firms to sell assets successfully and hence reduce

their financial difficulties. To investigate this possibility, we divided the sample into firms with a

coverage ratio (EBIT divided by interest payments) above the sample median and firms with a

coverage ratio below the sample median. We then compared stock-price reactions for firms with

a coverage ratio below the sample median in the payout sample and those in the re-invest

sample. We found that the 18 asset sales by firms with below-median coverage ratios in the re-

invest sample have an insignificant abnormal return that is significantly lower than the stock-price


                                                 23
reaction for firms with below-median coverage ratios in the payout sample. Since the abnormal

returns for firms that pay out the proceeds do not differ between firms with above and below-

median coverage ratios, it is unlikely that the relation between abnormal returns and the use of

the proceeds depends on the selling firm's financial situation.

        In table 5, we provide results for additional subsamples of interest. First, we show the

average and median abnormal returns for the sale announcements where the source for the use

of the proceeds is similar to the source for the announcement. This sample comprises sales

where the announcement is in the Dow-Jones wire or the WSJ with a WSJ stoiy that has the use

of the proceeds and where the announcement date is the agreement date from the 8K filing with

the use of the proceeds described in the BK. These 16 observations have slightly higher mean

and median returns than the 40 observations, but the z-statistic is lower and the p-value of the

sign-rank test is higher for the 16 observations than for the 40 observations, possibly because

of the smaller number of observations. Second, we show that, among the firms that do not pay

out the proceeds, there is no evidence that there are subsamples of sales with average or median

abnormal returns comparable to those of firms that pay out the proceeds when one focuses on

the shorter window. For the longer window, there is no case where the z-statistic is significant

when the firm does not pay out the proceeds, but the magnitude of the abnormal retums is fairly

high in the case of the firms that sell an unprofitable division and retain the proceeds. In contrast,

fims that sell assets to focus more on core operations but do not pay out the proceeds have very

small abnormal returns in absolute value and for the short windows both average and median

abnormal returns are negative.

5.1. RelatIve proceeds and stock-price reactIon.

      The efficient deployment view of asset sales does not distinguish between poorly

performing firms paying out asset sales proceeds and other firms selling assets. Since we


                                              25
 document in this paper a sharp difference in the stock-price reaction between these firms, can

 our evidence be reconciled with the efficient deployment view? Our evidence in table 1 shows

 that firms paying out the proceeds have a significantly greater ratio of asset sale proceeds to the

 market value of their equity. Hence, if the seller's gain from selling an asset, i.e.. the premium the

 bidder pays for the asset in excess of the assets value when used by the seller, expressed as

 a percentage of the proceeds, is the same irrespective of the firm that sells the asset, one would

 expect a larger stock-price reaction for firms that pay out the proceeds. This argument suggests

that the distinction we rind could be due to the size of the proceeds relative to equity. However,

as evidenced by regressions I and 2 of table 8. there is a significant relation between the stock-

price reaction and the proceeds divided by the market value of equity, but this relation does not

explain the higher average abnormal return of the payout sample.1 Regression I is consistent with

the argument of Shleifer and Vishny (1992) that, given the illiquidity of the market for asset sales,

large asset sales are more likely to fail. This is because, in this case, their success is better news

than the success of small asset sales.

        The literature on security issues generally emphasizes that they convey information to

markets about the value of the issuing finn's securities or its assets; to the extent that asset sales

are altematives to security issues, they could also reveal information about the value of the firm's

securities or assets. This does not seem to be the case in our sample, though. This is because,

if outsiders learn about the firm's demand for funds through the asset sale, a greater demand for

funds would be bad news and the abnormal return would be negatively related to the size of the

asset sale. It is interesting to note that the positive relation between abnormal returns and the size

of the proceeds is the opposite or that obtained in the literature on equity issues, since in that



     All regressions of table 6 are estimated using weighted least squares, where the weight is
the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the residual of the marketmodel regression.

issue.'



5.2. Abnormal returns and performance: A multivarlate perspective.

          We investigated in section 4 the extent to which the difference in abnormal returns can

be explained by the fact that a successful asset sale is more important for the firms that pay out

the proceeds because these firms are in a poor financial situation and would face significant costs

of financial distress without the successful sale. in that section, dividing the sample according to

recent performance or the extent of financial difficulties does not lead to significant differences

between subsamples for the shorter event window, but does so for the longer event window. It

could be that our classification of firms as poorly performing or better performing firms does not

capture a relation between performance and stock-price reactions that could be captured by

regressing stock-price reactions on levels of performance measures. To investigate this, we relate

abnormal returns to net income, net of market stock returns for the past 250 days and the debt-

asset ratio In regressions 3 and 4.

          The regression estimates in table 5 confirm the earlier results that the higher abnormal

return of finns using asset sale proceeds to repay debt cannot be explained by these firms having

poorer performance or a more precarious financial situation. Whereas past stock returns are

correlated with abnormal returns for the longer window, this effect does not explain why firms that

repay debt have higher abnormal returns since the dummy variable that takes value one for the

firms that pay out the proceeds is significant for both windows. Further, regressing abnormal

returns on past performance could lead to significant results when abnormal returns are estimated




      See Korajczyk, Lucas and McDonald (1990) for a review of the evidence on the
determinants of the stock-price reaction to equity issues.

                                                28
 from market residuals because the intercept of the market model estimates depends on past

 performance.

         Regressions 5 and 6 relate abnormal returns to net-of-market cumulative returns for the

 past 250 days, Tobin's q and managerial ownership. The financing hypothesis implies that there

 should be a ne9ative relation between the stock-price reaction and the degree of agency costs.

 We would expect abnormal returns to be higher for firms with higher managerial ownership

 (provided that management is not using its control of voting rights for entrenchment purposes).

 One would expect high q firms to have lower agency costs of managerial discretion, so that the

 stock market would discount sales proceeds less for these firms. For the shorter window, these

 variables have no explanatory power whatsoever. For the longer window, these variables make

 the dummy variable for the use of the proceeds Insignificant This is because theyare correlated

with the use of the proceeds. In a logistic regression not reported here, we find that firms with low

managerial ownership or high q are significantly more likely to retain the proceeds, so that

introducing these variables in the regression makes it more difficult to estimate the coefficient on

the use of the proceeds precisely.



Section 6. ConcludIng remarks.

       In this paper, we have shown that for a sample of large asset sales the stock-price

reaction is significantly positive only for those firms that plan to pay out the proceeds to

claimholders. This evidence Is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the market reacts favorably

to asset sales simply because they lead to more efficient use of assets and the selling firm

captures some of the benefit from the increased efficiency.

       Our evidence is consistent with what we call the financing hypothesis. th this
hypothesis, management sells assets to obtain funds to pursue its objectives when altemative


                                               29
 funding is either too expensive given its objectives or unavailable. On average. finns benefit from

 announcing successful sales because a successful sale means that the firm received enough

 money to make the sale worthwhile. Further, proceeds are discounted when retained by the

 selling firm because of agency costs of managerial discretion. In our sample, firms selling assets

 typically are poor performers and they are more likely to pay out the proceeds when they find it

difficult to service their debt. The average stock-pdce reaction to asset sales is positive and it is

significantly higher for firms that pay out the proceeds. We do not, however, find a direct link

between abnormal returns and proxies for agency costs of managerial discretion.

        This paper raises some questions which should be addressed in further research. We do

not explore why managers might be reluctant to sell assets. Is it that managers do not want to

acknowledge failure or is it that complex organizations cannot change easily because of inn-firm

relationships and quid pro quos? Though we are convinced that our evidence demonstrates the

relevance of the financing hypothesis, it is also dear from our analysis and from our empirical

results that the information conveyed by asset sales is difficult to evaluate because asset sales

convey news about the value of the asset sold, the intended use of the proceeds and, possibly,

the firm's financial health. Larger samples of possibly less significant asset sales might offer a

way to disentangle these various effects with more precision and provide useful information on

the relative importance of the financing hypothesis and of the efficient deployment hypothesis.

In our analysis, we have not distinguished between payouts to shareholders and to debtholders.

The market for corporate control could force managers to sell assets for which they do not have

a comparative advantage and to pay out the proceeds to shareholders. Further research should

therefore investigate the extent to which asset sales are the result of pressures from the market

for corporate control.

       In conclusion, our sample suggests that the efficient deployment hypothesis is not as


                                                30
useful as prior studies might have suggested. Perhaps one could view our evidence as showing

that firms seem more aware of their comparative advantage when they are short of funds than

otherwise. If this is the case, though, it provides further support for the view that the agency costs

of managerial discretion matter and that debt plays a useful role in disciplining management.'
