                                             ABSTRACT

Even as research has begun to document that teachers matter, there is less certainty about what attributes
of teachers make the most difference in raising student achievement. Numerous studies have estimated
the relationship between teachers' characteristics, such as work experience and academic performance,
and their value-added to student achievement; but, few have explored whether instructional practices
predict student test score gains. In this study, we ask what classroom practices, if any, differentiate
teachers with high impact on student achievement in middle school English Language Arts from those
with lower impact. In so doing, the study also explores to what extent value-added measures signal
differences in instructional quality. Even with the small sample used in our analysis, we find consistent
evidence that high value-added teachers have a different profile of instructional practices than do low
value-added teachers. Teachers in the fourth (top) quartile according to value-added scores score higher
than second-quartile teachers on all 16 elements of instruction that we measured, and the differences
are statistically significant for a subset of practices including explicit strategy instruction.

       Even as research has begun to document that teachers matter, there is less certainty about
what attributes of teachers actually make the most difference in raising student achievement.
Our own work and the work of others suggest that differences in teacher preparation may
account for some of these differences, particularly in the first year of teaching, while other work
identifies teacher attributes, including certification, the selectivity of teachers’ undergraduate
institutions, and teachers’ scores on tests of general knowledge and verbal ability as factors that
may be related to student achievement gains (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff,
2009; Kane, Rockoff, &Staiger, 2005; see Rice, 2003 for a review). The emphasis on teacher
characteristics and preparation, however, obscures the importance of instruction within the
classroom. Teachers’ classroom practices are likely to be the mechanism by which teachers
affect students. In addition, even if certain teacher attributes make a difference, such as having
attended a more selective college, such findings may have limited utility for policy makers and
teacher educators. Identifying classroom practices associated with high student achievement
gains, and then targeting these practices in teacher education and professional development,
provides a potential avenue for improving the quality of instruction for all students.
       While our first goal is to identify those elements of instruction that lead to improvement
in student learning, we are equally interested in assessing whether value-added measures capture
instructional differences among teachers. Measures of value-added to student test score gains are
becoming more and more common tools for measuring teacher effectiveness (c. f. Sanders &
Rivers, 1996; Rivkin, Hanushek and Kain, 2005; Rockoff, 2004). Yet, researchers have debated
the validity of these measures, questioning whether value-added measures reflect the
characteristics of the students in the classroom more than the contribution of teachers to student
achievement (Rothstein, 2007). This paper describes the pilot study of a larger effort to uncover
the extent to which value-added measures reflect differences in instruction, as well to identify the
classroom practices that are more characteristic of more effective teachers. We focus on middle
school English Language Arts instruction and test performance in New York City. To measure
instruction, we used a structured observation protocol that combines new measures of instruction
with measures that have been used elsewhere (LaParo, Pianta, & Stuhlman, 2004; Pianta et al.,
2006) in addition to collecting additional measures of instruction, including teacher logs and
student work. In what follows we describe the differences in instruction between teachers with
high value-added scores and those with moderately low value-added scores.

                                                                                                      1
       In this study, we built on our earlier work on pathways into teaching and on our data base
on New York City teachers to investigate the classroom practices associated with teachers whose
students make above average gains in English/Language Arts, particularly in more challenging
schools. We ask what classroom practices, if any, differentiate between teachers with high
impact on student achievement in middle school English/Language Arts, as measured through
value-added analyses, from teachers with lower low value-added scores? In addition, this study
explores whether these kinds of value-added analyses represent a reasonable signal for
differences in instructional quality and teacher effectiveness; are value-added measures, in fact,
associated with observable differences in instruction?
       In order to investigate the classroom practices of middle school English/Language Arts
teachers, we also need tools for classroom observation that are able to capture differences in
instruction that might differentiate more effective teachers. In this study, we combined the use
of several dimensions of the CLASS (Pianta, Hamre, Haynes, Mintz, &La Paro, 2006), a widely
used classroom observation system, with a new observation protocol we developed specifically
for secondary English/Language Arts instruction. In this paper, we describe the origins of this
instrument, its elements, and its use in a study of middle school ELA instruction in New York
City. We also discuss the relationship between the practices targeted in our instrument and value-
added assessments of teacher quality. Our goals include both identifying those elements of
instruction associated with improvement in student learning and investigating empirically the
extent to which value-added measures capture differences in instructional quality among
teachers.


Framework for Instructional Interactions in English/Language Arts
       Our study focuses specifically on instruction in English/Language Arts, as there is
growing concern about adolescent literacy in this country. While students in elementary schools
have shown gains in literacy, as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress,
students at the 8th and 12th grade levels have demonstrated relatively few gains in reading
(http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard). Even more disturbing, the achievement gap between
white and non-white students, and between higher and lower SES students, seems to be
increasing (c.f. Snow & Biancarosa, 2003). Though a number of curricular and instructional
programs have been aimed at improving literacy (see Snow et al. for an overview of 12 such

                                                                                                     2
programs), we still know relatively little about the instructional practices that support literacy
achievement during middle school, particularly in urban schools. While we know that teachers
in other content areas help develop students’ academic literacy, English/Language Arts teachers
are the teachers who are most explicitly charged with developing students’ literacy skills. We
focus on instruction in ELA classrooms where we can look at relationships between instruction
and student achievement in reading and writing.
       Much of the existing research on middle schools has focused on the importance of school
organization (e.g. blocked scheduling; interdisciplinary teams), opportunities for student choice
(electives and exploratory classes) and on the creation of strong adult-student relationships
through structures such as advisories (c.f. Carnegie Corporation, 1989). While school-level
structures can certainly impact student experiences and a variety of outcomes, we are most
interested in classroom-level instructional interactions and how these interactions predict
students’ academic achievement.
       We focus on middle school because so little research has focused on instruction at this
level. Yet we believe that middle school is a consequential time in students’ academic lives
(Carnegie Corporation, 1989) and that the quality of instruction students receive during this time
affects their chances at success in high school and beyond. While there is a growing consensus
on effective approaches to early literacy instruction (Snow, Burns & Griffin, 1998), there is
much less agreement about effective literacy instruction for secondary school students, including
middle grades.
       Prior research has suggested multiple dimensions that characterize classroom interaction
including the intellectual challenge of tasks assigned to students (Newmann, Lopez, & Bryk,
1998), the quality of instructional conversation, including teachers’ uptake and elaboration of
student ideas (Nystrand, 1997; O’Connor & Michaels, 1993); and representations of content,
including the use of analogies or examples ( Leinhardt, 2004). In addition, measures of
classroom practice must capture how those teaching English/Language Arts attend specifically to
the needs of English learners in their classrooms as such students make up an increasing
percentage of students in classrooms nationwide (e.g. Short & Fitzsimmons, 2007). Such
accommodations might include more scaffolding of tasks, support for academic language
development, and targeted vocabulary instruction (Short & Fitzsimmons, 2007). Measures of
classroom practice must therefore be sensitive to a range of interactions around instruction,

                                                                                                     3
including the nature of the task, the focus of instruction, the features of classroom discourse, the
types of accommodations provided, and the quality of feedback given to students.
       While some practices associated with higher student gains in English/Language Arts may
be inherently subject-specific, such as comprehension instruction, other more generic factors
may also contribute to teacher effectiveness at the middle school level. Student motivation and
engagement, for example, have been strongly associated with student achievement in literacy,
particularly at the secondary level (Guthrie & Wigfield, 2000). A long history of research on
teaching also suggests that effective teachers may be better at capturing more time for academic
instruction (Denham & Lieberman, 1980) and keeping students focused on their tasks than less
effective teachers. Effective teachers may have more efficient routines for transitions between
activities, and better classroom management that result in more time for instruction.
       Given the multifaceted nature of effective teaching, our instrument takes many of these
potential dimensions of instruction into account, while focusing on ELA specific instructional
interactions. While some aspects of classroom practice are likely to be general, cutting across
subject areas and grade levels, other features of instruction are almost certainly domain-specific,
requiring subject-specific measures (Stodolsky, 1988). One of the challenges of creating tools
for measuring instruction that can be useful across a wide range of classrooms lies in addressing
this balance between measuring both generic and more domain-specific elements of classroom
interaction (Grosman & McDonald, 2008).


Review of Observation Protocols
       A number of current observation protocols have been designed to focus upon elements of
classroom instruction that may be consistent across different grade levels and content area,
examining a series of features that could be considered generic elements of teaching. For
instance, Danielson’s (1996/2007) Enhancing professional practice: A framework for teaching,
focuses on teacher preparation and knowledge, standards based instruction, necessary material
resources, and student and teacher relationships. Similarly, Pianta and his colleagues developed
the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) to assess instructional approaches, as well
as the teacher-student, and student-to-student interactions and nature of the classroom
environment (Pianta et al., 2004). CLASS focuses upon a number of key instructional
dimensions that can be examined in different subject areas, such as the degree to which a teacher

                                                                                                       4
helps the student understand ideas within a disciplines and the broader framework of the domain,
and the degree to which a teacher provides students opportunities for analysis and higher order
thinking skills, and the quality of feedback a teacher provides for students. The protocol also
captures the emotional climate of the classroom and the teacher’s attempts to address adolescent
needs and perspectives.
       Other instruments have been designed to measure teachers’ understanding of best
practices and/or specific subject matter knowledge in content areas. Emphasizing the importance
of making mathematics accessible to students, Hill and her colleagues developed the
Mathematical Quality of Instruction instrument (MQI) to assess the accuracy and richness of
teachers’ mathematical ideas, language, representations and tasks (Hill et al., 2008). In literacy, a
number of observation protocols have been developed around comprehension, including systems
developed by Taylor et al. (2005) at the Center for the Improvement of Early Reading
Achievement out of the University of Michigan. The TEX-IN3 system (Hoffman et al., 2004)
focuses specifically on the presence and use of texts in classrooms.
       None of the existing observation protocols, however, provides a way to observe across
the many domains of ELA classrooms, particularly at the secondary level. Both of the
aforementioned literacy protocols focus specifically on one element of English Language Arts
instruction—reading—and were designed for elementary classrooms. The paucity of discipline-
based observation approaches has been a persistent problem in efforts to develop assessments of
teaching (Kennedy, in press). Indeed, as Kennedy argues, “until recently, assessments have not
attended to the intellectual substance of teaching: to the content actually presented, how that
content is represented, and whether and how students are engaged with it…Documenting the
intellectual meaning of teaching events remains the illusive final frontier in performance
assessment” (p. 21). To that end, the PLATO instrument builds on existing observation tools and
research on effective teaching practices in ELA in an attempt to parse the different facets of
teaching practice in secondary ELA classrooms.


Development of PLATO
       The Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observation (PLATO) is based on research on
effective literacy instruction at the secondary level and is designed for observations of middle
and high school English/Language Arts classrooms. In its initial version, which we use for the

                                                                                                    5
study presented here, PLATO was designed to supplement our use of the CLASS instrument and
therefore employed the same 7-point scale referenced to 3 levels (low, medium, high).(FN-2) For
each element, we developed indicators of interactions that would receive low (scores of 1 and 2),
medium (scores of 3, 4, and 5), and high scores (6, 7) by raters (see attached instrument for full
details). Researchers observed for 15-minute intervals, and then coded that 15-minute segment of
instruction, according to both the PLATO elements and six CLASS elements described in more
detail below. (FN-3)
       In its first iteration, PLATO included ten elements of effective English Language Arts
instruction:
          clarity of purpose of the lesson
          level of intellectual challenge in both teacher questions and tasks assigned to students
              representations of content
          connections to both personal and prior knowledge
          use of models and modeling of both high quality work and strategies for reading and
           writing
          presence of explicit strategy instruction in reading and writing
          use of guided practice in the classroom
          quality of feedback offered to students by both teachers and peers
              qualities of classroom discourse, including teachers’ response and elaboration of
           student ideas
          accommodations for English Learners
       The element of Purpose derives from research that suggests that children who learn in
classrooms in which the purposes and goals of their work are clearly articulated, and the
relationships between what they learn and broader goals are clear (Borko & Livington, 1989;
Smith & Feathers, 1983). The element “Intellectual Challenge” was designed to focus upon the
nature of the task and the degree to which it represents a developmentally appropriate stretch or
reach for the specific students (Newmann, Lopez, & Bryk, 1998; see also Vygotsky, 1978). We
also wanted to capture the ways in which teachers made content accessible to students and/or
contextualized that content in terms of students prior or personal knowledge. Based upon
research that suggests that teachers’ content knowledge—and the ways in which they represent
content to children—may affect the ways in which students learn (Lee, 1995, 2007; Stevenson

                                                                                                     6
& Stigler, 2002), we included the element “Representation of Content” in order to evaluate the
teachers’ disciplinary knowledge, and the accuracy of the representations of the content she or he
made to students during the observed segment. When teachers connect new material to students’
personal experiences and prior learning, students are more likely to develop a deeper
understanding and make their own connections (Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Tharp & Gallimore,
1988; Levin & Pressley, 1981). Connections to personal and/or cultural experiences are
particularly relevant for ELA instruction, in which students may be asked to make such
connections to a literary text. To that end, the element “Connections to Prior/Personal
Knowledge” evaluates the degree to which teachers make these linkages.
       Students also need examples of strong work in ELA, strategies to help them produce
sophisticated readings and written texts, and structured and scaffolded opportunities to practice
employing those strategies. Three additional elements, “Modeling,” “Explicit Strategy
Instruction,” and “Guided Practice,” attempt to capture this triad of practices central to effective
ELA instruction. When a teacher provides examples and models of what students are being
asked to do, students have specific, concrete images of what their work can and should look like
(Frederickson & Collins, 1989; Graham, 2006; Hillocks, 1992; Knudsen, 1991). The element
“Models/Modeling” captures whether there are models of quality work available in the
classroom to guide student work and whether or not they are analyzed. It also assesses the extent
to which a teacher names and then models specific meta-cognitive strategies or skills that she
wants students to use, such as being able to figure out the meaning of a word using context clues,
being able to write a strong opening paragraph for an essay, or how to edit someone else’s
writing. Because research also suggests teaching specific strategies that can be used flexibly
across a range of ELA activities can enable students to be more successful, we included an
element on “Explicit Strategy Instruction” (Beck & McKeown, 2002; Greenleaf, Schoepenhauer,
Cziko, & Mueller, 2001; Palinscar & Brown, 1987). The element of “Guided Practice,” based
upon research upon the role of practice with support (Vygotsky, 1978; see also Lave and
Wegner,1991), evaluates the level of support that a teacher provides in the segment observed as
well as a teachers’ capacity to check in with his or her students about their programs, evaluate
their learning, and offer any needed support.
       The opportunities for extended discussion as well as the ways in which student ideas are
responded to and clarified are equally important aspects of an ELA classroom. The “Feedback”

                                                                                                       7
element is based upon a long line of research that suggests that feedback facilitates student
learning (Thorndike, 1931/1968; Kluger & DeNisi, 1996), particularly when it is specific and
targeted (Sadler, 1989; Sperling & Freedman, 2001). This element captures when teachers elicit
student ideas, probe student thinking, and have opportunities to address misconceptions. The
“Classroom Discourse” element grows out of research on the nature of productive discourse that
can promote learning in the classroom (Nystrand, 1997; Nystrand & Gamoran, 1991; O’Connor
& Michaels, 1993; Taylor, Pearson, Peterson, & Rodriguez, 2003) as well as upon research on
the typical discourse pattern of “initiation-response-evaluation”, and a tendency to pose lower-
order, rote or recall questions that do not require analytic thinking (Cazden, 2001; Mehan, 1979).
Thus the “Classroom Discourse” element assesses opportunities students have for conversations
with the teacher or among peers, as well as whether the discourse is perfunctory and minimal at
the low end, or elaborated, and purposeful at the high end. Building upon work that suggests that
introducing academic language in classrooms can help bridge students’ home discourse with the
language used in school (Delpit, 1988; Schleppegrell, 2004), this element also focuses upon
whether or not the teacher introduces specific ELA language and concepts and the degree to
which he or she supports students in using those terms.
       Finally, building upon work that suggests that teachers in most mainstreamed classrooms
today are increasingly responsible for teaching English learners, and hence, must be able to
respond both to their language needs as well as support their academic development (August &
Hakuta, 1997), we developed the dimension of “Accommodations for language learning” in
order to capture the range of strategies and supports that a teacher might use to make a lesson
accessible to non-native speakers. Accommodations we wanted to capture included teachers
taking into account individuals’ levels of language proficiency, strategic use of primary
language, grouping strategies, differentiated materials and assessments, as well as graphic
organizers and visual displays.
       Because content coverage can also be an important predictor of student achievement
(Rowan, Correnti, & Miller, 2002), we wanted to capture different aspects of teachers’ curricular
focus during instruction. For this reason, PLATO also includes checklists for the major content
domains within English/Language Arts including reading, writing, literature, speaking/listening,
and grammar & mechanics. For each segment of instruction, observers check the domain that
was the focus of instruction, and identify additional features related to that domain. For

                                                                                                   8
example, if observers identify reading as the target domain, they also identify the nature of the
text read (e.g. fiction or non-fiction), the focus of reading instruction (e.g. comprehension,
decoding, metacognitive strategies, etc.), and the nature of in-class reading activity (e.g.
independent reading, teacher reading aloud, etc.).


Research Design
Sampling procedures
       In order to select teachers for this pilot study, we began by estimating the value-added to
student achievement of all New York City teachers teaching sixth, seventh or eighth grade
classes that take the English Language Arts exam. There are active debates concerning the best
specification for estimating teacher effects. Because there is no consensus on the best approach,
we chose to combine two measures. In particular, we used one estimate that includes student
effects and models gains in student achievement as a function of student fixed-effects, student
time-varying characteristics, (such as whether a student changes schools), school characteristics,
classroom characteristics, and year and grade indicator variables. This strategy identifies value-
added by comparing teachers who teach the same students, usually in different years. Our other
estimate includes student controls, school controls, classroom controls and year and grade
indicator variables. The student controls include gender, race, eligibility for free lunch, prior
year test scores in math and ELA, and English learner status, among other factors. Classroom
variables include the aggregates of all the individual variables plus the standard deviations of the
prior year test scores. The school variables include enrollment, the percent of both black and
Hispanic students, the percent of English learners, and the school average expenditures per
pupil. We shrink each measure of value-added using emprical Bayes techniques to adjust for
estimation error in calculating value-added.
       We then divided teachers into quartiles based on each of these two estimated value-added
measures. In particular, we identified teachers in their third through fifth year of teaching who
were in the second quartile of value-added performance on both measures or were in the fourth
quartile (the top) of value-added performance on both measures.1 Using these samples, we


1
 We selected teachers in the second quartile rather than the lowest because we thought that there
might be relatively little instruction occurring in the lowest-quartile classrooms and hence less to
be learned. In addition, the differences between teachers in the top and bottom quartiles might
                                                                                                     9
identified matched pairs of middle-school teachers – one moderate-performing (2nd quartile) and
one high-performing (4th quartile) – teaching in the same school. We choose 12 pairs, 24
teachers, for the pilot. Neither observers nor participants knew the value added quartiles of
specific teachers during any component of data collection.
       We focused on third through fifth year teachers because we have been following the
cohort of teachers who were in their fourth year at the time of this study since they entered
teaching in 2004; from our earlier work, we know a significant amount about their preparation,
entry into teaching, perceptions of school context, and early experiences in the classroom. In
addition, research on teaching also suggests that by the fourth or fifth year, teachers have
developed a more stable set of instructional practices, and many teachers have reached a stage
where they begin to plateau in their impact on student achievement (e.g. Boyd et. al., 2006; Kane
et al, 2006). However, there were not enough teachers from this single cohort that met our
stringent requirements (value-added and matched in schools), so we included one cohort with an
additional year of teaching experience and one cohort with one year less of teaching experience.
       Table 1 describes the teachers in our sample. 83 percent of the teachers are female.
Approximately 21 percent of the teachers are black, four percent are Hispanic and 54 percent are
white. Half of the teachers entered teaching through traditional teacher education programs
(college recommending) and a quarter through the largest alternative route in NYC, the NYC
Teaching Fellows. The remainder of the teachers entered through a variety of pathways
including Individual Evaluation, Teach for America, and the Temporary license process.


Data Sources
       The primary data source for this study is structured classroom observation. In addition to
PLATO, described above, we used 6 elements from two domains the Classroom Assessment
Scoring System (CLASS) (La Para, Pianta & Stuhlman, 2004) to assess two of the more generic
aspects of instruction we wanted to measure-- emotional support and classroom organization.
Within the domain of Emotional Support, we measured Positive Climate, Negative Climate, and
Regard for Adolescent Perspectives. Within the domain of Classroom Organization, we included
Behavior Management and Productivity. We also included the CLASS measure of Student


have been so striking that they might have alerted raters to a teacher’s quartile during
observations, potentially biasing their scoring of classroom.
                                                                                                 10
Engagement. All of our observers were trained and certified in the use of CLASS prior to
entering the classrooms.
           We assessed inter-rater reliability on PLATO consistent with the procedures used for
CLASS. We first identified target scores for each video, based on master coders, and then
calculated the percentage of ratings by individuals that fell within 1 point of the target score. All
observers completed training both in CLASS and in PLATO. Reliability for using PLATO was
assessed using at least 5 different videos of classroom instruction across three different content
domains (writing, literature, and grammar). All observers achieved at least 80% reliability on
both CLASS and PLATO before observing in the field. We re-assessed inter-rater reliability
during the second wave of observation and again achieved a minimum of 80% agreement on our
ratings.
           We observed teachers on six separate days during the spring of 2007. On each day, we
observed teachers for at least two hours of instruction, generally in two different classes. The six
days were divided into two waves of data collection, separated by between two to six weeks. As
mentioned above, observers did not know the quartile of the teachers they were observing.
           We worried, however, that using structured observation instruments alone might cause us
to miss other aspects of classroom practice not included on the protocols that may in fact
distinguish the highly effective teachers. To capture additional dimensions of classroom
practice, including relationships among teachers and students, peer interactions in the classroom,
curricular focus, evidence of links to out-of-school literacy practices we also included more
open-ended observations. For this reason, we had two observers in the majority of classrooms;
one observer in the classroom took open-ended notes while the second observer used PLATO
and CLASS.
           To gain insights over an extended period, we supplemented six days of direct classroom
observations with teacher logs based, in large part, on the Study of Instructional Improvement’s
teacher log for ELA for middle school classrooms (Rowan, Camburn, & Correnti, 2004). The
log replicates the content categories of the PLATO, allowing us to coordinate two of our
measures of instruction. We asked teachers to fill this log out for 15 consecutive days of
instruction, or roughly three weeks. Teachers began to fill out the logs on the days we began our
observations, which allowed them to ask any questions once they began to use the log. With



                                                                                                     11
these logs, we are also able to assess the overlap between observer’s and teacher’s assessment of
content coverage and activity structures for the days of observation.
       In addition to the log, we also collected both assignments and student work samples to
get another vantage point on instructional practice. We adapted the protocols for collecting and
analyzing student work developed by Newmann and his colleagues (see Table 2). Because prior
research suggests more challenging assignments are positively correlated with higher student
performance (Newmann, Lopez, & Bryk, 1998), we collected copies of assignments teachers
designated as challenging and typical for their classroom. For each assignment, we collected the
work from students that teachers considered high, average, and low performing (2 students from
each group). For each teacher, we had 12 pieces of student work. We then coded qualities of
the both the assignment and of the written work, using protocols adapted from Newmann and his
colleagues.


Findings
       The distribution of scores across observations varies for both the PLATO and the CLASS
elements (See Figures 1 and 2).2 On average, teachers received lower scores for PLATO
elements across the board than on CLASS elements (see Tables 3 and 4). This result confirms
other studies using CLASS alone, in which teachers tend to score higher on the domains of
Emotional Climate and Classroom Organization than they do on the CLASS domain of
Instructional Support. Of the PLATO measures, on average, the teachers scored highest on
Purpose and lowest on ELL Accommodation. The standard deviation across teachers is
approximately 1.0 for all ten PLATO elements. For the CLASS elements, the teachers in our
sample scored highest on Behavior Management and lowest on Negative Climate, which is the
one element constructed to represent a negative classroom behavior and is reverse coded. The
CLASS elements have somewhat higher variances across teachers than the PLATO elements.

2
 Of the PLATO elements, Purpose, Intellectual Challenge and Representations of Content have
approximately bell-shaped distributions. Connections to Prior/Personal Knowledge has an
approximately uniform distribution, except that few observations achieved the very top score.
The remaining measures are positively skewed across the observations. Among the CLASS
measures, Positive Climate, Adolescent Perspectives, Productivity, Student Engagement are
approximately bell-shaped, while Negative Climate is positively skewed and Behavior
Management is negatively skewed. See Figures 1 and 2 for distributions.

                                                                                                12
         Our structured observation data suggests systematic differences between teachers in the
two value-added quartiles. Figure 3 illustrates the average PLATO scores for teachers by their
value-added group. Across all PLATO elements, the high value-added teachers (top quartile)
scored higher on average than the low value-added teachers (2nd quartile). This difference is
evident even though observers were unaware of the value-added quartile of their subjects when
scoring instructional practice. Figure 4 illustrates the average scores for teachers for CLASS
dimensions by their value-added group. The small size of the sample (24 teachers) makes it
difficult to statistically differentiate groups; however, t-tests of the differences across groups on
each of the PLATO scores shows that the groups are statistically different on the element of
Explicit Strategy Instruction (p=0.03) and close to statistically different on the elements of
Guided Practice (p=0.09) and Intellectual Challenge (p=0.13).
         The high value-added teachers also received more positive scores on each of the six
CLASS elements, with the exception of Negative Climate, which is lower among this group (see
Figure 4). However, only the difference in Student Engagement across the groups is significant
at the .05 level, although Negative Climate is close (p= 0.13).


Explicit Strategy Instruction
         One of the most striking findings was the association between a teacher’s score on the
Explicit Strategy Instruction element and his/her value-added quartile. However, many elements
of PLATO are positively correlated with each other (see Tables 5 and 6), potentially
confounding our understanding of the relationship between instructional elements and value
added quartiles. In order to provide a somewhat clearer picture of these relationships, Table 4
provides the results of simple logits predicting value-added group as a function of PLATO scores
on multiple dimensions. This set of analyses, in particular, assesses the extent to which the
relationship between Explicit Strategy Instruction and teachers’ value-added scores holds up to
the inclusion of other measures of instruction. Each column within each of the two vertical
panels of the table represents a separate model in which Explicit Strategy Instruction and one
other observational measure of instruction predicts the log odds of a teacher being in the high
value-added group. As an example, in the first specification, a teacher with a one unit higher
score in Explicit Strategy instruction is 4.88 times more likely to be in the high value-added
group.    This positive relationship between value-added and Explicit Strategy Instruction holds

                                                                                                    13
up to the inclusion of every one of the other measures of instruction. None of the other measures
have nearly as strong a relationship with value-added, once Explicit Strategy Instruction is
included in the model.
       As is clear from this analysis, Explicit Strategy Instruction, in particular, appears to
distinguish the more effective teachers in our sample. To get a better sense of what such
instruction looks like, we provide several examples from the field notes taken during open-ended
observations. Teachers who scored “high” (a score of 6 or 7) on Explicit Strategy Instruction
provided students with very structured and specific ways to approach ELA activities. For
example, one high quartile teacher systematically broke down a newspaper article on “skinny
jeans” to help students understand the features of effective journalism. She instructed them on
how to compose a list of “4 Ws” (who, when, where, and what), how to use that list to create a
focused lead, and then how to incorporate supporting details culled from graphic organizers.
Students then wrote their own newspaper articles with an arsenal of specific strategies. This
focus on how students could tackle ELA tasks was reflected in other high quartile teachers’
classrooms. One teacher carefully broke down the steps involved in using context clues to
determine the meaning of unknown words (reading the sentence before and after the sentence at
hand, substituting in multiple words etc.). Another taught students how to identify the passive
voice in their own writing and then change it to the active voice. Thus these teachers made
visible the often invisible process requisite for successful, sophisticated literary analysis, reading
comprehension, or writing.


Content Domain Findings
       In addition to collecting information on instructional practice, the observers recorded the
content domain(s) covered in the lesson. Lesson segments could be coded for multiple content
domains. On average 31.2 percent of the observations focused on reading, compared with 43.3
percent on writing, 38.5 percent on literature and 19.8 percent on speaking and listening. During
reading instruction, we observed that the majority of the reading texts were fiction, the primary
instructional focus was on comprehension rather than decoding or evaluation, and in about 23
percent of the observations, reading was done in class, either independently or in small or whole
class groups.



                                                                                                    14
       We also noted differences in content coverage based on a teacher’s value-added quartile.
Within our sample, high quartile teachers are more likely to teach across content domains and are
more likely to focus on writing and speaking, while low value-added teachers are more likely to
focus their instruction on reading and literature. On a more detailed note, the low value-added
teachers are more likely to use class time for individual reading and reading aloud, while the
high value-added teachers are more likely spend time on pre-writing and having the students
make oral presentations. None of these differences are statistically significant at the .05 level,
which is perhaps not surprising for such a small sample.
       One possibility is that the differences that we see in instruction between high and low
value-added teachers (as shown above in Figures 3 and 4) is driven by differences in the content
domains. Perhaps, for example, all teachers teach better when they teach writing than reading
and the higher scores on PLATO and CLASS are simply driven by high value-added teachers
teaching more writing. In fact, this is not the case. If anything, instructional quality appears
lower in writing than in other observations. Across almost all of the 16 elements, the writing
observations have less positive scores. The differences are statistically significant for
Representations of Content, Connections to Personal/ Prior Knowledge, Feedback, Positive
Climate, Negative Climate, Adolescent Perspectives, Behavior Management, and Productivity.
Only in the element of Modeling, does writing instruction appear better than instruction in other
content areas.
       In contrast to lower scores during writing instruction, teachers in both quartiles scored
significantly higher on the majority of elements during literature instruction. These differences
are significant across the board except for modeling, explicit strategy instruction, and positive
and negative climate. There were few differences in instructional quality as measured by
PLATO and CLASS between observed segments of teaching reading and teaching other content
domains.


Looking Across Measures: Examination of Teacher Logs and Student Work
       In addition to analyzing differences in instruction, as measured by PLATO and CLASS
elements, we also examined teacher logs and student work.
       Teacher Logs. The teacher logs indicate some differences between teachers in the two
quartiles in content coverage and grouping strategies. Mirroring the observational results, high

                                                                                                     15
value-added teachers in our sample focused less on reading and more on writing and research
skills than low value-added teachers. While only the reading and research differences are even
close to statistical significant at usual levels (see Figure 5), the sample is small and the similarity
in results between the logs and the observations suggest a trend worth further exploration. The
logs also indicate differences between how teachers in the two quartiles use grouping structures
(see Figure 6). Though teachers in both quartiles use independent work time for approximately
the same percentage of instructional time, there were statistically significant differences between
the frequencies with which teachers in the two quartiles used small group versus whole class
instruction. In particular, high value-added teachers use small groups far more than low value-
added teachers (36 percent compared with 16 percent), and they use large groups far less (26
percent compared with 44 percent.
        Student Work: Finally, we draw on student work. We coded the work for feedback,
construction of knowledge, extended writing, disciplined inquiry, value beyond school,
representations of content, and scaffolding. Across all measures but one, high value-added
teachers score higher than low-value added teachers, although none of the differences are
statistically significant.
        Beyond determining the instructional features that predicted teacher’s value-added
quartile, we are interested in the relationships between the different measures of instruction. Do
different measures, such as structured observations, self-reported teacher logs, and student work
assignments and samples pick up similar or different aspects of instruction? We found several
interesting connections between the PLATO/CLASS observations and student work data. For
example, teachers who provide models or rubrics to illustrate ‘good’ work and define what
constitutes quality in a specific lesson or domain are more likely to also give students feedback
on how to improve their (r= 0.44, p< .05). In a way, modeling sets the stage for the feedback
teachers provide when the assignment is complete. If students have greater clarity on a teacher’s
expectations for their work, the teacher can tie his/her feedback to the rubric or model he/she has
provided and is thus better to able to give constructive, targeted feedback on that work.
        Modeling is also positively correlated with students’ opportunity to construct knowledge,
whether or not the assignment requires basic recall of facts or asks students to provide rationales
for their analyses and interpretations (r= 0.44, p< .05). This suggests that teachers who provide a
clearer sense of their expectations may be better able to push students for higher levels of

                                                                                                     16
analysis and interpretation perhaps because the assignment/instruction is better structured and
goal-directed. There is also the possibility, however, that teachers who provide assignments that
only ask for basic recall of facts do not see the need for models or rubrics because they are
looking for right or wrong answers rather than more elaborated written work that could be
stronger or weaker on several different dimensions.
       Interestingly, scaffolding for student work assignments is significantly correlated at the .1
level with several PLATO dimensions including feedback (r=.39, p<.1), classroom discourse
(r=.37, p< .1), and modeling (r= .37, p< .1). Scaffolding looks at whether or not the assignment
provides “structural supports, such as graphic organizers, multiple drafts, etc., that support
further investigation and revision.” It seems logical that teachers who are clearer about their
expectations for an assignment, indicated by a higher score on modeling, would be better able to
provide appropriate scaffolds to complete that assignment. In the same way, teachers who
engage in “frequent back and forth exchanges with students about their work” and provide
“specific and timely feedback that acknowledges what students did well and
problems/incomplete understanding” (PLATO rubric) are the same teachers who scaffold the
completion of assignments, as multiple drafts provide multiple opportunities for teacher
feedback.
       While our analyses of the teacher logs and student work samples demonstrate some
connections across measures, they also highlight important differences among the measures.
Teachers’ self-reports of content coverage in the teacher logs differ significantly from our
structured observations, indicating teachers perceive what they are doing differently from outside
observers. For example, on days in which we observed, we noted one teacher teaching grammar
over 30% of the time, and she reported teaching it only 7% of the time. While there are some
interesting links between PLATO elements and features of the assignments teachers provide for
students, as noted above, we observe surprisingly few connections between the features and/or
quality of student work samples and PLATO or CLASS elements. This may be a result of the
fact that the work samples represent the end product of instruction, while classroom observations
represent the process leading up to the product. In this way, the two measures provide very
different lenses on instruction. Moreover different measures collapse or disaggregate different
instructional elements making comparisons across measures potentially more challenging.



                                                                                                  17
Discussion
PLATO and value-added measures
       This paper describes a pilot study to assess the relationship between classroom instruction
and measures of teachers’ value-added to student achievement based on students’ test score
performance. Even with the small sample used in our analysis, we find consistent evidence that
high value-added teachers have a different profile of instructional practices than low value-added
teachers. Teachers in the fourth (top) quartile according to value-added scores score higher than
second quartile teachers on all 16 elements of instruction that we observed, and these differences
are close to statistically significant in certain elements such as intellectual challenge and guided
practice.
       Our open-ended observation notes provide vivid illustrations of the range in the
intellectual rigor of the instruction teachers provide. Instructional segments that score “low”
(scores of 1 or 2) on intellectual involve students writing instructions for what they do when they
wake up in the morning or completing highly formulaic “bio poems” that required little more
than filling in the blanks. In sharp contrast, instruction that scored high on Intellectual Challenge
(scores of 6 or 7) included students writing five paragraph essays about My Antonia, generating
alternative endings to short stories, or crafting speeches from the perspective of presidential
candidates. Instruction that scores low on Guided Practice either does not provide opportunities
for students to practice new skills in class or allotted time for students to work independently but
without sufficient support or “guidance” during class time. Lesson segments that score high on
Guided Practice involve teachers circulating during literature circles answering student questions
and clarifying their ideas or doing periodic whole class “check ins” as students work through
stages of the writing process. In these elements, we find a clear relationship between a teacher’s
value-added quartile and several facets of high quality instruction.


Why is strategy instruction essential? What does it look like in practice?
       The dimension of explicit strategy instruction strongly differentiates teachers at the
different levels of value-added and confirms research in the area of reading comprehension on
the importance of strategy instruction (Pearson & Fielding, 1991). In order to be successful on
standardized assessments, the primary tool for determining a teacher’s value-added score,
students must consistently employ strategies for interpreting literary text, making a compelling

                                                                                                   18
argument, or analyzing grammatical errors. When students understand when and how to use
specific strategies, as well as why they are useful, they may be better able to use such strategies
on less familiar tasks or material. In contrast, students who write editorials without a broader
understanding of how to craft persuasive prose or build an effective paragraph may encounter
more difficulties on the open-ended writing questions included on the majority of standardized
assessments.
        Unfortunately, instances of effective strategy instruction are rare, as the positively
skewed distribution of scores indicates. The mean score for Explicit Strategy Instruction, 2.1, is
the lowest of all the PLATO elements except ELL accommodations, and the modal score is a 1.
Even instructional segments that score high on other elements such as Intellectual Challenge,
score lower on Explicit Strategy Instruction. During a lesson in which students were asked to “to
anticipate an opponent’s counter argument in writing an editorial,” undoubtedly an intellectually
demanding activity, the teacher did not discuss how students might accomplish the lesson’s goal
when writing independently. In fact it is during intellectually rigorous activities just beyond
students’ intellectual “comfort zone” that teachers most need to equip students with specific
strategies. However, the vast majority of teachers provided students with directions for
completing activities, but they did not instruct them on the nuances of how to complete those
activities effectively. In literature circles, students were often told to analyze a character’s
actions or determine the meaning of unknown words without any discussion of the strategies that
would enable them to do so. Similarly, teachers highlighted the features of cinquains or editorials
but did not teach students how they might approach different types of writing based on those
features. Thus the goal of many lessons was completion of the specific task rather than mastering
a more broadly applicable skill or strategy.


What makes writing instruction more problematic and literature less so?
        High value-added teachers were also more likely to teach writing than their less effective
colleagues. Yet, writing instruction seems to provide another challenge for teachers. Across
quartiles, teachers’ scores on both PLATO and CLASS elements went down during writing
lessons. Interestingly the only PLATO element on which teachers on average scored higher
during writing instruction was modeling. Writing provides the opportunity to generate a concrete
model or exemplar (student work, published pieces, or teacher’s own writing). Moreover

                                                                                                   19
providing a model for a writing strategy (brainstorming, organizing etc.) may be more familiar
for many middle school teachers than modeling reading strategies that involve more
metacognition (what a teacher is thinking when he/she is reading a text or interpreting literature).
       The lack of strategy instruction discussed previously was particularly pronounced during
writing instruction. Our qualitative data indicates a clear distinction between “writing
instruction” and lessons during which students were asked to write. Unfortunately we saw few of
the former, regardless of teacher quartile. The majority of what were coded as writing lessons
were lessons in which students spent class time writing but were given little to no direction about
how to structure their writing or strategies to improve their writing. For example, at the
conclusion to an introductory lesson on the features of poetry that highlighted a number of
academic terms including simile, onomatopeia, and stanza, a teacher instructed students to “do a
pre-write in poetic form.” After students asked number of questions about the specifics of the
assignment, she instructed them to, “write whatever [they] want about poetry- turn to a clean
page in [their] journal and title it, ‘Free Write: Poetry.’” A significant number of the writing
assignments consisted of little more than “do nows” written on the board at the start of class.
        This lack of structure was evident in lessons across the stages of the writing process. The
majority of peer editing sessions involved students reading each other’s writing without specific
features on which they should focus or questions to use to guide the editing process. As a result,
students often provided each other with general or vague feedback such as “I love it!” or “you
could make this better.” Often teachers told students to “work on” or revise a draft for an entire
class period with no specifications or guidance about how to structure their efforts. As a result,
we saw numerous students simply typing or copying earlier drafts in neater handwriting in an
attempt to revise.
       Not only were the PLATO dimensions of practice lower in writing lessons; all of the
social-emotional CLASS elements scored significantly lower during writing lessons, other than
Negative Climate, which was significantly higher. As noted, the observed writing lessons tended
to be less structured, with students spending a great deal of time working independently. This
lack of structure might make writing lessons more difficult to manage and keep productive.
When students were supposed to be writing independently, we noted the teacher’s focus was
heavily on behavior management. Regardless of the effectiveness of these efforts, highly visible
behavior management, such as circulating with a notebook grading students on behavior, seemed

                                                                                                     20
to demand the vast majority of the teacher’s time during writing lessons. We saw few instances
in which teachers meaningfully conferenced with students about their writing; management
seemed to take precedence.
       In sharp contrast, teachers’ scores were significantly higher scores on seven of the ten
PLATO elements during literature instruction. Literature lessons tended to be more structured
around comprehension questions or reading texts aloud and analyzing as they went. This inherent
structure may have facilitated teachers’ ability to engage in higher-level discourse with students,
make connections to students’ experiences and prior knowledge, and demonstrate their own
content knowledge through the use of examples and/or analogies. In addition, literature lessons
involved more whole class and small group instruction, which may have made them easier to
manage and keep on task, while writing lessons often had students working independently.
       Perhaps the general instructional challenges during writing instruction result from the fact
that most secondary ELA teachers have degrees in English literature, and are thus more
confident and competent with content related to literature rather than writing. English majors
may be more familiar and hence more comfortable discussing theme or character in a novel than
explaining the intricacies of persuasive rhetoric and teaching students how employ those
techniques in their own work. Yet, New York City has invested considerable resources around
the teaching of writing in recent years, so these findings regarding the challenges of writing
instruction remain puzzling.


Refining the Instrument and Future Research
        The improvement of classroom instruction is at the heart of improving outcomes for all
students. Yet, researchers and professional educators have been hampered by the lack of
common tools for measuring classroom practice. In a recent article on assessment of teacher
quality in practice, Ball and Hill (2009) commented:
              “The current enthusiasm for teacher quality requires caution. In the
              end, what matters is the quality of the instruction that students
              receive- that is, teaching quality. . .However, given the
              underdevelopment of the field right now, we need to improve the
              precision with which we conceptualize and measure teacher
              quality. . . . We will have to delve into instruction and then map
              backward and forward to specific elements that we can use to predict
              instructional practice and its quality.”


                                                                                                  21
Our efforts to develop a tool for classroom observations for secondary English Language Arts
represent a beginning contribution to this effort.
       Ultimately, we hope to create a tool that is not only useful for research on teaching, but
can be used for teacher development as well. By identifying components of classroom practice
that are related to student achievement, we hope to contribute to the preparation of future English
teachers and the ongoing development of practicing teachers. This tool might also prove useful
in clinical supervision of English teachers, as it provides a common language for discussing and
analyzing classroom practice. In a field that still lacks a technical language to describe practice
(Lortie, 1975), tools that help coordinate how we view classrooms and calibrate our sense of
qualities of practice are sorely needed.
       The tool is still far from perfect. For example, in our effort to reach across the domains of
ELA, we ended up with more generic elements than we might have originally imagined. In
addition, while each of the 16 elements used in this study appears to signal a higher value-added
teacher, they do not necessarily reflect different features of instruction. The elements are highly
correlated, particularly at the teacher level. Because of these high correlations, we cannot
necessarily conclude that it is one or more particular elements that drive the relationship between
the observations of instruction and value added.
       Based on this pilot study, we have significantly revised this instrument, developed
broader instructional factors within PLATO, collapsing, disaggregating, and eliminating
elements that are highly correlated with one another, and changed the scoring from a 7 point to a
4 point scale. We recently completed using this revised version of PLATO in a follow-up study
of 177 teachers in New York City middle schools to see if these initial findings hold up.
       Overall, our study provides evidence that value-added measures do more than measure
the characteristics of students that arrive in a teachers’ classroom. They also seem to be
capturing important differences in the quality of instruction. This said, the small sample size of
this pilot study limits our ability to identify with precision the instructional practices that most
directly impact student achievement gains. Nonetheless, our findings regarding the impact of
Explicit Strategy Instruction suggests that future research can begin to develop measures of
teaching that can identify the attributes of instruction that can make a difference to student
achievement. It is also possible that the impact some aspects of instruction, such as the quality
of classroom discourse that may be important in developing students reasoning abilities and

                                                                                                       22
conceptual understanding of literature and writing, may not be measured well by the tests used to
construct value-added scores. In addition to developing multiple measures of instruction, we
need to develop multiple measures of student outcomes to ensure that classroom instruction
supports the development of a broad range of learning outcomes for students.
