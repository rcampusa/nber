       The 1992 eighth grade mathematics test of the National Assessment of Educational

Progress reveals a low average level of achievement, wide variation across states, and a large

difference in average scores of white and black students. Multiple regression analysis across

states indicates that the characteristics of children (such as readiness to learn in kindergarten) and

of the households in which they live (such as mother's education) have much larger effects on

NAEP test scores than do variables (such as the student/teacher ratio) that measure school

characteristics. White-black differences in the levels of child and household variables account

for much of the white-black difference in NAEP test scores.

       Expressions of concern regarding the low achievement of American students have been
appearing for more than a decade.' Some researchers contend that the bad news has been

overstated,2 but others point to a variety of evidence that provides little ground for complacency.
From the early 1960s to the late 1970s, SAT scores declined substantially; this decline can only
partially be explained by changes in the composition of students taking the test.3 Since the tate

1970s, there has been a slight recovery in mathematics scores, and a substantial rise in the
achievement of black students overall, but verbal scores for white students remain close to their
all-time low. In comparisons with students in other industrialized nations, American students
often perform poorly; international differences in achievement in mathematics and sciences have

received special attention.4 U.S. employers and prospective employers frequently complain
about high school graduates who lack basic skills in English and mathematics, and these

complaints are echoed by university professors and administrators who find that many freshmen
require extensive remedial work before they can begin higher education. Finally, it is important
to note that achievement varies widely within the U.S. by geographic location, race, and

socioeconomic status.

       Concern regarding low achievement is not accompanied by agreement about it's causes or

possible solutions. Some critics see the problem residing primarily in the schools themselves,
while others believe that changes in families and communities are at the root of the problem.
Even those who focus on the schools disagree as to whether the problem is primarily one of
inadequate resources (e.g., high student/teacher ratios) or whether the educational process is
plagued by inefficient bureaucrats and ineffective teachers. Similarly, critics who claim that the
problems lie outside the schools are divided between those who see poverty as the principal cause

and those who put more emphasis on changes in adult behavior that result in decreased parental

involvement with their children.
       In a previous study of the decline in the mental, physical, and emotional well-being of
children since 1960, we found that explanations that emphasize material resources could not be

valid for the first half of the period: purchases of goods and services for children by government
rose rapidly, as did real household income per child, and the poverty rate of children
plummeted.5 By contrast, in the 1980s material conditions deteriorated for many children,
especially those in households at the lower end of the income distribution.

       This paper attempts to identify the factors associated with educational performance

through an analysis of interstate differences in mathematical achievement in 1992. The
determinants for all races and for white students only are identified, and the latter are used to

analyze the large white-black differential in achievement.
       Reliance on state data has some obvious limitations, including a relatively small number

of observations and the possibility that statewide aggregates may obscure information about

individual students. There are, however, at least two important advantages of state aggregate
data over cross-sectional studies of individual students. First, because there is great stability in
interstate differences overtime, the "window of time" problem is not as severe.6 With
individual data, for example, a child may nat be living in poverty at the time of a given study,
but her performance in sèhool may be significantly affected by having been in poverty for much
of her life. Second, studies based on individual data usually assume that all of the effects of a
variable, e.g., living in a one-adult household, are experienced by the individual child. In fact,
there may be important "neighborhood" effects (i.e.. externalities) which will be reflected in the
aggregate data. In addition to these methodological advantages, data for certain important
variables are available only by state.


Interstate and Racial Differences in Achievement

       The results of the eighth grade mathematics test (MATHS) of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP) were used to measure mathematics achievement. According to

some experts, the MAEP offers uthe only dependable national index for monitoring the perform-
ance of our schools."7 NAEP results were made available by state for the first time in 1990,
and again in 1992. This study used the 1992 scores8 which we found to be highly correlated
with both the 1990 data (r=.97) and with the 1992 fourth grade mathematics scores (r=.95).

       Three aspects of the statewide averages summarized in Table 1 deserve special attention.

First, the average level of achievement--a mean of 266—is quite low.9 For students to receive a
score of 300 they only had to demonstrate an ability to solve problems involving decimals,

fractions, and percentages, and to use elementary concepts in algebra, geometry, and



                                                  2
statistics.10 There is no state where the average eighth grader came close to meeting that
standard. A score of 250 indicates only an ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide whole
numbers and solve two-step problems." Second, we see wide variation across states in the

avenge level of achievement. There is almost a 40 point gap between the lowest and the highest

state. Finally, achievement levels differ greatly between white and black students. Thehighest
mean state score for blacks is below the lowest mean state score for whites. The following

analyses focus on the interstate and racial differentials; the results may also throw light on the

generally low level of achievement.


Determinants of Interstate Differences in Achievement

       The explanatory variables used in this study are described in Table 2. They are of three

types. First, there are variables such as READY and LOWBWT that pertain directly to children
themselves. Second, there are variables such as MOMDRP and POVRTY that describe the

households in which the children live. Finally, variables such as STU/TCH measure
characteristics of the schools that the children attend. Variables were chosen on the basis of

theoretical considerations, previous empirical research, and availability.
        Readiness-to-learn in kindergarten (READY) is a new series developed by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In 1990 kindergarten teachers were asked to
estimate the percentage of their students who entered kindergarten ready to learn, based on

"physical well-being, social confidence, emotional maturity, language richness, general

knowledge, and moral awareness"; these responses were reported by state but not byrace)2
Low birthweight, a variable that has been identified as a predictor of poor performance in
school,13 was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics)4 The remaining child
and household data were derived from the March Consumer Population Surveys (CPS) for the

years 1988 through 1990.15 The measurement of percent black (AFRAM) is straightforward,

but the interpretation is complicated by correlation with many socioeconomic variables plus
possible cultural biases in standardized tests.

        The importance of household variables was emphasized by Coleman in 1966: "Variations

 in family background account for far more variation in school achievement than do variations in

 school characteristics."'6 The percent of children living with only one adult is of interest


                                                   3
because of a rapid increase (5.5% in 1960, 14.8% in 1990') and concerns about the effects of

this increase oil children. As more mothers enter the work force, it is important to examine the
implications of this trend for children. To analyze this phenomenon, we focused on households
where there is one adult male and one adult female, and calculated the percent of children living
in these households where both adults work 20 or more hours per week. We also calculated the
percent of children in households where both adults are in the labor force, but at least one works

less than 20 hours per week. Most educational researchers believe that "a weak but statistically

significant relationship exists between student poverty and academic achievement.• ta With one
in five children currently living in poverty, it is important to consider the possible effect of this
variable.
       Other child and household variables that were considered but found to have no
independent statistically significant relation to MATHS included the percent of children who
moved in the past year, who live in big cities, and who live in households where there are at least
two adults, but no married couple. Also considered but not found to be statistically significant
were the percent of mothers who received prenatal care, the number of children in Head Start as
a percent of children in poverty, and median household income per person.
       School variables include the student-teacher ratio in each stat&9 and the portion of state

and local education revenues which came from the state.20 The portion of revenue from the
state is of interest because it has increased substantially since 196821 and it is likely to continue

to increase as taxpayers resist high property taxes and as the states seek greater equality of

revenue across school districts. The increasing importance of state financing may lead to less
local community involvement with the schools.
       School variables which were considered but were not statistically significant included
dollar revenue per student, the percent of children 9-13 in private school, and the percent of

children ages 3 and 4 in preschool.

       The state MATHS avenges for all races were regressed on the children, household, and

school variables in a wide variety of specifications. Those regressions with the most explanatory
power (highest R2s adjusted for degrees of freedom) are shown in Table 3. Their overall
explanatory power is very high; almost 90% of the variance in NAEP scores is explained by a

relatively small set of. variables?2



                                                   4
       In all specifications the most important determinant of MATHS is READY. It is the first
variable to enter in stepwise regressions, always has a high level of statistical significance
regardless of specification, and the absolute size of the effect is substantial. A change of one

percentage point in READY is associated with a change of about .4 or .5 in the NAEP score.
AFRAM is also always statistically significant (pc .01), but the size of the effect is not as large
as READY. The coefficient for AFRAM varies from -.2 to -.3, depending on whether
LOWBWT is included or excludedY

       STATSHR is the only schooling variable that is consistently significant (p< .Ol),24 but
the size of the effect is small. The coefficient of-. £3 implies that an increase in STATSHR of

ten percentage points would, ceteris paribus, result in a decrease of 1.3 points in MATH8.
MOMDRP is statistically significant at Pc .05; its effect on MATHS is about one-half that of
READY. BOTHWK, the only other variable that is statistically significant in many
specifications, has a positive effect on MATHS. Although LOWBWF, POVRTY, and STU/TCH

figure prominently in many discussions of student achievement, they do not play a significant role
in cross-state differences in MATHS, as may be seen in regressions (2) through (5).



Determinants of Readiness to Learn in Kinder2arten

       Readiness to learn merits particular attention. The scatter diagram (Figure 1) and the
robustness of READY in the regressions show the strong relation between this variable and
achievement in mathematics in eighth grade. In order to identify the factors associated with
readiness to learn, READY was regressed on several variables, and those regressions with the

most explanatory power are shown in Table 4. We report the results of regressions weighted by
number of children because READY was based on responses from fewer than 50 kindergarten

teachers in one state. The coefficients are similar in the weighted and unweighted regressions,
but the former yield higher adjusted R2s.
       Either measure of mothers' education (MOMEI) or MOMDRP) was the first variable

brought in by stepwise regressions and was always significant at the .01 level; MOMED gave
slightly better results. If MOMED increases by one year, READY increases by about five

percentage points. The percent of children living in single-adult households was always
significant at least at the .05 level. An increase in ADULT 1 of 1 percentage point is associated


                                                  5
with a .5 percentage point decrease in READY. This has serious implications given the 9
percentage point increase in ADULTI since 1960.
       The percent of two-adult households where both adults work 20 hours per week and
the percent of those households where both are in the labor force but at least one works less than

20 hours were frequently significant but in opposite directions. While a one percentage point
increase in EOTHWK results in a decrease of about .25 percentage points in READY, a similar

increase in BOTHLFX results in an increase of the same magnitude. Low birthweight has a ]arge

but not statistically significant effect on READY. The percent of children in poverty has a very
small and statistically insignificant coefficient when other variables (particularly MOMED and
ADULT!) are included; AFRAM also has a small coefficient which is not statistically significant.


Racial Differences in Achievement
       To test the robustness of the MATHS regression results reported in Table 3, we estimated
similar regressions for white students only (see Table 5)." Because READY was not reported
by race, we used a predicted value for whites, estimated from the results of regression (1) in
Table 4 applied to the levels of the variables for whites only.26 Qualitatively, the results for
whites-only are similar to those for all races; the principal differences are a substantial increase in
the coefficients for POVRTY and MOMDRP, a large decrease for AFRAM, and a modest
decrease for READY.

       The regression results for MATHS for white students and for READY for all races
provide significant insights concerning the white-black differential in MATHS, as shown in Table
6. First, we we see that there is a large racial differential in READY as predicted from
regression 1 in Table 4. This difference is attributable primarily to the large percentage of black
children living with only one adult, and secondly to the greater education of white mothers.
There are also racial differences in labor force status of two-parent families, but they have small
and offsetting effects on READY.

       The large racial difference in READY helps explain the large differential in MATHS.
Equally important are the racial differences in MOMDRP, LOWBWT, and POVRTY. Using the
coefficients from regression (5) in Table 5, the predicted white-black difference in MATHS is
25.6. The actual difference is 37.7. Thus, the differences between whites and blacks in the



                                                  6
children and household variables shown in Table 6 explain two-thirds of the racial difference in
mathematical achievement in eighth grade. Unmeasured socioeconomic differences and

segregated schools could account for some or all of the unexplained differential.



Conclusion
       Multiple regression analysis of state data yields two important conclusions about mathe
matical achievement in eighth grade. First, we find that the characteristics of children and the
that households in which they live have much larger effects on NAEP test scores than do variables
that measure school characteristics. Second, we find that white-black differences in the children and
household variables account for most of the large white-black difference in NAEP test scores.
       The most consistent predictors of interstate differences in mathematical achievement are

the percent of children who enter kindergarten ready to learn and the percent of mothers who

dropped out of high schobl. The percent of students who are black has a large, statistically
significant negative relation with achievement in the all-races regressions; for whites-only the
coefficient is much smaller, but still statistically significant. The only school-related variable that
is statistically significant is a small negative effect of the share of school revenues supplied by the

state. Both parents working in paid jobs has a positive effect on MATHS.
       The observed difference in mathematical achievement between white and black students

can be explained largely by differences in predicted readiness-to-learn in kindergarten, mother's

education, low birthweight, and poverty. Readiness-to-learn in kindergarten is predicted
primarily by mother's education (positive) and living in a one-adult household (negative).21
The extent of parental labor force participation in two-parent households is also relevant: when
both parents work 20 or more hours per week the effect is negative; when both parents are in the
labor force but at least one works fewer than 20 hours the effect is positive.
       If a public policy goal is to increase achievement in mathematics, these results suggest
that more emphasis be given to the pre-school years even if this requires re-allocation of
resources from formal schooling. Unless there is a dramatic improvement in the circumstances

of young children, there is little chance of achieving the nationally established goals that by the
year 2000 "all children will come to school ready to learn" and "American students will be first
in the world in math and science achievement."28

                                                                                             significant.


 Bacial Differences in Achievement
           To test the robustness of the MATHS regression results reported in Table 3. we estimated

 siruiilar regressions for white students only (see Table 5)." Because READY was not reported
 by race, we used a predicted value for whites, estimated from the results of regression (I) in
 Table 4 applied to the levels of the variables for whiles only!6 Qualitatively, the results for

 whites-only are similar to those for all races; the principal differences are a substantial increase in
 the coefficients for POVRTY and MOMDRP, a large decrease for AFRAM, and a modest
 decrease for READY.

          The regression results for MATH8 for white students and for READY for all races
provide significa,t insights concerning the white-black differential in MATH8, as shown in Table
6. First, we we see that there is a large racial differential in READY as predicted from
regression tin Table 4. This difference is attributable primarily to the large percentage of black
children living with only one adult, and secondly to the greater education of white mothers.
ihcre are also racial differences in labor force status of Iwo-parent families, but they have small
and offsetting effects on READY.

          The large racial difference in READY helps explain the large differential in MATHS.
IRually important are the racial differences in MOMDRP and POVRTY. Using the coefficients
from regression (3) in Table 5, the predicted white-black difference in MATHS is 20.9. The

actual difference is 377. Thus, the differences between whites and blacks in the children and


                                                  6
  household variables shown in Table 6 explain more than half of the racial difference in

  mathematical achievement in eighth•grade. Unmeasured socioeconomic differences and
 segregated schools could account (or some or all of the unexplained differential.


 Conclusion

         Muttipte regression analysis of stale data yields two important conclusions about niathemat-
 ical achievement in eighth grade. First, we find that Ihe average characteristics of children and th
 households in which they live have much larger effects on average NAEP test scores than do varia-
 bles that measure school characteristics. Second, we find that white-black differences in the chitdren
 and household variables account for much of the large white-black difference in NAEP test scores.

         The most consistent predictors of interstate differences in mathematical achievement are
 the percent of children who enter kindergarten ready 10 learn and the percent of mothers who

 dropped out of high school, The percent of students who are black has a large, statistically
 significant negative relation with achievement in the all-races regressions; for whiles-only the

 coefficient is much smaller, but stitl statisticalty signiFicant. The only schoot-related variabte that
 us statistically significant isa small negative effect of the share of school revenues supplied by the
 state. Both parents working in paid jobs has a positive cft'ect on MATH8.
        The observed difference in mathematical achievement between while and black students

can be explained largely by differences in predicued readiness-to-learn in kindergarten, mothcr's

education, and poverly. Readiness-to-learn in kindergarten is predicted primarily by mother's
education (posilive) and living in a otie-adult household (negative)." The extent of parental
labor force participation in two-parent households is also relevant: when both parents work It) or

more hours per week the effect is negative; when both parents are in the labor force hul at least
one works fewer than 20 hours the effect is positive.

        If a public policy goal is to increase achievement in mathematics, these results suggest
that more emphasis be given to the pre-school years even if this requires re-allocation of
resources from formal schooling. Unless there is a dramatic improvement in the circumstances

of young children, there is little chance of achieving the nationally established goals that by the
year 20(10 "all children wilt conic to school ready to learn' and 'American students will be First
iii the world iii uiath and science achievement."''

        22. When the regressions were run in weighted form (the number of children in each
state used as weights) the results were very similar to those shown in Table 3, and the overall
explanatory power was about the same.

         23. When all other variables are excluded the coefficient for AFRAM is .5.

       24. STUITCH achieves statistical significance (p< .05) if STATSHR and BOTHWK are
both excluded. The coefficient for S11J/TCH, -.5, is quite small. It implies that a reduction of
two students in the student/teacher ratio would result in an increase of only one point in the
NAEP mathematics score.

        25. Cross-state regressions for black students are not reliable because of small sample
size in several states.

        26. READY was estimated for white, black, and others using the regression coefficients
and the state averages for each variable and racial group. Each value was then adjusted by the
factor for that state which would equate the weighted avenge of the three estimated values of
READY to the observed value for that state.

       27. Some reformers advocate delaying entry to kindergarten in order to increase the
percent of children ready to learn. However, this would probably increase the disparity among
children as parents with more education and more resources would be likely to substitute other
learning experiences for early kindergarten, whereas parents with fewer options might settle for
custodial care.
