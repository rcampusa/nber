              The Effect of Social Security on Retirement


                                  SUMMARY



       This study examines the impact of social security on the

retirement of married men aged 60-70 years. The empirical results

are based on a rich file of data from the Social Security Adminis-

tration (1973 CPS-IRS-SSA Exact Match File). The data permit precise

calculation of social security wealth (the actuarial present value

of benefits that a person would receive by retiring) denoted SSW.

This variable measures social security's effect on retirement. The

estimated effects are significant and considerable. When SSW in-

creases from $35,000 to $55,000 the probability of retirement rises

by .15 for 62-64 year olds relative to a .41 retirement rate. For

65-70 year olds this increase is .22 relative to .78. For 60-61

year olds who ae entitled to SSW but not old enough to receive

benefits the estimated effect was small and insignificant. This

supports the conclusion that the observed effect on men eligible

for benefits is a causal relationship.

       The traditional method of comparing market and reservation

wages for analyzing the decision to work provides the basic econom-

ometric model. SSW is added to construct a retirement model. A

two-step probit analysis is developed to identify structural para-

meters in the retirement model.

                     The Effect of Social Security on Retiretnent*



                 The social security program is the major source of income sup-

    port for retired workers.' The basic idea of this program is to di-

    rect benefits to individuals whose retirement decreased their income

    and was outside their control. A provision consistent with this idea

    is the retirement test which reduces social security benefits when

    earned income exceeds a certain amount.2 However, the variation in

    benefit levels for individuals who otherwise face the same economic

    opportunities in terms of their market wage, capital income, and

    other resources may influence the decision to retire. Also, the

    high implicit tax rate on earnings above an exempt amount can change

    the labor supply of persons who are eligible for retirement benefits

    subject to the earnings test. Therefore, rather than being outside

    individual control, retirement may be induced by social security.

    The net effect of social security on total income which is the sum

    of labor, benefit, and capital income is an unanswered empirical

    question because we do not know enough about its impact on retire—
             3
    merit.


             This paper examines how social security affects retirement in

    a cross—section sample of men aged 60—70 years. The data source

    comes from the Social Security Administration and contains accurate

    information on the retirement benefits which each person is eligible

    to receive, regardless of whether he claims these benefits as a re-

    tiree. The foundation of this analysis is the standard theory of

    labor—leisure choice. Section II will briefly review recent liter—

 model based on a market wage equation and
                                               shadow price equation is
 introduced in Section III. These two equations are part of a simul-

 taneous equations mode]. of labor supply which will be discussed

 briefly. The data source and specification of the model are pre-

 sented in Section IV. Empirical results based on estimating the

 participation model over subsa.mples of 60—70 year old men constitute

 Section V. Section VI briefly summarizes and concludes this paper.


 II. Review of Recent Literature

           The Social Security Administration has conducted several sur-

veys of beneficiaries almost since benefits were first paid in

l940. Early survey results seemed to indicate that
                                                   poor health and
lack of employment opportunities were major reasons for the retire-

ment of respondents. As Quinn (1975) points out, health may be a

more convenient or socially acceptable explanation for departure from

full—time work than personal economic gain. He shows that health,

labor market conditions, and job characteristics do influence retire-

ment, but economic factors have additional explanatory power in his

retirement model. The main economic determinants are eligibility for

social security and private pension retirement benefits and interac-

tion between the two. The insignificant wage effect found by Quinn

may   be   caused by hIs not having the full benefit amount which an in-

dividual is entitled to receive. Since this amount is expected to

have a negative income effect on participation and be positively
                                                                          3




 correlated with the wage, the wage effect which should be positive may

be estimated as small and insignificant due to left—out variable bias.

Another difficulty with these results is not being able to distinguish

between the effect of eligibility for benefits and
                                                      declining participa-
 tion due to age. Although there are problems, Quinn's results provide

empirical support for viewing retirement as an economic decision.

        Boskin (1977) constructs a model which enables him to estimate

responses to both social security benefits and the earnings test in

the transition to retirement status. Since his results are based on

defining retirement as working less than quarter time, it is not clear

how much of the effect he measures is just due to whether or not a

person works   at   all. Analyzing labor force participation separately

from   the amount of labor supplied after a person decides to work is
important for two reasons: (1) it indicates whether the information
in labor supply estimates comes from participation or variation in
positive amounts of work; (2) participation analysis is not compli-

cated by the earnings test which makes the budget line kinked and non—

convex (discussed in Section III). A better understanding of how so-

cial security affects retirement is obtained by separating the benefit

effect on participation and the combined effect of benefits and the

earnings test on labor supply. Boskin also does not have data on in—

dividuaj.s' full retirement benefits and is forced to use   imputed
benefits based on an earnings regression and the benefits formula

or actual benefits received if present. Withstanding these
                                                                       4




problems, Boskin makes a significant contribution by analyzing retire-

ment in the context of states of labor market activity and offering a

specification for examining this dynamic process.

      The earnings distribution of persons eligible for benefits is a

source of evidence that retirement may be induced by social security.

A clustering of earned income around the amount above which benefits

are reduced for increases in earnings would indicate some distortion

of labor supply. Evidence of this clustering effect has been pre-

sented by Social Security Administration (SSA) researchers Sander

(1968) and Vroman (1971). They conclude that retirees do control

their earnings so that benefits are not withheld by the earnings

test. This is evidence that social security has an effect on labor

supply conditional on participation but it does not indicate whether

participation is itself affected by benefits. There have been dif-

ferences in the retirement research done by the SSA and economists

outside the SSA as discussed by Campbell and Campbell (1976), but

recent results by both reveal some aspects of induced retirement.

SSA researchers (e.g., Bixby, 1976) stress, as do Campbell and

Campbell, the importance of finding and estimating work disincen-

tives that operate against social security's objective of income

maintenance for the aged.

      Estimating the effect of social security on the probability of

retirement is the focus of this study. Having an accurate measure of

the potential benefit a person is entitled to receive is the main
                                                                       5




 advantage of the data used here. -The decision to work, the first

 step in the labor supply process, of potential retirees covered by

 social security comes under investigation as a useful empirical study

 on its own and as part of the important study of life—cycle labor

 supply.


 III. The Retirement Model

       A person decides to work based on the opportunities available

inside and outside the market. This decision is embedded in the

process of personal welfare maximization which can include human cap-

ital accumulation and bequest motives. This study analyzes labor

force participation in a given year of retirement—aged men whose

education and training are, for practical purposes, completed. In

this context, a person's wage is a fixed market valuation of his

working time. Whether a person works depends on the value of time

spent in nonmarket activity as veil. The value of time for non—

workers, their reservation wage, is larger than their market wage.

When a person's reservation wage is less than the market wage and he

can work any desired amount, then he supplies labor at a level which

equates his shadow price of time and the market wage. The comparison

of a market wage and reservation wage is the foundation of the retire-

ment model used here. This approach is developed in the literature

by Cronau (1973), Hall (1973, 1975), Hanoch (1976a, b), and Heckman

(1974, 1977).

        The market wage (w) that an individual, faces will depend on a

 set of observed variables (X) and an error term (e1) which includes

 unobserved and unobservable determinants of
                                                 wage opportunities, other
 left—out variables, and a random disturbance.      The market wage rela—
 tionsh.ip is specified in the following semi—log form:


 (1)      lnv
                      Xa±e1

 This form of the wage equation is widely accepted in the econometrics

 literature.
               5
       Labor market activity also depends on the shadow price (s) of a

 person's time, which will be influenced by a set of variables (Y) and

 the amount of time spent working (K).
                                           Unobserved labor supply deter—
ininants and   a   random disturbance will be combined in an error term

 (e2). The form of the shadow price equation is the same as eq. (1):


 (2)     ins
                     Y8+yK+e2.

In the static labor force participation model, when market wage is

less than shadow price at zero labor supply, i.e., s(K=O) >
                                                            w, the
individual will not participate in labor market activity; if s(KO) <

w, then the individual will participate.

       As discussed by Pellechjo (1978), full retirement is a dynamic

life—cycle decision. The analysis of this decision requires adding

the present value of future retirement benefits assuming full retire—

sent to the set of explanatoi-y variables in the
                                                    static labor force

eq. (3) the probability of participation, P(DP               1), can be written
as:

where F is the standard normal distribution function
                                                                 and J0 I0/c,
the participation index. Since the variables that are used to de-

termine wage and shadow price appear in J0, estimates of the coeff i—
                                                                        8




 cients in eqá. (1) and (2) and   up to scale factor a may be obtained

from a probit analysis of DP. If a variable is in both X and Y,

i.e., it influences both market wage and shadow price, only the dif-

ference between its coefficients in eqs. (1) and (2) relative to

can be identified. Thus, a probit analysis of DP based on eqs. (1)

and (2) estimates the net effect on participation of the variables

in these equations.

      Having the true wage, w*, that each person faces in the market

would permit estimating coefficients in the shadow price equation.

In this case, individuals work when:


          e2 < SSW + ln w*


so that


          P(DP   1) =   F[(SSSW + in w —
                                           Y$)/a2]

The inverse of the estimated coefficient on in w yields an estimate

of a2, a2. The estimated coefficients for the Y variables and SSW

are multiplied by a2 to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the

8's and 6.

      In this study, estimates of the a's, 8's, and 6 are obtained by

estimating the wage equation over the sample of working persons and

using imputed wages, w, in a second probit step. It may be desirable

to use imputed wages rather than observed wages due to transitory

disturbance or measurement error In reported earnings and labor supply

 of workers (Hall, 1973). Since participation defines the sample for

market wage estimation, e1 can be related to the X's through eq. (3)

so that OLS estimates of             may be biased. Hanoch (1976b) and Heckman

 (1977) show that an additional variable must be included to correct

for sample selection bias. This can be seen by taking the expectation

of in w conditional on participation:


 (5)    E(in wJX, DP        1)         X +                     DP   1)
                                                E(e1IX,

From the participation analysis the conditional mean of e1 is:



(6)     E(e1IX, DP         1) —
                                     E(e11e0

                                 —      and     f   is the standard normal density

function. Thus, the wage regression function conditional on partici-

pation is:



(8)     E(lnvIX, DP l)—X +

The additional variable that corrects for sample selection bias is

f(30)/F(J0) which is the inverse of Mill's ratio and                      is   abbreviated

M(30). Using the estimates of u/a0,                            and 6/0o   from   the probit

 analysis of DP [eq. (4)], an estimate of M(J0) is constructed for

 each individual. The wage equation is estimated over the sample of

workers where wages are observed with the estimate of MCJ0) added to

the right—hand side. It is important to note that the Y variables

which are not in X are nonetheless included in the wage regression to

avoid inducing bias in their coefficient estimates in the second pro—

bit step. Using the coefficient estimates, a wage is imputed to

workers and nonworkers.

        The error (ei) in using imputed rather than true wages enters

the analysis as did e1 [in eq. (3)] when using the market wage equa-

tion. Therefore, people work when:



          e2— e < SSW+lnw—y8

Letting       =       — 2aa2 + o, the participation probability becomes:


(9)       P(DP =   1) = F[(5SSW + mw — Y8)/


The   estimates   of coefficients for in w, Y, and SSW can be used as in

the case when true wages are known    to   estimate B and   tS.7


       A labor supply equation follows from eqs. (1) and (2) by setting

in w in s and solving for K conditional on participation.8 If this

strict derivation is not assumed an independent equation for K can be

added to eqs. (1) and (2) which would complete the labor supply

model. In this way the variables which determine, participation do
                                                                        11




 not also strictly determine the amount of work.    Consequently, the
 labor supply decision is viewed as a two—step process. In the first

 step, given a set of variables describing opportunities for
                                                               market and
nonmarket activity, it is decided whether or not to participate in the

 labor market. If the decision is for
                                        nonparticipation, then labor
supply is naturally zero. However, conditional on deciding to work,

the same variables with different coefficients or additional variables

may determine how much to work in the second step of the supply de-

cision. This study examines empirically the participation decision,

the first step in the labor supply process, for retirement—aged men.

      Up to this point, the del assumes that the wage rate is not

changed by the earnings test. The earnings test that will be con-

sidered operates as follows: there is no loss in benefits for earn-

ings up to an exempt amount of       $1 in benefits is lost for every

$2 of earnings up to $M2; benefits are lost dollar—for—dollar with

earnings up to the point where the person receives no benefit income

and the budget line returns to what it would be outside the retirement

program. The earnings—tested budget line of a person with wage w who

could receive full benefit amount F..B is illustrated in Figure 1.

      A crucial feature of this budget set for
                                                 participation analysis
is that the extension of its initial segment BC (shown as the dashed

line CC) lies above the budget constraint.
                                             Although the earnings—
tested budget constraint is nonlinear and nonconvex, it never Cuts

the extension of BC from below. If this were not the case, the market

        The earnings test provides that no benefits are withheld from

workers earning less than M1 a year, $1 in annual benefits are withheld

for each $2 in annual earnings between N1 and N2, and $1 was withheld

for each $1 in earnings above
                                N2.

 wage and shadow price comparison at zero labor supply that underlies

 the participation analysis would not be valid.   It would be possible

 for shadow price to be less than or equal to the slope along a seg—

ment which was above CC, indicating a potential positive amount of

work, even though shadow price was greater than wage at zero labor

 supply. Fortunately no such problem arises with the earnings test.

       The conventional assumption made here that individuals face a

fixed wage may not describe how the market actually works. If wages

rise with the amount of labor supplied, the resulting nonconvex

budget line may cause problems. On the other hand, progressive in-

come taxation diminishes the likelihood that a wage—hours locus will

affect the analysis. There is the related issue that individuals

may not be able to choose their amount of work freely and face

discrete choices for part—time and full—time work.   Thus, the work

and nonwork dichotomy might be replaced by a trichotomy: full—time

work, part—time work, and no work. Although the analysis can be ex-

tended to cover these and other descriptions of work choice, the ap-

proach taken here is less complicated than these others and is a

good starting point.


IV.   Data   and Model Specification

      The empirical analysis is based on a rich file of data from

the Social Security Administration, the 1973 cPS—IRS—SSA Exact Match

file.9 This file starts with the March 1973 Current Population

Survey (CPS) from which selected information on each individual has
                                                                      14




 been taken. This information has been linked with extracts of Social

 Security Administration (SSA) records for each individual. The SSA

 data permit precise calculation of full social security retirement

 benefits. The amount of a monthly benefit award is related to past

 earnings. Benefits are determined by first computing an insured

 worker's average monthly earnings. This is done by suing a

 worker's covered earnings after 1950 omitting five years of lowest

 earnings and dividing the accumulated amount by the number of months

 during the same period; this average is denoted AME5O. A formula

 stated in the law relates ANE5O to the monthly benefit payable to an

insured worker alone——this is the primary insurance amount, PIA.

Benefits for a dependent spouse are 50 percent of the primary worker's

PIA. A married couple will receive at least 150 percent of the pri-

mary worker's PI.A. If the secondary, worker's PIA is greater than 50

percent of the primary worker's, a retired couple will receive the

sum of their separate PIA's. Actuarial reduction of full benefits

payable to workers and spouses aged 62—64 years is applied according

to the law. The potential benefit payable to a couple is denoted

'BHW.


        Social security wealth, SSW, as defined in Feldstein (1976)

and Peldstein and Pellechio (1977a, b), is based on the husband's and

wife's respective PI.A's. A couple's SSW is the actuarial present

value of the husband's PI.A and one of the following:

        1) the dependent wife's allowance of 50 percent of her hus—

           band's PIA while he is alive and the survivor's benefits
                                                                       15




           of •82.5 percent contingent on his death when her PIA is

           less than 50 percent of his

       2) the wife's PIA while the husband is alive and the survivor's

           benefit when her PIA is greater than 50 percent of his but

           less than 82.5 percent

       3) the wife's PIA alone if it is greater than the survivor's

          benefit

The present value was calculated at several real discount rates. The

SSW variable used here was based on a real discount rate of 3
                                                                percent.
The size of the coefficient estimate for SSW varies directly with the

discount rate, but other results do not change.

      An individual's initial endowment of wealth and unexpected

changes in wealth can influence life—cycle behavior. On the other

hand, savings and realized capital income arise from an optimal plan

that redistributes consumption and leisure over time. Therefore,

capital income should have no independent influence on any one per-

iod's consumption or labor supply.   Unfortunately the data contain

no direct measure of endowed or accumulated wealth or capital gains

or losses over time. The CPS income information
                                                  reports property
income as the sum of interest payments, dividends and rental income,

and other income. The IRS data give the amount of total dividends

and the taxable portion of interest received by an individual from

bonds, debentures, notes, mortgages, personal loans, bank deposits,

and savings accounts. The larger amount in capital income reported
                                                                      16




 from the CPS and IRS   is   denoted KINC. Results will be presented in-

cluding capital income In the model even though it should not have

an independent effect on life—cycle labor supply. An argument can

be made that capital income may capture the effect of initial endow-

ments or unexpected capital gains or losses and therefore should be

in the model. KINC enters the model through the shadow price equa-

tion. It is important to note that the results remain unchanged

when KINC is excluded (as will be shown in Appendix B).

      The SSA information also contains summary measures of a per-

son's recent earnings experience. Average monthly earnings based

on the five years of highest earnings serves as an indicator of a

person's potential market wage. This Is multiplied by 12 to yield

average yearly earnings, AYE, which is used as an explanatory van—

able In the wage equation. This is done because the SSA uses nominal

earnings in each year for computing the AME's without adjusting for

wage growth or price inflation. Therefore, assuming that nominal

earnings grow, AYE is an average of five recent yearly wages. A

problem with AYE is that only annual amounts up to the maximum

taxable earnings under the law in each year are used)0 This trun-

cation on earnings introduces a downward bias In AYE as a yearly

wage estimate. However, the SSA describes a person's pattern of

employment and from this description a binary variable, MAX, is set

equal to 1 when a person always earned the maximum taxable amount

and 0 otherwise. Putting MAX Into the wage regression yields an
                                                                      17




estimate of the percentage increase in wages for persons who always

earn the maximum or more. The equation used here to
                                                      predict wages
is not the traditional wage equation in the sense that wage is gen-

erated by schooling, experience, and background variables as devel-

oped by Griliches (1977), Gronau (1973), Mincer (1974), and Chamber-

lain (1975, 1977). Rather lagged wages measured by AYE and MA) serve

as predictors of current wage along with other variables from the

traditional model which will be used also.

      Variables that influence both market wage and shadow price are

the number of years of schooling (SCHOOL) and binary variables for

race (RACE   1 for whites), residence in a rural area (RURAL), and

age (DAGE    1 for persons whose age equals ACE). Residence in the

South (SOUTH) is an additional binary variable in the wage equation.

      The age that a person attains in 1972 is used as his observed

age. Month of birth is given in the data. The number of weeks that

a person works is given in categories which are 1—13, 14—26, 27—39,

40—48, 49—52 weeks. The number of weeks worked is approximated by

the m.idpoint of the category in which a person falls. Most people

who work are in the 49—52 weeks category (see Appendix C) so the mid-

point approximation does not pose any significant problem. A person

is said to have retired when weeks worked in 1972 end before his

month of birth. In other words, retirement status is defined by

stopping work before reaching one's next year of age in 1972. A

fortiori, this includes persons who retired before 1972. The natural

assumption is that retirement is planned around the time a specific
                                                                        18




 age is attained. Therefore, the participation model discussed in

 Section III becomes a retirement model when DP — 1
                                                    for working Into
 or beyond one's month of birth.

       Actuarial reduction of benefits is computed to the month of re-

 tirement. If a person under age 65 worked, actuarial reduction is

 based on the number of months between the last month of work and the

 month and year in which a person attains age 65.

       The actual number of hours a person worked during the week be-

 fore the March 1973 CPS is given. This observation on hours per week

 Is multiplied by weeks worked in 1972 to yield an estimate of annual

hours worked in 1972 for the sample of full—time workers. Observed

wages are obtained for this sample when their 1972 earnings are di-

vided by annual hours. The wage equation is estimated over the sam-

ple of full—time workers and the log of wage, LWAGE, is the left—hand

side variable. If a person worked on a full—time basis in 1972 but

hours worked were not reported for the survey week, the value for

hours per week was set at 40. This attempts to avoid survey—week

selectivity bias as defined and discussed by Eanoch (1976b).

      The entire sample under study consists of married men aged

60—70 years whose CPS, SSA, and IRS records are properly matched.

These men are insured under OASI, not covered by the railroad retire-

ment .system, and not employed by the federal or a state government.

This was done so that responses to social security would not be con-

fused with the effects of other pension programs. Also, the persons
                                                                     19




 in the sample did not receive welfare income, unemployment compensa-

tion, or disability payments. In this way, income maintenance pro-

grams other than social security do not influence the behavior under

study.

       Wage, schooling, and age of wives may influence husbands'

shadow price of time. These variables are added to the shadow price

equation and are denoted LWAGEW, SCHOOLW, and AGEW, respectively.

       Given the variables defined in this section, the equations

discussed generally in Section III can be specified. The market

wage equation is:


(1')     LWAGE      a + a AYE + a MAX + a SCHOOL + a SOUTH
                     0               1           2   3       k

                             5               6           1




The shadow price equation is:


(2')     lnS8+8KINC+8ScHOOL+8RUPL+8CE
               o             5   16              3


                  + 8 AGEW + B LWAGEW + B SCHOOLW + bDAGE + e
                         7               8           9           2



Since shadow price is not observed, eq. (2') cannot be estimated

directly. The two—step probit analysis presented in Section III

provides an indirect method for estimating the B's.

       Although SSW is not an explanatory variable in the wage or

shadow price equations, It enters the del through Its influence

on lifetime resources and net wage, as discussed In Pellechio
                                                                          20




     (1978). Letting k be the rate of accumulating SSW and t be the tax

    rate implicit in the earnings test at the margin of just working and

    earning some income, the shadow price and net wage comparison under-

    lying the retirement decision can be expressed as:


               s >   w[1 + SSW (k+ t)]

    By taking the log of this equation, SSW can enter the model
                                                                  separately.
    Even though a tore precise specification for including SSW can be de-

    rived, simply adding SSW as a separate variable in the participation

    index [see Section III, eqs. (3) and (4)] is in the spirit of using a

    linear specification as a first approximation to the model's function-

    al form.

          The variables used in the retirement model are listed and sum-

    marized in Table 1. The effect of SSW on retirement is the main

    focus of study.

V. Empirical Results

      This section presents estimated retirement models for various

age groups in the full sample of married men aged 60—70 years. The

sample is divided into age groups based on prior considerations for

which support can be found in the empirical results. To begin,

there is a technical reason for estimating the model in separate age

groups when the observed proportion of those who retire rises with

age. A "different" equation may be required to approximate these

changing retirement probabilities; the equation is "different" in

the sense that its coefficients change in different age groups.

      The first step in estimating the model is a probit analysis

of retirement based on the variables in eqs. (1') and (2') and SSW.

SSW is included because retirement is a dynamic decision in the life—

cycle model. This requires adding the capital value of social se-

curity benefits that will be received during full retirement. The

behavior of individuals in the 62—64 year old age group can illus-

trate the importance of the life—cycle approach. These individuals

are eligible for benefits subject to actuarial reduction for early

retirement. If this reduction is fair to an individual, there is no

incentive to retire early and accept a reduced benefit If retirement

Is financed from private assets and social security. If a person

wants to retire early, he can wait for his full benefit and finance

early retirement from private assets with no loss In capital value

of total resources. Therefore, there is no incentive to collect

benefits early in a life—cycle model of behavior.
                                                                      23




       Social security can raise lifetime resources by yielding a

 higher—than—market rate of return arid the resulting wealth effect

 could induce early retirement. Higher SSW may obviate private

 financing of this retirement. For men age 60—70 in 1972 who did not

 pay social security taxes over their whole working lives, their

 lifetime resources are likely to have been increased by the insti-

 tution and gradual growth of social security.   Thus, actuarial reduc-

 tion would only mitigate the overall wealth effect in the sample

under study here. This wealth effect could lower labor supply in all

periods of life. However, due to institutional constraints, it may

be difficult to lower hours worked per week or weeks worked per year

during full—time working years. If this is the case, the relevant

margin for reducing lifetime labor supply is the timing of retirement.

Consequently, social security may induce early retirement through a

constrained wealth effect. The coefficient for SSW in the retirement

model measures a partial or full wealth effect on labor supply work-

ing through the retirement decision.

      The opportunity to avoid actuarial reduction and accumulate ad—

ditional benefit credits through earnings as discussed in Pellechio

(1978) provides an argument for observing SSW act as an incentive not

to retire between ages 62 and 64. Holding wage constant, higher

social security wealth might imply a higher rate of return from social'

security. In this way, social security acts as a net wage subsidy.

However it is not likely that significant increases in the present

value of benefits can be gained for working between ages 62 and 65,
                                                                       24




 especially since the 1972 legislation changed the computation of the

benefits base (AME5O, see Section IV) to cover earnings in years to

age 62 back from age 65.   It is important to add that the earnings

test applied in the social security program reduces benefits only

after earnings exceed a certain amount. Consequently, at zero labor

Supply the marginal tax rate of the earnings test is zero. Therefore,

the reduction in benefits due to the earnings test should not be

responsible for early retirement effects observed in the estimates of

the retirement model.

      Actuarial reduction was the main   reason   for estimating the model

separately for 62—64 year olds. The estimated coefficient for SSW

should be interpreted as measuring the net impact of the effects dis-

cussed above. Subsequent refinements in specifying the model and de-

fining the variables may permit estimating the wealth, accumulation,

and substitution effects separately (see Pellechio, 1978).

      Persons aged 60—61 years are not eligible to receive benefits,

but an accurate potential benefit can be computed from their average

monthly earnings nonetheless and SSW can be calculated from these

benefits. However there should be no explanatory power associated

with benefits that cannot be received. Thus these ineligible persons

serve as a control group——if social security does influence their

labor force participation, then there is correlation without causality

in the estimates.
                                                                      25




      Persons. aged 65 and over are eligible to receive their full

benefits. If they postpone retirement, benefits are increased by

only 1 percent annually. Such a low benefit increase for working

beyond age 65 would encourage retiring because delaying retirement

lowers the present value of benefits at a market rate of interest

greater than 1 percent. Therefore, at least in the over-65 age

group, higher SSW should induce retirement since the higher is SSW,

the greater the loss from postponing retirement.

      Table 2 presents probit estimates of the retirement model

based on eqs. (1') and (2') and SSW over the three age groups dis-

cussed above. For each variable in these equations and SSW, the

estimated value of its coefficient in the participation index,

discussed in Section III, is given.

      For 60—61 year olds, the coefficient estimate for SSW is small

and insignificant compared to those in the other age groups. Since

60—61 year olds are not eligible for retirement benefits, social

security should not affect their retirement and the supporting em-

pirical evidence is encouraging. The life—cycle model does suggest

that raising lifetime resources through SSW could change desired

labor supply in all periods. Thus, being ineligible to receive bene—

fits does not entirely preclude SSW's having an effect on labor sup-

ply. However, as mentioned, institutional work arrangements may not

allow individuals to adjust their labor supply in all periods to

desired levels. The timing of retirement may be where changes in

lifetime labor supply in response to social security occur. Since

 it is still a period of
                           accumulating SSW for 60—61 year olds, an in—

 significant, small coefficient estimate for SSW could result from the

 wealth effect being offset'by the incentive to work and gain credit

 for higher future benefits. However the wealth effect should be

 dominant for 61—61 year olds who paid nothing into the social secur-

 ity program before it was established and little
                                                    during its early
 stages, but obtained full coverage. Evidence that   social   security
 has no effect on the labor force
                                    participation of persons ineligible

 to receive benefits indicates that its observed significant effect

 on the retirement behavior of eligible persons is a causal relation-

ship.

        In the 60—61 year old sample, the only variable having a sig-

nificant effect on work is MAX, indicating that a person who always

worked and earned the maximum taxable amount is likely to continue

working. Permanent unobserved determinants of labor supply may in-

duce a positive correlation between labor force participation before

and after the observed period [Hall (1975) discusses this in the

context of the negative income tax experiments). In addition to

measuring a wage effect, MAX may also be serving as a serial corre—

lation variable controlling for unobserved labor supply determinants.

        The transition from actuarially reduced to full benefits in—

creases social security's effect on retirement. The rate of accumu-

lating SSW is reduced by moving out of the range In which benefits

are actuarially increased for later retirement and into the period
                                                                          29




for receiving full benefits where delaying retirement increases

benefits by an insignificant amount. Consequently, postponing re-

tirement decreases SSW and the larger is SS', the greater is the cap-

ital loss. Such losses are avoided by retiring.

        The quantitative impact of the variables in Table 2 on retire—

merit is not inediately apparent from the coefficient estimates re-

ported there. The estimated probability of labor force participation,

or, in other words, of not being retired, is:

                            J
(10)     P(DP    1)      1
                         -
                                f(t)dt

where     is the participation index discussed in Section III and es-

timated in Table 2, and f is the standard normal density function.

It follows that:



(11)            f(J )b
                      0 x

where x is any variable in J arid b is x's
                           0      x          coefficient   estimate in

   (these coefficient estimates are given in Table 2). For example,

when x is SCHOOL, bSCHOOL is the estimate of (a3 —           .   As can
                                                   cx3)/a0
be seen, the effect of one variable depends on the net result of its

influence on market wage and shadow price and the values for all the

other variables through f(J0). Using the example of a white married

male aged 62 years with twelve years of schooling who resides neither

in the South nor a rural area with a nonworking wife of the same age

and education and has values of AYE and KINC equal to their mean
                                                                     30




values for 62—64 year olds, the point estimate of —0.174 for SSW in-

dicates that a $10,000 increase in social security wealth centered on

its mean value of $46,016 raises the probability of retirement by

0.05. For the same male aged 65 years, SSW's point estimate of —0.255

raises the retirement probability by 0.08 for the same $10,000 in-

crease around a mean value of $46,115. This provides some quantita-

tive reference point for the estimates in Table 2.

      By estimating the wage equation arid using imputed wages in the

second probit step, the wage effect is summarized in a single coeffi-

cient. When this is done, estimated probabilities of retirement by

wage, and benefit amounts can be calculated. Regressing observed

wages in the sample of full—time workers on all variables in the re-

tirement model is the intermediate step in the analysis. The coeffi-

cient estimates in Table 2 are used to construct M(J0), an estimate of

the inverse of Mill's ratio discussed in Section III. This variable

is added to the wage regression to correct potential bias in coeff i—

cient estimates induced by selecting the sample of full—time workers.

This does not imply that the first probit analysis produced biased

estimates; it was carried out over the full sample so there is no

selectivity problem. Since the intermediate step is not the focus

of study, estimated wage equations for the three age groups are pre-

sented arid discussed in Appendix A.

      In the first probit step, the wage effect is dispersed through

the variables in eq. (1'). By using imputed wages in the second pro—

bit step, three things are accomplished:
                                                                        3].




       1) the wage effect is measured by the coefficient estimate for

             imputed wage, or, in other words, the dispersed wage effect

             in the reduced form is pulled together into one coefficient;

      2) having swept out the cx's, the shadow price coefficients,

             the 8's, are identified;

      3) the variation in SSW in the second step is net of its

             correlation with wage. Even though SSW does not appear

             in the wage equation, it is included in the wage regres-

             sion to avoid inducing bias in its second step coefficient

             estimate.

      The first probit step consistently estimates the reduced form

effects of variables in the model on the probability of retirement.

These results shown in Table 2 provide strong evidence that social

security influences retirement behavior through SSW. The wealth

effect and the associated losses in SSW from continuing work induce

retirement. The main empirical results are obtained from the first

probit step on which this Study could conclude. However, as de-

scribed in Section III and provided consistent estimates are still

obtained,11 the second step identifies the structural parameters in

the model.

      Estimates of the retirement model using imputed wages are pre—

sented in Table 3. Higher wages significantly raise the probability

of working for persons eligible to receive benefits aged 62 and

over. This contrasts with Quinn's (1975) result that there is
                                                                         32

little wage effect. This can probably be explained by his not

having the benefit amount in his niodel. The wage effect for 60—61

year olds is significantly positive but less than that for 62—70

year olds.

      The same pattern of responses to social security wealth given

in Table 2 is repeated in the second point analysis. It was speci-

fied that SSW does not appear in the wage equation so that its coef-

ficient estimate should not change in the second step. However bene-

fits are based on an average of a person's earnings which are the

product of wage and labor supply. Since the benefit formula is pro-

gressive a negative coefficient on SSW could be obtained from a wage

effect working through this formula. Having SSW in the wage regres-

sion as a statistical requirement also attempts to deal with this

problem. Consequently obtaining the same strong impact of SSW again

empirically supports the proposed life—cycle responses to social

security. The insignificant small coefficient estimate for SSW for

ineligible persons lends support to interpreting effects on eligible

persons as a causal relationship. The SSW coefficient estimates are

significantly negative for 62—70 year olds indicating again a wealth

effect inducing retirement. SSW has a greater impact on the proba-

bility of retirement for 65—70 year olds. This is the correct dynam-

ic life—cycle pattern when the rate of accumulating SSW decreases as

it does going from actuarially reduced to full benefits.
                                                                   35




      The wage effect has been sunarized in one significantly esti—

mated coefficient and removed from other variables' influences on re-

tirement. Therefore using the results in Table 3, estimated retire—

ment probabilities can be calculated for different wage and benefit

amounts. This was done for married males with twelve years of school-

ing residing outside the South or a rural area with a nonworking wife

of the same age and education and having the mean value of KINC for

their respective age groups. The top half of Table 4 presents the es-

timated retirement probabilities for a person aged 62 years at various

wage and SSW levels. SSW has a mean value of $46,016 and a standard

deviation of $11,536 in the 62—64 age group so with slight interpola-

tion in Table 4, an increase in SSW from one standard deviation below

to one standard deviation above the mean raises the probability of re-

tirement by 0.12 to 0.16 for wages between $3 and $7 per hour.

      In the bottom half of Table 4, retirement probabilities are cal-

culated for a male aged 65. Increasing SSW from one standard devia-

tion ($11,666) below the mean of $46,115 to one above raises the re-

tirement probability by 0.14 to 0.25 for wages between $3 and $7 per

hour. For both examples in Table 4, socIal security's effect on re-

tirement is significant.

      The coefficient for LWAGE in the second probit step is the in-

verse of a', the standard error in eq. (9). The coefficient for SSW

is its coefficient in the retirement model relative to this standard

error, 6/a'. Consequently, by dividing the coefficient estimate for

  SSW by that for LWAGE, an estimate of 6 is obtained. This
                                                            estimate is
  0.15 for 62—64 year olds and 0.19 for 65—70 year o].ds. By the
                                                                 same
 calculation, coefficients for variables in the shadow price equation

 are identified. For example, the
                                      estimate of 8, the LWAGEW coeffi-
 cient, is 0.23 for 62—64 year olds and
                                           0.14 for 65—70 year olds.
       The estimates for capital income's effect on retirement change

 substantially for 62—64 and 65—70 year olds from Table 2 to Table 3.

 As can be seen in Appendix A, KINC has a significant positive
                                                               coeffi-
 cient in the wage regression
                              even though KINC was not specified in the
 wage equation. There is no direct causal
                                              relationship between wages
 and capital income. However,
                                 unobserved personal characteristics such
 as ability, preferences for market work, and accumulation of private

 assets and other special aptitudes and traits that are common in

having both high wages and assets can produce the observed relation-

ship between KINC and wage. When this
                                          common effect is taken out by
imputing wages from a regression on all the
                                               variables, KINC's coeffi-
cient is significantly
                         negative for 60—61 year olds. This is an ex-
pected result and serves to illustrate the
                                              additional information
gained from the two—step procedure.

      Raving KINC in the model raises a
                                           specification issue. If cap-
ital income should enter the model
                                      as exogenous nonlabor income, net
worth or the change in net worth based on total accrued gains and

losses is the appropriate variable.
                                       Actually, potential capital in-
come based on Hick's (1946,
                              p. 172) definition of income is the rele-
vant variable. Whether or not a person realizes income
                                                          from   his
                                                                        38




 assets may depend on his retirement decision.   Thus, it can be argued
 that KINC is an endogenous variable that induces bias in other coef-

 ficient estimates. Also, as discussed in Section IV, the life—cycle

 model implies that capital income should have no independent influence

 on consumption or labor supply in any one period unless it is measur-

 ing the effect of initial endowments or unexpected changes in net

worth. For these reasons the model was estimated excluding KINC and

 the results were unchanged (see Appendix B which presents reduced—form

results obtained from repeating the first—step probit analysis of the

model without KINC——these results should be compared with those in

Table 2).

      The only other variable having a significant effect on a mar-

ried man's labor force participation Is his wife's wage. The signifi-

cant positive coefficient estimate for LWAGEW implies that husbands'

and wives' time are complements in household utility. Even If LWAGEW

just indicates that a wife has worked the same Implication can be

drawn. The other variables in the model show no significant pattern

of retirement effects.

      Private pension variables are an obvious omission In the model.

However, holding the variables in the model——in particular, wages——

constant, potential private pension benefits are likely to be uncor—

related with social security benefits and wealth.   Thus, leaving out

private pension variables would not affect the results. Private pen-

sion formulas for Integrating benefits with social security suggest a

possible negative correlation between the two. This Implies that the
                                                                        39




results reported here underestimate social security's impact on retire—

ment.

        Since AYE is an average of past earnings, unobserved labor sup-

ply determinants may be measured in AYE also. Thus AYE could be in-

cluded in the shadow price equation due to its possible correlation

with shadow price through these determinants. For the same reason,

MAX could also be included in the shadow price equation. This
                                                                 sug-

gests including AYE and MAX along with LWACE in the second probit

step. The reduced—form results in Table 2 from the first probit step

remain unchanged. Again, the analysis of social security's effect on

retirement could be based and concluded on the results in Table 2.

        In this study benefits depend on a person's history of wages

and labor supply for at least the last twenty years through the cal-

culation of average monthly earnings as the benefit base. It can be

argued that a person's labor supply also depends on his entire wage

and employment experience. Consequently a person's benefit and com-

plete labor market experience cannot vary independently. Benefits

are only a complicated nonlinear transformation of the fully speci-

fied labor supply model. Any estimated effect of social security

really only measures the effects of the variables in the full model

working through the function used to define benefits. A social se—

curiy effect cannot be identified in this idealized model of labor

supply. A reasonable reply to this argument makes the point that

labor supply in any one period depends on employment experience of a
                                                                               40




 few years rather than twenty years or more. The assertion being made

 in this study is that because benefits
                                              vary independently of the em—
 ployinent   experience that possibly influences labor sUpply, social se-
 curity   can have   an independent   impact on   the decision to retire.
 This   assertion is strengthened by the fact that people were covered by

 social security at different times in their employment histories as

 the program developed.


 VI. Stmimary and Conclusion

        This study examined the effect of social security on retirement

 decisions of married men aged 60—70 years. A life—cycle model of

 labor supply provided the framework for specifying the model for em-

pirical study. Market wage and shadow price equations were the foun-

dation of analysis. Added to this standard framework for labor supply

study was social security wealth defined as the present value of bene-

fit income that a person would receive in full retirement. This ad-

ditional variable came from the life—cycle model's
                                                           optimality condi-
tions for labor supply and measures social security's influence on re-

tirement.

        A two—step probit analysis was developed in order to identify

the structural parameters of the model.        In this way, the coefficients

in the shadow price equation could be estimated even though shadow

price is not observed. In addition, this yielded a single coefficient

estimate swnmarizing the effect of the market wage on retiring. The

wage effect was also cleared from the coefficient estimates for other
                                                                         41



 variables.    The variables in the retirement model were defined from

 data containing accurate information on persons' full potential social

 Becurity   benefit whether or not any benefit payment vas actually made.
         The retirement model was estimated separately over three age
groups   in the 60—70 year old range of the full sample. In the 62—64

and 65—70 year old samples of men eligible for benefits, social secu-

rity significantly raised the probability of retirement.    A two stan-
dard deviation increase in social security wealth centered on its mean

value raised the estimated retirement
                                        probability by 0.15 for 62—64
year olds and 0.22 for 65—70 year olds. As expected, actuarial reduc-

tion lessened the impact for 62—64 year olds. For 60—61 year olds

covered by social security but ineligible for receiving benefits, the

estimated effect of social security was small   and insignificant. This
supports the conclusion that the observed effect on the retirement of

eligible persons is a causal relationship. It also suggests that in-

stitutional work arrangements may make retirement the relevant margin

for altering lifetime labor supply in response to social security.

      These results caution against assuming that retirement age is

fixed when studying social security's or any other retirement program's

effects on individual behavior or considering changes in these pro-

grams. Furthermore, being a large, important income maintenance pro-

gram, social security should minimize work disincentives.

                                 Notes


      1. Social security benefit payments to retired workers and

their dependents and survivors amounted to $37 billion in fiscal year

1972. Private pension programs paid out $10 billion in benefits in

1972. Financial statements on the social security program can be

found in the annual reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal

Old—Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance. A good

presentation of the old age, survivors, and disability insurance

(OASDI) program can be found in OASDI Digest (see U.S. Department of

Health, Education, and Welfare, Social Security Administration, 1974).

The principal source which describes changes in program definitions

and provisions and presents annual data on covered workers, earnings,

and benefit payments is the Annual Statistical Supplement of the

Social Security Bulletin. Skolnik (1976) describes private pension

programs and estimates coverage, contributions, number of beneficiaries,

and benefit payments under these programs.

      2. At present an individual can earn $3,000 in a year without

losing any social security retirement benefit. Once the $3,000 exempt

amount is exceeded, the retirement test is administered on a monthly

basis where $1 in benefits is lost for every $2 of earned income over

$250 in a given month. It is important to note that if earnings ax—

ceed $250 in some months but yearly earnings do not exceed $3,000,

the retirement test is not applied in any month of the year. Since

retirement is tested solely through earned income, this vechanism
 viii be called the "earnings test."

         3. Income from accumulated private assets is another major

 source of retirement income. The effect of social security on pri—

 vate capital accumulation has been the subject of recent theoretical

 and empirical study by Feldstejn (1974, 1977), Feldstein and Peliechio

 (1977a), Munnel (1974, 1976), Kotlikoff (1977a, b), and Barro (1977).

        4. An excellent review of these surveys and findings can be

found in Bixby (1976).

        5. See Heckman (l974a, p. 85), Griliches (1977), and Chamber-

lain (1977).

        6. A justification of this linear specification for adding

SSW is given in Section IV.

        7. Obtaining a single estimate of the wage effect by using

imputed wages is also proposed by Gronau (1977). The method proposed

here was developed independently.

        8. This derivation is carried out by Heckman (1974a&b, 1977).

Eanoch (l976a) points out the restrictive features of this model and

presents a general formulation.

        9. See Aziz, Kilss, and Scheuren (1978) for a description and

documentation of the data.

       10. As a result of this truncation, the maximum value of AYE

is   $8,040.
                                                                    44




      11. There is a problem in using imputed wages which is that

the residual vector from ordinary least squares estimation of the

wage equation is not homoscedastic in small samples. Therefore a

probit specification can give inconsistent estimates. The sample

size used here may be large enough so that the asymptotic normal dis-

tribution of the shadow price error minus the wage regression resid-

ual justifies the probit specification. Nonetheless the second

probit step may be misspecified which should be noted.

                            WAGE EQUATION ESTIMATES


         Results from estimating the wage equation over the three age

 groups with and without the correction for sample selection are pre-

sented in Table A. The dependent variable is the log of observed

hourly wage. The regressions account for at least 40 percent of the

variation in logged wages with AYE and MAX adding significantly to ex-

planatory power. An average of lagged wages was expected to be a good

predictor of current wages. The regressions were intended to predict

individuals' potential market wages and not to serve as estimates of

the traditional wage equation. SSW is present not for structural

reasons, but to clear its coefficient estimate in the second step of

a wage effect working through the benefits formula (see p. 34 in the

text).

         Even though M(30) is a nonlinear function of the other variables

it caused problems in getting precise estimates.      Since the main ob-

jective was prediction and not estimation of the traditional wage

equation, the log   of   wages were imputed based on the regressions with-
out   M(30) as an explanatory variable.
