                       CYCLICAL PRICING OF DURABLE GOODS


                                   ABSTRACT



     I examine price markups in monopolisticly-competitive markets that

experience fluctuations in demand because the economy experiences cyclical

fluctuations in productivity.    Markups depend positively on the average

income of purchasers in the market.    For a nondurable good average income of

purchasers is procyclical; so the markup is procyclical.      For a durable good.

however. the average income of purchasers is likely to decrease in booms

because low income consumers of the good concentrate their purchases in boom

periods; so the markup is likely countercyclical.    This is particularly true

for growing markets.    I find markups make the aggregate economy fluctuate

more in response to productivity if goods are sufficiently durable.
