                     Do Long—Term Interest Rates Overreact
                         to Short—Term Interest Rates?



                                   ABSTRACT



        This paper   examines the hypothesis that financial markets are myopic

by studying the term structure of interest rates. White      rejecting deci-
sively the traditional expectations hypothesis regarding the term structure,

our statistical results also lead us to conclude that long term interest

rates do not overreact to either the level or the change in short term

rates. This finding suggests that participants in bond markets are not

myopic or overly sensitive to recent events. Our statistical results also

suggest that most variations in the yield curve reflect changes in liquidity

premia rather than expected changes in interest rates.

        The term structure of interest rates has been extensively studied

by economists. It is of interest to financial economists because of

its close connection with the pricing of bonds of different maturities.

More    important, understanding the term structure of interest rates is
also critical to the evaluation of the effects of'    alternative

macroeconomic policies. For example, it is widely believed that the

monetary authority can most directly control short—term interest rates,

but that aggregate demand depends primarily on long—term interest

rates.' If this conviction is correct, the monetary transmission niecha—

nism relies on the behavior of the term structure of interest rates.

       During the first few months of 198h, the yield curve has been very

steep by historicial standards. The yield on twenty—year bonds has been

about 300 basis points above the yield on three—month Treasury bills.

Only rarely have such large spreads been observed in the past.2 The

yield   curve   is widely interpreted as reflecting market participants'

conviction that interest rates will rise over the next several years

under the pressure of large Federal deficits. It is sometimes even

suggested that because of such expectational effects, prospective

Federal deficits are exerting a dampening effect on the current level of

economic activity. These arguments presume that long rates reflect


    1For example, in the simple IS—LM irodel of Richard H. Clarida and
Benjamin M. Friedman, "Why Have Short—Term Interest Rates Been So High?,"
BPEA 2:1983, pp. 553—578, the short rate enters the LM curve but the
long rate enters the IS curve.

    2The average spread between twenty—year bond yields and three—month
bill yields over the past two decades is 96 basis points; the standard
deviation is 136 basis points. The average since October 1979 is 110;
the standard deviation is 206.

market expectations of future short rates.   In   this paper, we examine

this view of the yield curve.

     Most work on the term structure is based on some variant of the

expectations hypothesis. This hypothesis holds that the long—term

interest rate is a weighted average of present and expected future

short—term interest rates. An approximately equivalent form of the

hypothesis holds that the expected one period holding returns on

riskiess bonds of all maturities are the same or differ by constant

risk premia.3 Unfortunately, many investigators using various

techniques and data sets reject the joint hypothesis of rational expec-

tations and the expectations theory of the term structure.

     The failure of interest rates to Trove as the theory predicts is

not a new phenomenon. In 1938 Frederick Macaulay wrote the following:5


    3The approximate nature of the equivalence is discussed extensively
by John Cox, John Ingersoll and Stephen Ross, "A He—examination of
Traditional Hypotheses about the Term Structure of Interest Rates,"
Journal of Finance, September 1981. As demonstrated by Robert J. Shiller,
John Y. Campbell and Kermit J. Schoenholtz, "Forward Rates and Future
Policy: Interpreting the Term Structure of Interest Rates," EPEA, 1:1983,
the equivalence is exact after linearization.


    There are many recent examples. David S. Jones and V. Vance Roley,
"Rational Expectations and the Expectations Model of the Term Structure:
A Test Using Weekly Data," Journal of Monetary Economics 12, September
1983, perform regression tests on the holding returns on T—Bills of dif-
ferent maturities. Robert Shiller, "The Volatility of Long—Term Interest
Rates and Expectations Models of the Term Structure," Journal of
Political Economy, December 1979, performs volatility tests using six
different data sets on American and British interest rates. Shiller,
Campbell and Schoenholtz, "Forward Rates," find that long—term interest
rates have almost no predictive power for future short—term interest
rates.

            To preserve the thoeretical relationship between long
            term and future short term interest rates, the 'yields'
            of bonds of the highest grades should fall during a
            period in which short term rates are higher than the
            yields on bonds and rise during a period in which short
            term rates are lower. Now experience is ntre nearly the
            opposite.


As we show below, the test of the expectations theory derived under

the assumption of rational expectations is exactly the test Macauley

suggested almost fifty years ago. Moreover, the behavior of long rates

in   the recent period we examine is also "nearly the opDosite" from that
implied by the theory.
      While statistical rejections of   the expectations theory are ubi-

quitous, previous research has not made clear the substantive signifi-

cance of the failure of the theory. One problem with interpreting

previous test results is the absence of an economically meaningful

alternative hypothesis. In this paper, we embed the expectations

theory of the term structure within two wider classes of hypotheses.

We can thus form judgments as to whether the empirical deviation from

the expectations hypothesis is substantively important.

      The   first class of hypotheses includes a quantitative expression of
the notion that the long rate responds "too itch" to the contemporaneous
short rate. This alternative hypothesis is suggested by work on the
volatility   of long—term interest rates. Since the long rate is, under

the expectations hypothesis, a weighted average of expected future short

rates, the long rate should be a itch smoother series than the short

rate. Robert Shiller examines this smoothing property of the expec—
                                      _14 —



tations   hypothesis and finds that long rates are too volatile to be con-

sistent with the theory.6 The excess sensitivity hypothesis we examine

here is one possible explanation for this excess volatility.

      The excess sensitivity hypothesis is also suggested by evidence

that the response of interest rates to money supply announcements is

similar at all turities, even though standard theories suggest that

the response of long rates should be ouch more attentuated. Moreover,

this view appears to be widely held among participants in the bond

market, where it   is   conventional wisdom that "long rates follow short

rates."   This hypothesis is also implicit in the popular claim that
financial narkets "overreact" to news or are in some sense "myopic".
      Whether long rates are excessively sensitive to short rates has
important implications for macro—economic policy. Excess sensitivity,
for   example, would increase the potency of' monetary policy. A reduc-

tion in short rates would have a greater impact on long rates than

under the expectations hypothesis. Such an expansionary action by the

Federal Reserve would therefore have a greater impact on aggregate

demand.

       To our surprise, the results of our tests decisively reject the

notion that long rates are overly sensitive to short rates. The

results taken literally imply that current interest rates have a ouch

lower (sometimes negative) weight than theory would suggest and that

expected future short rates exert a disproportionate influence on long—

                                    —5—

tern rates. This literal interpretation of the results, however, does

not seem satisfactory. Alternatively, the results nay reflect the

failure of the assumption that market forecasts of future interest

rates represent rational expectations. These conclusions appear

robust, with similar results obtained from analyses of yields on short—

term and long—term bonds, and three—month and six—month Treasury bills.

      Using data on three—month arid six—month bills, we are also able to

examine the possibility that expectations are formed irrationally, with

excessive weight placed on the current short rate in forecasting future

short rates. We show that the observed behavior of the term structure

is also inconsistent with this view. Our estimates taken literally

imply that market participants place too little weight on the current

short rate in forecasting future yields.

      Having found that the excess sensitivity hypothesis cannot explain

the term structure, we turn to a second alternative hypothesis. This

second hypothesis assumes that the expectations theory holds except for

a random unexplained liquidity premium. The results suggest that, at

least at the short end of the term structure, the expectations theory is

not very useful in explaining the spread between long—term and short—

term interest rates. In particular, only one quarter of the variation

in the spread between six—month and three—month Treasury bill yields is

attributable to expected movements in short rates. The remainder is

attributable to movements in what are tautologically labelled liquidity

premia. Large and highly variable liquidity premia, especially within

the   very short end of the maturity spectrum, are not easy to understand.

                                   EXCESS SENSITIVITY



       In this section, we consider the hypothesis that long rates

overreact to short rates. We first examine the behavior of twenty—year

bonds and three—month bills. We then turn to examining the behavior of

three—month and six—month bills.


Long Rates an Short Pates


      Let rt be the one—period yield and Rt be the yield on a consol,

i.e., an infinitely—lived bond paying a fixed coupon each period. We

consider the following class of hypotheses of which the standard expec-

tations lpothesis is one special case:



(i)           =   6    +   (i—y)    )   1k Etrt+k
                                   k3
where 0 <   'y' < 1.   Et denotes the rational expectation conditional on

information available at time t. The term 6 is the risk premium. For

this section, we assume 6 is constant; in the next section, however, we con-

sider the possibility that the risk premium changes through time.

      The expectations theory of the term structure implies that

I =   l/(l+R*),   where R* is an average interest rate around which the

linearization is made. For lower values of I ,          greater   weight is given

to the contemporaneous short rate. The alternative hypothesis of excess

sensitivity is thus represented in equation (1) by a low value of I

Informally, excess sensitivity arises either if agents place too little
                                                          —7—


weight     on rationally expected future short rates or if agents irra-

tionally place too much weight on the current short rate in forecasting

future short rates.

      Equation (1) is easily transformed into a simple regression test

of the ixdel. Note that Ci)                   implies           (2):




(2)                    =   yO       +    (l—y)
           iRt+i                                          1k+l +lrt+k
                                                  k=l


Subtract (2) from (1) to obtain equation (3):



(3)        t —                  = (i—y)Q          +
                                                          (l_r)rt       —
                                                                            t+l
where 6t+l =           (l—y)            yk(Er              —
                                                                Etrt+k)
                            k1

The term           reflects new information about future short rates that

becomes available between time t and time t+l. Algebraic nipulation

of (3) yields (1k):


                   —            =                          (i—i)
                       R)               —(l—y)O       +                (R. —   rt)   +
                                                                                         6t+1/y
                                          I                     I
Equation    (4)   provides          a simple test of the model (i).

      How should we estimate equation V-i)?                             Ordinary least squares

produces consistent estimates only if the error term in the regression

is uncorrelated with the variables on the right hand                                 side.   The assump-

tion of rational expectations implies that this condition is satisfied
                                         —8—


here.   The error term        measures the "news" that arrived between

time t and time t+l. The right hand side variable, (Rt —         rt),   is


known at time t. If expectations are rationally formed, "news" should

not be predictable Iron known information. In this case, rational

expectations implies (R —     rt)   and        are uncorrelated. We can thus

estimate equation (14) using ordinary least squares.

    Equation (14) embodies both the standard expectations theory of the

term structure and the possibility of excess sensitivity of long rates

to current short rates. Under the expectations hypothesis, the coef-

ficient on (n —    rt)   is R*, i.e., roughly O.O2. If excess sensitivity

of long rates to short rates explains the failure of' the expectations

hypothesis, the estimated coefficient should exceed R*, implying an

estimate of I below l/(l+E*).

    The logic of equation (14)      is    fairly intuitive. Ignoring the risk

premium, equation (1) states that the long rate is a weighted average

of short rates, with tore recent short rates given greater weight than

more distant ones. If Et is greater than rt, then the short rate must

be rising. Next period's long rate Rt+1 must be higher than this

period's, as it gives greater weight to the higher future short rates.

Thus, according to both the expectations theory and the excess sen-

sitivity hypothesis, when the current long rate exceeds the current

short rate, the long rate will (on average) rise.




    TWith   quarterly data, the appropriate R* is the nean quarterly
interest rate,   which with our sample is 0.019.
                                       —9—

        We can give equation (14)   another intuitive interpretation. The

holding period return on long bonds is approximately

                             Rt —   t+i   —

The first term in this expression is the coupon yield, while the second

term is the capital gain or loss attributable to changes in the long

rate.     If' we regress this holding return less the short rate on

available information, we learn whether there are exploitable profit

opportunities. Rejecting the null }'pothesis that the coefficient in

(14) is R* is equivalent to finding statistically significant profit

opportunities.

     If markets were m,çopic, then when the short rate is high relative

to the long rate, the long rate would nonetheless be "too" high and the

price of a long bond "too" low. Holding long—term bonds would be a

profitable strategy. This would imply that, when regressing the excess

holding return on the spread, we would obtain a negative coefficient.

Finding a negative coefficient in this regression is precisely equiva-

lent to estimating a coefficient in (14) greater than R.

     Equation (14), and thus the original equation (1), is a consequence

of a variety of dels of asset returns. For example, It follows from

the now popular "consumption beta" model of asset returns. If all the

relevant variables in this del are jointly log—normal and homoske—

dastjc, then the ndel implies that excess return are not forecastable.8

In other words, except for a constant term that depends on variances and

Consumption, Risk Aversion and      the Temporal Behavior of Stock Market
Returns,t' Journal of Political     Econoit, 1983.   This is strictly true

                                      —10—

covariances, there are no expected profit opportunities in this model.

Any empirical failure of this implication implies either that the

"consumption beta" theory is wrong or that the relevant variances and

covariances change through time.9

     We estimate equation V4) using U.S. quarterly data from 1963:1 to

1983:14.       is the yield at the first week of the quarter on Treasury

securities of a constant maturity of twenty years. rt is the yield on

three—month Treasury bills. Table 1 presents the results.

     The coefficient on the spread (R —      rt)   has the wrong sign.

Regression (1.1) is the OLS estimate using th entire sample. The null

hypothesis that the slope coefficient is 0.02 is rejected at the five

percent level using a one—tailed test. Since the coefficient is nega-

tive, the hypothesis that it is larger than 0.02 is also rejected.

Thus, we reject the standard expectations theory of the term stucture,

but we also nist reject the excess sensitivity of long rates to current

short rates.

     In October of 1979,   the   Federal Reserve changed its operating pro-

cedure and began relying sore on targetting monetary aggregates and less

on targetting interest rates. One might suspect that this change in the

policy rule altered the relationship between interest rates of different

maturities. In fact, an examination of the residuals from regression

(1.1) indicates substantial heteroskedaticity coinciding with this

change in mDnetary regime. After the change in October 1979, the resi—

Asset Markets, and Macroeconomic Fluctuations," Journal of Monetary
Economics Supplement, Carnegie—Rochester Conference, Volume 17, 1982.
                                     —11—

dual variance is much greater.

        In regressions (1.2) and (1.3), we split the sample to examine

whether the change in policy rule affected the relation between long

rates and short rates. The estimates suggest there has been no shift in

this relation. In both subsaxnples, the coefficient has the incorrect

sign. The hypothesis that it is 0.02 is rejected for the earlier

period. It is not rejected for the latter period, since there are many

fewer observations and much greater residual variance. The residuals

from the split samples appear Gaussian. In particular, an examination

of the third and fourth inents indicates no skewness nor unusual kur—

tosis that might lead one to distrust the reported standard errors. The

rejection of the theory for the first subsample appears statistically

sound. Moreover, the point estimate for the second subsample indicates

that the theory has worked no better since 19T9)°

        Regression (i.1) uses the entire sample, but weights the two sub—

samples to correct for the heteroskadasticity. The weight is the

reciprocal of the root mean squared residual from equation (1).

Again, the coefficient is negative, and the null hypothesis that it is

0.02 or larger is rejected at the five percent level. The data support
neither the expectations hypothesis nor the excess sensitivity hypothe-
sis.

        These empirical results cannot be interpreted within the context

of equation (1). Equation (1) is valid only if y is between zero and


   10The change in the Fed operating procedures in 1979 roughly coin-
cides with the introduction of future markets in Treasury bills. While
one might have expected that the availability of future markets would,
by facilitating "yield curve arbitrage," improve the performance of the
expectations hypothesis, the point estimates suggest otherwise.

one. The coefficient estimates taken literally, however, imply that

is greater than one.   Nonetheless, we are left with the conclusion

that n,ropia does not explain the excess volatility of long—term

interest rates and the other rejections of the expectations theory.

     While our results imply that an investor could, on average, make

money by taking advantage of the failure of the expectations theory, the

risks involved are very large. For example, at the present time, the

profitable strate suggested by regression (l.4)    is   to go short in

three—month Treasury bills and to use the proceeds to buy twenty—year

bonds. The estimates indicate that a $1000 investment of this sort

would yield an expected profit of $28 in three nnths Less any transac-

tions Costs. Such an investment, however, is very risky. At the level

of uncertainty observed since 19T9, the standard deviation of this $28

profit is $165. The probability that this strategy would actually pro-

duce a loss exceeds forty percent. Thus, the failure of the expec-

tations theory does not imply the presence of relatively riskiess profit

opportunities.

     Potential problems with sample selection and data mining always

make the evaluation of statistical results difficult. For example, one

might argue that our results are attibutable to an unusual sequence of

inflation surprises over our sample period. A standard practice is to

check the validity of the conclusion on an independent data set. One

can view our regressions as just such a validity check. As we point out

in the introduction, Macaulay was aware that long rates do not ive as

the theory predicts. Moreover, he made his observation many years prior

to the beginning of our data set. Furthermore, Shiller reports estima-

tes of a regression equation parallel to (14) for six different data sets

covering a variety of different sample periods and interest rates.11 In

five of the six cases, the estimates slope coefficient is negative, and

in the sixth it is close to zero. In all cases, his results are con—

sisent with our finding that the failure of the expectations theory can-

not be related to excess sensitivity of the long rate. The results in

Table 1 are not just an artifact of recent experience, but appear to be

an empirical regularity.


Short Rates and Shorter Rates


     There are a number of potential objections to the test in the pre-

ceding subsection using long—term and short—term yields. The lineari-

zation on which the derivation depends may be an unsatisfactory

approximation for such long—term yields. It is also possible that

there is significant segmentation between the short—term and long—term

bonds markets, as investors may have differing "preferred habitats."

We can address both   of   these objections by examining yields only at the

short end of the term structure. Moreover, the use of short—term

instruments obviates the need to ndel expectations over a long horizon,

making possible the examination of a broader range     of   issues. This sec-

tion therefore develops tests of the term structure hypotheses similar

to    those in the preceding section for three—month and six—month Treasury

bills.

       Let rt be the one—period yield and Rt. be the two—period yield. We

consider this class of hypotheses:


(5)             =0      +   A   rt +       (l—x) Etrt+i.

For pure discount bonds, the expectations hypothesis posits that A =

In    this case, the yield from holding a two—period bond equals the

expected yield from holding two one—period bonds in sequence plus a

constant risk premium. Under the alternative hypothesis that the long

rate      is excessively sensitive to the short rate r, the current short

rate receives greater weight than under the expectations theory. That

is, the excess sensitiviety hypothesis implies A > 1/2.

       We can explicitly derive the excess sensitivity tdel for one arid

two—period bills under the assumption that expectations are partly

myopic. Let us suppose that the expectations theory of the term.truc—

ture holds hxt with expectations that are not necessarily rational.

That is,



(6)        Rt
                =   0   +
                            l,rt       +




where r+i is the rrket expectation of rt+l. Let us also suppose

that the nrket expectation is partly rational and          partly
myopic:

If w = 0, expectations are purely rational, If u                     1, expectations are

purely riop1c. Combiting (6) and (7), we obtain

expectations re partly 'opic (                   ' 0),   then A exceeds one half

and the two—period yie.d is excessively sensitive to the one—period

yield.

       We nov wish to manipulate (5) to derive a test of the ndel. As

in the last subsection, the properties of rational expectations permit

such a test. We first write the realized value                        as the sum of the

expected value Et?t+i and Hnewste £t÷1.


(9)                —


We now combine (5) and           (9),    Simple algebraic rearrangement yields:


(10)           (rt.1 —   R.)       —   ._L. + __. ( — r.)

As discussed above in connection with equation (14), the error term

         is uncorrelated with the right hand side variable, since

(Rt —    rt)    is known at time t Hence, we can estimate (10) using ordi-

nary least 8quares.

       Equation (10) provides another simple test of the standard expec—
                                              —i6—

tations     theory arid the excess sensitivity model. Under the expec-

tations theory, the coefficient on (Et —                 rt)   is one, since A =     1.     Ir

there is excess sensitivity, this estimated coefficient should exceed

one, implying A > 1t2. Thus, as in the previous subsection, a simple OLS

regression is capable of measuring the excess sensitivity of the

longer—term rate to the current short rate.

     Equation (10) is also intuitive. Ignoring the risk premium, (5)

implies that the two—period rate is a weighted average of the two con-

secutive one—period rates. Therefore, when the current long rate is

above the current short rate, the current long rate should be below

next period's short rate. A regression of (rt+l —                   R)    on (Ft —   rt)
should yield a positive coefficient.

     We can write equation (io) in two other equivalent ways. First,

by adding C;        —
                        rt)   to both sides of the equation, we obtain a

regression of (rt+1 —           rt)   on (Ft —    rt).   This new equation relates the

spread to the change in short rates. Second, by subtracting                           —
                                                                                           rt)
from both sides of (10), we obtain a regression of (rt —                         — rt+l))
on (mi, —    rt).   Under the null Fwpothesis that A =              lj,   the coefficient in

this regression is zero. This second equivalent form has a natural

interpretation. Since (2Rt —              rt+l)    is the one—period holding return on

a two—period bond, the left hand side variable is the difference in

holding return between short and long bonds. Under the expectations

theory, this excess return is not forecastable. The failure to find a

zero coefficient in this regression, or (equivalently) a coefficient of
                                            —17—

one in equation (10) ,     indicates       the existence of expected profit

opportunities.

      If' nrkets were    Irrjopic, then when the short rate is high relative

to   the   long rate, the long rate would nonetheless be "too" high and

the price of a long bond would be "too" low. Long bonds would thus be

profitable when the short rate is relatively high. A regression of the

excess return (rt —     (2R   —
                                  rt+l))    on the spread (R —   rt)   would yield a

positive coefficient. Finding a positive coefficient in this

regression is exactly equivalent to estimating A >               in equation (10).

      We   estimate equation (10) with U.S. quarterly data from 1963:1 to
l933:.     Rt is the yield at the first week of the quarter on six—ninth
Treasury bills, while rt is the yield on three—month bills. Table 2
presents the results.
      The coefficient on the spread has the wrong sign. Regression
(2.1) is the OLS estimate for the entire sample. The null hypothesis
that the coefficient     is one is rejected at the one percent level. The

parameter estimates, taken literally, imply insufficient rather than

excessive sensitivity of longer—term interest rates to short yields.

      The    residuals in regression (2.1), like those of regressions
(1.1), indicate     substantial heteroskadasticity associated with the

change     in Federal Reserve operating procedure in 1979. Regressions
(2.2) and (2.3) split the sample. In both subsamples, the sign of the
coefficient is incorrect. As for equation (4), the recent subsample has

too few observations to reject the expectations           hypothesis. Yet the

theory   is rejected for the earlier subsample, and the point estimates do

not indicate any structural change caused by the change in nnetary

policy regime. An examination of the residuals from regression (2.2)

indicates no skewness nor unusual kurtosis, suggesting they are at least

roughly Gaussian. As in the previous section, the rejection of the

expectations theory and   the   excess sensitivity trjpothesis appears sta-

tistically sound.12

     Regression (2.) again uses the entire sample, but weights the two

subsamples by the reciprocal of the root mean squared residual from

regression (2.1) to correct for heteroskedasticity. Again, the null

hypothesis that the coefficeitn is one or larger is rejected at the one

percent level. Again the estimate implies A <      0,   which taken literally

implies that the current short rate has a negative weight in forming

longer—term yields. This finding is clearly implausible, and we do not

suggest acceptance of this literal conclusion. This finding does indi-

cate, however, that the data are consistent with neither the expec-

tations hypothesis nor the excess sensitivity hypothesis.13

    As we note above, the excess sensitivity nodel for one and two—

period bills is equivalent to a xdel in which expectations are partly

myopic. The estimate in regression (2.) implies A is —0.89 and            is

   12These results raise the question of whether the results in the pre-
ceding subsection are due only to the failure of the expectations
hypothesis at the very short end of the term structure. This possibi-
lity was tested by replicating the previous tests with one—year and
20—year bonds. Very similar results were obtained.

   -3David Wilcox has recently performed regression (2.1) using weekly
data, correcting for the implied moving average error. He obtains a
slope coefficient of —0.040, with a standard error of 0.385. He also
examines the quarterly samples beginning at different weeks in the
quarter. For each subsample, the slope estimate is well below one,
                                     —19—

—2.8. Thus, in the nwopic expectations interpretation of the model, the

market expectation gives a negative weight to the current short rate and

an excessively large weight to the rational expectation. This interpre-

tation of the results is again implausible. It does indicate, however,

that the failure of the expectations theory cannot be easily explained

by an appeal to naive expectation formation.

        Observers of financial markets often comment that these markets

are Ijopic. The empirical results in both subsections decisively

reject a simple quantitative expression of this view. The implausibi—

lity of the results suggest that equations (1) and    (8)   are not satis-

factory models of the term structure. Taken on face value, the results

imply    that the market is hyperopic. They indicate that the market
gives    too little weight to contemporaneous fundamentals and too niich

weight to future fundamentals.

        A parallel phenomenon has been observed in the stock market.

Shiller finds that when current dividends are high relative to the

current price, the holding return on the stock market is high. Using

an argument similar to that used with regard to equation (i), this

suggests that the market gives too little weight to contemporaneous

dividends. Similarly, Sanjoy Basu shows with cross—sectional data that

when a company's current earnings are high relative to its price, the

company's stock will on average outperform the nErket.-5 Again, the

market price appears to give too little weight to contemporaneous ear-

nings. Thus, none of these violations of the efficient markets hjpothe—

sis is consistent with the alternative hypothesis of myopia.




An Alternative Model of Overreaction


        As we explain above, the excess sensitivity model we examine is

equivalent to a model in which investors irrationally place too large a

weight on the current short rate in forecasting future short rates.

Although this formulation appears a natural model of "irrational" expec-

tations, it is not the only possible one. In this subsection, we con-

sider another plausible model of overreaction. Instead of placing too

large a weight on the current level of the short rate, investors here

place too large a weight on the news contained in the current short

rate.

        Let us again suppose that the expectation theory holds:




(ii)        Rt =   8   + lrt + l/4+l

where r+i is the market expectation of rt+l. Let          be the innovation

in the short rate. In other words, Vt is the "news" about the path of

short rates that arrived in period t. Let us consider the possibility

to Their Price—Earnings Ratio: A Test of the Efficient Markets
Hypothesis," Journal of Finance, June 1977, pp. 663—682, and Sanjoy

                                                 —21—

that investors overreact to this news in forming their expectations.

That is, the following rule describes their expectations:



(12)               =
                        Etrt+l       +   4   V
If   $     0, then the market expectation is rational. If $ >        0,   then the

market overreacts to the current news about short rates.

         Algebraic manipulation of (ii) and (12) produces an equation simi—

lar to the one we estimate above:


(13) rt+1 — Rt         =   —20   +           — rt)      —   • Vt +

Thus, we obtain equation (10) with an additional term: the innovation in
the short rate.16          This alternative nde1 of overreaction suggests a

slightly different regression test)7

         To investigate this alternative model, we must obtain a measure of

the innovation in short rates. To do this, we InDdel the short rate as a

third order autoregressive process, although other specifications appear

to produce similar results. Estimation of this process yields:18




Economics 12, June 1983, pp. 129—156.

   l6Note that under the null hypothesis, the news term equals the
following period's residual (i.e., Vt = Ct). Our estimation strategy,
however, does not exploit this fact.

   1TThis test is analogous to the test of the permanent income hypothe-
sis suggested by Marjorie A. Flavin, "The Adjustment of Consumption to
Changing Expectations of Permanent Income," Journal of Political Economy
89, 1981.

   l8Sjnce we require three lagged short rates, the estimation in this
subsection is for the period 1963:4 to l983:1.

We use the residuals from this regression as measures of the innovation

in the short rate.

     Estimation of equation (13), with the heteroskadasticity correc-

tion, produces the following result:


     rt+1 —          = —0.05     —     0.40      (Rt —    rt)       +    0.03 v.

              D.W. = 2.04            s.e.        0.79


Thus, contrary to the implications of this alternative model of

overreaction, the innovation has a positive and insignificant coef-

ficient. Moreover, the coefficient on the spread remains negative and

significantly different from one.

     If we impose the restriction that the coefficient on the spread is

one, as implied by equation (13), the results are no more supportive of

the model. We find:


     rt+1 —          = —0.36     +     1.0          —
                                                         rt)    +       0.12 Vt

                                         —23—

Again, the coefficient on the innovation has the wrong sign. The data

do not appear consistent with the view that investors place too rmich

weight in recent "news" in forecasting future short rates.19

                          VARIABLE LIQUIDITY PHEIA


       The previous section demonstrates the failure of the expectations

theory of the term structure. The alternative hypothesis that long

rates respond too nuch to short rates cannot explain the rejection. The

purpose of this section is to show in another way that the failure is

substantively significant.

       Consider the following slight rrdification of the expectations

theory for one and two—period bills:


(in) Rt =      St   +   1/   rt +   1   Etrt+i


In this formulation, the long rate Rt differs from an average of the

current and future short rates by the term O. Our test above assumes

   is constant. In this section we make the less restrictive assumption

that S is uncorrelated with short rates.

       The term       can be interpreted in two alternative ways. First, we

can view 0. as a time—varying liquidity premium, i.e., the extra compen-

sation required to induce a lender to hold the longer—term bond. Edward

Kane   finds, based   upon   surveys of the expectations of market par-
ticipants,   that liquidity premiums are positive and time varying.20 Note


        analogous     test
                       can be derived for the case of short—term bills
and long—term bonds. The results were again not supportive of this
alternative ndel of overreaction.

                                       —2k—

that once it is extended to include a time—varying liquidity premium,

the expectations theory becomes almost vacuous. The liquidity premium

is a deus ex rnachina. Without an explicit theory of why there is such a

premium and why it varies, it has no function but tautologically to

rescue the theory. If fluctuations in the liquidity premium are needed

to account for a large fraction of the variance in the slope of' the

yield curve, then the expectations theory fails to provide a useful

guide for understanding these fluctuations. Estimating the extent of

variations in    the   liquidity premium thus provides a way   of' evaluating
the power of the expectations theory as a vehicle for understanding the

term structure of interest rates.

       A   second interpretation of the term O, is a   measure of the extent

to   which the nRrket fails to produce the "right" long rate given current
and expected future short      rates. In other   words, 0 is   the deviation of

the   nrket rate from the long rate based upon fundamentals.21 If the
variance of 0t is relatively small, we can conclude that the expec-
tations theory is      approximately correct.22 On   the other hand, if fluc-

tuations in O.     dominate fluctuations in expectations, then we can

conclude     that the expectations theory fails to capture the primary
feature of fluctuations in long rates.




      21The analysis here is parallel to that in Lawrence H. Summers, "Do
We Really Know That Financial Markets are Efficient?", NBER Working
Paper.
   22Explaining a mean value significantly different from zero would
also pose problems.

       The previous section derives a simple test of the expectations

theory. With the term 0t equation (10) becomes equation (15).


                     =                       —          —

                                     B(Rt         rt)

According to the theory, a =            —2       and B =     1.     Of course, 0 is not obser-

vable. The regressions in Table 2 thus omit this variable. Since 0 is

correlated with Re,, this omission leads to a biased estimate of B .                                In
particular, the estimate of B is the following.



(16)        B + a Cov(Rt — rt,Ot)/Var(Rt —                    rt)

Underthe null hypothesis that the model is correct (a = —2, B =                                1,
and Ut is uncorrelated with rt), the estimate of B becomes:

(17)     = 1 — 2 Var(Ot)!Var(Rt —                rt)

Thus, so long as O. is not constant, the estimate of B is biased

downward.

       Using (7) ,we can produce estimates of Var(Ut)/Var(Rt —                           rt)    from

our estimates in Table 2. See Table 3. From regression (2.i.), which uses

the entire sample and corrects for heteroskedasticity, we find that

Var(Ot)/Var(Rt —     rt)       is 0.7 with a standard error of 0.21. This ratio

has a very natural interpretation. Maintaining our                          assumption    that

is uncorrelated with short rates, equation (8)                         implies   the following:


(18) Var(Rt —    rt)       =
                                Var(Ot)          +     ]    Var(Etrt+i —   rt)

The variance of the spread between long and short rates is thus decom—

posed into variance in expected changes in short rates and Var(Ot).

This decomposition implies that expected changes in the short rate

account for only 26 percent of the variance in the spread between the

six—month and three—month Treasury bills. We can reject the null

hypothesis that Var(Ot)          0, while we cannot reject the null pothesis

that expected changes in the short rate account for none of the variance

in the spread between three—month and six—month bills.

       It is important to note that, although this unexplained liquidity

premdum   e appears   central to the spread between long and short rates,
it is relatively unimportant to the level of long rates. In particular,
we   can decompose the variance in the long rates as follows:

(19) Var(Rt) = Var(6t)                     +                      +
                             +
                                 Var(rt)       lVar(Etrt+i_rt)        Cov(rt,Etrt+i—rt)


Simple calculation demonstrates that Var(Rt) is nnich larger than
Var(Ot). In particular, Var(rt)/Var(Rt) is 1.05, while Var(Ot)/Var(Rt)
is only 0.01. Thus, although e is critical to ( — rt), its impor-
tance to understanding Rt is much less.23

      The data decisively reject the expectations hypothesis regarding the
term   structure of interest rates both statistically            and substantively.

   23The reason for this is that both short and long rates are highly
autocorrelated, and thus the variance of     is much greater than the
variance of (R —      rt).
                        For example, suppose  that rt followed an AR(i)
process with parameter 0.8 and that the expectations tjpothesis held
exactly. Then we can show that Var(Rt —             rt)
                                              would be one percent of

The alternative hypothesis that long rates are overly sensitive to short

rates is also decisively rejected. The expectations theory can be

modified to include an unexplained random liquidity premium, but then

expected interest rate nxvements account for only a small part of the

variance in the spread between interest rates of different maturities

reflect these changing liquidity premia or expectations that do riot

satisfy the standard postulates of rationality.

    These results suggest the importance of developing idels capable

of explaining fluctuating liquidity premia.2 Presumably this would

involve in some way recognizing the heterogeneous liquidity positions of

different economic agents. They also raise important questions about

the inetary transmission mechanism. If, as usually thought, spending

decisions and capital assets valuations depend primarily on long—term

rates, nnetary policy may   operate   by changing liquidity premia as well

as by affecting short rates. Although the efficacy of open market

operations directed at shifting the yield curve, such as "Operation

Twist," is widely questioned, the issue is difficult to evaluate without

a fuller understanding of the deteminants of liquidity premia. The

failure of the expectations hypothesis does make ricre plausible the view

that the supplies of assets of different maturities influences yields.25


Var(Rt). Introducing a random liquidity premium increases both varian-
ces equally and thus increases Var(Rt —    rt)
                                           proportionally more.

it is,   however, difficult to understand why these effects would be

important in the market for three—month and six—month bills.

     Our negative results provide an additional reason for uncertainty

in predicting the effects of alternative monetary and fiscal policies on

financial markets. They suggest that estimating the impact of policies

on future short—term rates   is   not likely to be a good guide   to   pre-

dicting their impact on long—term rates or asset valuations. These

effects may depend more on liquidity prernia than on expectations.

Without a satisfactory theory of liquidity premia, predicting the

effect of policies on the shape of the yield curve is almost impossible.
