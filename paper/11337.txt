                                           ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the effect of binge and frequent drinking by adolescents on subsequent high

school dropout using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Young Adults. We

estimate an instrumental variables model with an indicator of any past month alcohol use, which is

by definition correlated with heavy drinking but should have minimal additional impact on

educational outcomes, as the identifying instrument, and also control for a rich set of potentially

confounding variables, including maternal characteristics and dropout risk factors measured before

and during adolescence. In comparison, OLS provides conservative estimates of the causal impact

of heavy drinking on dropping out, implying that binge or frequent drinking among 15 16 year old

students lowers the probability of having graduated or being enrolled in high school four years later

by at least 11 percent. Overidentification tests using two measures of maternal youthful alcohol use

as additional instruments support our identification strategy.

Introduction

       Despite its illegality, alcohol is extensively used by teenagers. In the 2004 Monitoring

the Future (MTF) study, a national survey of adolescent substance use, 48 percent of high school

seniors reported consuming alcohol in the past month, and 29 percent reported binge drinking

(having at least five drinks in a single episode) in the past two weeks. Drinking prevalence was

only slightly lower among 2004 MTF 10th graders: 35 percent used alcohol in the past month and

22 percent binge drank in the past two weeks. Even among 2004 MTF 8th graders, almost one in

five students reported past month alcohol use (Johnston et al. 2005).

       The primary motivation for alcohol control policies targeted at youth, such as zero

tolerance laws, restrictions on advertising, and minimum legal drinking ages, is to lessen the

harmful social impact of teenage alcohol use. While such policies appear to have reduced

drinking among youth (e.g. Chaloupka et al. 2002), it is unclear whether any health or social

benefits will ensue. In particular, if alcohol use does not cause the adverse outcomes with which

it is associated, even successful alcohol policies cannot prevent these outcomes. For example,

while alcohol use is highly correlated with suicidal behaviors and risky sexual practices, causal

relationships are difficult to establish (Chatterji et al. 2004, Grossman et al. 2002, Rashad &

Kaestner 2004, Rees et al. 2001).

       This study provides evidence on the causal nature of the relationship between heavy

drinking among middle and high school students and subsequent high school dropout, an

important human capital outcome. Alcohol use has a strong inverse association with educational

success: adolescent alcohol users receive lower grades and are more likely to report academic

difficulties and not graduate from high school than their non-using peers (Cook & Moore 1993,

DeSimone & Wolaver 2005, Ellickson et al. 2003, Yamada et al. 1996). This association,




                                                 1
however, may be partially or entirely incidental. Adolescent drinkers typically have

characteristics that predispose them to poor educational outcomes, such as behavioral and family

problems, parental substance use, minimal parental monitoring, and low attachment to school

(Borawski et al. 2003, Diego et al. 2003, Ellickson et al. 2001, Maney et al. 2002, Sale et al.

2003, Silberg et al. 2003). Empirical models may not sufficiently control for these factors

because they are difficult to measure. The effects of heavy drinking on educational attainment

estimated by standard regression procedures therefore may suffer from omitted variable bias and

not reflect causal impacts.

        We analyze data from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Young Adults

(NLSY79-YA). As children of the youngest, and thus relatively disadvantaged, NLSY79

mothers, NLSY79-YA are at elevated risk for school dropout, making them a particularly

appropriate group to study. Furthermore, the combination of NLSY79-YA and NLSY79

mothers offers an unusually rich data source that contains detailed information not only on youth

alcohol use and educational attainment, but also on socioeconomic background, maternal alcohol

use, and risk factors for adolescent drinking and dropout. These measures include many

potentially confounding correlates of alcohol use and educational attainment, facilitating the

estimation of the causal impact of heavy drinking on subsequent high school dropout.

        Specifically, we estimate the effects of both binge drinking and frequent drinking, the

latter defined as having 14 or more drinks in the previous month (as explained further below), on

the likelihood that students who were in seventh through twelfth grade at age 15–16 had not

either graduated from or remained enrolled in high school as of the interview that occurred four

years later. We begin by estimating ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models that control

for a basic set of covariates that are standard in the literature, a set of maternal characteristics




                                                   2
including educational attainment and current alcohol use, and several less plausibly exogenous

respondent characteristics including current depressive symptoms and early behavior problems

and reading ability. Results imply that heavy drinking reduces the probability of graduating or

remaining in school by 11–13 percent.

       To assess the legitimacy of interpreting these OLS estimates as causal effects, we then

estimate instrumental variables (IV) models that specify an indicator of any past month alcohol

use as the sole identifying instrument. Our logic for this choice is that a correlation between any

drinking and heavy drinking exists by definition, while drinking that is not intense or frequent

presumably has no mechanism by which to impact educational outcomes. Two stage least

squares (2SLS) estimation reveals that not only are the first stage relationships between any

drinking and both binge and frequent drinking indeed quite strong, but moreover the second

stage binge and frequent drinking effects are somewhat larger in magnitude than those from

OLS, suggesting that the latter provides conservative causal effect estimates.

       Formal overidentification tests from an alternative specification that includes two

measures of youthful maternal drinking as additional instruments provide empirical evidence that

the indicator of any past month alcohol use can be validly excluded from the educational

attainment equation. Finally, estimated effects that are qualitatively and often quantitatively

similar persist upon various modifications to the sample inclusion criteria. These findings

suggest that limiting adolescent drinking may have important human capital benefits, at least for

children of relatively young and disadvantaged mothers.




                                                 3
Adolescent Alcohol Use and Human Capital Outcomes

       Conceptually, numerous causal pathways exist through which alcohol use could

potentially interfere with the human capital accumulation that occurs during adolescence.

Among heavier users, drinking might impair cognition, learning and memory (e.g. Ziegler et al.

2005), take time away from studying and class attendance (Powell, Williams & Wechsler, 2004;

Williams, Powell & Wechsler, 2003; Wolaver 2002), diminish academic reputation among

teachers and peers, and lower attachment to school and motivation. Through any of these

avenues, heavy drinking would be expected to decrease the marginal benefit of investing in

additional schooling.

       Previous research has found that heavy drinking during youth is strongly associated with

adverse educational outcomes (Ellickson, Tucker & Klein, 2003; Cook & Moore, 1993; Yamada,

Kendix & Yamada 1996; Mullahy & Sindelar 1989) but offers only limited evidence regarding

whether this association represents a causal relationship, given that alcohol use may be correlated

with unmeasured factors that also detract from educational attainment. Empirical methods that

address this issue have commonly identified the educational attainment equation using state-level

alcohol policies, which are expected to influence adolescent alcohol use without directly

affecting educational attainment. Cook and Moore (1993), for example, use this approach to

estimate the effect that drinking on at least two days in the past week has on additional years of

schooling in NLSY79 data on high school seniors. They report large detrimental effects of

alcohol use: drinkers finish 2.3 fewer years of college than do non-drinkers.

       This identification strategy has been called into question for several reasons. State

policies tend to be only weakly correlated with alcohol use, at least by the standards required to

have confidence in IV estimates. Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995), Bollen, Guilkey and Mroz




                                                 4
(1995), Nelson and Startz (1990) and Staiger and Stock (1997) demonstrate that a low first stage

F statistic for the joint significance of the identifying instruments could lead to IV estimates

being more biased than corresponding OLS estimates. Rashad and Kaestner (2004) show that

using alcohol policies as instruments may be problematic whenever equations modeling alcohol

use and consequences of alcohol use are estimated jointly. Dee (1999) similarly argues that

cross-state alcohol policy variation is endogenous, in the sense that it is associated with

unobserved state sentiments that are correlated with both drinking and educational attainment. In

sum, state alcohol policies lack credibility as identifying instruments both because they are

typically poor predictors of adolescent drinking, and when state-level fixed effects cannot be

included to capture time invariant state sentiments that are correlated with policy enactment.

       Because of these problems, two recent related studies apply alternative empirical

approaches. Koch and Ribar (2001) estimate the relationship between the age of alcohol use

initiation and years of schooling completed by age 25 in NLSY79. They estimate family fixed

effects models using NLSY79 siblings, and instrumental variables models using the sibling’s

initiation age as an identifying instrument. Their results indicate that on average delaying

alcohol use initiation by one year increases educational attainment by 0.22 years. Dee and Evans

(2003) use a two-sample IV (TSIV) strategy in which they use data first from the 1977–1992

MTF surveys to estimate the impact of minimum legal drinking ages on teen alcohol use, and

then from the 1990 Census to construct simulated drinking variables based on the MTF equations

and estimate their effects on schooling. The results contradict most existing research, in that

none of the drinking measures they examine have statistically significant effects on high school

graduation, college entrance or college completion.




                                                  5
Methods

       Our estimates of the effect that heavy drinking has on subsequently dropping out of high

school before graduating come from the equation

(1)                            D = β 0 + β1 A + X      2   +M   3   +R   4   +ε ,

where D represents dropout, A denotes binge or frequent alcohol use, is the error term, and X,

M and R are vectors of presumably exogenous variables, maternal characteristics and student-

level risk factors, respectively, that potentially influence educational attainment. The inclusion

of elements in M and R that are also correlated with drinking eliminates the bias that would have

resulted if these measures had otherwise been subsumed in . But if factors such as orientation

towards the future relative to the present, risk aversion and self-esteem affect both dropout and

drinking and are still not held constant in equation (1) because of their inherently unobservable

nature, despite the presence of M and R, the OLS estimate of the causal effect      1   remains

inconsistent. Specifically, the true causal effect will be smaller in magnitude than the OLS

coefficient implies.

       Previous studies such as Dee and Evans (2003) and DeSimone and Wolaver (2005) have

focused on this source of bias, i.e. unobserved heterogeneity, in their arguments that alternative

methods explicitly dealing with the endogeneity of alcohol use are necessary to obtain a

consistent estimate of the causal effect of heavy drinking on educational outcomes. An

alternative potential source of bias that could result in OLS instead underestimating the causal

effect is measurement error. If our drinking variables are misreported or misspecify the relevant

drinking behavior, the OLS estimate of    1   will be biased downward in magnitude as long as

these errors in measurement are random.

       Because IV models with properly specified instruments are immune to bias resulting



                                                   6
from unobserved heterogeneity and measurement error in the drinking variables, we estimate IV

models to generate consistent estimates of the causal effect of heavy drinking on dropping out,

and use these estimates to assess whether our OLS estimates reflect causal effects. Our IV

models are estimated using 2SLS. The first stage is an equation that explains heavy drinking in

terms of observed factors X, M and R, and one or more instruments Z that affect heavy drinking

but have no further impact on dropping out,

(2)                                 A = α0 + Z    1   +X       2   +M   3   +R   4   +u.

The second stage is equation (1) above, using the fitted values from equation (2) in place of the

observed binge or frequent drinking measures and adjusting standard errors accordingly. We

further adjust standard errors for both heteroskedasticity of arbitrary form, which is particularly

relevant because both drinking and dropout are measured as binary indicators, and correlation

between observations from siblings, because our 1,107 respondents come from only 912

different mothers.1

        Our identification strategy specifies a binary indicator of any past month alcohol use as

the sole excluded instrument. This is notable in that the nature of the association between the

identifying instrument and the endogenous variable is definitional rather than statistical. By

definition, past month drinking is correlated with the relatively intense and frequent types of

drinking that we hypothesize will affect educational attainment, since one cannot drink heavily

without drinking at all. As a result, standard errors in the dropout equation are small enough to

allow for more precise inferences. Any uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of this

1
 Two points are relevant here. First, although generalized method of moments is in principle more efficient than
2SLS when regression errors are heteroskedastic, in our application the two procedures produce identical results to
any reasonable level of precision, so we utilize 2SLS for expository convenience. Second, Angrist (2001) and
Wooldridge (2002, pg. 622) argue that researchers can, and in many cases should, use 2SLS even when the
endogenous and outcome variables are binary, rather than methods specifically designed to address the binary nature
of these variables.



                                                           7
identification strategy would therefore involve the exogeneity of the identifying instrument with

respect to the error term in the dropout equation. Specifically, our strategy presumes that non-

binge and infrequent drinking will not reduce educational attainment separately from its

influence on binge and frequent drinking.

         Our conceptual argument for this exclusion restriction relies on the premise that there is

no mechanism by which drinking can impact educational attainment unless it is either intense in

some episodes or occurs frequently. For instance, Wolaver (2002) and Williams et al. (2003)

argued that drinking can reduce academic performance either directly by diminishing cognitive

skills, or indirectly because drinking occurs during time that would otherwise have been

allocated towards studying. But drinking that is not intense, i.e. does not result in drunkenness

and consequent hangovers or addiction, cannot directly affect cognitive skills. And infrequent

drinking simply does not occupy enough time to meaningfully alter time constraints.

         Our exclusion restriction is possibly not as intuitively compelling as that made by

previous researchers who use state-level alcohol policies to identify equations that estimate

outcomes of alcohol use. However, such policies are correlated with unobserved state-level

determinants of educational attainment when state fixed effects are not included (e.g. Dee and

Evans 2003), but have weak predictive power for drinking when state effects are included.2

Additionally, even when state fixed effects are included, using state policies for identification

fails to take advantage of variation in heavy drinking that occurs within the same state and time

period. In contrast, our identification strategy acknowledges the importance of the first-stage

explanatory power of the instrument in generating IV estimates that are consistent and

sufficiently precise to test the hypothesis of interest.


2
 Inclusion of state fixed effects is particularly problematic in our sample, which is relatively small in size and has
minimal time variation.


                                                           8
       Moreover, we empirically assess the merit of our exogeneity argument by estimating an

additional specification in which two indicator variables serve as auxiliary instruments that

overidentify the dropout equation: (1) maternal drinking on a weekly basis before the mother was

16 years old (maternal adolescent drinking) and (2) past month maternal binge drinking

measured in 1982, when the mother was between 17 and 25 years old (maternal young adult

drinking). Maternal adolescent and young adult drinking are likely linked to respondent drinking

through genetic factors such as preferences for alcohol. Also, mothers who were binge or

frequent drinkers as youths may find it difficult to prohibit their children from doing the same.

These measures should not directly affect educational attainment, however, given that the M

vector includes various maternal attributes, such as educational attainment and current alcohol

use, which will mediate any correlation between previous maternal drinking and respondent

educational outcomes. Because the dropout equation is overidentified in these models, we can

conduct formal overidentification tests to confirm the validity of our primary exclusion

restriction. The results of these tests also address any concern that unobservable factors drive

both differences in educational outcomes between drinkers and non-drinkers and the correlation

between any alcohol use and heavy drinking.



The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 – Young Adults

NLSY79 Young Adults and Mothers

       Our data come from the 2002 release of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979

Young Adults (NLSY79-YA) and the NLSY79, an annual nationally representative survey

initiated in 1979 with a sample of 12,686 individuals aged 14–21. NLSY79 respondents

provided extensive information on labor market participation, education, fertility, substance use



                                                 9
and family background. Beginning in 1986, children of female NLSY79 respondents

(CNLSY79) were assessed biennially in a variety of areas relevant for child development. As

these children began to enter late adolescence, there was interest in obtaining information from

them on the same topics as were covered by NLSY79. Thus, beginning in 1994, CNLSY79

respondents who would be at least 15 years old by the end of each survey year formed a new

cohort, the NLSY79-YA.

        NLSY79-YA offers some of the richest data available to social scientists: longitudinal

information on participants from birth to young adulthood combined with detailed information

on their mothers’ experiences beginning in adolescence. Respondents biennially complete a

computer-assisted survey instrument, administered either in person (in most cases) or by

telephone. The survey parallels the NLSY79 survey and focuses on transitions into adulthood.

The 2002 survey had 4,648 respondents aged 15 to 32. These are the children of the youngest

NLSY79 mothers: at the time of the respondents’ births, all mothers were under age 27 and 41

percent were teenagers.

        We use information from the 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002 NLSY79-YA surveys,

linked to earlier assessments obtained during the 1988, 1990, 1992 and 1994 CNLSY79 surveys

and maternal characteristics from the 1982, 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1998 NLSY79 surveys. The

analysis sample consists of 1,107 NLSY79-YA respondents who were 19–24 years old in 2002

and had information available on alcohol use at age 15–16 (from the 1994, 1996 and 1998

surveys) and educational attainment at age 19–20 (i.e. from the survey administered four years

later).3 We further limit our sample to respondents who were in grades 7–12 at age 15–16: 68

respondents who dropped out before the age 15–16 interview are excluded.


3
 NLSY79-YA respondents who were age 25 or older in 2002 were 15–16 years old before the NLSY79-YA surveys
were initiated, while those younger than 19 years old in 2002 are too young to assess school dropout.


                                                   10
Educational Attainment and Alcohol Use Measures

           Because our sample represents three separate NLSY79-YA cohorts, we measure most

relevant characteristics at the same age for all respondents. In particular, our drinking variables

capture past month alcohol use as of the interview at which respondents were age 15 or 16, and

our educational attainment variable corresponds to the interview that occurred four years

subsequently, by which respondents were age 19 or 20. The latter is specifically a binary

indicator that is coded to one if the respondent both had not graduated from high school and was

not enrolled in school at the age 19–20 interview, and otherwise equals zero. We do not

categorize respondents who are still in school but have yet to graduate as “dropouts” because 7th

and 8th graders are not expected to finish high school within four years.

           As only drunkenness or frequent drinking is expected to be a detriment to educational

attainment, the two binary alcohol use indicators that we consider are binge drinking, defined as

consuming at least five drinks in a single episode, and frequent drinking, defined as consuming

at least 14 alcoholic beverages over the month and based on responses to the questions “On how

many days did you drink during the past 30 days?” and “On average, how many drinks did you

consume on the days you drank in the past 30 days?” The threshold of 14 is chosen to capture

roughly the most frequent-drinking one-third of sample past month alcohol users; while almost

10 percent of drinkers consumed exactly 12 beverages, no respondents reported having 13 drinks

and no single number of drinks above 14 applies for more than three percent of drinkers.4



Explanatory Variables

           A variety of potential determinants of educational attainment are important to include as

control variables because of their possible correlation with binge and frequent drinking during
4
    Results were similar when slightly higher drink thresholds were used to categorize frequent drinking.


                                                           11
adolescence. We begin by estimating models that include X, a basic set of variables that are

plausibly exogenous from the adolescent’s perspective. These include indicators for being

African-American, Latino, female, and each of ages 20–24 (age 19 omitted) and in each of

grades 8–12 (7th grade omitted), living in the central, western and southern U.S. (northeast

omitted) and in an urban location, and all four quartiles of total net previous year family income

(with family income not observed as the omitted category), along with the log of the number of

other household members age 17 and younger. All but the race and gender indicators are from

the same survey year as the alcohol use variable, when the respondent is 15–16 years old.

       Next we estimate an expanded model that also includes the maternal characteristics M in

order to gauge their role as potential confounders. These include indicators for each age from 31

to 41 years old, with the omitted category including a total of seven observations in which age

was 29, 30 or not reported; having graduated from high school, attended college, and graduated

from college, defined as mutually exclusive categories with not having completed high school as

the baseline; being employed and unemployed, with out of the labor force as the omitted

category; currently being married, the father residing in the household, alcohol use when

pregnant with the respondent, and having binge drank at least once in the past month in 1994.

All variables besides the two maternal drinking indicators are measured when the youth is age

15–16. Maternal binge drinking might be correlated with teen drinking and dropout because of

both genetic and environmental factors (Cloniger et al. 1981, Hrubec & Omenn 1981, Chassin et

al. 1991). We take this variable from the 1994 NLSY, when our sample respondents were 10–16

years old, because this is the closest available match to our standard baseline of age 15–16.

       Previous research suggests that three of the most important individual-level risk factors

for adolescent alcohol use are childhood impulsive and aggressive behavior, poor early academic




                                                12
achievement, and psychiatric disorders such as conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity

disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression (Pulkkinen & Pitkanen 1994, Costa et al. 1999, Caspi

et al. 1996, Brook et al. 1992, Rydelius et al. 1981, Brook et al. 1986, Block et al. 1988, Boyle &

Offord 1991, Kushner & Sher 1993, Deykin et al. 1987, Deykin et al. 1992). All three might

also impact educational attainment directly. In previous studies, these variables generally have

been omitted, thus remaining a potential source of unobserved heterogeneity. However,

NLSY79-YA includes measures of all three of these quantities, enabling estimation of our “full”

model that also includes the vector R of risk factors for alcohol use and school dropout. We add

R separately from M because these variables are potentially endogenous: its inclusion might

reduce bias from unobserved heterogeneity, but alternatively might increase bias if its elements

are determined simultaneously with educational attainment.

       Our measures of early behavior problems and school achievement are based on the

Behavior Problems Index (BPI) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), respectively,

both of which were administered when respondents were age 10 or 11. The BPI consists of 28

items describing a particular type of behavior pertaining to sociability, anxiety, depression,

headstrongness, hyperactivity, immaturity, dependency and social withdrawal (Peterson & Zill,

1986). Mothers respond “often” or “sometimes true,” which are assigned a value of one, or “not

true,” which receives a value of zero. Scores are summed and then normed based on data from

the 1981 National Health Interview Survey. Because young children with high percentile scores

on behavior problem scales are more likely than others to subsequently have persistent behavior

problems, DSM III diagnoses of externalizing disorders, and mental health services use

(Achenbach et al. 1995, Campbell & Ewing 1990, McGee et. al. 1991, Gortmaker et. al. 1990),

we include a binary indicator for whether the gender-specific normed BPI score was at or above




                                                 13
the 90th percentile. The PPVT is considered to be a highly valid and reliable measure of

scholastic aptitude (Campbell, Bell & Keith 2001). Children listen to an interviewer state a

word, and then are asked to choose which of four pictures best represents its meaning.

Increasingly difficult questions are asked until the child incorrectly responds to six of eight

consecutive questions. We control for the normed percentile PPVT score.

       Our psychological disorder variable is a measure of adolescent depressive symptoms at

age 15–16 using items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D),

which is widely used and has demonstrated excellent psychometric properties (Crockett et al.

2005, Radloff 1977, Husaini et al. 1980). The NLSY79-YA includes seven of 20 items from the

CES-D scale: poor appetite, trouble keeping mind on tasks, depressed, everything took extra

effort, restless sleep, sad and could not get going. Responses are on a four-point Likert scale,

with higher values corresponding to higher frequencies of the item in the past week. Because the

full 20-item scale was not included, we use an indicator of whether the sum of the responses falls

at or above the 90th percentile of the sample to represent an elevated level of depressive

symptoms.



Instruments

       As described previously, our primary identifying instrument is an indicator of any past

month alcohol use at age 15–16. To overidentify the model, we also estimate specifications that

include two additional instruments, binary indicators for whether the mother of the respondent:

(1) had at least one binge drinking episode in the past month in 1982, when she was age 17–25,

and (2) had initiated weekly use of alcohol before age 16. Maternal alcohol use data come from

responses to 1982 NLSY79 questions regarding the number of alcohol binges in the past 30 days




                                                 14
and the age at which drinking first occurred on at least a weekly basis.



Descriptive Statistics

         Table 1 displays variable means.5 The first column pertains to the full sample, the second

and third columns split the sample into binge drinkers and others, and the fourth and fifth

columns divide the sample into frequent drinkers and others. Drinking status generally varies

with exogenous covariates in the predicted directions, with income (i.e. a nonlinear effect),

maternal employment status, paternal presence in the home, and PPVT score constituting the few

exceptions and differences across drinking status being small in those cases.

         Just over a sixth of sample respondents are classified as dropouts. Slightly less than 10

percent of the sample binge drank at least once during the previous month, and about six percent

are categorized as frequent drinkers.6 For both binge and frequent drinking, dropout prevalence

is 11 percentage points higher for drinkers than for non-drinkers. But binge and frequent

drinking are not synonymous: while all but two of the 65 frequent drinkers are also binge

drinkers, 40 percent of binge drinkers consumed 12 or fewer beverages in the past month, which

implies that they had two or fewer binge drinking episodes and otherwise drank infrequently.

         Although our primary instrument, having consumed any alcohol in the past month, is by

definition correlated with our measures of heavy drinking, roughly half of past month drinkers

did not binge drink, and two-thirds are not frequent drinkers. Our auxiliary instruments also

have high simple correlations with our heavy drinking variables. Having a mother who drank

  Because all but two variables are binary indicators, we do not show standard deviations or ranges. In the full
sample, PPVT ranges from 0 to 99 with a standard deviation of 25.9, while the number of other household members
under age 18 ranges from 0 to 12 with a standard deviation of 1.59.

  These rates are somewhat lower than national rates of adolescent alcohol use in the mid-1990s, when respondents
were 15–16 years old. For example, among 1996 MTF 10th graders, 26 percent of whites, 12 percent of African-
Americans and 30 percent of Latinos binge drank in the past 2 weeks. Among 1996 MTF 8th graders, these rates
were 15 percent for whites, 10 percent for African-Americans and 21 percent for Latinos. It is important to note that
36 percent of our sample is African-American, the racial group with the lowest binge drinking prevalence.


                                                         15
weekly by age 16 is more than twice as likely among both binge and frequent drinkers.

Similarly, the prevalence of mothers who binge drank in the month prior to the 1982 interview,

which corresponds to between one year before and four years after the birth years of respondents,

is about twice as high for binge drinkers and 50 percent higher for frequent drinkers.


Results

       Table 2 displays the main results of the analysis. The first three columns provide binge-

drinking results for our basic, expanded and full set of explanatory variables, respectively, while

the latter three columns do the same for frequent drinking. Maternal characteristics are excluded

from the basic model and risk factors for drinking and dropout are included only in the full

model. The top row shows that regardless of whether maternal characteristics and risk factors

are held constant, more than half of past month drinkers have at least one binge drinking episode

and almost a third of drinkers consume at least 14 drinks. The next row indicates that the

extremely large t statistics for any alcohol use translate to F statistics of around 220 for binge

drinking and nearly 100 for frequent drinking, which are considerably higher than the threshold

of 10 sometimes used to judge the adequacy of instrument strength (Staiger and Stock 1997).

       OLS estimates of the effects of binge and frequent drinking on dropping out, all of which

are significant at the five percent level, are listed in the following row. For both drinking

measures, the estimated effect falls as additional explanatory variables are included in the

regression. In particular, moving from the basic to expanded model reduces the binge drinking

coefficient by 26 percent and the frequent drinking coefficient by 13 percent, and moving from

the expanded to full model lowers the coefficients by another six to seven percent, producing

overall declines in magnitude of 31 percent for binge drinking and 19 percent for frequent

drinking. This provides some assurance that the unique aspects of our data, namely the maternal


                                                  16
characteristics and dropout risk factors, do in fact capture some of the unobserved heterogeneity

that potentially plagues OLS estimates of the causal effect of drinking on educational attainment.

In the full model, which we prefer because it yields the most conservative estimates, binge and

frequent drinking increase the probability of dropping out by 9–11 percentage points, which at

the mean dropout proportion implies an 11–13 percent reduction in the probability that 15–16

year old students have graduated or are still in school four years later.

       2SLS estimates, which identify binge and frequent drinking using just the indicator of

any past month alcohol use and are also highly significant in all cases, appear in the subsequent

row. The pattern of declining coefficient magnitudes as maternal characteristics and dropout risk

factors are added parallels that for OLS. Notably, the 2SLS estimates are larger in magnitude

than those from OLS, by roughly 50 percent for binge drinking and 100 percent for frequent

drinking, contradicting the expectation that they would be smaller because of unobserved

heterogeneity. The exogeneity t statistics, however, reveal that there is no statistical difference

between OLS and 2SLS in most specifications, including the full models that we prefer.

       Highly depressed students are seven percentage points more likely to drop out, while a

one standard deviation increase of 26 points in the PPVT score reduces the dropout probability

by four percentage points. The former effect is significant at the 10 percent level, while the latter

is significant at one percent. Despite the large coefficients on these variables, the estimated

drinking effects fall only minimally when they are added to the model along with the youth

behavioral problems indicator, and are still highly significant.

       It seems reasonable that frequent drinking has a slightly larger effect on dropout

propensity than binge drinking, in that while 97 percent of frequent drinkers are binge drinkers,

40 percent of binge drinkers are not frequent drinkers. The negative effect of frequent drinking




                                                  17
evidently increases the dropout rate of all non-binge drinkers relative to that of just infrequent

drinkers and abstainers, thus dampening the estimated impact of binge drinking.

       A possible explanation for the 2SLS effect being larger than the OLS effect is random

measurement error in the binge and frequent drinking variables. Both drinking measures could

be misreported in a nonsystematic way because of recall error regarding the timing of drinking or

quantity of drinks consumed. And both variables are only crude measures of the form of alcohol

use that would presumably impact educational outcomes, in that neither fully captures the

intensity of heavy drinking episodes or the frequency with which drinking events take place.

Even our frequent drinking indicator, which for practical purposes encompasses binge drinking,

is imprecise because both the number of days on which drinking occurs and the amount of

alcohol necessary to produce intoxication could vary across respondents.

       A more problematic alternative reason for the relative magnitudes of the OLS and 2SLS

estimates would be if the identifying instrument, the any past month alcohol use indicator, is not

truly exogenous with respect to high school dropout even conditional on binge and frequent

drinking. Table 3 empirically examines this possibility by displaying results of models in which

the two measures of youthful maternal drinking, indicators of whether the mother initiated

weekly drinking by age 16 and binge drank at least once in the past month in 1982, serve as

additional excluded instruments in the 2SLS model. This allows us to overidentify the dropout

equation and thereby conduct formal tests for the hypothesis that past month alcohol use and the

two youthful maternal drinking indicators are jointly validly excluded.

       The first and second columns, and fourth and fifth columns, juxtapose estimates from the

basic and full models for binge and frequent drinking, respectively. The first row, in comparison

to the analogous row of table 2, shows that including the additional instruments has no tangible




                                                 18
effect on the magnitude or standard error of the first stage any alcohol use coefficient. As

evident from the next two rows, when our primary instrument is included the auxiliary

instruments have minimal first stage strength, though maternal binge drinking is a significant

predictor of binge drinking and maternal weekly drinking is a significant determinant of frequent

drinking in the full model. The subsequent row indicates that F statistics for the identifying

instruments, though reduced in size by almost two-thirds, are still very large, and the following

row reveals that with our original instrument retaining the vast majority of the identifying power,

the 2SLS estimates change little when the auxiliary instruments are added.

       Hansen’s J statistic, i.e. the minimized value of the corresponding generalized method of

moments objective function multiplied by the sample size, is reported in the last row, with p-

values given in brackets beneath. Although this overidentification test is comfortably passed

even in the basic model, moving to the full model raises the p-values from around .5 to .9 as the

2SLS estimates fall in size by over one-quarter. This provides further evidence that the maternal

characteristics and dropout risk factors that are included in the full but not basic model account

for some of the unobserved heterogeneity that inflates estimates of the impact of drinking on

educational attainment. Moreover, the very high J statistic p-values in the full models offer

assurance that our main identifying instrument does not influence high school dropout beyond

effects of binge or frequent drinking and is therefore appropriately excluded from the dropout

equation.

       The third and sixth columns of table 3 show estimates from 2SLS models in which the

any past month alcohol use indicator is omitted, leaving the two youthful maternal drinking

indicators as the only identifying instruments. Both variables are more highly correlated with

binge and frequent drinking than when past month drinking is included, but their joint F statistics




                                                 19
are substantially lower and well below the Staiger and Stock (1997) threshold of 10. The

consequence is very large second stage standard errors. Importantly, however, the 2SLS

coefficients are somewhat larger in magnitude, and overidentification tests are still passed but

with slightly lower p values. Combined with the overidentification statistics in the second and

fifth columns, these results provide strong confirmation that our identification strategy is valid.

           Table 4 explores the sensitivity of the estimated full model drinking effects to various

sample modifications. For convenience, the first row restates the main results from table 2. The

next two rows more specifically examine high school dropout by omitting 7th and 8th graders,

who would not be expected to have graduated four years later, and 12th graders, who are already

close to graduation.7 In the second row, simply altering the sample in this way has little impact

on the results. When we further change the dependent variable to reflect only high school

graduation, so that students still in high school are now reported as “dropouts,” the OLS effect

diminishes is size, implying that abstaining from binge or frequent drinking is a reason that

students who have not yet graduated but are still in school have not dropped out (rather than

drinking being a reason that these students are still in school rather than having graduated), but

the change in magnitude is not dramatic and the 2SLS effect is slightly larger. The following

two rows indicate that binge drinking is problematic for Latinos and blacks while frequent

drinking is not, with the opposite being true for others (mostly whites). Subsequent rows show

that drinking effects are larger for males, non-urban residents, and students with mothers who are

less educated and unmarried. All in all, though, the relative stability of the estimates across a

variety of subsamples offers further evidence that our results are not spurious.

    Only one of 31 sample 12th graders is classified as a dropout.

Discussion

       Previous studies have had difficulty in inferring whether the well-documented negative

correlation between adolescent alcohol use and educational attainment reflects a causal

relationship, with researchers facing two challenges: a lack of data on some important risk

factors for alcohol use, and a reliance on state-level policies as identifying instruments even

though they have only weak explanatory power for adolescent drinking. Our study takes

advantage of an unusually rich data set to assess the evidence on whether teen drinking causally

increases the likelihood of high school dropout. We estimate OLS dropout equations that

include controls for maternal characteristics and dropout risk factors that are likely to be related

with alcohol use, as well as 2SLS models using an indicator of any past month alcohol use as the

identifying instrument. Besides establishing that any drinking is an excellent predictor of binge

and frequent drinking, we make both conceptual and empirical cases that its exclusion from the

dropout equation is legitimate.

       The OLS results imply that past month binge and frequent drinking at age 15–16 bring

about 11–13 percent declines in the likelihood of still being enrolled in or having completed high

school four years later. 2SLS estimates are even larger in magnitude, regardless of whether two

indicators of youthful maternal drinking are specified as auxiliary or sole identifying

instruments. Estimated effects are reasonably insensitive to changes in sample composition.

       We conservatively interpret our findings as indicating that OLS estimates represent

causal effects of binge and frequent drinking on high school dropout. A caveat to this conclusion

is that it applies specifically to relatively disadvantaged teenagers who are already at elevated

risk of school dropout. But our results are notable in that the 2SLS estimates are larger in

magnitude, rather than smaller, compared with those from OLS, as well as in finding significant



                                                 21
effects in a comparatively small sample size of just over 1,000.

       These findings are consistent with those of Mullahy & Sindelar (1989, 1994), who

suggest that the onset of alcoholism before age 19 may have important indirect effects on adult

labor market outcomes through reductions in schooling. Given that a very large body of

literature shows no evidence that alcohol use directly detracts from labor market outcomes (Cook

& Moore 2002), drinking may impact labor market productivity primarily through reductions in

educational attainment. If so, alcohol policies that reduce the prevalence of teenage drinking

might increase human capital accumulation and ultimately labor market outcomes. Future

research should address this issue by linking measures of alcohol policies directly to data on

educational attainment, and investigating long-run labor market effects of adolescent drinking.

The first stage equation is an OLS regression of the drinking variable in the corresponding column heading on an
indicator for any past month alcohol use and the explanatory variables listed in Table 1 starting with the grade
indicators (and including the last four variables listed above for the expanded set). The second stage equation is the
regression of having dropped out without finishing high school on the corresponding drinking variable and the
aforementioned explanatory variables. The exogeneity statistic is the difference in the IV and OLS coefficients
divided by the square root of the difference in the IV and OLS coefficient variances. Parentheses contain standard
errors that are robust to arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity and allow observations from siblings to be correlated.

The first stage equation is an OLS regression of the drinking variable in the corresponding column heading on the
instruments listed in the first three rows (but excluding any alcohol use in the second and fourth columns) and the
explanatory variables listed in Table 1 starting with the grade indicators. The second stage equation is the two stage
least squares regression of having dropped out without finishing high school on the corresponding drinking variable
and the aforementioned explanatory variables. The overidentification statistic is Hansen’s J statistic, i.e. the
minimized value of the corresponding method of moments objective function multiplied by the sample size, with p-
values reported in brackets beneath. Parentheses contain standard errors that are robust to arbitrary forms of
heteroskedasticity and allow observations from siblings to be correlated.

Entries represent coefficients of the drinking variable in the column heading in least squares regressions of having
dropped out without finishing high school that also include the explanatory variables listed in Table 1 starting with
the grade indicators, with the sample defined as indicated in the row heading. 2SLS estimates are from two stage
least squares regressions identified by an indicator of any past month alcohol use. Parentheses contain standard
errors that are robust to arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity and allow observations from siblings to be correlated.
