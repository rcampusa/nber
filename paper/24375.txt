                                          ABSTRACT

We evaluate the impact of the credit conditions facing corporations on their emissions of toxic air
pollutants. Exploiting cross-county, cross-time shale discoveries that generated liquidity windfalls
at local bank branches, we construct measures of (1) the degree to which banks in non-shale
counties, i.e., counties where shale was not discovered, receive liquidity shocks through their
branches in shale counties and (2) the degree to which a corporation in a non-shale county has a
relationship lender that receives liquidity shocks through its branches. From both the county- and
firm-level analyses, we discover that positive shocks to credit conditions reduce corporate
pollution.

1. Introduction

        Air pollution increases the incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,

cancer, asthma and allergies, reproductive and neurodevelopmental disorders, and premature

death. 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2012 around 1 in 8 deaths

were attributable to air pollution. According to Ambient Air Pollution 2016 released by the

WHO, 92% of the world’s people breathe air with pollution concentrations that exceed WHO

Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) limits. Even in developed countries, environmental pollution

is the biggest threat to human health and well-being. For example, the Air Quality Report

2016 by the European Environment Agency estimates that approximately 50% of the EU’s

urban population was exposed to concentrations of small particulate matter exceeding WHO

AQG limits. As another example, the State of the Air 2017 report by the American Lung

Association shows that more than 40% of the people in the U.S. live in counties that have

unhealthful levels of air pollution.

        In this paper, we examine how bank liquidity and credit supply affect the environment.

More specifically, we evaluate the impact of shocks to the supply of credit on corporate

emissions of toxic air pollutants. 2 Although the literature shows that credit conditions shape

economic growth (e.g., King and Levine 1993, Jayaratne and Strahan 1996, Levine and

Zervos 1998), firm and industry dynamics (Cetorelli and Strahan, 2006), business cycle

fluctuations (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler, 1989, Morgan, Rime, and Strahan, 2004), innovation

(e.g., Brown, Fazzari, and Petersen 2009), and the distribution of income and economic

opportunities (e.g., Black and Strahan 2001, Beck, Levine, and Levkov 2012), the literature

has not focused on how credit conditions influence corporate emissions of toxic pollutants,

and as a result, the quality of the environment. In this study, we identify shocks to the supply

of bank credit and examine the impacts on corporate pollution and environmental quality.

  In addition to harming public health (e.g., Chay and Greenstone 2003, Ebenstein et al. 2015, Schlenker and
Walker 2016, IIsen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker 2017), pollution reduces housing prices (e.g., Currie, Davis,
Greenstone and Walker 2015), lower labor productivity (e.g., Zivin and Neidell 2012), and influences industrial
production (e.g., Greenstone 2002).

  U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that industrial plants in the nation emit a total of about 4
billion pounds of toxic chemicals every year (Currie, Davis, Greenstone, and Walker, 2015).
                                                                                                          2



        A simple cost-benefit framework suggests how access to credit can shape toxic

emissions by corporations. The costs of reducing pollution involve sizeable upfront

investments, as shown by Walker (2013). 3 The benefits, however, largely accrue over time,

as pollution abatement reduces expected fines and penalties from violating regulatory and

legal limits on toxic emissions, augments the health and productivity of its workers, and

boosts the firm’s reputation. 4 Therefore, a boost in the supply of bank credit can improve

access to credit, allowing firms to finance large pollution abatement investments, and lower

interest rates, increasing the net present value of projects that reduce pollution. Similarly, if

credit conditions tighten, firms will be less likely to invest in pollution abatement and might

cut expenditures on existing environmental protection activities, increasing their emissions of

toxic air pollutants. Although we do not have corporate-level data on investment in pollution

abatement, we can evaluate how the supply of credit influences the emissions of toxic

pollutants by corporations.

        To assess the impact of credit conditions on corporate pollution, we must address two

standard identification challenges: (1) unobserved factors might simultaneously drive both

the corporation’s credit conditions and its emissions of toxic air pollutants and (2) reverse

causality might drive the credit-pollution relationship, i.e., corporation’s environmental

policies might shape the credit conditions offered by its lenders. To address these challenges,

we develop and implement two complimentary empirical strategies for identifying shocks to

the credit conditions facing firms. The first strategy identifies shocks to the credit conditions

facing firms in a county and the second strategy identifies shocks to the credit conditions

facing individual firms.

        Both of our empirical strategies start with the same building block: identifying

liquidity shocks to individual banks. In particular, we start with Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan

(2016). They show that (1) unexpected technological breakthroughs in fracking made shale

gas production economically viable; (2) following these technological breakthroughs, the

pollution. See, https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/enforcement-annual-results-fiscal-year-2016.

  According to the EPA, fees and penalties from for violating environmental laws and regulations reached $6
billion in 2016.

energy industry began rapidly purchasing shale mineral leases from landowners in promising

areas, i.e., in “shale counties;” (3) the landowners then deposited a portion of these mineral-

lease payments in local banks, boosting bank liquidity; and (4) banks receiving shale liquidity

shocks from their branch networks in shale counties increased their residential mortgage

lending in non-shale counties, i.e., counties that did not receive shale liquidity shocks. Thus,

we first confirm that shale discoveries increased local bank deposits in shale counties. We

then demonstrate that these banks improved the credit conditions offered to their corporate

clients in non-shale counties, i.e., the “treated” corporations. 5 Based on this building block,

we then develop two novel strategies for evaluating the impact of shocks to the credit

conditions facing treated firms on their toxic emissions and the quality of the environment.

         For our first empirical strategy, we use shale liquidity shocks to individual banks to

identify shocks to the credit conditions facing firms in a county. Specifically, we construct

measures of the degree to which banks in non-shale counties receive liquidity shocks through

their branch networks in shale counties. In this way, we identify county-specific shocks to the

supply of bank credit available to corporations in non-shale counties and then evaluate how

these shocks to credit conditions influence pollution in those counties. Importantly, we focus

on changes in credit conditions and environmental outcomes in counties without any shale

discoveries or drilling activities. This mitigates concerns that our results are driven by

changes in local economic conditions resulting from shale discoveries or development. We

use data on hazardous pollutants collected by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

monitoring stations across the country. Thus, conceptually, our first empirical strategy

compares the environment outcomes in two otherwise similar non-shale counties, except that

banks in one county receive greater liquidity shocks through their branch networks than

banks in the other county.

         We discover that a positive shock to the supply of bank credit in a county lowers toxic

air pollution in the county. That is, when a non-shale county’s banks are more exposed to

positive liquidity shocks through their branches in counties experiencing shale discoveries,

5
  Consistent with this finding, Peek and Rosengren (2000), and Strahan (2009) show that declines in bank
liquidity translate into reductions in the supply of bank credit. In addition, Gatev and Strahan (2009) find that
bank liquidity positions affect syndicated loan structure.
                                                                                              4



we observe sharp reductions in air pollution in those treated, non-shale counties. These

results hold when (a) controlling for time-varying county traits along with county and year

fixed effects, (b) using several different measures of shocks to the credit conditions facing

corporations within non-shale counties, (c) analyzing each of the five major toxic air

pollutants, and (d) employing different measures of the intensity of air pollution in counties.

In terms of economic magnitudes, consider Benzene, the most monitored hazardous air

pollutant by the EPA in our sample. We find that in counties where banks received a shale-

liquidity shock equal to one standard deviation of the cross-county distribution of such

shocks, Benzene concentration levels fell by 26% of the standard deviation of Benzene

concentration levels across counties.

       Our second strategy identifies shocks to the credit conditions facing individual firms.

To link shale liquidity shocks to a bank with its lending to specific firms, we use syndicated

loan deals because Dealscan provides information on each firm’s lenders in each deal. This

strategy relies on two testable conditions. First, bank-firm relationships endure, so that if a

bank was the lead arranger for a syndicated loan to a firm in the past, the bank is likely to be

a lead arranger for the firm in the future. We call such a bank the firm’s relationship lender,

where firms can have more than one such lender. Second, banks receiving shale liquidity

shocks through their branches in non-shale localities offer better credit terms to their

relationship firms in non-shale counties. We first verify that these two conditions hold. We

then use shale liquidity shocks to a firm’s relationship lenders to construct time-varying

measures of the credit conditions facing each firm. Conceptually, therefore, our second

empirical strategy compares the environment outcomes in two otherwise similar corporations

located in non-shale counties, except that the relationship lenders for one of these

corporations receives greater liquidity shocks through their branch networks in shale counties

than the relationship lenders for the other corporation.

       Using this strategy, we evaluate the impact of shocks to the credit conditions facing

individual firms on (a) their emissions of toxic pollutants, (b) expert assessments of their

environmental policies, and (c) their expressions of concern in 10-K filings about the

environment. To measure the release of toxic pollutants by individuals firms, we use data
                                                                                             5



from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program on toxic emissions from the

individual plants of firms. We obtain assessments of each firm’s environmental performance

from MSCI, which provides independent evaluations of corporations for institutional

investors. To gauge a company’s concerns about its environmental policies, we conduct

textual analyses of corporate 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission

(SEC). The sample size varies depending on whether we are examining toxic emissions using

TRI data, expert assessments using the MSCI, or 10-K filings. Our TRI sample, for instance,

contains 66,819 plant-year observations involving 8839 plants over the period from 2000

through 2014.

       We find that positive shocks to the credit conditions facing firms (a) reduce their

emissions of toxic air pollutants, (b) boost their overall environmental performance, as

measured by MSCI ratings, and (c) increase their focus on environmental considerations, as

expressed in SEC 10-K filings. These results are robust to controlling for firm, industry-year,

and state-year fixed effects, as well as time-varying firm characteristics. Furthermore these

results hold when using different measures of the shale liquidity shocks and across different

measures of toxic air pollution. Critically, as emphasized above, we examine firms and plants

located in counties in which there have been no shale discoveries or development. This limits

concerns that the findings are driven by changes in local conditions triggered by shale

activities. The estimated economic magnitudes are material. For example, if one firm receives

a positive liquidity shock equal to the sample mean value, while an otherwise identical firm

does not, our estimates indicate that toxic air emissions from the firm receiving the shock

would fall by 7%.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and variables.

Section 3 introduces the technological breakthroughs in “fracking” and demonstrates that

shale discoveries boosted bank liquidity. Section 4 describes the county- and firm-specific

shocks to credit conditions. Sections 5 and 6 provide the county-level and firm-level results

respectively, while Section 7 concludes.

2. Data and Variables

2.1 Toxic air pollutants concentration from EPA monitoring stations

       To evaluate the impact of an increase in the supply of bank credit on the local

environment, we use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data on the

concentration of hazardous airborne pollutants collected at outdoor monitors across the nation.

The EPA (2017) defines hazardous airborne pollutants as “those pollutants that are known or

suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects (including reproductive effects or

birth defects), or adverse environmental effects.” For each monitor, the EPA annual summary

files contain pollutant-by-pollutant summary statistics on the arithmetic mean, 50th, 75th, and

90th percentile of the readings from each monitor over each year. This provides annual

quantitative and objective measures of hazardous pollutant concentrations across geographic

locations. We focus on the five toxic air pollutants with the most comprehensive data:

Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene.

       We use these data on toxic air pollutants in two ways. First, we use the monitor level

data to investigate whether changes in the credit conditions facing corporations lead to

changes in toxic pollutants as detected by monitoring sites close to the company’s plants.

Second, we examine whether improvements in the supply of credit to firms in a county

influences air pollution in that county. To calculate the concentration of each hazardous air

pollutant at the county-year level, we compute the average of each summary statistic—mean,

median, 75th percentile, etc.—across monitors within the county and year. The average

number of monitoring sites in a county equals 1.76, and the median value equals to one.

Table 1 Panel A presents cross-county summary statistics on the annual mean, median, 75th,
and 90th percentile values of each of the five hazardous pollutant concentrations in our

sample. We provide detailed variable definition in Appendix Table A1.



2.2 Firm-specific toxic emissions and environmental activities

We examine three firm-specific measures of toxic emissions and environmental policies: (1)

The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) dataset contains information on the toxic emissions by

individual plants; (2) MSCI provides independent assessments by professional analysts of
                                                                                             7



each parent company’s environmental performance; and (3) we construct a text-based

measure of the parent company’s environmental protection activities from SEC 10-K filings.

We now describe each of these datasets in greater detail.



       2.2.1 Toxic Release Inventory

       We obtain pollutant emissions information at the plant-level from the Toxic Release

Inventory (TRI) basic dataset, which is maintained by the U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA). TRI collects information on the production, storage, and release of toxic

chemicals from over 40,000 plants in the U.S. Starting in 1987, the TRI program tracks the

release of more than 650 chemicals that cause significant adverse effects on human health or

the environment. Industrial plants that (a) are involved in manufacturing, metal mining,

electric power generation, chemical manufacturing and hazardous waste treatment, (b) have

more than 10 full-time employees, and (c) use or produce more than threshold levels of TRI-

listed toxic substances must report their releases of toxins to the TRI. The TRI provides self-

reported toxic emissions data at the plant-level, where a unique ID, along with information on

the plant’s name, physical location, and parent company’s name, identifies each plant. For

each plant in a year, we construct two measures of its emissions of pollutants. Toxic Air

Releases is the total amount of toxic airborne chemicals released from a plant in a year; and

Total Toxic Releases is the total amount of toxic chemicals released (including air emissions,

water discharges, underground injection, etc.) from each plant in a year. We then aggregate

the toxic release data at the plant level to the parent and link the parent companies to their

data files in Compustat.

       To obtain parent companies’ financial and other information, we match the TRI

parent company names to those in Compustat. As there is no common identifier between the

two databases, we apply a “fuzzy match” based on a string matching similarity score of

parent company names as reported in each dataset. We then perform a manual check on all

the matches to ensure accuracy. Our final TRI pollutant emission sample includes 75,555

plant-year observations over the 2000 – 2014 sample period, involving toxic release records
                                                                                             8



from 9281 plants belong to 1050 companies that are successfully matched with corresponding

Compustat firms.

       To address the concern that our analyses might be driven by changes in local

economic conditions resulting from the shale development activities, we use a sample of TRI

plants that are located in counties where there has been no shale development since 2003.

This reduces the number of plant-year observations from 75,555 to 66,819, and the number of

plants from 9281 to 8839.



       2.2.2 MSCI environmental ratings

       MSCI provides the Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini (KLD) ratings on corporate

environmental activities. The MSCI database includes a variety of binary indicators on

corporate social performance for Russell 3000 companies since 2003, and has been used in

research on corporate environmental policies (e.g., Krüger, 2015). The MSCI rating scores

are constructed from numerous sources including companies’ regulatory filings and news

reports. The indicators are designed to assess a company’s overall environment performance

along both positive (strengths) and negative (concerns) dimensions. The indicators cover

topics including toxic emissions and waste management, end-of-life recycling or disposal of

packaging materials, investment in low-carbon technologies, the operation of an

environmental management system, etc.

       We construct the index of Environmental rating by summing all of the strength
indicators and subtracting all of the concerns indicators. Specifically, Environmental rating =
∑𝑠𝑖=1 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑠i − ∑𝑐𝑗=1 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐j, where s and c denote, respectively, the number of items

on corporate environmental strengths and concerns. Environmental rating is designed to

provide a quantitative measure on a firm’s environmental management policies, programs

and initiatives, as well as the severity of controversies related to the firm’s environmental

impact. Environmental rating ranges from -5 to 5, with higher value indicating greater

environmental goodness.
                                                                                                               9



         2.2.3 A text-based measure of environmental protection activities from SEC 10-Ks

         We also construct a text-based measure of corporate environmental protection

activities from SEC 10-K filings. For each 10-K file, we search for phrases that indicate the

nature of the corporation’s environmental activities. We define Environmental activities as a

dummy variable that equals one if a firm’s 10-K filing contains one of the phrases, including

“environmental compliance”, “environmental remediation”, “environmental control”,

“pollution control”, “emission control”, “contamination remediation”, but not “environmental

liability.” About 20% of 10-Ks filed by 4941 sample firms over the period of 2000 – 2014

contain these expressions.



2.3 Shale wells data and bank liquidity shocks

         To create bank-specific measures of their exposure to shale discoveries, we begin

with IHS Markit Energy, which is a comprehensive database that provides detailed

information on the date, location, and well orientation for more than 100,000 shale wells

drilled across the U.S over the period of 2001 – 2014. A 14-digit API number developed by

American Petroleum Institute (API) uniquely identifies each well. For each county in each

year, we calculate the number of shale wells drilled since 2003, which is when technological

innovations made large-scale “fracking” commercially viable. 6 Wellsjt denotes the number of

shale wells drilled in county j as of year t. Figure 1 shows the intensity of shale drilling

activities across U.S. counties, represented by the total number of shale wells drilled across

U.S. counties from 2003 to 2014, with darker colors indicating a larger amount of shale

discoveries.

         To measure a bank’s liquidity gains from shale discoveries, we combine U.S. counties’

shale drilling activities with the bank’s local branch networks. We retrieve information on

each bank’s branch structure, location of its branches, and deposit balances in those branches




6
  Following existing research, as horizontal drilling is one of the key elements in the technologies of drilling
shale wells, we treat horizontal wells as the measure of shale-related activities. According to Gilje, Loutskina,
and Strahan (2016), almost all horizontal wells in the U.S. are drilled to extract shale or other unconventional
resources after 2002.
                                                                                                             10



from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) Summary of Deposits (SOD)

database.

        Based on (a) the geographic distribution of a bank’s branches across counties and (b)

the number of shale wells drilled in each county, we construct our two core measures of each

bank’s exposure to shale-induced liquidity shock in each year. 7 The first measure, Bank

liquidity gain1, equals the natural logarithm of one plus the number of shale wells drilled

across counties in which a bank has at least one branch divided by the total number of

branches owned by the banking institution. Formally, it equals



𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔1𝑏,𝑡 =
                               𝐿𝐿 �1 + ∑𝑗 �𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗 ∗ 1�𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏𝑏 > 0�� / 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏 �, (1a)



where b represents bank, j denotes county, and t denotes time. 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗 denotes the number of

shale wells drilled in county j from 2003 as of year t; 1(𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏𝑏 > 0) denotes an

indicator that equals one if bank b has branches in county j at year t and zero otherwise;

𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏 equals the total number of branches owned by bank b in year t. Note that Bank

liquidity gain1 equals zero for (a) banks without branches in shale development counties, and

(b) all banks before 2003, which is before the technological breakthrough that fostered

fracking. Bank liquidity gain1 has a sample average of 0.286, with a higher value indicating

greater liquidity shocks. And, among banks that are exposed to shale liquidity shocks, the

sample average of Bank liquidity gain1 equals 1.2.
        The second bank-year liquidity shock measure, Bank liquidity gain2, equals the

logarithm of one plus the number of shale wells across counties in which a bank has at least

one branch, where the number of wells in each county is weighted by the bank market share

in each county, divided by the total number of branches owned by the bank. Formally, the

second measure is defined as follows.

 Note, our measure is a bit different from that used in Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan (2016) because we account
for the intensity of shale development in each county.
                                                                                                              11



𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔2𝑏,𝑡 =
                 𝐿𝐿[1 + ∑𝑗�𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗 ∗ 1�𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏𝑏 > 0� ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀ℎ𝑟𝑏𝑏𝑏 �⁄𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏 ], (1b)



where b represents bank, j denotes county, and t denotes year. 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀ℎ𝑟𝑏𝑏𝑏 equals the

proportion of all deposits held within county j in year t that are held at bank b’s branches
within county j. Other components, 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗 , 1�𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏𝑏 > 0� , and 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏 are

defined the same as above. By weighting the number of wells in a county by a bank’s market

share in that county, this measure assumes that a bank’s liquidity inflows in a shale-

development county is proportional to its market share in that county. 8


2.4 Syndicated loan database

         To link shale liquidity shocks to a bank with its lending to specific firms, we use

syndicated loans. Syndicated loans provide U.S. nonfinancial businesses with about one

trillion dollars of new credit each year and account for 58% of the commercial & industrial

loans made by U.S. domestic banks, and 68% of C&I loans with maturities longer than 365

days. 9 In a typical syndicated loan deal, the lead arranger negotiates the specific contract

terms, conducts due diligence and monitoring, and invites other participant lenders to share

part of the loan. The lead arranger also tends to retain a larger share of the loan than other

participants. A syndicated deal can include more than one tranche, also called a facility. The

identity of the lead arranger or lead arrangers, the composition and number of other lenders,


8
  In robustness tests that confirm the findings based on Bank liquidity gain1 and Bank liquidity gain2, we use a
third measure, Bank liquidity gain3, that takes the second measure and further weights by whether each branch
is in a shale-boom county or not. We define a shale-boom county as a county in which the number of wells is
above the top quartile for all county-years in our sample. Once a county is categorized as a shale-boom county,
it retains that categorization in all subsequent years. Formally, the second measure is defined as follows.

𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔3𝑏,𝑡 =
                   𝐿𝐿[1 + ∑𝑗 �𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗 ∗ 1�𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏𝑏 > 0� ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀ℎ𝑟𝑏𝑏𝑏 ∗ 1�𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑗𝑗 ���𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏 ], (1c)

where subscript b, j, and t, and component 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗 , 1�𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏𝑏 > 0�, and 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑏𝑏 denote the same as
above. 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑗𝑗 is a dummy variable that equals one if the number of shale wells drilled in county j during year t
is above the top quartile of county-years with shale development activities, and zero otherwise. Thus, this third
measure captures each bank’s exposure to the shale liquidity shock through its branch networks across shale-
boom counties only.

                                                                                                               12



and the terms of the syndicated loan typically vary at the deal level. The vast majority of the

syndicated deals in our sample have only one lead lender, which is consistent with the

overview of this market in Standard & Poor’s (2011) report. Almost 50% of the deals in our

sample use at least five participant lenders.

         We obtain syndicated loan data from Thomson Reuters Dealscan database. Dealscan

collects information on syndicated loans from a variety of sources including SEC filings,

public documents (10Ks, 10Qs, 8Ks and registration statements), loan syndicators and other

internal sources. The database provides data at the loan-level, for which it reports the identity

of the borrowers, lead lenders, loan amount, loan purposes, loan terms, etc. Lenders in

Dealscan are reported at the BHC level. We therefore link lenders in Dealscan to the U.S.

banks at the holding company level. We keep all the loans made to non-financial U.S. firms

(excluding borrowers with U.S. SIC codes between 6000 and 6999), with the primary deal

purposes classified as corporate purposes, working capital, capital expenditure, debt

repayment, and takeover. We identify the lead arranger(s) for each loan package based on

whether it is the Administrative agent. The rest of the lenders in the syndicate are treated as

participants. For about 20% of syndicates without a specified administrative agent, lenders

that serve as one of the significant titles mentioned in Standard & Poor (2011), namely Agent,

Co-Agent, Lead Arranger, or Lead managers, or received Lead Arranger League Table credit,

are identified as the lead arrangers.

         The lenders and borrowers in Dealscan do not share a common identifier with BHCs

in the Summary of Deposits (SOD) or firms in the toxic emission databases (e.g., TRI) or

Compustat. To link the Dealscan lenders with banks from SOD, we manually merge the

lenders at the parent holding company level with the BHC in the SOD database. 10 To obtain
financial information for lenders, we further merge with the Federal Reserve FR Y-9C, which

provides consolidated balance sheets and income statements for each BHC in the U.S.

         To link Dealscan borrowers with firms in the TRI for pollutant emission data, we first

merge Dealscan with Compustat, and use the identifier in Compustat to link Dealscan with

10
  To make the manual merge manageable, we remove loans in which the lead lenders make a small number of
deals (less than ten). This restriction reduces the loan sample by only about 4%. This is consistent with the fact
that the syndicated loan market is highly concentrated among top lead arrangers.
                                                                                           13



TRI (already linked with Compustat). Specifically, to merge Dealscan borrowers with the

Compustat firms, we use the linking table between Dealscan and Compustat provided by

Chava and Roberts (2008) for deals before 2012. This helps match more than 90% of the

sample. For deals after 2012, we conduct a similar “fuzzy match” based on firm names as

reported in each dataset, followed by a manual check of all matches. Out of 2087 firms with

both toxic emission data and Compustat information, we are able to match 1050 with

Dealscan borrowers. Our merged dataset contains 75,555 plant-year observations with 1050

nonfinancial firms over the period from 2000 to 2014, which (a) are reported with pollutant

emission data in TRI, (b) appeared as Dealscan borrowers at least once, and (c) have

Compustat financial information. We further remove TRI plants that are located in counties

where there have been shale development since 2003 (shale counties), reducing the number

of observations from 75,555 to 66,819, and the number of plants from 9281 to 8839.



3. Shale Discoveries and Bank Liquidity Gains

3.1 “Fracking” and shale discoveries

           In the early 2000s, a technological breakthrough, known as “fracking,” combined

horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing to make shale gas production economically

viable. It changed the U.S. energy landscape. According to the most recent Annual Energy

Outlook (AEO 2016) released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale gas

went from accounting for less than 1% of U.S. natural gas production in the late 1990s to

nearly 50% of total U.S. natural gas production by the end of 2015. Due to fracking, useable

shale gas reserves can fulfill the entire estimated volume of U.S. natural gas consumption for

at least 30 years. 11

           Mitchell Energy discovered how to produce vast quantities of shale gas in an

economically profitable way in the Barnett Shale Play, Texas. Fracking breaks apart the

highly non-porous rock of shale formations, freeing natural gas trapped inside the rock. When

Devon bought Mitchell Energy and combined slick-water fracking with the drilling of

horizontal wells in late 2002, this created the modern, highly profitable fracking method.
11
     See, https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=natural_gas_where.
                                                                                              14



Therefore, we use 2003 as the first year when oil and gas industry started large-scale

investment in shale development.



3.2 Shale development and bank liquidity windfalls

       Given the technological improvements in fracking, oil and gas companies increased

their purchase of mineral leases from landowners in promising areas. With mineral leases,

local property owners typically receive payments, including a large upfront bonus, based on

the number of leased acres, plus a royalty percentage on the extracted resources from the

lease. Consequently, these purchases significantly boost deposits in local banks.

       In terms of mineral leases increasing deposits in local banks, both anecdotal evidence

and existing research suggest that the effects were large. As described in Plosser (2015),

leasing contracts typically involve a bonus that varies between $10 and $30,000 per acre, and

a royalty percentage ranging from 10% to 25%. Accordingly, if an individual owns one

square mile of land (equivalent to 640 acres) and leases out his minerals at an average value

of $15,005 per acre, he would receive an upfront payment of $9.6 million plus future monthly

royalties. Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan (2016) show that deposits grow faster among banks

exposed to shale boom counties compared to unexposed banks.

       We also confirm this finding in our context using the sample period from 2000 – 2014.

The model specification to test this channel is as follows.



    𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔ℎ𝑏,𝑡 = 𝜑1 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑏,𝑡 + 𝜑3 ′Π𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝑏 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑏,𝑡 , (2)


where b and t denote BHC and time, respectively. Deposit growthb,t is the growth rate of

domestic deposits for BHC b during year t. Bank liquidity gainb,t represents one of the three

measures on a BHC’s exposure to shale drilling activities described above (i.e., Bank liquidity

gain1 or Bank liquidity gain2). The coefficient of interest is 𝜑1 , which captures the extent to

which a BHC’s deposits grow in response to the shale development activities in its branching

networks. If shale-well drilling indeed brings a large liquidity windfall to local branch offices,

we expect 𝜑1 to be positive and statistically significant. We also control for an array of time-
                                                                                             15



varying BHC specific characteristics measured at the beginning of each period (Π𝑏,𝑡−1 ),

namely Total asset, Deposit/Total assets, Liquid assets/Total assets, Mortgages/Total assets,

C&I loans/Total assets, Loan commitments/Total assets, and Letters of credits/Total assets.

We also include BHC and year fixed effects, 𝛼𝑏 and 𝛼𝑡 , throughout the analyses. Standard

errors are clustered at the BHC level.

        The results reported in Table 2 indicate that shale-well drilling activities within a

BHC’s branch networks lead to a significant increase in that BHC’s deposit growth. As

shown, both measures on BHC liquidity gains enter the regressions positively and

significantly. The economic magnitudes are meaningful. The coefficient estimates from

column 1 indicate that deposits in BHCs that are exposed to the shale development activities

with an average value of Bank liquidity gain1 (= 1.2) would grow 1.7 percentage points

(=1.2*0.0138) faster than BHCs without such exposure. This is equivalent to about 20% of

the sample mean of deposit growth.

       Several factors suggest treating shale-drilling activities as exogenous liquidity

windfalls for local bank branches. First, the technological breakthroughs in fracking were

unexpected. Second, the economic viability of shale wells is often driven by broader

macroeconomic factors, such as demand for natural gas and prices of natural gas (Lake et al.,

2013), that are unlikely to be correlated with local economic conditions (Gilje, Loutskina, and

Strahan, 2016). Third, at least two facts suggest that banks cannot strategically adjust branch

networks to gain greater exposure to shale windfalls: (a) the discoveries of shale formations

in different geographies are uncertain, as it is difficult even for the oil and gas companies to

predict how many wells an area needs to drill before producing shale gas; and (b) mineral

leasing by the oil and gas companies usually occurs at a very rapid pace. As reported by

Times-Picayune in 2008, several years after the technological breakthroughs, the signing

bonuses for buying mineral rights in the Louisiana’s Haynesville Shale area increased from

about $100 per acre to between $10,000 and $30,000 per acre within one year.
                                                                                            16



4. Measuring: County- and Firm-Level Liquidity Shocks

Having established that shale oil discoveries influence bank liquidity through their branches

in areas exposed to these discoveries, we now employ two complimentary empirical

strategies for evaluating the impact of an increase in bank liquidity on environmental quality.

First, we examine only non-shale counties—counties in which shale was not discovered—and

construct county-specific measures of the degree to which banks in these non-shale counties

receive liquidity shocks through their branch networks in shale counties. We then evaluate

the impact of these liquidity shocks on environment in these counties. Second, we examine

how shocks to a firm’s supply of credit influences its environmental actions. To do this, we

construct firm-specific measures of the extent to which the firm’s main relationship lenders

receive shale liquidity shocks and then observe how this changes the firm’s loan terms and

the firm’s environment actions. We now describe the county-level and firm-level liquidity

shock measures in detail and examine the impact of these shocks on the environment in the

next sections.



4.1 County-level liquidity shock measures

       To evaluate the impact of county-level liquidity shocks on pollution in these counties,

we construct county-specific liquidity shocks. For each non-shale county in each year, we

aggregate shale liquidity shocks to banks operating in that county. We take the two core

bank-specific shale liquidity shock measures defined above and weight them by the share of

the county’s deposits held by each bank.

       We compute two county-level liquidity shock measures from these bank-specific

shocks. Consider first the county-level shock based on Bank liquidity gain1:



           𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔1𝑗,𝑡 = ∑ 𝜅𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 ∗ 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔1𝑏,𝑡 , (3)



where County liquidity gain1j,t represents the extent to which banks in non-shale county j at

time t received shale liquidity shocks via their branch networks in shale counties, Bank

liquidity gain1b,t denotes the bank-specific shale liquidity shock measure for bank b in year t
                                                                                                           17



(Equation 1a), and 𝜅𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 is the share of county j’s total deposits in year t that are held in bank

b’s branches that are located in county j. The second county-level liquidity shock, County

liquidity gain2, is computed in a similar manner but is based on Bank liquidity gain2b,t

(Equation 1b).


4.2 Firm-level liquidity shock measures

        To evaluate the impact of a liquidity shock to a firm’s relationship lenders on the

firm’s toxic emissions and other environmental actions, we need to both identify the firm’s
relationship lenders and construct a measure of the shale liquidity shock to that firm. To

identify the firm’s relationship lenders, we use the lead arrangers in the firm’s syndicated

loans over the previous five years. As noted above, syndicated loans account for about 60%

of total domestic C&I loans and the lead arranger plays the primary role in screening and

monitoring firms and organizing the financing of the loan with other banks. Furthermore, we

show below that lending relationships endure: if a bank was a firm’s lead arranger in a past

syndicated loan, it is likely that the bank will be the firm’s lead arranger in future syndicated

loans. 12 In this way, we define the firm’s relationship lenders as the lead arrangers in the

borrowing firm’s syndicated deals over the previous five years.

        Thus, to compute two firm-level liquidity shock measures, we proceed as follows. For

each firm that has borrowed in the syndicated loan market, we calculate its exposure to shale

liquidity shocks as the weighted average of the liquidity shocks to each of its relationship

lenders. The weight for each lender equals the proportion of the total amount of syndicated

loans received by the borrower in which the lender was the lead arranger. Specifically,



       𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔1𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑏∈𝑆[𝑡−5,𝑡−1] 𝜔𝑖,𝑏,𝑡 ∗ 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔1𝑏,𝑡 ,                 (4)


where Firm liquidity gain1i,t represents the extent to which firm i at time t is exposed to

liquidity shocks via syndicated relationship lenders and is based on Bank liquidity gain1b,t


12
  Prior research emphasizes the value of enduring banking relationships, e.g., Williamson (1987), Sharp (1990)
and Boot (2000).
                                                                                               18



(Equation 1a). S[t – 5,t – 1] represents the pool of all BHCs that have served as lead arrangers

for borrower i during the last five years, and 𝜔𝑖,𝑏,𝑡 denotes the fraction of borrower i’s

syndicated loans in which BHC b was the lead arranger over the previous five years, [t – 5, t

– 1]. Firm liquidity gain1i,t is therefore constructed as the weighted average of the shale

liquidity shock across borrower i’s relationship lenders at time t. Firm liquidity gain2i,t is

defined similarly, but is based on Bank liquidity gain2 (Equation 1b).



5. Empirical Findings: County-Level Liquidity Shocks and Environmental Quality

5.1 County liquidity shocks and county pollution

       To evaluate the impact of county-level liquidity shocks on air pollution in these

counties, we use the following regression specification.



            𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛽2′ Π𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑗,𝑡 . (5)



The dependent variable, Pollj,t, is one of the pollution concentration measures, where there
are 25 measures: for each of the five pollutants (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene,

and m/p Xylene), there are statistics on the mean, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentile readings at the

monitors within county j during year t. The explanatory variable of interest, County liquidity
gainj,t represents one of the two county-level liquidity shock measures defined by Equation

(3), where we focus on County liquidity gain1j,t and County liquidity gain2j,t. We include a set
of county characteristics, Π𝑗,𝑡 , namely Ln(Per capita personal income), Ln(Population),

Labor market participation, and Unemployment to account for time-varying economic
conditions, and county and year fixed effects, 𝛼𝑗 and 𝛼𝑡 to condition out time-invariant

factors across counties and time specific effects. In this way, we are comparing toxic

pollutant concentrations between otherwise similar non-shale counties in which banks receive

different liquidity shocks through their branch networks in shale counties. It is worth

emphasizing that we reduce the possibility that the results will be affected by changes in the

demand side emanating from shale discoveries by examining only counties in which there are
                                                                                               19



no shale discoveries. We estimate Equation (5) using OLS, with standard errors clustered at

the county level, and report the results in Tables 3 and 4.

       We find that county-level liquidity shocks materially reduce pollution. Table 3 reports

the results for each of the five toxic air pollutants on the two measures of county-specific

liquidity shocks. In Panel A, we provide the results on the mean values of the five pollutants

collected by EPA monitoring stations during each year. In Panel B, we provide the results for

the 50th percentile. We provide the results for the 75th and 90th percentiles of the values of the

five pollutants collected by monitors during the year in Table 4.

       As shown, the two county-level liquidity shock measures, County liquidity gain1 in

columns 1 – 5 and County liquidity gain2 in columns 6 – 10, enter negatively and statistically

significantly across all of the regressions reported in Panels A and B of Table 3. Positive

liquidity shocks are associated with sharp decreases in both average and median toxic air

pollution concentrations. The estimated economic magnitudes are large. For example, the

coefficient estimates from Panel A column 1 indicate that the annual mean level of Benzene

fell by 0.37 (= 0.555*0.659) in non-shale counties in which banks received a one standard

deviation (0.659) boost in liquidity from shale oil discoveries in their branches in shale

counties. This is equivalent to 26% (= 0.37/1.426) of the standard deviation of Mean,

Benzene in our sample.
       We next evaluate the impact of county-level liquidity shocks on extreme toxic

pollutant concentrations. That is, rather than focusing on the mean or median pollutant

readings and monitors during a year, we focus on very high readings (the 75th and 90th

percentile) during the year in each county. To test this, we continue to use the same

regression specification as in Table 3, except that we now examine pollution levels at the 75th
and 90th percentiles of readings at each monitor during each year. Furthermore, to continue

our focus on shocks to the supply of bank credit, we continue to examine only counties in

which there are no shale discoveries. Banks in these non-shale counties may receive liquidity

shocks through their branch networks in shale-counties. We report the results in Table 4,

where Panels A and B provide the results on the 75th and 90thpercentiles respectively. We
                                                                                                            20



again examine each of the five pollutants and give the results for both county-specific

liquidity shock measures.

        As shown in Table 4, we find that positive liquidity shocks in non-shale counties

materially reduce the level of extreme toxic air pollutant concentrations in those counties.

That is, the county-level liquidity shock measures enter negatively and significantly in all

regressions, suggesting that positive shocks to the supply of credit in a county significantly

reduces the 75th (Panel A) and 90th (Panel B) values of EPA monitored toxic pollutant

concentrations in a year. Moreover, As shown in Appendix Table A2 and A3, the results

remain highly robust when using a third county-level liquidity shock measure, County

liquidity gain3, which further differentiates shale counties by whether they experience a shale

boom or not. With respect to the estimated impact, consider Benzene. The coefficients from

column 6 of Panel A and B imply that one-standard deviation shock to county liquidity

(0.121) would reduce the 75th and 90th monitored values of Benzene by 0.412 (= 3.408*0.121)

and 0.795 (= 6.568*0.121) respectively. This is equivalent to 23.8% (= 0.412/1.729) and 24.8%

(= 0.795/3.197) of their corresponding sample standard deviations. The results presented in

Table 3 and 4 suggest that positive liquidity shocks to a county’s banks reduce hazardous air

pollution concentrations in the county.



5.2 County liquidity shocks and county pollution: heterogeneous effects

        To provide additional evidence on whether county-level liquidity shocks affect

pollution, we assess whether the drop in pollution associated with a given bank liquidity

shock is greater in counties in which firms have paid more EPA fines. Specifically, we

conjecture that (1) when firms believe that they face a more intense monitoring by the EPA

regarding regulatory limits on toxic emissions, this increases the expected value of making

pollution abatement investments and (2) when there are more EPA fines in a county, this

tends to increase firms’ assessments of EPA monitoring intensity. 13 Thus, we evaluate


13
  For example, when there are more fines, firms’ perceptions of the likelihood of being fined might increase
because of increases in the actual intensity with which regulators examine and penalize toxic emissions in that
county or because of increases in the degree to which firms are aware that regulators are monitoring their
emissions, i.e., the salience of the environment regulatory regime to the firms.
                                                                                               21



whether easing access to credit has an especially pronounced effect on pollution abatement in

counties in which there have been more substantial EPA fines.

       To conduct this evaluation, we use a county-level indicator of penalties for violating

the Clean Air Act (CAA) based on EPA’s compliance and enforcement data. For each county

in each year, we calculate the total dollar amount of CAA penalties over the past five years

across plants located in the county. We define EPA Penalties as equal to one if the total

penalty amount in a county is above the median value of county-years in the EPA’s

compliance and enforcement dataset, and zero otherwise. To test our conjecture above, we

interact EPA Penalties with the county-specific liquidity shock measure, include that

interaction term in Equation (5), and report the regression results in Table 5.

       We find that the pollution-reducing effects of liquidity shocks are greater in counties

with a more intense regulatory focus, as measured by EPA Penalties. For brevity, we simply

provide the results on the median and 90th percentile values for the five toxic air pollutants. In

Appendix Table A4, we find similar results for mean and 75th percentile, as well as

alternative measures of county-specific liquidity shocks. As can be seen from columns 1 – 5,

the interaction of county-specific liquidity shocks and penalties for violating CAA, County

liquidity gain2*EPA Penalties, enters the pollution regressions negatively and significantly

across the annual 50th percentile values for each of the five pollutants. In addition, as shown

in columns 6 – 10, the coefficient estimates on the interaction enters the regression of 90th

percentile values for four out of the five toxic parameters. The estimated economic

magnitudes are large: the coefficients from column 1 suggest that the Benzene-reducing

effects of credit supply in counties with a higher amount of penalties for violating the CAA

are about twice as large as those in counties with a relatively lower amount. Consistent with

the previous tables, we include Ln(Per capita personal income), Ln(Population), Labor

market participation, and Unemployment to account for time-varying economic conditions,

and county and year fixed effects to condition out time-invariant factors across counties and

6. Empirical Findings: Firm-Level Liquidity Shocks and Firm-Level Environmental

Activities

In this section, we evaluate the impact of shocks to the credit conditions facing firms on their

environment activities. To identify the impact of BHC-specific liquidity shocks on the

environment actions of related firms, we rely on two assumptions. First, BHC-firm

relationships in the syndicated loan market endure over time, i.e., if a BHC was a lead

arranger for a syndicated loan to a firm, that same BHC is likely to be a lead arranger for

future syndicated loans to that firm. Second, BHCs that receive liquidity shocks—from their

branches in localities in which shale oil is discovered—make credit available at better terms

to their relationship firms, including firms in localities in which shale oil was not discovered.

Based on these assumptions, we use shale-based liquidity shocks to a firm’s relationship

lender as a measure of an exogenous change in the credit conditions facing the firm and then

assess the impact on the firm’s environmental actions.

           We first present evidence on these two key identifying assumptions and then evaluate

the impact of firm-level liquidity shocks on their environmental activities. In particular, we

analyze the impact of liquidity shocks to a firm’s relationship lender on the firm’s emissions

of toxic air pollutants, the concentration of toxic air pollution at EPA monitors close to the

firm’s toxic emission plants, expert assessments of the firm’s overall environmental-related

performance, and the degree to which the firm is focused on environmental protection as

detected in its 10-Ks.



6.1 Evidence on identifying assumptions

           A key assumption underlying our identification strategy is that syndicated loan

relationships endure. To test this assumption, we proceed as follows. First, in each year, we

find the 20 most active lead arrangers of syndicated loans, i.e., those with the largest number

of syndicated loans as the lead arranger. For each borrower in year t, who has previously

accessed the syndicated loan market, we consider these 20 most active syndicated lenders as

potential syndicated lenders in year t. 14 Third, we estimate the following regression:
14
     We find robustness results when defining potential lenders as top 5, top 10, and top 50 active lenders.
                                                                                                  23




        𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏,𝑖,𝑗,𝑠 = 𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑏,𝑖 + 𝛼𝑏,𝑗 + 𝛼𝑏,𝑠 + 𝛼𝑏,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑏,𝑖,𝑗,𝑠 ,              (6)



where the dependent variable, 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏,𝑖 equals one if bank b acts as the lead

arranger for borrower i in industry j operated in state s in the current deal and zero otherwise.

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑏,𝑖 equals one of two variables: (1) Previous lead arranger is an indicator

variable of whether bank b has served as the lead arranger for borrower i in any deals over the

previous five years or (2) Previous lead arranger_lending ties equals the fraction of loans for

which bank b served as borrower i’s lead arranger over the previous five years. Thus,

Previous lead arranger_lending ties differentiates lenders by the strength of their ties with a

borrower. If lending relationships endure, then we expect that 𝛾1 > 0. Standard errors are

clustered at the borrower level.

       The results reported in Table 6 indicate that borrowers tend to repeatedly use their

previous lead arrangers when accessing the syndicated loan market. As shown in columns 1

and 2, both measures of previous lending relationships enter the regressions positively at the

1% significance level. To further isolate the repeat-borrowing propensity, columns 3 and 4

include lender, borrower industry-by-lender, borrower state-by-lender, and year-by-lender

fixed effects. As shown, the results hold. Given that a firm used a bank as the lead arranger,

the probability that the firm uses the same lender the next time it accesses the syndicated loan

market is estimated to be on average 0.5, and increases to 0.7 with strong lending ties.

       A second key identifying assumption is that when BHCs receive positive liquidity

shocks from their branches in localities experiencing shale discoveries, they provide more

favorable loan terms to their borrowers. Using the loan facility information from Dealscan,

we evaluate this by estimating the following regression at the loan level.


𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑙,𝑏,𝑖,𝑗,𝑠,𝑡 = 𝜃1 𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑛 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑏,𝑡 + 𝜃2′ Ζ𝑙,𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛼𝑏 + 𝛼𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛼𝑠,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑙,𝑏,𝑖,𝑗,𝑠,𝑡 . (7)



The dependent variable, 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑙,𝑏,𝑖,𝑗,𝑠,𝑡 , is either (1) the log loan amount or (2) the all-in-

drawn spread in the contract of loan facility l syndicated by lender b to borrower i in industry
                                                                                                             24



j operated in state s during year t. The key explanatory variable, Bank liquidity gainb,t

represents one of the shale liquidity shock measures to BHC b in year t (i.e., either Bank

liquidity gain1 or Bank liquidity gain2). 15 Furthermore, we include a set of control variables:

borrower sales at the time of loan origination, indicators of the loan type, and indicators of

the deal purpose (Ζ𝑙,𝑖,𝑡 ), lender fixed effects (𝛼𝑏 ), borrower industry-by-year (𝛼𝑗,𝑡 ), and

borrower state-by-year fixed effects (𝛼𝑠,𝑡 ). Standard errors are clustered at the lender level.

        As shown in Table 7, we discover that BHCs that are exposed to greater, positive

shale liquidity shocks originate larger loans and loans with smaller spreads. The coefficients

on our key explanatory variables, Bank liquidity gain1 (columns 1 and 3) and Bank liquidity

gain2 (columns 2 and 4), enter the regressions in which Loan amount is the dependent

variable positively and significantly, and the regressions in which All-in-Drawn Spread is the

dependent variable negatively and significantly. These findings suggest that when BHCs

receive positive liquidity shocks from their branches in localities experiencing shale oil

discoveries, they offer more favor loan terms.



6.2 Credit supply and both plant-level and parent company toxic emissions

        We next evaluate how plants—located in non-shale counties—adjust their toxic

emissions after their parent company’s relationship lenders receive a positive liquidity shock

through branch networks in shale counties. We estimate the following regressions at the

plant-year level.



𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑝,𝑖,𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡 =

                    𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2′ Π𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝑝 + 𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛼𝑠𝑠,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑝,𝑖,𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡 , (8)


where the dependent variable, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑝,𝑖,𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡 , is either Toxic Air Releases or Total

Toxic Releases from plant p affiliated with parent company i of industry ind, located in state

st, in year t. Firm liquidity gaini,t measures the extent to which the relationship lenders of


15
  We focus on publicly listed non-financial borrowers, and use the types of loans classified as revolvers. Table
1 Panel B provides the summary statistics for the key variables in our syndicated loan sample.
                                                                                                  25



parent company i receive positive liquidity shocks, and is defined above in Equation (4). We

control for a set of parent company traits (Π𝑖,𝑡−1): Total assets, Profitability, and Leverage,

measured at the beginning of each period, and the contemporaneous value of parent company

sales, Sales. We include plant, industry-year, and state-year fixed effects, 𝛼𝑝 , 𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡 , and 𝛼𝑠𝑠,𝑡 ,

to condition out any time-invariant differences across pollution plants and time-varying

differences across industries and states. We estimate the model using OLS, with standard

errors clustered at the firm level. To the extent that parent companies effectively devote more

resources to limiting toxic emissions when they receive better credit conditions, we expect

𝛽1 < 0.

        As shown in Panel A of Table 8, we discover that when a parent company’s

relationship lenders receive a positive liquidity shock, the parent company’s plants pollute

less. Panel A reports the empirical results using Equation (8). Columns 1 – 2 report the

regression results of Toxic Air Releases, and columns 3 – 4 report those of Total Toxic

Releases. As shown, the key explanatory variables of the degree to which a parent company’s

relationship lenders receive positive liquidity shocks (i.e., Firm liquidity gain1, or Firm

liquidity gain2) enter negatively and significantly at the 1% level in all specifications. These

results suggest that improvements in firms’ access to finance lead to less toxic emissions at

the plant level. Importantly, these results are unlikely to be affected by shifts in local

economic conditions as we exclude plants located in counties with shale development.

        To interpret the economic magnitudes of the estimated coefficients, consider two

otherwise similar firms, except that one receives a positive, sample mean liquidity shock (i.e.,
Firm liquidity gain1 = 0.486 as shown in Table 1 Panel C) due to its lending relationships

with BHCs exposed to shale liquidity windfalls, while the other does not receive the shock

(i.e., Firm liquidity gain1 = 0). The coefficient estimates from Panel A column 1 indicate that

toxic air emissions from plants affiliated with the “shocked” firm would be 7.1% (=

0.486*0.146) lower than those of the other firm.

        Turning from the plant to the company, we now aggregate the toxic releases of plants

(in non-shale counties) and apply them to the parent company and assess whether a positive
                                                                                                          26



liquidity shock to a parent company’s relationship lenders reduce its toxic emissions using

the following:



𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖,𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡 =

                    𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2′ Π𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛼𝑠𝑠,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡 ,         (9)



where the dependent variable, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖,𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡 , is either the log amount of toxic air

releases or all chemical releases by plants affiliated with firm i in industry ind headquartered

in state st in year t. The other variables and estimation procedure are the same as those in

Equation (8).

        As reported in Panel B of Table 8, the parent company level analyses confirm the
plant-level results: When a parent company’s relationship lenders receive a positive liquidity

shock, the company emits less air pollutants. These results are unlikely to be driven by

changes in local economic conditions resulting from shale development as we exclude plants

in shale counties and firms headquartered in counties with shale development from our

sample. 16 The estimated economic effects are large. For example, if a parent company’s

relationship lenders receive an average liquidity shock (i.e., Firm liquidity gain1 = 0.486), the

coefficient estimates from Panel B column 1 indicate that its toxic air emissions would be 20%

(= 0.486*0.420) lower than a similar company whose relationship lenders did not receive any

liquidity shock.



6.3 Credit supply, TRI plants, and nearby pollutants concentration from EPA monitors

        We further examine whether less toxic plant emissions resulting from enhanced

accessibility to finance leads to detectable reductions in toxic pollutants concentration, using

data records from EPA monitoring sites located “near” those pollution plants. Thus, rather

than using toxic emissions data from TRI plants, we now use data from individual monitors

to test whether there is a measurable reduction in environmental quality. To do this, we first


16
 As shown in the Appendix Table A5 columns 1 – 4, Table 8 results are robust to using another liquidity shock
measure, Firm liquidity gain3.
                                                                                             27



compile a sample of EPA monitors that collect toxic air pollutants concentration data and

have toxic emission plants located within a certain distance (two, three, or five miles). To

identify toxic emission plants, we use those covered in the TRI dataset. We determine each

plant’s active operating years using the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) database.

NETS follows over 58.8 million establishments from 1990 to 2014, covering essentially the

universe of establishments in the U.S. For each establishment, NETS contains information on

the first and last year of operation for which we use to determine the active operating year for

each toxic emission plant. For each EPA monitoring site in a year, we then match it to all the

active toxic emission plants located within two, three, or five miles, where we calculate the

geographic distance between each monitor and TRI plant using their latitude and longitude.

       We then construct a time-varying, monitor-specific measure by taking the average

liquidity shocks received by its neighboring plants. The liquidity shock measure of a plant

equals the extent to which its affiliated firm is exposed to liquidity shocks through its

relationship lenders, and is defined above in Equation (4). Appendix Table A1 provides

detailed variable definitions. We employ the following specification to evaluate whether

changes in the accessibility of bank credit across firm of nearby plants lead to detectable

shifts in ambient toxic air pollutants concentrations.



𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑚,𝑗,𝑡 = 𝜋1 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔(𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑖 𝜏 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑜𝑜 𝑎 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚)𝑚,𝑡 + 𝛼𝑚 + 𝛼𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑚,𝑗,𝑡 , (10)


where the dependent variable 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑚,𝑗,𝑡 is the pollutant-by-pollutant median level of

concentration from monitor m located in county j in year t. The key explanatory variable,

Liquidity gain (within τ miles of a monitor)m,t, denotes the extent to which toxic emission
plants located within 𝜏 miles of monitor m receive liquidity shocks in year t (i.e., Liquidity

gain1 (within τ miles of a monitor) or Liquidity gain2 (within τ miles of a monitor)), where τ

equals 2, 3, or 5. Appendix Table A1 describes variable definition in greater detail. We

include monitor and county-year fixed effects (𝛼𝑚 and 𝛼𝑗,𝑡 ) to condition out any time-

invariant differences across monitors, and time-varying differences across counties. In this

way, we isolate the credit supply effects from changes in local economic conditions.
                                                                                            28



Furthermore, consistent with previous analyses, we exclude monitors located in counties with

shale development to mitigate the concern of changes in local economic conditions due to

shale development. We estimate the model using OLS, with standard errors clustered at the

monitor level. Given that Table 8 results suggest that an easing access to finance of their

parent companies leads plants to reduce toxic emissions, we expect 𝜋1 < 0.

       The estimation results reported in Table 9 are consistent with our conjecture. The

dependent variable is the median values of annual observations on each of the five most-

monitored hazardous air pollutants (namely, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and

m/p Xylene) concentration collected from EPA outdoor monitoring stations. Panel A

calculates liquidity shocks at the monitor level using toxic emission plants within three miles

around each monitor. As shown, both Liquidity gain1 (within 3 miles of a monitor) and

Liquidity gain2 (within 3 miles of a monitor) enter the regressions negatively and

significantly across columns, suggesting that the level of toxic pollutants concentration

declines when nearby plants experience an easing access to bank credit. We include monitor

and county-by-year fixed effects in all specifications to account for time-invariant factors

across monitor, time-varying factors across counties. Our results remain robust when altering

the distance range of toxic emission plants around each monitor. As reported in Panel B and

C, our results are robust to calculating monitor-specific liquidity shocks using toxic emission

plants within two or five miles of each monitor. Moreover, the results are robust to using a

different liquidity shock measure, Liquidity gain3 (within τ miles of a monitor), as shown in

Appendix Table A6.

       Taken together, the results in Tables 8 and 9 are consistent with the credit view:

enhanced accessibility to finance leads to a reduction in borrowing firms’ pollutant emissions

with positive repercussions on environmental quality.



6.4 Credit supply and corporate focus on the environment

       We next assess whether positive liquidity shocks to a corporation’s relationship

lenders augment the firm’s focus on environment protection. Specifically, we use (1) the

MSCI ratings on each corporation’s overall environmental performance, Environmental
                                                                                             29



rating, and (2) our textual analysis of SEC 10-K filings of the degree to which the

corporation discusses actions it is taking to protect the environment, Environmental activities.

Section 2.2 above provides detailed definitions of these two indicators. Methodologically, we

use the Equation (9) regression specification.

       As reported in Table 10 columns 1 and 2, we find a strong and robust impact of the

degree to which a corporation’s relationship lenders receive a positive liquidity shock and the

MSCI environmental ratings of the firm. The coefficient estimates on the firm liquidity shock

measures, Firm liquidity gain1 and Firm liquidity gain2, are positive and significant at the 1%

statistical level in all specifications, suggesting that an improvement in the credit conditions

increases the extent to which firms adopt policies, programs, and initiatives that improve the

environment.

       Furthermore, Table 10 columns 3 and 4 show that after relationship lenders receive

positive liquidity shocks, their firms produce 10-K filings that focus more on environmental

protection. As shown, both measures on firm liquidity shocks enter the regressions positively

and significantly. The results in Table 10 hold when including firm controls (Total assets,

Profitability, Leverage, and Sales growth), firm fixed effects, industry-by-year fixed effects,

and state-by-year fixed effects. As shown in Appendix Table A5 columns 5 and 6, the results

also obtain when using the third liquidity shock measure, Firm liquidity gain3. These results

are unlikely to be driven by changes in local economic conditions resulting from shale

development as we exclude firms headquartered in—and plants operating in—counties with

shale development from our sample.



7. Conclusion

       In this study, we evaluated the impact of changes in the credit conditions facing

corporations on their emissions of toxic air pollutants in particular and their environmental

policies more generally. To make this assessment, we developed and implemented two

identification strategies. For both strategies, we exploit shale discoveries that created

exogenous liquidity windfalls for local bank branches and show that banks receiving these

liquidity shocks from their branch networks in counties with shale discoveries improved the
                                                                                             30



credit conditions that they offered to their clients in non-shale counties, i.e., counties where

shale was not discovered. The first strategy is implemented at the county-level. We construct

measures of the degree to which banks in non-shale counties receive liquidity shocks through

their branch networks in shale counties and evaluate how these shocks to county credit

conditions influence the emissions of toxic air pollutants in those counties. The second

strategy is implemented at the firm-level. Using syndicated loan data, we examine firms

located in non-shale counties. We then measure the degree to which a firm’s relationship

lender in the syndicated loan market received a liquidity shock through its branches in shale

counties and evaluate how these shocks influenced the firm’s pollution activities.

       We discover that an easing of credit conditions reduces corporate pollution. From the

county-level analyses, we find that when banks in non-shale counties receive positive

liquidity shocks through their branches in shale counties, there is a sharp reduction in toxic

air pollution in those non-shale counties. From the firm-level analyses, we find that when a

firm’s relationship lender receives positive liquidity shocks through their branches in shale

counties, the firm (a) reduces its emissions of toxic air pollutants, (b) gets higher ratings on

its overall environmental performance by MSCI analyses, and (c) increases the frequency

with which it mentions environmental concerns in its SEC 10-K filings. Our analyses only

include firms and plants located in non-shale counties to reduce concerns that the findings are

driven by local shale activities.

Table 2 Bank Shale Liquidity Shocks and Deposit Growth
This table presents the bank-year regressions of bank deposit growth on liquidity shock from the shale-drilling
activities from 2000 – 2014. The dependent variable is the growth rate of domestic deposits across columns. For
each bank holding company in a year, we construct two measures of shale liquidity shocks, Bank liquidity gain1
and Bank liquidity gain2. Both measures capture the extent to which each bank receives liquidity gains resulting
from shale development through its branch networks across counties. Bank liquidity gain1 measures the number
of shale wells drilled across counties in which a bank has at least one branch. Similar to Bank liquidity gain1,
Bank liquidity gain2 further considers a bank’s market share in each shale county. Equations (1a) and (1b), and
Appendix Table A1 provide detailed variable definitions. Bank specific controls include Total asset,
Deposit/Total assets, Liquid assets/Total assets, Mortgages/Total assets, C&I loans/Total assets, Loan
commitments/Total assets, and Letters of credits/Total assets, all measured at the beginning of each year. We
include BHC and Year fixed effects throughout the table. P-values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust
standard errors clustered at the BHC level, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at
10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 3 Bank Liquidity and Hazardous Air Pollution, County-Level Analyses Using
Data from EPA Pollution Monitoring Stations
This table reports the regression results of the effects of county-level liquidity shocks on the concentration of
hazardous airborne pollutants based on EPA monitoring stations. Our county-year sample includes only non-
shale counties, i.e., those counties with no local shale development. We take the five most monitored hazardous
pollutants, namely, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene. The dependent variable in
Panel A and B is the arithmetic mean and median values of each of the five air pollutants collected by EPA
monitoring stations during each year. The key explanatory variable is one of the county-specific, time-varying
measures on the extent to which banks in a county are exposed to shale development via its branch located in
shale-boom counties, i.e., County liquidity gain1 or County liquidity gain2. For each county in a year, we
calculate its banks’ shale liquidity shock by taking the average of bank-specific shale liquidity shock (i.e., Bank
liquidity gain1 or Bank liquidity gain2), weighted each bank by its local market share in that particular county.
We provide detailed definitions for County liquidity gain1(2), and Bank liquidity gain1(2) in Equations (3), (1a),
and (1b), and Appendix Table A1. County controls include Ln(Per capita personal income), Ln(Population),
Labor market participation, and Unemployment. We include county and year fixed effects across columns. P-
values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the county level, and reported
in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 4 Bank Liquidity and Extreme Hazardous Air Pollution, County-Level Analyses
Using Data from EPA Pollution Monitoring Stations
This table reports the regression results of the effects of county-level liquidity shocks on the extreme
concentration of hazardous airborne pollutants from EPA monitoring stations. Our county-year sample includes
only non-shale counties, i.e., counties with no local shale development. We take the five most monitored
hazardous pollutants, namely, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene. The dependent
variable in Panel A and B is the 75th, and 90th values of each of the five air pollutants concentration collected by
EPA monitoring stations during each year. The key explanatory variable is one of the county-specific, time-
varying measures on the extent to which banks in a county are exposed to shale development via its branch
located in shale-boom counties, i.e., County liquidity gain1 or County liquidity gain2. For each county in a year,
we calculate its banks’ shale liquidity shock by taking the average of bank-specific shale liquidity shock (i.e.,
Bank liquidity gain1 or Bank liquidity gain2), weighted each bank by its local market share in that particular
county. We provide detailed definition for County liquidity gain1(2), and Bank liquidity gain1(2) in Equations
(3), (1a), and (1b), and Appendix Table A1. County controls include Ln(Per capita personal income),
Ln(Population), Labor market participation, and Unemployment. We include county and year fixed effects
across columns. P-values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the county
level, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 5 Bank Liquidity and County-Level Hazardous Air Pollution, Heterogeneity
across EPA Penalties for CAA Enforcement
This table reports the regression results of the heterogeneous effects of county-level liquidity shocks on
hazardous air pollutants concentration from EPA monitoring stations, while differentiating counties by the
intensity of EPA penalties. Consistent with the previous tables, our county-year sample includes only non-shale
counties, i.e., counties with no local shale development. We take the five most monitored hazardous pollutants,
namely, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene. The dependent variable is the 50th or 90th
values of each of the five air pollutants concentration collected by EPA monitoring stations during each year.
EPA Penalties is an indicator that equals one if the dollar amount of penalties imposed on a county’s
establishments for violating Clean Air Act over the past five years are greater than the sample median value, and
zero otherwise. The key explanatory variable, County liquidity gain2, is a county-specific, time-varying measure
on the extent to which banks in a county are exposed to shale development via its branch networks. For each
county in a year, we calculate its banks’ shale liquidity shock by taking the average of bank-specific shale
liquidity shock (i.e., Bank liquidity gain2), weighted each bank by its local market share in that particular county.
We provide detailed definition for County liquidity gain2, and Bank liquidity gain2 in Equations (3) and (1b),
and Appendix Table A1. We define a bank’s market share in a county as the share of total deposits in the county
that is held by the bank. County controls include Ln(Per capita personal income), Ln(Population), Labor market
participation, and Unemployment. We include county and year fixed effects across columns. P-values are
calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the county level, and reported in
parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 6 Lending Relationship Stickiness in the Syndicated Market
This table reports the regression results of the likelihood of using a borrower’s previous lenders when accessing
the syndicated market for a new loan. For each loan contract in which the borrower has previously accessed the
market, they are matched to a set of potential lenders, where potential lenders are the top 20 active lenders in the
market in the same year of the loan contract. The dependent variable, Lead arranger, is an indicator that equals
one if the lender serves as the actual lead arranger for that deal, and zero otherwise. The key explanatory
variable in columns 1 and 2, Previous lead arranger, is an indicator for whether the lender served as the lead
arranger on the borrower’s loan deals over the previous five years. The explanatory variable in columns 3 and 4,
Previous lead arranger_lending ties, equals the fraction of loans for which the lender served as the borrower’s
lead arranger over the previous five years. Appendix Table A1 provides detailed variable definitions. The
specific fixed effects are indicated in the table, namely, Lender, Borrower industry (2-digit SIC)-by-Lender,
Borrower State-by-Lender, Year-by-Lender fixed effects. P-values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust
standard errors clustered at the borrower level, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance

Table 7 Bank Liquidity and Loan Terms
This table reports the regression results of syndicated loan terms on lenders’ exposure to shale liquidity shocks.
The unit of analysis is the loan facility level. The dependent variable is the logarithm of the loan amount of each
deal in columns 1 – 2, and the all-in-drawn loan spread in columns 3 – 4. Columns 3 and 4 report the coefficient
estimates divided by 100 for expository purposes. We focus on public borrowers, and facilities of revolvers. For
each bank in a year, we measure its exposure to the shale-drilling activities using two variables, Bank liquidity
gain1 and Bank liquidity gain2. Both measure the extent to which each bank receives liquidity gains resulting
from shale development through its branch networks across counties. Bank liquidity gain1 measures the number
of shale wells drilled across counties in which a bank has at least one branch. Similar to Bank liquidity gain1,
Bank liquidity gain2 further considers a bank’s market share in each shale county. Equations (1a) and (1b), and
Appendix Table A1 provide detailed variable definitions. We control for Lender fixed effects, together with
borrower sales at close, industry-by-year, and state-by-year fixed effects. P-values are calculated using
heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the lender level, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and ***
indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 8 Liquidity Shocks and Plant and Parent Company Toxic Releases
This table presents the effects of liquidity shocks to a firms’ relationship lenders on the firm’s (or its plants’)
releases of toxic chemicals. The unit of analyses is the plant-year level in Panel A where we exclude plants
located in counties with shale development activities, and the firm-year level in Panel B where we further
exclude firms headquartered in counties with shale development activities. The dependent variable is logarithm
of the volume of air emissions in columns 1 – 2 and the logarithm of the total volume of toxic chemicals
released in columns 3 – 4, measured for each plant in a given year. The key explanatory variable is, Firm
liquidity gain1 in columns 1 and 3, and Firm liquidity gain2 in columns 2 and 4. For each firm in a year, we
construct its shale liquidity shock as the weighted average of its relationship lenders’ liquidity shock (i.e., Bank
liquidity gain1 or Bank liquidity gain2), where each relationship lender is weighted by the loan amount it acted
as the lead arranger in deals during the previous five years. We provide detailed definition for Firm liquidity
gain1(2), and Bank liquidity gain1(2) in Equations (4), (1a), and (1b), and Appendix Table A1. Firm controls
include Total assets (lag), Profitability (lag), Leverage (lag), and Sales. Panel A includes Plant, Industry (SIC 3-
digit)-by-Year fixed effects, and State-by-Year fixed effects, and Panel B includes Firm, and Industry-by-Year
fixed effects. P-values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the firm level,
and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 9 Liquidity Shocks and Hazardous Pollutant Concentration near Toxic Emission
Plants, Monitor-Level Analyses
This table reports the effects of liquidity shocks received by toxic emission plants on hazardous air pollutants
concentration collected by their neighboring EPA monitors within three (Panel A), two (Panel B), or five miles
(Panel C). We exclude monitors located in counties with shale development from our monitor-year regressions.
The dependent variable is the median values of each of the five most-monitored hazardous air pollutants
(namely, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene) concentration in each year. The key
explanatory variable, Liquidity gain1 (within τ miles of a monitor) or Liquidity gain2 (within τ miles of a
monitor), is a monitor-specific, time-varying measure on the extent to which a monitor’s neighboring toxic-
pollutant-emission plants receive positive liquidity shocks. For each monitor in a year, we calculate its nearby
plants’ shale liquidity shock by averaging the shale liquidity shock of their parent companies (i.e., Firm liquidity
gain1 or Firm liquidity gain2). Appendix Table A1 and Equation (4) provide detailed variable definitions. We
include monitor and county-year fixed effects in all specifications. P-values are calculated using
heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the monitor level, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and
*** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 10 Liquidity Shocks and Corporate Focus on the Environment
This table presents the effects of liquidity shocks to a firms’ relationship lenders on (a) MSCI ratings on its
overall environmental performance, Environmental rating, and (b) the degree to which the corporation discusses
actions it is taking to protect the environment in its SEC 10-K filings, Environmental activities. The dependent
variable is Environmental rating in columns 1 and 2, and Environmental activities in columns 3 and 4. The key
explanatory variable is Firm liquidity gain1 in columns 1 and 3, and Firm liquidity gain2 in columns 2 and 4.
For each firm in a year, we construct its shale liquidity shock as the weighted average of its relationship lenders’
shale liquidity shock (i.e., Bank liquidity gain1 or Bank liquidity gain2), where each relationship lender is
weighted by the loan amount it acted as the lead arranger in deals during the previous five years. We provide
detailed definition for Firm liquidity gain1(2), and Bank liquidity gain1(2) in Equations (4), (1a), and (1b), and
Appendix Table A1. Firm controls include Total assets (lag), Profitability (lag), Leverage (lag), and Sales
growth. We also include Firm, Industry (SIC 3-digit)-by-Year, and State-by-Year fixed effects. P-values are
calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the firm level, and reported in parentheses.
*,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table A2 Bank Liquidity and Hazardous Air Pollution, County-Level Analyses:
Robustness
This table reports the robustness tests that are the same as those in Table 3, except that we use a third measure of
shocks to the credit conditions facing corporations within non-shale counties. Specifically, we examine the
effects of county-level liquidity shocks on the concentration of hazardous airborne pollutants based on EPA
monitoring stations. Our county-year sample includes only non-shale counties, i.e., those counties with no local
shale development. We take the five most monitored hazardous pollutants, namely, Benzene, Toluene,
Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene. The dependent variable is the arithmetic mean (columns 1 – 5) and
median values (columns 6 – 10) of each of the five air pollutants collected by EPA monitoring stations during
each year. The key explanatory variable, County liquidity gain3, is a third county-specific, time-varying
measure on the extent to which banks in a county are exposed to shale development via its branch located in
shale-boom counties. For each county in a year, we calculate its banks’ shale liquidity shock by taking the
average of bank-specific shale liquidity shock (i.e., Bank liquidity gain3), weighted each bank by its local
market share in that particular county. Bank liquidity gain3 are defined in a similar way to Bank liquidity gain2,
except that we focus on counties having a shale boom (the number of shale wells drilled during a year is above
the sample top quartile value). We provide detailed definitions for County liquidity gain3 and Bank liquidity
gain3 in Equations (3) and (1c), and Appendix Table A1. County controls include Ln(Per capita personal
income), Ln(Population), Labor market participation, and Unemployment. We include county and year fixed
effects across columns. P-values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the
county level, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table A4 Bank Liquidity and County-Level Hazardous Air Pollution, Heterogeneity
across EPA Penalties: Robustness
This table reports the robustness tests that are the same as those in Table 5, except for using (a) different
measures of shocks to the credit conditions facing corporations within non-shale counties (Panel A and B),
and/or alternative measures of the intensity of air pollution in non-shale counties (Panel C and D). Specifically,
we evaluate the heterogeneous effects of county-level liquidity shocks on hazardous air pollutants concentration,
while differentiating counties by the intensity of EPA penalties. We take the five most monitored hazardous
pollutants, namely, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene. The dependent variable is the
50th, 90th percentile, mean and 75th percentile values of each of the five air pollutants concentration in Panel A,
B, C, and D, respectively. EPA Penalties is an indicator that equals one if the dollar amount of penalties
imposed on a county’s establishments for violating Clean Air Act over the past five years are greater than the
sample median value, and zero otherwise. The key explanatory variable is County liquidity gain1 and County
liquidity gain3 in Panel A and B, and County liquidity gain2 in Panel C and D. For each county in a year, we
calculate its banks’ shale liquidity shock by taking the average of bank-specific shale liquidity shock (i.e., Bank
liquidity gain1, Bank liquidity gain2, or Bank liquidity gain3), weighted each bank by its local market share in
that particular county. Appendix Table A1 provides detailed variable definitions. County controls include
Ln(Per capita personal income), Ln(Population), Labor market participation, and Unemployment. We include
county and year fixed effects across columns. P-values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard
errors clustered at the county level, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%,
and 1%.

Table A5 Liquidity Shocks, Toxic Releases, and Corporate Focus on the Environment:
Robustness
This table presents the robustness tests that are the same as those in Table 8 and 10, except that we use a third
measure of the extent to which a firm’s relationship lenders receive a positive liquidity shock. Specifically, we
examine the effects of liquidity shocks to a corporation’s relationship lenders on the firm’s (a) toxic releases,
and (b) focus on environment protection. The unit of analyses is plant-year in columns 1 and 2 where we
exclude plants located in counties with shale development activities, and firm-year columns 3 – 6 where we
exclude firms headquartered in counties with shale development activities. The dependent variable is logarithm
of the volume of air emissions in column 1 and 3 the logarithm of the total volume of toxic chemicals released
in columns 2 and 4, Environmental rating from MSCI analyses in column 5 and Environmental activities from
SEC 10-K filings. The key explanatory variable is Firm liquidity gain3. For each firm in a year, we construct its
shale liquidity shock as the weighted average of its relationship lenders’ liquidity shock (i.e., Bank liquidity
gain3), where each relationship lender is weighted by the loan amount it acted as the lead arranger in deals
during the previous five years. Bank liquidity gain3 are defined in a similar way to Bank liquidity gain2, except
that we focus on counties having a shale boom (the number of shale wells drilled during a year is above the
sample top quartile value). We provide detailed definition for Firm liquidity gain3, and Bank liquidity gain3 in
Equations (4) and (1c), and Appendix Table A1. Firm controls include Total assets (lag), Profitability (lag),
Leverage (lag), and Sales. Columns 1 and 2 include Plant, Industry (SIC 3-digit)-by-Year fixed effects, and
State-by-Year fixed effects, and Columns 3 – 6 include Firm, and Industry-by-Year fixed effects. P-values are
calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the firm level, and reported in parentheses.

Table A6 Liquidity Shocks and Hazardous Pollutant Concentration near Toxic
Emission Plants: Robustness
This table reports the robustness tests that are the same as those in Table 9, except that we use a third measure of
the extent to which a monitor’s neighboring pollution plants receive a positive liquidity shock. Specifically, we
evaluate the effects of liquidity shocks received by toxic emission plants on hazardous air pollutants
concentration collected by their neighboring EPA monitors within three (Panel A), two (Panel B), or five miles
(Panel C). We exclude monitors located in counties with local shale development from our monitor-year
regressions. The dependent variable is the median values of each of the five most-monitored hazardous air
pollutants (namely, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, and m/p Xylene) concentration in each year.
The key explanatory variable, Liquidity gain3 (within τ miles of a monitor), is a monitor-specific, time-varying
measure on the extent to which a monitor’s neighboring toxic-pollutant-emission plants receive positive
liquidity shocks. For each monitor in a year, we calculate its nearby plants’ shale liquidity shock by averaging
the shale liquidity shock of their parent companies (i.e., Firm liquidity gain3). Appendix Table A1 and Equation
(4) provide detailed variable definitions. We include monitor and county-year fixed effects in all specifications.
P-values are calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the monitor level, and
reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.
