         "Double Dipping": The Combined Effects of Social Security and
                  Civil Service Pensions on Employee Retirement



                                    ABSTRACT



     We consider the retirement behavior of civilian employees of the
United States government. Unlike previous studies, this investigation
is based upon a data set containing fairly complete and accurate information
about the Social Security and employer—provided pensions for which employees
are (or ultimately will be) eligible. These data permit us   to   specify
the  financial aspects of individual retirement decisions with a reasonable
degree of precision. A large fraction of civil service pensioners is
eligible to receive Social Security benefits because a part of their working
careers was spent in Social—.Security—covered employment. The prevalence
of double pension coverage among government employees has raised serious
equity questions about the treatment of civil servants by Social Security,
and these questions have led to various suggestions for pension reform.
Partly, the reform proposals have been put forward due to the perceived
unfairness of "double dipping" which arises from the double pension coverage
of government employees.
     Our analysis finds: (1) Both the amount of a Federal pension entitle-
ment and the expected wait until the pension commences affect the timing
of retirement from the Federal service. (2) The rate of anticipated wage
growth significantly affects individual decisions to remain in Federal
employment. (3) Workers who are eligible to ultimately receive Social
Security in some cases show a different pattern of retirement than do workers
not vested in Social Security. However, our analysis does not reveal any
massive shift of Federal workers into Social—Security—covered employment
in order to benefit from the "tilt" in the Social Security formula.

1. INTRODUCTION

     Employer—provided pension plans have substantial impacts on the timing of

employee retirement. In large measure, these impacts are intentional. Pension

programs are frequently designed to provide powerful incentives to discourage

turnover among experienced personnel, but also to encourage job leaving among

older or very senior employees whose productivity may be declining. Among older

workers in particular, the characteristics of employer—provided pension plans may

have important consequences on the decision to remain employed with a particular

employer, find employment elsewhere, or leave market work altogether. While the

effect of Social Security on retirement has frequently been the subject of study,

the effect of employer—provided pension schemes has received far less scrutiny.

Both types of pension programs should be considered in a well specified model of

individual retirement decisions. Unfortunately, the difficulties of obtaining

reliable survey information about the generosity of individual pension entitle—

ments has hindered any careful study of private pension programs and their

impacts on retirement behavior.

     In the present paper we consider the retirement behavior of civilian

employees of the United States government, an unusually large employer which

also provides comparatively generous pension benefits. Unlike previous studies,

this investigation is based upon a data set containing fairly complete and accu-

rate information about the Social Security and employer—provided pensions for

which employees are (or ultimately will be) eligible. These data will permit us
                                      —2—

to specify the financial aspects of individual retirement decisions with a

reasonable degree of precision. What is more, the data allow us to distinguish

between government "ret irecs" who merely change employers and ones who leave paid

market work completely. The individual's decision to leave government employment

can therefore be treated within the context of a more fundamental consumer choice

problem, namely, the decision of whether to supply labor to the market.

     The government's pension plan deserves attention because of its peculiar

relationship to the American Social Security system. Unlike virtually all other

forms of paid employment in the U.S., Federal government service does not count

in the determination of Social Security Old Age Insurance benefits, nor are wages

from such employment subject to Social Security (FICA) taxes. In spite of this

feature of government employment, a large fraction of civil service pensioners

is eligible to receive Social Security benefits because a part of their working

careers was spent in Social—Security—covered employment. The prevalence of

double pension coverage among government employees has raised serious equity

questions about the treatment of civil servants by Social Security, and these

questions have led to various suggestions for pension reform. An important policy

reform currently under consideration is to bring all Federal government employees

into the Social Security system. Partly, this reform has been put forwafd due to

the perceived unfairness of "double dipping" which arises from the double pension

coverage of government employees. But the short—run impact of reform on the

efficiency of government operations might be substantial if the reform induced

large numbers of exrerienced workers to leave Fed€ral employment. For that

reason, it is of considerable interest to be able to estimate the retirement

effects of a variety of possible reforms. The qualitative choice model we

estimate in this paper permits us to do so.
                                       —3—

     Of course, the present peculiar relationship between Social Security and

Federal pensions may also induce some civil servants to retire earlier than they

they otherwise might .   Since Federal workers are not covered by Social Security

and hence have typically made only modest contributions to the Social Security

system, individuals may reap important benefits from leaving Federal employment

to work for an employer who is covered by Social Security. Because of a

redistributive "tilt" in the Old Age Insurance benefit formula that favors wage

earners who have made only modest contributions to the system, there may be a

substantial payoff in Social Security retirement benefits for Federal employees

who leave Federal employment to work only a few years in the Social—Security—

covered sector. This redistributive tilt has raised serious equity problems

which have led to calls for reform of the Social Security system as applied to

government employees. Note that an important difference exists with respect to

private sector employees who may also have a private pension and will be eligible

for Social Security benefits. Since they have worked in covered jobs throughout

their career, they do not benefit from the redistributive tilt of Social Security

retirement benefits. Only people who have worked in uncovered jobs for the

majority of their working years, e.g. civil servants, benefit from this provision

in the current Social Security retirement payment schedule.               -



    The plan of the paper is as follows. InSection 2 we consider financial

details of the Federal retirment and Social Security Old Age Insurance programs

and describe the inducements for government employees to remain in Federal

employment, to seek employment in the Social—Security—covered sector, or to

retire from gainful employment altogether. In the third section we discuss our

data set and specify the econometric model used in estimation. The information

for this study comes from a large administrative data file containing Federal
                                     —4—

employment records, Federal pension records, and Social Security earnings and

benefits records for one percent of all Federal employees who were over the age

of 54 and under 62 during 1976. The empirical results are based on the

retirement decisions of these individuals during 1977. Because of data

limitations it is not now possible to embed the retirement decision in a complete

life—cycle model of savings and labor supply, and our results must be interpreted

with this limitation in mind. The statistical model used in estimation is the

conditional probit model for qualitative choice proposed by Hausman and Wise

(1978). Section 4 contains a discussion of empirical results. In the following

section we consider the impact of reforming the existing Federal pension and

Social Security programs. The paper ends with a summary of our conclusions.

 2. FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO LEAVE FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT

     Federal workers aged 55 and older who have 30 years of Federal service are

currently eligible for Federal pensions upon retirement from Federal service;

workers aged 60 and older are currently eligible with 20 years' service; and

workers older than 62 are currently eligible with only 5 years' service. The

worker's pension entitlement upon retireement is a multiple (less than 0.80 and

greater than 0.075) of his average salary in his three years of highest wages.

This multiple, which we refer to here as the "replacement rate," is determined on

the basis of years of Federal service.1 Most older Federal workers have worked

many years in Federal service, and consequently may anticipate a Federal pension

that nominally replaces a large fraction of current wage earnings, either

immediately or within a few years. For example, among the 3,116 male Federal

employees in our sample, the average replacement——even without additional years

of service——was close to 50 percent in 1977. Among the 1,040 female employees,

the average replacement rate was over 35 percent.2

     Although the prospect of a generous Federal pension may encourage retirement

among older workers, several features of the pension computation may induce

workers to remain i.n Federal service. First, CSRS—vested workers with fewer than

30 years of service must wait until age 60 before their pensions commence;

workers with fewer than 20 years service must wait until age 62. Even without

any complications arising from wage and price inflation, this delay before the

commencement of pension payments must necessarily reduce the present discounted

value of any given stream of pension payments. A the delay lengthens, the

valueof any particular replacement rate declines, and the likelihood of

retirement presumably decreases.
                                       —6—

    Second, an additional year of Federal service increases the replacement rate

by 2 percentage points.3 This form of deferred compensation should encourage

workers to remain in Federal service, even if they are entitled to receive a

pension immediately upon leaving service. Also, the fact that the wage base for

computing the pension rises with an additional year's service (because nominal

Federal wages rise from year to year) should encourage individuals to remain in

Federal service.

    Third, the failure to index the wage base used in computing Federal pension

entitlements may encourage vested Federal workers who are not currently entitled

to receive pensions to remain employed in the Government.L For example, an

employee aged 55 with 27 years' service is eligible to receive a pension equal to

50 percent of his average, high three years' nominal salary. However, since he

has not yet attained 30 years' service, he must wait five years before his

pension will commence. As mentioned earlier, the five years' wait reduces the

present value of the pension, even ignoring problems due to inflation. If in

addition price inflation is 10 percent per year between the age of retirement

(55) and the age of annuity commencement (60), prices will have risen by 61

percent over the period while the nominal amount of the pension will have

remained constant. The real value of the pension will have fallen by 38 percent.

The worker can protect himself against this loss in real pension benefits by

remaining in Federal service.

     Federal pensioners are protected against rises in the cost of living because

pension payments——as soon as they commence——are indexed to the CPI. For certain

Federal workers, this indexing scheme may provide a perverse incentive to take

early retirement. Consider a Federal worker whose high three years of salary are

W, W (1 +   z),   and W (1 +    respectively. (Thus, s' is the rate of growth of
                                             —7—

 the worker's wage.) Suppose his replacement rate, based on current years of

 Federal service, is r. Suppose also that he anticipates future wage growth equal

 to past wage growth, namely, i.     If he retires immediately, his first—year
 Federal annuity, A1, will be:


 (1)                         A1 =
                                    w + w (1 +     ) + w (1   +
                                                                   •   r.
                                                     3




Because his pension is indexed, he can anticipate that after one year it would

rise by , the rate of change of prices. Hence, his second—year annuity, A2,

would be A1'(l +   ). On    the other hand, if he deferred his retirement for one

year, his second—year annuity, A2', would be:




(2)          AW(1++W++W(1+w)                                      (r+O.02)



It can be shown that under certain circumstances, defined in (3) below, the

second—year annuity (and all subsequent years' annuities) will actually be higher

for the worker who chooses to retire rather than work in year 1. Some algebraic

manipulation shows that:

                                               •              +
(3)                        A2 > A2 1FF
                                         •
                                                   + 2.P20



Thus, if the rate oF price inflation substantially exceeds the expected rate of

wage change in the Government, the potential retiree may be assured of a higher

nominal (and real) pension if he accepts early retirement rather than if he

defers his retirement for one year.
                                       —8—

      To see whether the condition defined in (3) above is ever likely to be

encountered, consider some typical values of s' and p in recent years. Federal

workers who are not eligible to receive merit pay increases are typically limited

to a "wage comparability" pay increase of 4.5 to 7 percent.5 In comparison, the

rate of U.S. price inflation has ranged from 6 to 13 percent in recent years. If

the expected rate of Federal wage growth is 7 percent and expected price

inflation is 12 percent, Federal workers with current replacement rates equal to

43   percent or more would receive higher annuities if they retired immediately
rather than postponed their retirement. (Federal workers with 24 years or more

of service might thus gain from immediate retirement.) If expected wage growth

were 7 percent and expected inflation were only 10 percent, Federal workers with

71 percent (or higher) replacement rates might gain through early retirement.

(However, it takes 39 years of Federal service to attain this replacement rate.)

      Although the arithmetic may seem arcane, there is little doubt that this

perverse inducement to take early retirement is widely understood within the

relevant population. Popular newspaper columns aimed at Federal employees spell

out the pertinent details and provide down—to—earth examples showing which

employees are most likely to lose pension benefits from continued service in the

U.S. Government. Shortly before one recent cost—of—living pension increase, for

example, the Washington Post alerted older Federal workers of the gains from

immediate retirement, and concluded with this sensible advice:
                                       —9—


      President Carter has projected a 6.2 percent active pay raise
      for this November [1980]. ..That is an increase much less than
      the current rate of inflation. Retirees, on the other hand, are
      linked to the rate of inflation with twice yearly adjustments.
      The pay raise—retirement squeeze is causing many people to check
      their options. If you doubt it, check the number of people retiring
      from your agency this month. (Washington Post, February
      17, 1980, p.B2)


Of course, for a Federal worker who anticipates that his own wages will rise

rapidly, the gains from immediate retirement are much more slight.

     •This section on incentive effects of the CSRS may be suiruinarized by noting

the strikingly different incentives of the system for those who are currently

entitled to pensions, on the one hand, and those who are entitled to pensions

after some delay, on the other. Because the wage base used to compute pensions

is not indexed, the latter group has a strong incentive to remain in Federal

service simply in order to partially protect the real value of its ultimate

pensions. But because wages among older workers may rise more slowly than the

CPI, to which pensions are indexed, workers who are currently entitled to

benefits may retire immediately and receive pensions that are approximately

equal——in real terms——to the pensions that would be obtainable after several

extra years of Federal service.

     In addition to the CSRS itself, a number of factors may affect the

retirement decisions of older Federal workers. For present purposes, one of the

most important is entitlement to benefits under OASDHI——the Social Security

system. Federal workers who are not vested in the Social Security system may

leave Federal service in order to become vested. The incentives to do so are

substantial. Benefits under Social Security can begin at age 62 or the year of

vesting in Social Security, whichever occurs later. Since Federal workers in our
                                        —10—


sample are at least 55 years old and must accumulate no more than 33 quarters of
Social Security—covered earnings in order to become vested, Social Security

benefits are not a distant prospect; they can be anticipated in the relatively

near future if vesting occurs. Also, because of the existence of a Social

Security minimum payment amount and other redistributive features of the Social

Security benefit formula, Federal workers who become vested in Social Security

can anticipate receiving benefits under the system that are large relative to

their   FICA tax withholding. Finally, Social Security benefits, unlike Federal
pension payments, are not subject to state or Federal taxation. Consequently,
the   net, after—tax value of a given Social Security benefit may substantially

exceed that of an equal amount of Federal pension.

        Among Federal employees who are already vested in Social Security, the

incentive effects of Social Security are somewhat more ambiguous. Since the wage

base used to compute Social Security benefits is indexed, the real value of a

vested wage earner's pension is generally protected against the price inflation

that occurs between the time the earner leaves covered employment and the time

the Social Security benefit begins. Consequently, there is no particular

incentive to remain in covered employment until just before benefit eligibility

commences as there is in Federal service. On the other hand, for some Federal

workers the real value, of the Social Security pension may be substantially raised

by working one or more additional years in Social—Securitycovered employment.

This could provide an important incentive to leave Federal service for other

employment.

        One complicating factor in considering the incentives offered by the Social

Security system is the earning test applied in determining OASI benefits for

those who are currently eligible to receive them. Annual wage earnings in excess
                                        —11—

 of a relatively low limit are subject to a 50 percent benefit reduction rate for

 those receiving Social Security benefits.     This tax applies against Federal wages

 as well as Social—Security—covered wages.     Consequently, Federal workers who are

vested in Social Security have an incentive to concentrate all of their

contemplated wage earnings——Federal as well as    private——in the period before they
begin receiving Social Security. By contrast, Federal workers who are not vested

 in Social Security do not have this incentive. Under the CSRS, the only wage

earnings   that affect the Federal pension entitlement are those that accrue from
continuing in a Federal job; wages   from a non—Federal job do not affect either

eligibility   for or the amount of a Federal pension.
     Final factors to consider among determinants of early retirement are age and
health. We expect that advances in age and declines in health status should
increase the probability of leaving work, either in the Government or in the
Social—Security—covered sector. In fact, health status and its interactive

effects with pension eligibility are frequently found to be the most important

factors associated with retirement (see, e.g., Quinn (1977). Unfortunately, the

data at our disposal do not permit us to measure an individual's health status

with any precision. Thus, we have adopted a specification of the effects of age

that is consistent with our notions about the interrelationship between age and

health. In particular, we believe that among younger workers variations in

health are comparatively less important in determining work status than they are

among older workers. This is primarily because variations in health become more

pronounced as an age cohort becomes older. This general notion will be given

more precision as we describe our empirical specification below.




                                                                                        V

3.   EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION AND ESTIMATION PROCEDURE

      In the previous section we described in general terms the factors that may

affect an individual's decision to leave Federal employment. Our discussion

concentrated on the effects of the Federal retirement system itself and on the

possible effects of Social Security and age. In the present section we specify

an empirical estimating equation, and in the next section we summarize the

results obtained from applying it.

      There are two general reasons for leaving Federal service. The first is the

desire to leave gainful employment altogether and the second is the desire to

accept a job from a non—Federal employer. Because the incentives that lead

Federal workers to take one or the other of these alternatives are so different,

we have adopted a three—state qualitative choice model. The three states are

defined on the basis of individual information covering the 1977 calendar year.

It will be recalled that our sample consists of men or women aged 54 to 61 who

were Federal employees at the end of 1976. (Employees who did not make wage

contributions to the CSRS are excluded from our sample.) We define an individual

as a "Federal employee" if there is an indication on our file that the person was

Federally employed during 1977 and if there is no indication that he or she began

receiving a Federal pension some time during 1977. Remaining individuals are

defined  either as "privately employed" or as "retired;" a "privately employed"
person is one who has Social—Security—covered wages during 1977, while a
"retiree" does not.
      We assume that each of   the   three states just defined have particular
attributes   that individuals find either attractive or unattractrive. To the

extent that two of the states possess a similar attribute, both states should be

viewed similarly by individuals in the sample. To fix ideas, consider an
                                       —13—

 attribute like "Federal pension benefits." Two states—--"private employment" and

 "retirement"——allow individuals to collect the Federal pensions to which they may

 be entitled, and thus both states ought to be considered identical with respect

 to "Federal pension benefits." (By contrast, the remaining state—--"Federal

 employment"——is quite different; current Federal employees cannot collect Federal

pensions.) Other attributes may be unique to a single state. For example, the

only state in which an individual can become entitled to increases in future

Federal pension benefits is "Federal employment." The attributes (or variables)

characterizing the three states are defined in Section 4, below.

     The econometric specification used to estimate our model of retirement

decisions is the covariance probit model of Hausman and Wise (1978). The

covariance probit specification removes the independence assumption of the

conditional logit specification which has characterized previous econometric work

on retirement, e.g., Boskin and Hurd (1978). The reason that the independence

assumption seems improper in the context of a model of retirement is that two of

our three states, working for the Federal government or working in the private

sector, seem closer together in terms of the unobserved attributes than does the

third state, complete retirement. The covariance probit specification assumes

that a distribution of tastes exists in the population. Here we assume a

distribution of tastes, exists for work (or leisure), so that an individual with a

lower than average preference for leisure will be more likely to be in either of

the first two states than an observationally equivalent individual with a higher

than average preference for leisure. Only through relaxing the assumption of

independence can we allow these differential taste factors to enter the model and

influence choice of work states or retirement states.
                                                 -14-

      The specification of the model assumes a level of utility Ujj for person

i in state j. Let Xj stand for attributes of state j for person i, e.g.,

the individual's nominal federal pension entitlement, and Si stand for

individual attributes such as age. Then utility Ujj can be decomposed,

without loss of generality, into a deterministic part, which represents the

"average" individual, and a stochastic term, which represents the deviation from

average utility for this particular individual:




(4)          U.. =     u(x.13.,s.)
                                1
                                      ff(X. .,S.) + Cx. .,s.)
                                              1        13  1
                                                                 jl,2,3 il,n
                 13                       i3

                                        13    13




In equation (4) the tT (.) terms represent how the average individual with

his utility in that state is highest. Since the cd's introduce a stochastic

instance, the probability that person i chooses state 1, here continued Federal

employment, is

 where the number subscript notation in the last line of equation (5) signifies

 subtraction.

        To make the model operational we now choose a probability distribution for

 the c..'s. We assume that they are independent across individuals, but that the

 joint density function f(c12,c12,13) is distributed as trivariate normal

 N(O,). Thus we allow for covariance among the cd's through specification of Z.


This covariance probit assumption is more general than the conditional logit

model which assumes independence of the c's. Given the specification of the

of the joint density function we can compute the probability r1 of equation (

Let us represent the unknown parameters of U(s) and E as the vector 0. Then we

estimate the unknown paramters by the method of maximum likelihood using the log

likelihood function

      We now consider the specification of the tT(X.., S.) term in equation (4) and

the covariance matrix Z. We use the variables mentioned above as well as

individual attributes to specify .             . = Z.   .8 as a linear in parameters function

enter the Zj's via ratio or polynomial terms. However, the linear—in—parameters

specification does impose a limitation on the model. Since pensions and Social

Security benefits represent a stream of payments over time, they need to be

discounted back to the present. Of course, the discount rate used by the

individual is an unknown parameter of the model. The proper method to introduce

discounting over time is through use of exponential functions, exp (—It), where y

is the unknown discount rate and t is the relevant time period. But since use of

the exponential function would introduce an extremely complicated nonlinearity

into the model, we instead use a quadratic specification in t and t2 as an

approximation that is much simpler to estimate. As it turns out, all of the

quadratic functions take the correct shape as a function of their estimated

parameters. Specification of E also presents a problem.    The original Hausman—

Wise (1978) specification would introduce 12 additional covariance parameters

which would be difficult to estimate precisely. Instead we use a considerably

more simple specification which is meant to capture the distribution of

preferences in the population toward work. We allow the parameter representing

age effects to vary in the population, giving the specification8

Thus, the correlation coefficient p, which measures tastes for Federal

employment or private employment, rises with age. At the same time the variation
                                      —17--


of these two states also rises with age relative to the variance of the

retirement choice. This specification is meant to capture the increasing

variability of the work decision which arises because of the (unobserved)

deterioration of health with increasing age. At the same time, the rising

correlation can capture the effect that taste for work and leisure increasingly

dominates the individual's decision once he has qualified for the appropriate

pensions and their rate of increase becomes less. As it turns out, we estimate

   to be an important component of our specification for males. However, for

females, the covariance component does not turn Out to be an important part of

the model.

     One last econometric point deserves mention. Since our data set Consists of

a single year's decision by Federal employees aged 55—61, we have omitted

individuals who have previously left the Federal service. Since the probability

of retirement increases with age, we have oversampled younger individuals. But

the age variable and various discounted pension terms should capture this effect.

The problem which might arise is if the model were used for long—run simulation

purposes. If the age distribution of Federal employees is not in equilibrium and

our model does not accurately capture all age effects, the parameter values might

be different for a later period. In particular, we might expect our estimate of

   to change. To fully explore this possibility, we would need a complete sample

of Federal employees and their age of termination or retirement. Such data are

not presently available.

4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

     Empirical results for our retirement model are presented in Table 1 below.

The attributes characterizing the three states and the affected individuals are

defined in the accompanying attachment to the table. The inclusion of these

variables in our model was justified in Section 2, where we described the

incentives that induce older workers to leave Federal employment. Note that the

financial variables are included in ratio form, i.e., as replacement rates. This

specification turned out to be more successful in explaining retirement patterns

than the alternative of including values of potential pensions in non—ratio form.

      Estimates for both men and women are qualitatively similar so we shall

focus our discussion on the results for men. As expected, the rate of growth of

an individual's wages in the Federal Government (WAGE76/WAGE73) is an excellent

predictor of whether he will remain in Federal service. Two reasons for this

association may be advanced. First, when the direct payoff from worki,ng in the

Federal service is rising rapidly, the attractiveness of Federal employment in

comparison to both private employment and retirement is strengthened. Second,

rapid rises in current wages lead to similarly rapid rises in deferred

compensation because an individual's wage upon leaving Federal service

constitutes one third of the wage base used to compute ultimate pension benefits.

The more rapid the wage rise, the larger the gain in ultimate pension benefits

from remaining in Federal service. (See equaton (3) above.)

     The second set of variables——FED.REPL.RATE, FRR*YR, and FRR*(YR)2——reflects

the generosity of a worker's Federal pension entitlement. As expected, workers

eligible to receive a pension immediately upon leaving Federal service are more

likely to take private employment or to retire than are otherwise identical

workers who can receive a pension only after some delay. Also, among workers who

can immediately receive a pension, those who are entitled to a higher replacement

rate are more likely to take private employment or to retire. However, the

evidence concerning Federal pension incentives contains one surprise. Suppose we

consider Federal workers whomust wait one to three years after leaving Federal

service before their pensions commence. Among these workers, the likelihood of

leaving Federal service actually declines as the nominal replacement rate rises.

We conjecture that this may be attributable to inflation. Workers with a higher

replacement rate stand to lose more in absolute terms as a result of price

inflation, and consequently they may be more likely to remain in Federal service

simply to protect the real value of their pension.

     The next variable, CHG.S.S.REPL.RATE, is intended to measure the amount of

net gain in ultimate Social Security pension that a worker could obtain by moving

from Federal to private employment. In computing this variable, it is assumed

that his attainable wage in the private sector is equal to his potential 1977

Federal wage. While partly unrealistic, this assumption serves to grossly

distinguish between workers for whom Social Security offers a good payoff and

those who gain only slightly from the "tilt" in OASI benefits. (The variable

takes nonzero values only for workers who are already vested in Social Security

or who would become vested if they worked four additional quarters in the Social—

Security—covered sector.) The estimated coefficient is opposite in sign to what

might be expected , though obviously it is not very precisely measured. However,

the reader should be cautious in interpreting this result, since the incentive to

take Social—Security—covered employment is probably poorly measured by our

variable. (Alternative variable definitions did not yield any better results,

however.)
                                    —20—


     The next variables (SSRR*YR——RET, and SSRR*(YR)2——RET) capture the effects

of Social Security "wealth" on retirement. As anticipated, the longer the wait

till Social Security benefits commence, the smaller the likelihood of retirement.

However, individuals who will ultimately be entitled to receive Social Security

benefits are actually less likely to retire during their late 50's and early 60's

than are otherwise comparable Federal workers who have no anticipated benefits

under Social Security. We surmise that potential Social Security recipients, to

avoid the high implicit tax in the Social Security earnings test, may concentrate

their earnings in the period before they begin receiving OASI benefits. The next

three variables (S.S.REPL.RATE——FED, SSRR*YR__FED, and SSRR*(YR)2__FED) capture

the effect of Social Security "wealth" on remaining in Federal employment. Here

the response of men and women, although apparently quite similar, is actually

somewhat different. We shall discuss the female results first. On balance,

women who are entitled to eventually receive Social Security benefits are more

likely to leave Federal service than are otherwise comparable women not entitled

to Social Security. (To see this, the reader should note that because of the age

limitation we impose, no woman in our sample is entitled to receive Social

Security benefits for at least one year. For most women in the sample, a longer

period is required. Consequently, the interaction between the Social Security

replacement rate and years—to—benefit receipt causes the overall impact of Social

Security to be negative.) Also, as the Social Security replacement rate rises,

the likelihood of leaving Federal service also rises. Curiously, women who are

closest to being eligible for Social Security (i.e., those who are closest to age

62) are the least affected by its incentive effects.
                                      —21—

     For men, on the other hand, Social Security "wealth" seems to provide an

inducement to remain in Federal service. On balance, older men who are vested in

Social Security have a greater likelihood of remaining in Federal employment than

comparable men who are not vested. This tendency is greatest for men who are

closest to age 62, the age at which Social Security benefits can commence. For

men in their mid—50's, there is little difference between those vested and those

not vested in Social Security.

     The last variable we consider is AGE. As anticipated, advancing age

significantly reduces the likelihood that a Federal worker will choose to work,

either in the Federal Government or in the Social—Security—covered sector. Among

men, although not among women, there is good evidence that the variability of age

effects on working also rises with age. We attribute this to the fact that the

variability of health status rises with advancing age.

5. SIMULATION OF REFORM IMPACTS

     It is natural to consider the implications of our results for reform of the

retirement programs now available to Federal employees. In this section we

consider two possible reforms, one involving the Civil Service Retirement System

and the other involving Social Security retirement benefits. Both reforms cause

a change in the financial attractiveness of occupying one or more of the states

we have been considering in this paper. In particular, one or more attributes

obtainable from a particular state can be affected by the reforms, and as a

consequence utility maximizers may attain greater satisfaction by choosing a

different status than the one chosen in the prereform world. We will measure the

impact of the proposed reforms by computing the fraction of people represented by

our sample who would choose a different status in the postreform world than in

the prereform world.

     In principle, this can be accomplished in two ways for a given sample.

First, the probability of occupying each of the states in the postreform world

can be computed for each observation. Then each observation can be assigned to a

particular state by means of a random process in which the probability of being

assigned to any state is equal to the computed probability of occupying that

state. The effect of the reform can then be computed by summing up the number of

individuals occupying each of the states and comparing the resulting totals to

the simulated or actual prereform distribution. A second method of computing the

postreform distribution of individuals is to compute the probability of occupying

one of the states si'ccessively for each observation and then to sum the

probabilities across observations. This procedure is then repeated for all but

one of the states. As sample size becomes indefinitely large, both procedures

will yield identical estimates of reform impacts. In this paper we use the
                                       —23--


 latter method because it is associated with smaller prediction varibility in

 finite samples.

      Federal pension reform. The first reform we consider is changing the age

 requirements for Federal pension receipt. As noted in the first section, Federal

 employees who have met minimum tenure requirements are currently eligible to

receive a pension when they reach age 55. Under the simulated reform, the

earliest allowed pension receipt is postponed to age 62. Given the distribution

of age in our sample (55 to 61, inclusive), very few persons would become

eligible for pension receipt during the 1977 calendar year under the proposed

reform. (By contrast, nearly half of the men in our sample were eligible for

1977 pensions under the prereform rules.) Thus the reform reduces the present

discounted value of the Federal pension. The fact that the Federal wage base is

not indexed in computing a pension entitlement means that the reform also reduces

the real value of the pension once it commences at age 62 for persons retiring

before 62. Our discussion in the first section suggests that this reform should

reduce the incentive to leave Federal employment. Our specification of the

incentives to retire captures this effect in the two interaction terms between

the Federal pension replacement rate and the number of years of wait until the

pension commences. The effect of this pension reform on financial variables in

our sample can be seen in Table 2 where we have given the mean sample values both

for the prereform system (column 1) and the postreforni system (column 2). As can

be seen in this table, the third and fourth variables listed —— the
                                                                    pension—delay
interaction terms —— are substantially increased by the reform.

    To estimate the effects of these financial changes on retirement patterns,

we performed two simulations of the type described above. The first simulation

yields predictions on the prereform retirement pattern; the second, predictions

 on the postreform pattern. These simulation results are presented in the first

 and second panels of Table 3.   (The actual prereform retirement pattern is given

 in the bottom row of the first panel. As may be seen, the actual prereform

distribution differs only slightly from the predicted pattern, where the

predictions are based on the estimated parameters in Table 1.) The simulation

results suggest, as expected, that the number of older Federal employees leaving

Federal employment will drop sharply (by 47 percent) as a result of the reform.

The number of workers going into private employment drops even more sharply than

the number choosing complete retirement because Federal work and private work are

"closer" substitutes than Federal work and complete retirement.   Interestingly,

there is a larger proportional effect on decisions to leave Federal employment

among older workers (aged 58 to 61) than among the youngest cohort (aged 55).

The readers should note that these simulation results reflect the first—year

effect of the proposed reform. In later years the proportional effect will be

quite different as the composition of the older Federal work force is affected by

cumulative effects of the reform.

     Social Security reform. In the introduction to this paper we mentioned that

potential double coverage of civil servants by both Federal pension and Social

Security retirement benefits has raised serious equity questions about the

interaction between th two programs. The equity issue arises because the Social

Security benefit formula is intentionally redistributive, paying larger benefits

relative to contributions to workers with low lifetime earnings than to workers

with high earnings.9 Civil servants do not pay Social Security taxes on their

government earnings, nor do those earnings count in the determination of Social

Security benefits. Consequently, when civil servants become vested in Social

Security they are inappropriately treated as low—wage workers, since only a

 fraction of their lifetime earnings —— those earned in Social—Security—covered

 employment ——   are   counted in Social Security benefit determination.

           A variety of reforms has been suggested to reduce or eliminate the

unintended subsidies" that accrue to retired civil servants as a result of

double coverage by Social Security and Federal pensions. The reform we simulate

here was suggested by a panel commissioned by the U.S. Congress to investigate

the interaction between government pensions and Social Security.'0 The panel

suggested computing Social Security benefit entitlements on the basis of the sum

of Federal and Social—Security—covered wages, rather than Social—Security—covered

wages alone. (Federal wages would not, however, become taxable by Social

Security.) This computed replacement rate would than be applied only against

average Social—Security—covered wages (E,) in determining the Social Security

benefit.

     To phase in this reform, Federal wages would only be counted starting with

wages paid in an initial year, say 1975. Federal wages paid prior to that year

would not be counted in the benefit determination. In our simulation, we assumed

that 1975 and 1976 (and subsequent years') Federal wages up to the Social

Security taxable maximum were recorded by the Social Security Administration and

were used in computing Social Security benefits under the reformed formula. As

may be seen in Table 2 above, this reform affects a considerable number of

variables in our specification of the retirement decision. All variables

associated with the Social Security replacement rate are of course affected,

though their mean values are only slightly affected because only a small

proportion of persons in our sample is vested in Social Security. In addition,

the reform affects the change in Social Security replacement rate that results

from an additional year of working. Under the prereform system, earnings in the

Federal Civil Service do

not affect the Social Security replacement rate at all, since
not counted in determining Social Security benefits.     But under the reformed

system, Social Security benefits for Federal employees vested in Social Security

actually fall with each additional year of Federal employment.     This change

should affect the relative attractiveness of remaining in Federal employment for

persons vested——or expecting to become vested——in Social Security.

     The simulation results for this reform are presented in the bottom panel of

Table 3. The simulation indicates that the reform would have only a very small

impact on retirement patterns among men aged 55 to 61, though of course the

impact may be expected to grow over time as additional years of Federal wages are

included in the Social Security benefit computation. In later years the

reform's effect on Social Security replacement rates will become larger, and the

incentive to retire from market work altogether should become proportionately

smaller. The reader should recall that our estimate of the effect of the change

significant of recently proposed reforms may be expected to have only modest

-effects on Federal retirement patterns in the first few years after it is

    SUHMARY

     In     this paper we have presented and estimated a model that predicts the

choice of older Federal workers among three alternatives: continued Federal

employment, employment solely in the Social—Security—covered sector and complete

retirement. Our empirical estimates confirm some reasonable expectations

concerning the effects of certain financial and nonfinancial incentives to

ret ire——



      • Both the amount of a Federal pension entitlement and the expected
        wait until the pension commences affect the timing of retirement
        from the Federal service.


      • The rate of anticipated wage growth significantly affects individual
        decisions to remain in Federal employment.


      • Advancing age is a significant disincentive to remaining in Federal
        or non—Federal work.


      • Workers who are eligible to ultimately recieve Social Security in
        some cases show a different pattern of retirement than do workers
        not vested in Social Security:


               Vested workers are more likely to remain in Federal service,
               especially as they approach age 62.


               Among vested workers, those with higher anticipated replacement
               rates from Social Security are more likely to remain in Federal
               service than those with lower repiacernent rates.


However, our analysis did not reveal any massive shift of Federal workers into

Social—Security—covered employment in order to benefit from the "tilt" in the

Social Security formula. The reader should be very cautious in interpreting this

last result, however, because our measure of the gains from working in Social—

Security—covered employment is extremely imprecise.
                                         —28—

     Finally, we presented simulation results for males in our sample based upon

making changes in the financial attractiveness of the Federal pension system and

the Social Security, benefit formula. Our results suggest that advancing the age

at which Federal pension receipt is permitted will have a substantial impact on

the pattern of Federal retirement: far fewer Federal employees will choose to

leave Federal for private employment or to leave paid employment altogether. On

the other hand, reform of the Social Security benefit formula to reduce

unintended subsidies to Federal reitrees was found to have only a very small

impact of Federal retirement patterns.

    All of our conclusions are presented with the caveat that they are based on

retirement decisions in a self—selected group of nonretirees from Federal

employment. An important goal for future research must be the development of

longitudinal individual records that permit the examination of retirement

decisions within the context of longer term or life—cycle models. In the absence

of such data, inferences about the impact of employer—provided pension programs

must rely on theory and cross—sectional models of qualitative choice.
NOTES


     1For the first 5 years of Federal service, each year adds 0.015 to the
replacement rate; years 6 through 10 add 0.0175 per year to the replacement rate;
and each year in excess of 10 adds 0.02 to the replacement rate.

     2Many employees, of course, were not immediately entitled to receive a
pension upon retirement. Thus, only 48 percent of the men and 24 percent of
the women were eligible to receive a pension if they left Federal employment
during 1977.

     3For workers with fewer than 10 years' previous service, the increase is
smaller. See note 1.

      kFive years of Federal service is required for vesting.

     5Among older Federal workers, a substantial fraction are not entitled to
annual merit pay increases.

of a discrete choice model was introduced into the econometrics literature
by McFadden (1974)
