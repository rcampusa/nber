The Impact of Therapeutic Procedure Innovation on Hospital Patient Longevity: Evidence

                                              ABSTRACT

We investigate the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation in general on the longevity of all hospital
patients, i.e. patients with a variety of medical conditions. The analysis is based on data on over one
million discharges from public and private hospitals in Western Australia (WA) during the period
2000-2007. We can measure survival for a period as long as 8 years after admission, and we know
the date each procedure was added to the Medicare Benefits Schedule.

Estimates based on patient-level data indicate that therapeutic procedure innovation increased the life
expectancy of WA hospital patients by almost 3 months between 2000 and 2007, controlling for the
patient’s age, sex, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG, over 600 categories), Aboriginal status, marital
status, insurance coverage (whether or not the patient had private insurance), postcode (over 400 postcodes),
year of hospital admission, and number of procedures performed.. Estimates based on longitudinal
DRG-level data also indicate that therapeutic procedure innovation increased the life expectancy of
WA hospital patients, but the implied increase may be smaller—about 2 months. In either case, therapeutic
procedure innovation in WA hospitals appears to have been remarkably cost-effective, because it increased
the cost of medical procedures by a negligible amount.

       A number of previous studies have examined the effects of specific medical innovations,
or innovations for specific medical conditions, on longevity and other patient outcomes. For
example, McGovern et al (1993) found that there were marked improvements in survival from
1970 to 1985 among hospitalized stroke patients in the Twin Cities; these improvements
occurred almost exclusively in the acute hospitalization phase, and improved medical care
probably contributed to gains in survival. Gockel et al (2008) argued that surgical therapy for
esophageal carcinoma has undergone distinct changes over the past 20 years, and that these
changes have led to a significantly more favorable long-term prognosis. Ravi (2007) found that
recent advances in the study and treatment of esophageal disorders allow for more accurate
diagnosis of known esophageal disorders and have introduced previously unexplored disorders.
Noble (2003) argued that “developments in neonatal technology continue to improve infant
outcomes.” Dobson (2003) found that “advances in medical technology account for a third of
the reduction in road traffic deaths,” and Dobson (2002) found that “murder rates would be up to
five times higher than they are but for medical developments over the past 40 years.” However,
Lameire et al (2009) found that, “overall, the major technological advances in dialysis have not
yet been translated into longer patient survival.”
       In this study, we will investigate the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation in general
on the longevity of all hospital patients, i.e. patients with a variety of medical conditions. The
analysis will be based on data on over one million discharges from public and private hospitals in
Western Australia (WA) during the period 2000-2007. The hospital discharge data, contained in
WA’s Hospital Morbidity Data Collection, are linked to WA Death Registration data up until
March 1, 2008, so we can measure survival for a period as long as 8 years after admission.
       Each hospital discharge record includes up to eleven procedure codes. Since 1 July 1999,
procedures have been coded using the International statistical classification of diseases and
related health problems, 10th revision, Australian modification (ICD-10-AM). An important
feature of ICD-10-AM was the addition of a classification of procedures based on the
                                                                                                                   2


Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) of fees for health services.1 The MBS is a
listing of the Medicare services subsidized by the Australian government.2 New procedures are
added to the MBS each year. In order to be included in the MBS, new medical technologies and
procedures must be assessed by the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC,
http://www.msac.gov.au/), an independent scientific committee comprising individuals with
expertise in clinical medicine, health economics and consumer matters. The MSAC undertakes a
rigorous and transparent assessment of new medical technologies in consultation with the
applicant, and advises the Minister for Health and Ageing on whether new medical services
should be publicly funded based on an assessment of their safety, effectiveness and cost
effectiveness, using the best available evidence.
         Each procedure in the MBS has a “start date,” i.e. the date the procedure was added to the
MBS. As of 1 November 2010, the MBS included 5756 items (procedures). As shown in Figure
1, 40% of the items included in the 1 November 2010 MBS were added by the end of 1992, 59%
were added by the end of 1999, and 79% were added by the end of 2004. Henceforth I will refer
to the year in which a procedure was introduced into the MBS as the vintage of the procedure.3
         Innovation may be defined as “the introduction of a new idea, method or device.”4 Our
measures of innovation will be based on the mean vintage of the procedures used to treat a
patient or group of patients.
         We will investigate the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation5 on hospital patient

  It was a deliberate decision of the Casemix Implementation Project Board in 1995 to create this Australian
procedure classification based on the fee schedule so that the classification of procedures in the public and private
sectors, as well as in ambulatory situations, would be more consistent. The Australian procedure classification,
known as the Medicare Benefits Schedule, Extended (MBS-E), is more specific than MBS, and is organised
logically according to body system and site and includes a detailed index. Codes have been added for procedures not
currently eligible for benefits, such as cosmetic surgery, obstetrics and allied health procedures. See Roberts et al
(1998).

  The Schedule is part of the wider Medicare Benefits Scheme managed by the Department of Health and Ageing
and administered by Medicare Australia.

  According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, one definition of vintage is “a period of origin or manufacture (e.g.
a piano of 1845 vintage)”. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vintage

  This is a synthesis of the two definitions of innovation provided by the Merriam Webster dictionary: “(1) the
introduction of something new, and (2) a new idea, method, or device.” http://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/innovation

  About 90% of the procedures (and procedure fees) included in WA’s Hospital Morbidity Data Collection are
accounted for by therapeutic (category 3) procedures. Most of the remaining procedures are diagnostic imaging
(category 5) procedures.
                                                                                                               3


longevity in two different ways. First, we will investigate the effect of therapeutic procedure
vintage on patient survival using cross-sectional patient-level data. We will control, in a very
unrestrictive manner, for the patient’s age, sex, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG, over 600
categories), Aboriginal status, marital status, insurance coverage (whether or not the patient has
private insurance), postcode (over 400 postcodes), year of hospital admission, and number of
procedures performed.
        These variables should control, to a very great extent, for the patient’s underlying health
status and mortality risk prior to treatment.6 Nevertheless, there may be unobserved
heterogeneity of patients with respect to mortality risk, which could bias our estimates of the
effect of therapeutic procedure vintage on patient survival. However, both our own data and
evidence from other studies suggest that the sickest patients tend to receive the newest
treatments. A regression of mean procedure vintage on all of the variables listed above indicates
that (1) mean vintage is positively correlated with the number of procedures performed; (2)
procedures used on uninsured patients are newer than those used on insured patients; and (3)
procedures used on men are newer than those used on women. Also, Hoover et al (2002)
showed that mean annual medical expenditure on persons aged 65 and older were over five
times as high during the last year of life as they were during nonterminal years. It is plausible
that part of this expenditure differential is due to the use of newer, as well as more, procedures
during the last year of life. If the sickest patients tend to receive the newest treatments, our
estimates of the effect of therapeutic procedure vintage on patient survival are likely to be
conservative if we don’t adequately control for severity of illness.
        We believe that heterogeneous treatment of patients, controlling for their diagnoses,
demographic characteristics, insurance coverage, and other factors, is primarily due to physician
practice variation. Wennberg (2004) argues that “unwarranted [treatment] variation—variation
not explained by illness, patient preference, or the dictates of evidence-based medicine—is a
ubiquitous feature of U.S. health care.” This may also apply to Australia. A large number of
studies have documented the importance of unexplained variation in medical care. Lee et al
(2008) showed that “pediatric and adult transplant physicians differed significantly in their
management strategies for chronic myeloid leukemia, acute and chronic graft-versus-host


6
 For example, old men from poor regions receiving large number of procedures face higher mortality risk than
young women from wealthy regions receiving fewer procedures.
                                                                                                                       4


disease, and choice of graft source for patients with aplastic anemia. Among adult transplant
physicians, there was little agreement on the patient factors favoring reduced intensity
conditioning or myeloablative conditioning.” DeSalvo et al (2000) reported “wide variation…in
assignment of reappointment interval with mean return intervals…ranging from 2.2 to 20.5
weeks. Sex was a significant provider independent variable…Female providers assigned earlier
reappointment intervals for their patients.” Solomon et al (2003) found that “established risk
factors for NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxicity were poor predictors of who was
prescribed a selective COX-2 inhibitor; in contrast, physician prescribing preference was an
important determinant.” De Las Cuevas et al (2002) showed that “there is a remarkable degree
of variation in antidepressant prescribing by psychiatrists and general practitioners; this is due to
economic and social factors as much as to morbidity differences.” Rochon et al (2007) found
that “residents in facilities with high antipsychotic prescribing rates were about 3 times more
likely than those in facilities with low prescribing rates to be dispensed an antipsychotic agent,
irrespective of their clinical indication.”7
         We will also investigate the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation on patient survival
using longitudinal DRG-level data. This approach enables us to determine whether DRGs that
exhibited more procedure innovation (larger increases in procedure vintage) had greater
increases in patient survival, ceteris paribus. Estimates based on longitudinal DRG-level data are
less subject to bias from unobserved patient heterogeneity than estimates based on cross-
sectional patient-level data. Comparison of the two kinds of estimates can help us to assess the
direction of bias, if any.
         Section 2 describes the econometric models of patient survival we will estimate.
Descriptive statistics are presented in Section 3. Empirical results are presented in Section 4.
The cost-effectiveness of therapeutic procedure innovation is assessed in Section 5. Section 6
provides a summary.

  Using clinical and administrative data obtained from all facilities in a Department of Veterans Affairs integrated
service network, Krein et al (2002) showed that there was variation in diabetes practice patterns at the primary care
provider, provider group, and facility levels, and that the greatest amount of variance tended to be attributable to the
facility level.
                                                                                                                   5


2, Econometric models of patient survival


A. Econometric models of patient survival based on cross-sectional patient-level data


Dependent variables. We will estimate two types of models of patient survival using cross-
sectional patient-level data. In the first type, the dependent variable is a binary variable
indicating whether or not the patient survived a specified length of time, i.e. whether the patient
was discharged alive (which we refer to as “0 years”), and whether the patient was alive 1, 2, 3,
4, and 5 years after admission to the hospital.8 These models will be of the form:

          survni=  vintagei +  Zi + i                                         (1)

where

               survni = 1 if patient i survived n years (n = 0, 1, …, 5)
                      = 0 otherwise
             vintagei = the vintage of therapeutic procedures performed on patient i
                   Zi = a vector of other attributes of patients i
                   i = a disturbance


Since the dependent variable is a binary variable, we will estimate these models as probit
models.
          In the second type of model, the dependent variable is the number of years the patient
lived after being admitted to the hospital. These models will be of the form:
          years_livedi=  vintagei +  Zi + i                                   (2)

where

    years_livedi = the number of years patient i lived after being admitted to the hospital


          If the patient did not die by 1 March 2008 (the Death Registration cut-off date), this
variable is right censored. I will account for this by using a statistical procedure (the SAS
LIFEREG procedure) that fits parametric models to failure time data that can be uncensored,

8
 Because the coverage of the WA Death Registration data ends on March 1, 2008, 1-year survival can be measured
for patients hospitalized during 2000-2006, but 5-year survival can be measured only for patients hospitalized during
2000-2002.
                                                                                                                         6


right censored, left censored, or interval censored. To reduce the degree of censoring, I will
analyze people who were hospitalized during 2000-2004. I will assume that the number of years
the patient lived after being admitted to the hospital (or the number of years till death) has the
Weibull distribution, one of the most commonly used distributions in failure time analysis. The
probability density function of a Weibull random variable X is:




where k > 0 is the shape parameter and λ > 0 is the scale parameter of the distribution.9 The
mean of a Weibull random variable can be expressed as λ (1+(1/k)) where (z) is the Gamma
function:10




         We assume that the scale parameter λ depends on patient characteristics X as follows: λ =
exp( X). Hence ln  =  X, and ln(mean survival time) =  X + ln((1+(1/k))). Therefore the
estimated coefficient on a patient characteristic X1 indicates the percentage change in mean
survival time attributable to a unit increase in X1.
Explanatory variables. The explanatory variable of primary interest is the mean vintage of
procedures used to treat the patient. One potential measure of procedure vintage is the mean
year in which the procedures performed on a patient commenced in the MBS:
proc_yeari = p itempi item_start_yearp
                       p itempi
where

itempi = 1 if patient i was treated with procedure p
       = 0 if patient i was not treated with procedure p


9
  The shape parameter is what gives the Weibull distribution its flexibility. By changing the value of the shape
parameter, the Weibull distribution can model a wide variety of data. If k = 1, the Weibull distribution is identical to
the exponential distribution; if k = 2, the Weibull distribution is identical to the Rayleigh distribution; if k is between
3 and 4 the Weibull distribution approximates the normal distribution. The Weibull distribution approximates the
lognormal distribution for several values of k.
10
   See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution and http://www.engineeredsoftware.com/nasa/weibull.htm.
                                                                                                     7


item_start_yearp = the year procedure p commenced in the MBS


However, as shown in Figure 1, item_start_year is, in effect, a “left-censored” variable: no items
commenced before 1987, and a third of all items commenced in a single year (1991). Therefore,
the following may be a better measure of vintage:

proc_post1995%i = p itempi item_post1995p
                         p itempi
where

item_post1995p = 1 if the year procedure p commenced in the MBS > 1995
               = 0 if the year procedure p commenced in the MBS < 1995


Hence proc_post1995%i is the fraction of procedures used to treat patient i that were “new”
procedures, where a procedure is considered “new” if it commenced in the MBS after 1995
(approximately the median commencement year of items included in the MBS as of 1 November
2010).
         In addition to procedure vintage, all of the models of patient survival we estimate using
cross-sectional patient-level data will also include the following explanatory variables: dummy
variables for the patient’s (single year of) age, sex, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG, over 600
categories), Aboriginal status, marital status, insurance coverage (whether or not the patient has
private insurance), postcode (over 400 postcodes), year of hospital admission, and number of
procedures performed (1-11).


B. Econometric models of patient survival based on longitudinal DRG-level data


         To determine whether DRGs that exhibited more procedure innovation (larger increases
in procedure vintage) had greater increases in patient survival, ceteris paribus, we will use
longitudinal DRG-level data to estimate models of the following form:

         ln(surv%ndt/(1- surv%ndt)) =  proc_post1995%dt +  Zdt + d + t + dt     (3)

where

           surv%0dt = the fraction of patients discharged in year t in DRG d who were
                                                                                                               8


                        discharged alive (“survived 0 years”)
           surv%ndt     = the fraction of patients discharged in year t in DRG d who
                        survived n years (n = 1, 2,…,5)
proc_post1995%dt        = the fraction of procedures performed in year t in DRG d that were
                        “new” procedures
                  Zdt   = a vector of other attributes11 of patients discharged in year t in
                        DRG d
                  d    = a fixed effect for DRG d
                   t   = a fixed effect for year t
                  dt   = a disturbance


Eq. (3) will be estimated via weighted least-squares, where the weight is the number of patients
discharged in year t in DRG d (Ndt). We will allow for clustering of disturbances within DRGs.

3. Descriptive statistics

        Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. The number of discharges ranged between
113 and 138 thousand per year. The mean age of patients was about 64 years. The average
values of the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 75.4%, 57.9%, and 48.7%,
respectively. Not surprisingly, these are far below the corresponding survival rates of the general
population of Western Australia. For example, according to the life table for Western Australia
for the years 2001-2003, the 5-year survival rates of 64-year-old men and women in the general
population were 93% and 96%, respectively. What is perhaps more surprising is that survival
rates of WA hospital patients declined during this period.12 For example, the 3-year survival rate
declined from 59.8% in 2000 to 55.9% in 2004. This may be attributable to an increase in the
average severity of illness of patients admitted to hospitals. Patients with low illness severity
may have been increasingly treated in an outpatient setting.
        The average number of therapeutic procedures per patient remained constant (at about
1.00) from 2000 to 2003, but declined 27% between 2003 and 2007. This is entirely due to the
fact that, for unknown reasons, the fraction of patients who had no therapeutic procedures
increased from one-fourth during 2000-2003 to one half in 2007.13


11
   The other attributes are mean age, mean number of procedures performed, and fraction of patients with private
insurance.
12
   Survival rates of the WA general population increased during this period.
13
   Among patients who had any therapeutic procedures, the mean number of procedures increased from 1.31 in 2003
to 1.46 in 2007.
                                                                                                  9


       WA’s Hospital Morbidity Data Collection does not contain any cost information, but we
can compute the cost of each patient’s therapeutic procedures (in 2010 dollars) by using the
schedule fees contained in the 1 November 2010 MBS. Due to the decline in the average
number of therapeutic procedures per patient, therapeutic procedure schedule fees per patient
declined. But therapeutic procedure schedule fees per procedure increased from $268 in 2003 to
$336 in 2007.
       Both measures of procedure vintage increased during the sample period. The fraction of
therapeutic procedures with an item start year greater than 1995 increased from 8.2% in 2000 to
14.6% in 2007.


4. Empirical results

       First we will present estimates of eq. (1). To conserve space, we will provide complete
estimates of just one model, and estimates of the key parameter of interest (, the procedure
vintage coefficient) from 12 models. Table 2 provides estimates of the model of the 2-year
survival rate in which vintage is defined as proc_post1995% (the fraction of procedures that
commenced in the MBS after 1995). The estimates in this table indicate that the probability of
being alive two years after admission was significantly higher for women and for people with
private insurance, and inversely related to age and to the number of procedures performed on the
patient, controlling for the patient’s DRG, postcode, year of admission, marital status, and
aboriginal status. The estimates also indicate that patients receiving newer procedures were
significantly more likely to be alive two years after admission to the hospital.
       Table 3 presents estimates of from 12 different models: 6 survival intervals (0-5 years),
and two alternative measures of therapeutic procedure vintage (proc_year and proc_post1995%).
In model 1, the dependent variable is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the patient was alive when
discharged from the hospital, and the regressor is the mean year in which the procedures
performed on the patient commenced in the MBS. The estimate of  is positive and significant,
indicating that patients treated with newer procedures were more likely to be discharged alive.
In models 2-6, the dependent variables are dummy variables indicating survival 1-5 years after
admission to the hospital, and the same measure of procedure vintage is used. The estimates of 
in all of these models are positive and significant. Models 7-12 are similar to models 1-6, but the
                                                                                                   10


measure of procedure vintage is the fraction of procedures used to treat a patient that commenced
in the MBS after 1995. The estimate of  is not significant in model 7, but it is positive and
highly significant (p-value < 0.0001) in models 8-12.
       As shown in Table 1, between 2000 and 2007, the fraction of therapeutic procedures that
were “new” (commenced in the MBS after 1995) increased by .064, from 8.2% to 14.6%. We
can use the estimates of  in models 7 to 12 to assess how much therapeutic procedure
innovation increased survival rates. Let SURV_RATE denote the mean survival rate during the
period, and F-1( ) denotes the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution. Then S0 =
F [F-1(SURV_RATE) –  (.064 / 2)] is the “predicted” survival rate if proc_post1995% had
increased by .032 less than the actual increase; S1 = F [F-1(SURV_RATE) +  (.064 / 2)] is the
“predicted” survival rate if proc_post1995% had increased by .032 more than the actual increase;
and S1 – S0 is the change in the survival rate attributable to therapeutic procedure innovation.
The results of these calculations are shown in the following table.

Model 8 implies that, ceteris paribus, therapeutic procedure innovation during the period 2000-
2007 increased the 1-year survival rate by .008, from 75.0% to 75.8%, and that it increased the 2-
year survival rate by .010, from 64.2% to 65.2%. As noted above, survival rates of WA hospital
patients declined during this period; our estimates indicate how much more they would have
declined in the absence of therapeutic procedure innovation.
       Now we will discuss estimates of eq. (2), in which the (right-censored) dependent
variable is the number of years the patient lived after being admitted to the hospital. This
equation was estimated using data on 448,829 hospital discharges during the period 2000-2004.
About half of these observations were right-censored, i.e. the patient did not die before 1 March
2008. The estimate of the Weibull shape parameter was significantly less than one (0.882,
                                                                                                                      11


standard error = 0.0016), which indicates that the mortality rate decreases over time. This is not
surprising, since the figures in Table 1 indicate that the probability of surviving 2 years,
conditional on surviving one year (85.8% = 64.7% / 75.4%) is higher than the (unconditional)
probability of surviving one year (75.4%).
         When eq. (2) is estimated using proc_post1995% as the vintage measure, the coefficient
on this variable is positive and highly significant:
 Estimate StdErr ChiSq   ProbChiSq
    0.383   0.019  399.5     0.0000


This indicates that the mean time till death of a patient treated with only old procedures was 32%
(= exp(-0.383)) lower than the mean time till death of a patient treated with only new procedures,
controlling for all of the covariates. The estimate also implies that the 2000-2007 increase in
proc_post1995% increased the life expectancy of WA hospital patients by 2.4% (= 0.383 *
.064). The absolute increase (in months) in life expectancy of WA hospital patients attributable
to therapeutic procedure innovation is equal to the percentage increase (2.4%) times the mean
life expectancy. We calculated mean life expectancy by estimating eq. (2) without any
explanatory variables (only an intercept); in that model, mean life expectancy = λ (1+(1/k)).
This implied that the mean life expectancy of WA hospital patients (whose mean age was 64.4)
was 9.61 years.14 Hence we estimate that, between 2000 and 2007, therapeutic procedure
innovation increased the life expectancy of WA hospital patients by almost 3 months (0.234
years = 2.4% * 9.61 years). Between 2002 and 2008, the life expectancy at age 64 of the overall
WA population increased by 0.9 years.15 The annual rate of increase in the life expectancy of
WA hospital patients attributable to therapeutic procedure innovation is about 22% as large as
the annual rate of increase of life expectancy at age 64 of the overall WA population.
         Now we will present estimates of models of patient survival based on longitudinal DRG-
level data. Estimates of the coefficient  in eq. (3) are shown in Table 4. Each estimate is from
a different model. All models include mean age, mean number of procedures performed, the
fraction of patients with private insurance, DRG fixed effects, and year fixed effects. Models

14
   Mean life expectancy at age 64 of the overall WA population was 18.6 years for men and 22.1 years for women
during 2001-2003.
15
   Due to right censoring of the survival data, during this period the change in the life expectancy of WA hospital
patients can’t be reliably estimated.
                                                                                                                12


were estimated via weighted least-squares, where the weight is the number of patients discharged
in year t in DRG d (Ndt). Estimates allow for clustering of disturbances within DRGs. In models
13-18, the vintage measure is proc_year (the mean year in which the procedures performed
commenced in the MBS). The estimate of  is positive and significant (p-value < .05) in models
13-16, indicating that DRGs with higher rates of therapeutic procedure innovation had larger
increases in the odds of surviving until discharge and until 1, 2, and 3 years after admission.16 In
models 19-24, the other (we believe more reliable) vintage measure—proc_post1995% (the
fraction of procedures that commenced in the MBS after 1995) —is used. The estimate of  is
positive and significant (p-value < .05) in models 19-23, except in model 20 (1-year survival
rate), where it is marginally significant (p-value = .0767).
        Once again, we can use the estimates of  in models 19 to 23 to assess how much
therapeutic procedure innovation increased survival rates. In this case, we define S0 =
1/(1+(1/exp [ln(SURV/(1- SURV)) –  (.064 / 2)])) as the “predicted” survival rate if
proc_post1995% had increased by .032 less than the actual increase; S1 = 1/(1+(1/exp
[ln(SURV/(1- SURV)) +  (.064 / 2)])) as the “predicted” survival rate if proc_post1995% had
increased by .032 more than the actual increase; and S1 – S0 as the change in the survival rate
attributable to therapeutic procedure innovation. These calculations, and a comparison of them
with the corresponding calculations based on patient-level data, are shown below.
                                                 patient level                       DRG level
 survival interval                        S0         S1        S1 - S0        S0        S1         S1 - S0
 alive at time of discharge             97.8%      97.8%       0.0%         97.8%     97.9%        0.2%
 alive 1 year after admission           75.0%      75.8%       0.8%         75.2%     75.6%        0.4%
 alive 2 years after admission          64.2%      65.2%       1.0%         64.3%     65.0%        0.7%
 alive 3 years after admission          57.5%      58.4%       0.8%         57.6%     58.3%        0.8%

 alive 5 years after admission          48.5%      49.0%       0.5%


In three cases, the estimate of the increase in the survival rate attributable to therapeutic
procedure innovation based on longitudinal DRG-level data is smaller than the estimate based on
patient-level data. In one case (the three-year survival rate), the two estimates are the same, and



16
  As shown in Table 1, the 4-year survival rate can only be measured during 2000-2003, and the 5-year survival rate
can only be measured during 2000-2002.
                                                                                                       13


in one case (survival until discharge), the estimate based on longitudinal DRG-level data is
larger.

          Estimates of the survival-time model (eq. (2)), which was based on patient-level data,
indicated that, between 2000 and 2007, therapeutic procedure innovation increased the life
expectancy of WA hospital patients by almost 3 months. The estimate of the increase in the 2-
year survival rate attributable to therapeutic procedure innovation based on longitudinal DRG-
level data is 30% smaller than the corresponding estimate based on patient-level data, so
therapeutic procedure innovation may have increased the life expectancy of WA hospital patients
by a smaller amount: about 2 months.

5. Cost-effectiveness of therapeutic procedure innovation

          In addition to estimating the longevity benefit of therapeutic procedure innovation, it is
worthwhile to estimate the cost of this innovation, and the ratio of the two: the incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio (ICER).

ICER =  PROC_COST =  PROC_COST /  PROC_POST1995%
            LE            LE /  PROC_POST1995%


where PROC_COST denotes the cost of therapeutic procedures and LE denotes life expectancy.
We estimate the cost of each patient’s therapeutic procedures (in 2010 dollars) by using the
schedule fees contained in the 1 November 2010 MBS:

PROC_COSTi = p itempi schedule_feep

where

itempi = 1 if patient i was treated with procedure p
       = 0 if patient i was not treated with procedure p

schedule_feep = the fee for procedure p in the 1 November 2010 MBS


To estimate the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation on cost, we can estimate an equation
similar to eq. (1), in which the dependent variable is the (log of) the patient’s procedure cost:
                                                                                                  14


       ln(PROC_COSTi) =  PROC_POST1995%i +  Zi + i                                (4)

The estimate of  in eq. (4) is 0.426 (t-value = 112.6). The cost of procedures performed on
patients receiving new procedures is higher than the cost of procedures performed on patients
receiving old procedures. However, the percentage increase in procedure cost attributable to the
2000-2007 increase in PROC_POST1995% is quite small: 2.7% (= 0.426 * 6.4%). Among
people who had positive procedure cost, mean procedure cost per hospital discharge during
2000-2004 was $367. Therefore, therapeutic procedure innovation is estimated to have increased
mean procedure cost by only $10 (= 2.7% * $367).
       Therapeutic procedure innovation in WA hospitals during the period 2000-2007 appears
to have been remarkably cost-effective: it increased the life expectancy of patients by 2-3
months, and increased medical expenditure by a negligible amount. This may be due in part to
the fact that decisions about whether new medical services are publicly funded are based on an
assessment of their safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness, using the best available evidence.


6. Summary

       A number of previous studies have examined the effects of specific medical innovations,
or innovations for specific medical conditions, on longevity and other patient outcomes. In this
study, we investigated the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation in general on the longevity
of all hospital patients, i.e. patients with a variety of medical conditions. The analysis was based
on data on over one million discharges from public and private hospitals in Western Australia
(WA) during the period 2000-2007. The hospital discharge data, contained in WA’s Hospital
Morbidity Data Collection, are linked to WA Death Registration data up until March 1, 2008, so
we could measure survival for a period as long as 8 years after admission. Measurement of
procedure innovation was facilitated by the fact that hospital procedures are coded using the
Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), and we know the date each procedure was
added to the MBS.
       We investigated the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation on hospital patient
longevity in two different ways. First, we investigated the effect of therapeutic procedure
innovation on patient survival using cross-sectional patient-level data. We controlled, in a very
unrestrictive manner, for the patient’s age, sex, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG, over 600
                                                                                                 15


categories), Aboriginal status, marital status, insurance coverage (whether or not the patient had
private insurance), postcode (over 400 postcodes), year of hospital admission, and number of
procedures performed. We also investigated the effect of therapeutic procedure innovation on
patient survival using longitudinal DRG-level data. This approach enabled us to determine
whether DRGs that exhibited more procedure innovation had greater increases in patient
survival, ceteris paribus.
       Estimates based on patient-level data indicated that therapeutic procedure innovation
increased the life expectancy of WA hospital patients (whose mean life expectancy was about 10
years) by almost 3 months between 2000 and 2007. (Between 2002 and 2008, the life
expectancy of the overall WA population of the same mean age (64) increased by about 11
months.) Estimates based on longitudinal DRG-level data also indicated that therapeutic
procedure innovation increased the life expectancy of WA hospital patients, but the implied
increase may be smaller—about 2 months. In either case, therapeutic procedure innovation in
WA hospitals appears to have been remarkably cost-effective, because it increased the cost of
medical procedures by a negligible amount.

Note: The estimates reported are estimates of the coefficient  in eq. (1): survni=  vintagei +  Zi + i.
Each estimate is from a different probit model. All models include dummy variables for the patient’s
age, sex, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG, over 600 categories), Aboriginal status, marital status,
insurance coverage (whether or not the patient has private insurance), postcode (over 400 postcodes),
year of hospital admission, and number of procedures performed.

mean age, mean number of procedures performed, the fraction of patients with private insurance, DRG
fixed effects, and year fixed effects. Models were estimated via weighted least-squares, where the
weight is the number of patients discharged in year t in DRG d (Ndt). Estimates allow for clustering of
disturbances within DRGs.
