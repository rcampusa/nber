Are Americans Saving “Optimally” for Retirement?

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the degree to which Americans are saving optimally for retirement. Our

standard for assessing optimality comes from a life-cycle model that incorporates uncertain

lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers,

and pension and social security benefit functions derived from rich household data. We solve every

household’’s decision problem from death to starting age and then use the decision rules in

conjunction with earnings histories to make predictions about wealth in 1992. Ours is the first study

to compare, household by household, wealth predictions that arise from a life-cycle model that

incorporates earnings histories for a nationally representative sample. The results, based on data

from the Health and Retirement Study, are striking – we find that the model is capable of accounting

for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of

households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are

undersaving is generally small.

     There is considerable skepticism in public policy discussions and in the financial press that

Americans are preparing adequately for retirement. A quotation from the Wall Street Journal

captures a popular view:

     A long time ago, New England was known for its thrifty Yankees. But that was before the
     baby boomers came along. These days, many New Englanders in their 30s and 40s, and
     indeed their counterparts all over America, have a different style: they are spending heavily
     and have sunk knee-deep in debt. ... A recent study sponsored by Merrill Lynch & Co.
     showed that the average middle-aged American had about $2,600 in net financial assets.
     Another survey by the financial-services giant showed that boomers earning $100,000 will
     need $653,000 in today’s dollars by age 65 to retire in comfort – but were saving only 31
     percent of the amount needed. In other words, the saving rate will have to triple. Experts
     say the failure to build a nest egg will come to haunt the baby boomers, forcing them to
     drastically lower standards of living in their later years or to work for longer, perhaps into
     their 70s.1

     Assessing the adequacy or optimality of wealth accumulation is difficult, since it requires

some standard against which to measure observed behavior. Several authors use augmented life-

cycle models for this standard, simulating the expected distribution of wealth for representative

household types (see, for example, Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes, 1995; and Engen, Gale, and

Uccello, 1999).2 While augmented life-cycle models provide natural benchmarks, these

researchers do not fully assess the adequacy (let alone the optimality) of wealth accumulation.

They derive optimal distributions of wealth (or wealth-income ratios). But given underlying

Nearly Rapidly Enough for an Easy Retirement,” Bernard Wysocki Jr., 6/5/95, A1 Wall Street Journal. Wolff
(2002) concludes “retirement wealth accumulation needs to be improved for the vast majority of households.”

  Kotlikoff, Spivak, and Summers (1982); Moore and Mitchell (1998); and Gustman and Steinmeier (1999) examine
saving adequacy by comparing data to financial planning rules of thumb. But a rule of thumb cannot describe
optimal behavior for households with widely different patterns of earnings realizations, even if preferences are
homogeneous. Hamermesh (1984); Banks, Blundell, and Tanner (1998); and Bernheim, Skinner, and Weinberg
(2001) make inferences about adequacy from consumption changes around retirement. But, for the reasons given in
Aguiar and Hurst (2003) and Hurd and Rohwedder (2003), it is difficult to make inferences about adequacy or
optimality from patterns of consumption changes around retirement.

model parameters, expectations, and earnings realizations, the models have household-specific

implications for optimal wealth accumulation. These household-specific implications have not

been studied.

    We examine the degree to which households are optimally preparing for retirement by

constructing a stochastic life-cycle model that captures the key features of a household’s

consumption decisions. Our model incorporates many behavioral features shown by prior work

to affect consumption, including precautionary savings and buffer stock behavior (Deaton, 1991;

Aiyagari, 1994; Carroll, 1997). It incorporates asset-tested public transfers (Hubbard, Skinner,

and Zeldes, 1995), where benefits vary over time and by household size. Our model incorporates

end-of-life uncertainty and medical shocks (Palumbo, 1999). We also incorporate a stylized,

time-varying progressive income tax that reflects the evolution of average effective federal

income tax rates over the period spanned by our data. Households in the model form realistic

expectations about social security, which depends on lifetime income; pension benefits, which

depend on income in the final year of work; and earnings. We incorporate detailed data from the

Health and Retirement Study (HRS) on family structure and age of retirement (treating both as

exogenous and known from the beginning of working life) in calculating optimal life-cycle

consumption profiles.

    Our approach has other distinctive features. Most important, we calculate household-

specific optimal wealth targets, using data from the HRS. A crucial input to our behavioral

model is 41 years of information on earnings realizations drawn from restricted-access social

security earnings records. The timing of earnings shocks can cause optimal wealth to vary

substantially, even for households with identical preferences, demographic characteristics, and


                                                2
lifetime income. Hence, it is essential for life-cycle models of wealth accumulation to

incorporate earnings realizations, at least to the extent model implications are compared to actual

behavior.

     We find that over 80 percent of HRS households have accumulated more wealth than their

optimal targets. These targets indicate the amounts of private saving households need to solve

their life-cycle planning problem, given social security and defined benefit pension expectations

and realizations. For those not meeting their targets, the magnitudes of the deficits are typically

small. In addition, the cross-sectional distribution of wealth in 1992 closely matches the

predictions of our life-cycle model.

I.   The Health and Retirement Study

     The HRS is a national panel study with an initial sample (in 1992) of 12,652 persons and

7,702 households.3 It oversamples blacks, Hispanics, and residents of Florida. The baseline

1992 study consisted of in-home, face-to-face interviews of the 1931-1941 birth cohort and their

spouses, if they are married. Follow-up interviews were given by telephone in 1994, 1996, 1998,

2000, and 2002. For the analyses in this paper we exclude 379 married households where one

spouse did not participate in the 1992 HRS, 93 households that failed to have at least one year of

full-time work, and 908 households where the highest earner began working full time prior to

1951.4 Our resulting sample has 6,322 households.




3
  An overview of the HRS is given in a Supplementary issue of the Journal of Human Resources, 1995 (volume 30).
There, 22 authors discuss and assess the data quality of many dimensions of the initial wave of the HRS.
4
  We drop the first group because we do not have information on spousal, and hence household, income. We drop
the second group because we do not have information on transfer payments in years prior to the HRS survey and
therefore we cannot model the lifetime budget constraint. We drop households where the highest earner started
working before 1951 for computational reasons. Our procedures to impute missing and top-coded data are
considerably more complicated when initial values of the earnings process are missing. Details for the earnings
imputations are given in Appendix I.
                                                       3
     The survey covers a wide range of topics, including batteries of questions on health and

cognitive conditions; retirement plans; subjective assessments of mortality probabilities and the

quality of retirement preparation; family structure; employment status and job history;

demographic characteristics; housing; income and net worth; and pension details.

Wealth Measures in the HRS

     Households typically maintain living standards in retirement by drawing on their own

(private) saving, employer-provided pensions, and social security wealth. To study the degree to

which households optimally accumulate wealth, therefore, we need accurate measures of these

wealth components.

     Net worth (private saving) is a comprehensive measure that includes housing assets less

liabilities, business assets less liabilities, checking and saving accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual

funds, retirement accounts including defined contribution pensions, certificates of deposit, the

cash value of whole life insurance, and other assets, less credit card debt and other liabilities. It

excludes defined benefit pension wealth, social security wealth, and future earnings.5 The

concept of wealth is similar (and in many cases identical) to those used in other studies of wealth

and saving adequacy.

     We use the “Pension Present Value Database” that Bob Peticolas and Tom Steinmeier

kindly made available on the HRS World Wide Web Site to calculate the value of defined benefit

pensions and, as described below, estimate the household’s expectations of future pension



5
 We account rigorously for defined benefit pensions, social security, and future earnings in the household decision
problem. We do not model the purchase and service flows that result from consumer durables since we do not have
data on durables. We do not include term life policies in net worth because we do not have information on premium
payments and, more importantly, a comparison of data from the HRS and Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest
Old suggests that a substantial fraction of term life policies are dropped in retirement. Those that are not dropped
have a median value of less than $7,000.

benefits.6 The program makes present value calculations of HRS pensions for wave 1 (1992)

respondents for nine different scenarios, corresponding to the Social Security Administration’s

low, intermediate and high long-term projections for interest rates, wage growth rates, and

inflation rates. We use the intermediate values when calculating DB pension wealth.7

HRS Earnings Data

     Restricted access social security earnings data provide a direct measure of earnings

realizations and lifetime income, and, as described below, they are used to estimate household’s

expectations of future earnings. They also allow us to simulate accurately social security

benefits for the respondent and spouse or for the couple, if the benefit would be higher.8

     Two issues arise in using earnings information. First, social security earnings records are

not available for 22.8 percent of the respondents included in the analysis (we have 10,523

respondents in 6,322 households). Second, the social security earnings records are top-coded

(households earn more than the social security taxable wage caps) for 16 percent of earnings

observations between 1951 and 1979. Beginning in 1980, censoring is not an issue, because we

have access to uncensored W-2 earnings records from 1980-1991.

     We impute earnings histories for those individuals with missing or top-coded earnings

records assuming the individual log-earnings process

6
  See http://www.umich.edu/~hrswww/center/rescont2.html. The programs use detailed plan descriptions along with
information on employee earnings. We use self-reported defined-benefit pension information for households not
included in the Peticolas and Steinmeier file. The assumptions used in the program to calculate the value of defined
contribution (DC) pensions – particularly the assumption that contributions were a constant fraction of income
during years worked with a given employer – are likely inappropriate. Consequently, we follow others in the
literature (for example, Engen et al., 1999, p. 159) and use self-reported information to calculate DC pension wealth.

  The intermediate Social Security Administration assumptions are 6.3 percent for interest rates, 5 percent for wage
growth, and 4 percent for inflation.

where yi*,t is the log of observed earnings of the individual i at time t in 1992 dollars, xi,t is the

vector of i's characteristics at time t, and the error term εi,t includes an individual-specific

component α i , which is constant over time, and an unanticipated white noise component, ui,t .

We employ random-effect assumptions with homoskedastic errors to estimate equation (1).

     We estimate the model separately for four groups: men without a college education, men

with some college, women without a college education, and women with some college. Details

of the empirical earnings model and coefficient estimates are given in Appendix I. In Appendix

I we also describe how we use the model of individual earnings and a Gibbs sampling procedure

to impute earnings for individuals who refuse to release their social security earnings histories to

the HRS,9 and for earnings in years when social security earnings records are top-coded. The

Gibbs procedure is conceptually appealing as it allows us to use information from the entire

sequence of individual earnings to impute missing and top-coded earnings.

     Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the HRS sample. Mean (median) earnings in 1991

of HRS households are $35,263 ($28,298), though note that 13 percent are not in the paid labor

force when interviewed in 1992. The mean (median) present discounted value of lifetime

household earnings is $1,691,104 ($1,516,931).10 Retirement consumption will be financed out

  We repeated our central empirical analyses dropping individuals who refused to release their social security
records and generated nearly identical results to those reported in the paper. Brief details are given in the sensitivity
analysis, section 4.6.
10
   When calculating present discounted values of earnings, social security or defined benefit pension wealth, we
discount the constant-dollar sum of earnings (social security, or pensions) by a real interest rate measure (prior to
1992, we use the difference between the CPI-W and the 3-month Treasury bill rate; for 1992 and after we use 4
percent).
                                                                6
of pension wealth (mean is $105,919, median is $17,371); social security wealth (mean is

$106,714, median is $97,150); and nonpension net worth (mean is $250,513, median is

$107,000).

    Our empirical procedures result in social security replacement rates that are somewhat lower

than those discussed in Engen et al. (1999). The replacement rate is defined as equaling annual

social security benefits divided by the average of the final five years of earned income (prior to

retirement), multiplied by 100. The median for our sample of married couples is 38.4 percent.

Those with less than a high school diploma have a median of 43.7 percent. Those with a high

school diploma or some college have a median rate of 39.3 percent. College graduates have a

median rate of 31.6 percent, while those with more than a college degree have a median rate of

29.8 percent. Engen et al. cite figures from Grad (1990) who reports that an average

replacement rate for couples was roughly 55 percent in 1982, but social security has become less

generous since then. Because we use social security earnings records and a close approximation

to the social security benefit rules, our measure compared to those in Grad (1990) shows how

replacement rates have changed over time.

    Figure 1, which shows the median levels of defined benefit pension wealth, social security

wealth, and net worth (excluding DB pensions) in each lifetime income decile, highlights the

reason we account rigorously for social security in our model. Social security exceeds the

combined value of pension and nonpension net worth in the bottom three deciles of the lifetime

income distribution. Private net worth significantly exceeds the value of social security only in

the top two deciles of the lifetime income distribution. The metaphor of the “three-legged stool,”

in which retirement income security is supported by the three legs of social security, employer-

provided pensions, and private wealth accumulation, appears to apply only to households in the

                                                 7
top 70 percent of the lifetime income distribution because low-income workers lack employer-

provided pension coverage.

II. A Model of Optimal Wealth Accumulation

    We solve a simple life-cycle model, augmented to incorporate uncertain lifetimes,

uninsurable earnings, uninsurable medical expenses, and borrowing constraints. The unit of

analysis is a household, which can be married or single.11 Individuals within a household live to

a maximum age D . Between ages 0 and S − 1 individuals are children and make no

consumption decisions. Adults start working at age S , have exogenous labor supply, and give

birth to as many as n children at ages B1 , B2 , ..., Bn . Earnings depend on age (which affects

work experience) and a random shock that may be correlated across time. Each period, adults

decide how much to consume and how much to save for the future.

    Households retire exogenously at the end of age R and face a probability of death in each

remaining year of life. In retirement, they start receiving health shocks that are allowed to be

correlated across ages. They receive income from social security, defined benefit plans (if

covered) and assets. Social security receipts depend on total earnings during the preretirement

period. Defined benefit pension receipts are a function of the household’s last earnings receipt

before retirement.

II.1. A Household's Maximization Problem

    A household derives utility U (c) from period-by-period consumption in equivalent units,

where g ( Aj , K j ) is a function that adjusts consumption for the number of adults Aj and children

K j in a household at age j . Let c j and a j represent consumption and assets at age j . With



                                                 8
probability p j the individual survives into the next period, so an individual survives until age j

with probability ∏ k = S pk , where        ∏
                        j −1                    j −1
                                                k =S
                                                       pk = 1 if j − 1 < R . At age D , pD = 0 . The discount

factor on future utilities is β . Expected lifetime utility is then

                                             D                                    
                                                             (
                                           E  ∑ β j − SU c j / g ( A j , K j )   ) .
                                              j=S                                 

The expectation operator E denotes the expectation over future earnings uncertainty, uncertainty

in health expenditures, and length of life.

     Consumption and assets are chosen to maximize expected utility subject to the constraints, 12

                                   y j = e j + ra j + T (e j , a j , j , n), j ∈ {S ,..., R} ,

                          R                                     R
                y j = SS  ∑ e j  + DB ( eR ) + ra j + T (eR , ∑ e j , a j , j , n), j ∈ { R + 1,..., D} ,
                          j =S                                j =S



                                    c j + a j +1 = y j + a j − τ ( y j ) , j ∈ {S ,..., R} ,

                               c j + a j +1 + m j = y j + a j − τ ( y j ) , j ∈ { R + 1,..., D} .

The first two equations define taxable income for working and for retired households. The last

two equations show the evolution of resources available for consumption. In these constraints e j

denotes labor earnings at age j, and τ (⋅) is a tax function that depicts total tax payments as a



11
   We do not model marriage or divorce. Married households become single only if a spouse dies. Single
households remain single forever.
12
   The model implies a borrowing constraint in the sense that asset balances are positive in every period. The
intuition is the following: for the problem to be well-specified, the household should not be allowed to die with debt,
regardless of the stochastic sequence of earnings (and medical) shocks. Since earnings shocks in every period can
get arbitrarily close to zero, the household should be in a position to repay debt even if they get a long sequence of
near-zero earnings draws – failing this, consumption goes to zero and marginal utility of consumption goes to
infinity, which is clearly not optimal (since the utility function satisfies the Inada condition). Consequently, the
household will maintain a non-negative asset position in every age. The same logic applies in retirement, with the
exception that rather than earnings uncertainty, the individual now faces uncertainty in medical expenses and
lifespan.
                                                                 9
function of taxable income, y j . SS (⋅) are social security receipts, which are a function of

aggregate lifetime income, and DB (⋅) are defined benefit receipts, which are a function of

earnings received at the last working age. T (⋅) denotes means-tested transfers, which depend on

earnings, social security benefits and defined benefit pensions, assets, the year, and the number

of people in the household. Medical expenditures are denoted by m j and the interest rate is

denoted by r .

II.2. Recursive Formulation of the Life-Cycle Problem

     The life-cycle problem may be solved backwards from age D , given the terminal condition

at that age. There are two sources of uncertainty in retirement – lifespan and medical expenses.

We start by describing the problem for retired married households. The problem for single

households is dealt with in a similar fashion.

II.2.1. The Retired Household’s Problem13

     A retired household between the ages R and D obtains income from social security,

defined benefits, and preretirement assets.14 The dynamic programming problem at age j for a

retired, married household with both members alive at the beginning of age j is given by

   To define a household’s retirement date for those already retired, we use the actual retirement date for the person
in the household who contributed the largest share of lifetime household earnings. For those not retired, we use the
expected retirement date of the person who is expected to contribute the largest share of lifetime household earnings.

   To simplify notation, age j variables will be expressed without any subscripts or superscripts, and age j − 1
variables and age j + 1 variables will be represented with subscript “ −1 ” and superscript “ ' ”, respectively.

In equation (2), V (eR , ER , a, j , m,3) denotes the present discounted value of utility from age j

until the date of death, V (eR , ER , a′, j + 1, m′,3) denotes the corresponding value in the following

year; β is the discount factor on future utilities; and, as noted before, phj and pwj denote the

probability of survival between ages j and j + 1 for the husband and the wife respectively.

Medical expenses are drawn from the Markov processes Ω jm (m′ | m) and Ω js (m′ | m) . These

distributions are allowed to be different depending upon whether the household is married (m) or

single (s). Total earnings up to the current period are denoted by ER , while the last earnings

draw at the age of retirement is eR . Note that ER and eR do not change once the individual is

retired. The integers in the last argument of the value function signify that only the husband

survives (1), only the wife survives (2), or both the husband and wife are alive (3) at the

beginning of the period.

II.2.2. The Problem at the Age of Retirement

     Age R represents the last working age for the individual. At this age, the individual knows

that in the next period he or she will cease working and begin receiving income from social

security and defined benefit pensions. The corresponding dynamic programming problem for a

married household is

The last earnings draw is eR . This draw will determine the household’s defined benefit pension

receipts in retirement. Further, this earnings draw together with total earnings to date, ER −1 ,

determine total lifetime earnings, ER , which in turn determines social security benefits. In

addition, the household realizes that they will start receiving medical shocks beginning in the

next period from the distribution Ω*Rm (m′) or Ω*Rs (m′) , depending on whether both spouses, or

just one, survive into the next period.15 These distributions are assumed to be the stationary

distributions associated with the corresponding Markov chains.

II.2.3. The Working Household’s Problem

      To simplify computation, the dynamic programming problem for working households has

two fewer state variables than it does for households beginning at the retirement age.

Specifically, we assume households incur no out-of-pocket medical expenses prior to retirement

and face no preretirement mortality risk. Between ages S and R , the individual receives an




15
 Medical expenses drawn from the distribution for single households are half those drawn from the distribution for
married couples.

exogenous earnings draw e . Given earnings and savings from the previous period, the

individual decides how much to consume and save. The decision problem reads

                                                                                                        

and
                                                     E = E−1 + e.

Note that during working years, earnings draws for the next period come from the distribution Φ

conditional on the individual’s age and current earnings draw. The solution to this problem

yields the decision rule as a function of the individual state: denote this decision rule

a′ = G (e, E−1 , a, j ) . We assume that each household begins life with zero assets. Given the

observed earnings history of a household, we compute the optimal level of assets at every age

using the decision rules.

III. Model Parameterization and Estimation of Exogenous Processes

      In this section we specify functional forms and parameter values that we use to solve the

model.

      Preferences: The utility function for consumption of final goods is assumed to be CRRA:

                                                        c1−γ

                                                       

Following Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995); Engen, Gale, and Uccello (1999); and Davis,

Kubler, and Willen (2002), the discount factor is set as β = 0.97 , and the coefficient of relative

risk aversion (the reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution) is set as γ = 3. We

describe sensitivity analyses on these key parameters below.

     Equivalence Scale: This is obtained from Citro and Michael (1995) and takes the form

g ( Aj , K j ) = ( Aj + 0.7 K j )0.7 , where again, Aj ( K j ) indicates the number of adults (children) in

the household.

     Survival Probabilities: These are based on the 1992 life tables of the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/lifetables/life92_2.pdf).

     Rate of Return: We assume an annualized real rate of return of 4 percent. This assumption

is consistent with McGrattan and Prescott (2003), who find that the real rate of return for both

equity and debt in the United States over the last 100 years, after accounting for taxes on

dividends and diversification costs, is about 4 percent.16 We include sensitivity analysis on this

parameter below.

     Taxes: We model an exogenous, time-varying, progressive income tax that takes the form

                                        τ ( y ) = a0  y − ( y − a + a2 )             ,

1989.17 We use the 1966 parameters for years before 1966 and the 1989 parameters for 1990

and 1991.

     Transfers: We model the cumulative benefits from public income transfer programs using a

specification suggested by Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes (1995). Specifically, the transfer that an

individual receives while working is given by

                                        T = max {0, c − [ e + (1 + r )a ]} ,

whereas the transfer that he or she will receive upon retiring is

                              T = max {0, c − [ SS ( ER ) + DB (eR ) + (1 + r )a ]} .

This transfer function guarantees a pre-tax income of c , which we set based on parameters

drawn from Moffitt (2002).18 Subsistence benefits ( c ) for a one-parent family with two children

increased sharply, from $5,992 in 1968 to $9,887 in 1974 (all in 1992 dollars). Benefits have

trended down from their 1974 peak – in 1992 the consumption floor was $8,159 for the one-

parent, two-child family. We assume through this formulation that earnings, retirement income,

and assets reduce public benefits dollar for dollar.

     Social Security and Defined Benefit Functions: By making use of the social security

earnings records, we calculate a close approximation of each household’s social security

entitlement. Households in the model understand social security rules and develop expectations

17
   Estimated parameters, for example, in 1989 are a0 = 0.258 , a1 = 0.768 and a2 = 0.031 . In the
framework, a1 = −1 corresponds to a lump sum tax with τ ( y ) = − a0 a2 , while when a1 → 0 , the tax system
converges to a proportional tax system with τ ( y ) = a0 y . For a1 > 0 we have a progressive tax system.
18
   Moffitt (2002, http://www.econ.jhu.edu/People/Moffitt/DataSets.html) provides a consistent series for average
benefits received by a family of four. We use his “modified real benefit sum” variable, which roughly accounts for
the cash value of food stamp, AFDC, and Medicaid guarantees. We weight state-level benefits by population to
calculate an average national income floor. We use 1960 values for years prior to 1960 and use the equivalence
scale described above to adjust benefits for families with different configurations of adults and children. We
confirm that the equivalence scale adjustments closely match average benefit patterns for families with different

of social security benefits that are consistent with their earnings expectations. Details concerning

the social security calculations are given in the first section of Appendix II.

     Defined benefit pension expectations are formed on the basis of an empirical pension

function that depends in a nonlinear way on union status, years of service in the pension-covered

job, and expectations about earnings in the last year of work. We estimate the function with

HRS data. Details are given in the second section of Appendix II.

     Earnings Process: The basic unit of analysis for our life-cycle model is the household. We

aggregate individual earnings histories into household earnings histories. Earnings expectations

are a central influence on life-cycle consumption decisions, both directly and through their

effects on expected pension and social security receipts.

     The household model of log earnings is

                                  log e j = α i + β1 AGE j + β 2 AGE 2j + u j ,

                                               u j = ρ u j −1 + ε j ,

where e j is the observed earnings of the household i at age j in 1992-dollars, α i is the household

specific constant, AGEj is age of the head of the household, u j is an AR(1) error term of the

earnings equation, and ε j is a zero-mean i.i.d., normally distributed error term. The estimated

parameters are α i , β1 , β 2 , ρ, and σ ε .

      We divide households into six groups according to marital status, education, and number of

earners in the household, giving us six sets of household-group-specific parameters.19 Estimates

(excluding the household-specific effect) are given in Appendix Table 4.20

      Estimates of the persistence parameters range from 0.58 for single households without

college degrees to 0.76 for married households with two earners, in which the highest earner has

at least a college degree. The variance of earnings shocks ranges from 0.21 for single

households without college degrees to 0.08 for married households with either one or two

earners and in which the highest earner has at least a college degree.

      We provide sensitivity analysis, setting the persistence parameter to 0.90 for all groups,

below.

      Out of Pocket Medical Expenses: The specification for household medical expense profiles

across retirement ages is given by

                                      mt = β 0 + β1 AGEt + β 2 AGEt2 + ut ,

                                      ut = ρ ut −1 + ε t , ε t ~ N (0, σ ε2 ),

where mt is the log of the household's out-of-pocket medical expenses at time t (the medical

expenses are assumed to be $1 if the self-report is zero or if the household has not yet retired),



19
   The six groups are (1) single without a college degree; (2) single with a college degree or more; (3) married, head
without a college degree, one earner; (4) married, head without a college degree, two earners; (5) married, head with
a college degree, one earner; and (6) married, head with a college degree, two earners. A respondent is an earner if
his or her lifetime earnings are positive and contribute at least 20 percent of the lifetime earnings of the household.
20
   Given the model assumption, predicted earnings are given by
                                  eˆ j = exp(α i + β1 AGE j + β 2 AGE 2j + ρ ( j − l ) ul + σ ε2 2)
where the period l disturbance is calculated as
                                         ul = log(el ) − α i − β1 AGEl − β 2 AGEl2

The household expected earnings profile is {eˆ j } j = S , where S is the first year that the head of the household started
working full time, R is the head’s last year of work. The head of household is defined throughout the paper as the
person in the household with the largest share of lifetime earnings.

AGEt is age of the household head at time t, ut is an AR(1) error term and εt is white-noise. The

parameters to be estimated are β0, β1, β2, ρ, and σε.

     We estimate the medical-expense specification for four groups of households: (1) single

without a college degree, (2) single with a college degree, (3) married without a college degree,

and (4) married with a college degree, using the 1998 and 2000 waves of the HRS.21 We use the

age and education of the head of household. Results are given in the third section of Appendix

II. The persistence parameters for medical shocks cluster tightly at 0.87 for each group. The

variance of shocks is lower for households with greater education within a given household type

(married or single), presumably reflecting higher rates of insurance coverage for households with

college degrees relative to others.

     To facilitate exposition, we denote the distribution from which a retired individual will draw

next period's (age j + 1 ) medical expenses m′ , conditional on the current earnings draw being m

at age j , by Ω js ( m′ m ) for single households and Ω jm ( m′ m ) for married households.

III.1. Model Solution

     We solve the dynamic programming problem by linear interpolation on the value function.

Recall that the state space is composed of six variables for retired households: earnings drawn at

j=R, eR ; cumulative earnings at the time of retirement, ER ; assets, a; age, i; medical expenses, m;

and the number of household members alive, n (as noted earlier, we assume there are no

mortality risks and out-of-pocket medical expenses for working households). We begin by

“discretizing” the state space. The 50-point grid for earnings is constructed using the procedure


21
  New cohorts were added to the HRS in 1998, so the later years give us a broader range of ages to estimate age–
medical expense profiles. These new cohorts were not matched to their social security earnings records, so they
cannot be used for our baseline analysis.

of assets and progressively coarser so as to account for nonlinearities in the decision rules for

assets induced by the borrowing constraint. We start at age D, assumed to be 100, and compute

the value function V (eR , ER , a, D, m, n) associated with all possible states in the discretized set.

(The problem at this stage is trivial, since the individual will simply consume all income.) We

move backward to the previous period and solve for the value function and the decision rule for

assets. If optimal assets do not lie on the grid, we linearly interpolate between the points on the

grid that lie on either side. In this fashion we go all the way to the starting age S and

consequently recover the decision rules a′ = G (e, E−1 , a, j ) for all j = S ...R and

a′ = G (e, E−1 , a, j , m, n) for all j = R + 1...D .

     To summarize, for each household in our sample we compute optimal decision rules for

consumption (and hence asset accumulation) from the oldest possible age ( D ) to the beginning

of their working life ( S ) for any feasible realizations of the random variables: earnings, health

shocks, and mortality. These decision rules differ for each household, since each faces stochastic

draws from different earnings distributions (recall that α i is household-specific). Household-

specific earnings expectations also directly influence expectations about social security and

pension benefits. Other characteristics also differ across households: for example, birth years of

children affect the “adult equivalents” in a household at any given age. Consequently, it is not

sufficient to solve the life-cycle problem for just a few household types.

     Once optimal decision rules are solved for each household, we calculate optimal

consumption (and therefore wealth) each period for each household using data on the observed

realizations of earnings. Specifically, we start at age S, the first working age, where the


                                                        19
household is assumed to begin with zero assets. Earnings to date are also zero at S. Given

observed earnings at age S, eˆS , wealth (saving) is given by aS +1 = G (eˆS , 0, 0, S ) . In the next

period, the household receives an observed earnings draw eˆS +1 , so aggregate earnings are given

by Eˆ S = eˆS . Consequently, wealth is given by aS +1 = G (eˆS +1 , Eˆ S , aS , S + 1). We move forward in

this fashion until we reach the age at which wealth data are available for that particular

household.

      The model, for the sample of 6,322 households, takes roughly six days to solve on a current

desktop PC. Computational constraints, therefore, limit our ability to add features to the model

or estimate the fit-maximizing discount rate or coefficient of relative risk aversion.

IV.     Model Predictions and Their Correspondence to HRS Data

      In this section we compare the optimal wealth levels for each household to their actual

wealth holdings. We start by providing information on optimal wealth for HRS households as

specified by our augmented life-cycle model. We then present detailed information on the

degree to which HRS households are meeting their specific targets. The third subsection

examines correlations between household characteristics and the degree to which households are

and are not meeting their targets. We then compare our results to wealth predictions that would

arise from a naïve behavioral model, where households save an age-varying and income-varying

fraction of their annual earnings, and show our model significantly outperforms several

alternatives. We also show that the model matches other features of wealth and consumption

data. The section concludes with sensitivity analyses on key model parameters.




                                                     20
IV.1 Optimal Wealth Accumulation in the HRS

     Table 2 summarizes the distribution of optimal net worth holdings. These targets include

resources that could be accumulated in real and financial assets, the current value of defined

contribution pensions, including 401(k)s, and housing net worth (for now, we assume households

are willing to reduce housing in retirement to maintain consumption standards). Recall that the

mean age of households in our sample is 55.7, so the average household will work many

additional years before retiring.

     As in the results of Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995), low-skilled households will

optimally accumulate negligible amounts of wealth outside of social security. The optimal

wealth target for the median households in the lowest decile of the lifetime income distribution is

$2,941 (including housing wealth). Means-tested transfer programs, including AFDC (during

the period being studied), food stamps, SSI, and other forms of assistance, have income and asset

tests. Households that receive transfers or that might receive transfers in the future may

optimally accumulate fewer assets than they would in the absence of a safety net, since assets

above a threshold will make households ineligible for benefits.22

     Optimal wealth targets are $69,777 for the median household and are $253,631 for the

median household in the highest decile of the lifetime income distribution.23 The targets increase

monotonically with lifetime income and with educational attainment.




22
   Empirical work on the effects of asset tests and asset accumulation comes to mixed conclusions. Gruber and
Yelowitz (1999) find significant negative effects of Medicaid on asset accumulation, but Hurst and Ziliak (2001)
find only very small effects of AFDC and food stamp asset limits.
23
   In other studies, wealth targets are commonly given in the form of wealth-to-earnings ratios. In the second
column of Table 2 we show targets as a ratio of average income earned in the last five years that the household
worked in the 1992 HRS. Optimal wealth-to-earnings ratios are 2.4 at the median, and median ratios range from 1.2
to 4.0 across the educational attainment distribution and from 0.6 to 3.9 across deciles of the lifetime income
distribution.
                                                       21
     A central feature of our work that distinguishes it from earlier papers is that we can compare

optimal levels of wealth with actual wealth for each household in the HRS.

IV.2. Are Households Preparing Optimally for Retirement?

     Figure 2 gives a scatterplot of optimal net worth against actual net worth, for HRS

households with optimal and actual wealth between $0 and $1,000,000. The curved line gives a

cubic spline of the median values of observed and optimal net worth.24 The figure is striking, in

that households appear to cluster just below the 45° line. The scatterplot gives suggestive visual

evidence that most households are saving adequately for retirement.

     A second striking aspect of Figure 2 is that it illustrates how a well-specified life-cycle

model can closely account for variation in cross-sectional household wealth accumulation. A

linear regression of actual net worth against predicted net worth and a constant shows the model

explains 84 percent of the cross-household variation in wealth (that is, the R2 is 84 percent).25

     Table 3 shows the fraction of HRS households with wealth deficits, broken out by

educational attainment and lifetime earnings deciles. Overall, 18.6 percent of the HRS sample

has deficits (their wealth is less than the optimal target). However, the median magnitude

(conditional on having a deficit) is very small, averaging $5,714. Although some households are

approaching retirement with significant wealth deficits, Table 3 provides additional evidence that

HRS households overwhelmingly are well prepared for retirement.




24
   The median band is smoothed by dividing households into 30 groups based on observed net worth. We use
Stata’s “connect(s) bands(30)” option for the figure.
25
   Hurst (2003), using an innovative test from the PSID, shows that between 10 and 20 percent of the population
appears not to be following the permanent income hypothesis. In brief, he splits the sample into low-residual
undersavers (the bottom 10–20 percent of wealth residuals) and other households based on a log-wealth regression
estimated from the 1989 wealth supplement of the PSID. He then shows that undersavers violate Euler equation
excess sensitivity tests, whereas other households do not.
                                                       22
    The last four columns of Table 3 help put the magnitude of the wealth deficits in

perspective. Column 3 repeats the optimal net worth targets shown in Table 2. Comparing

columns 2 and 3, median deficits for households who have deficits are generally small relative to

the optimal targets. The remaining columns show the actual nonpension, non-social-security net

worth accumulated by households, their social security entitlements, and their defined benefit

pension entitlements. Reinforcing the impression from Figure 2, Table 3 shows that households

accumulate more than the optimal level of net worth throughout the education and lifetime

income distribution.

    Another striking feature of Table 3 is that the probability of failing to meet the target is 34.6

percent in the lowest lifetime income decile and falls monotonically to 6.4 percent in the highest

lifetime income decile. The simple cross-tabulation suggests that to the extent undersaving is a

problem, it is particularly acute for low-income households. In this case, however, the

descriptive statistics are misleading.

    Table 4 shows the results from a probit regression of the probability that an HRS household

failed to meet its optimal wealth target. It is striking that lifetime income does not have a strong,

statistically significant effect once we condition on other covariates.26 The only factor that is

strongly correlated with having a wealth deficit is being single – married households are 27.2

percentage points less likely to have a deficit than single households.

    In additional regressions estimated separately for a sample of single households and for a

sample of married households, no covariates are correlated with saving less than the optimal

target for single households. The only covariate correlated with a wealth deficit for married

couples is an indicator variable for Hispanic ethnicity. Hispanic couples are 2.8 percentage



                                                 23
points less likely than white couples to have deficits. These results suggest undersaving is

approximately randomly distributed throughout the population – it is not a phenomenon

disproportionately affecting poor households or households with low levels of education.

Moreover, the strong income gradient shown in Table 3 is purely a composition effect – single

households are much more likely than married households not to meet their wealth targets. Since

single households are more likely to have lower incomes than married households, they are

disproportionately represented in the lower deciles of the lifetime earnings distribution.27

IV.3. Are Americans Oversaving?

     To this point we have only presented figures for the median household in the population or

the median household within education or lifetime income deciles. Figure 3 shows selected

percentiles – 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th – of the distribution of the difference between actual

and optimal wealth targets by lifetime income deciles. Two things are striking from this figure.

First, only very small percentages of households accumulated less than their optimal wealth

target. Undersavers are concentrated in the bottom half of the lifetime income distribution. And

the magnitudes of the shortfalls, conditional on having a shortfall, are small. Second, the most

striking aspect of Figure 3 is the degree to which people are saving too much. We probe this

result in the remaining part of this subsection.




26
   The income coefficients are not jointly significant at even the 15 percent level of confidence, nor are the
coefficients for the highest three lifetime income deciles.
27
   We were also concerned that the results for singles could be driven by divorce. If one-earner, married households
divorced prior to the HRS survey, we would likely treat single earner as undersaving (they had income that before
was supporting a family, yet following the divorce they would be expected to have only half the assets). Similarly,
the nonworking partners would appear to have oversaved – they earned no income but are observed to have half the
previously accumulated assets. However, this concern appears to be misplaced: the fraction of singles failing to
meet their wealth targets is stable as we drop recently divorced individuals from the sample, or when we drop ever-
divorced individuals.
                                                        24
     There is some question about the degree to which the elderly are willing to reduce housing

equity to sustain consumption in retirement. Venti and Wise (2001), for example, write “these

results suggest that in considering whether families have saved enough to maintain their

preretirement standard of living after retirement, housing equity should not be counted on to

support general non-housing consumption.” This conclusion is controversial. Hurd (2003)

shows that the elderly households in the AHEAD data (the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics

Among the Oldest Old) decumulate housing wealth as they age. Engen, Gale, and Uccello

(1999) make a forceful case for including at least a significant portion of housing wealth when

measuring resources households can draw on to maintain living standards in retirement.28

Nevertheless, we do not want the first conclusion from Figure 3 – that a substantial majority of

Americans are preparing well for retirement – to be driven by our treatment of home equity.

     To explore the consequences of altering the treatment of housing in our calculations, we

also examine the distribution of wealth deficits excluding half of housing from the resources

available to meet the wealth target. Excluding half of housing equity, 57.9 percent of all

households meet or exceed their wealth targets. The 25th percentile of the saving surplus

distribution (net worth minus optimal targets) has a deficit of $10,296, implying that 75 percent

of households are exceeding or within $10,300 of their optimal (nonpension, non-social-security)

wealth target, even excluding half their net home equity. The lowest decile of the distribution

has a deficit of $40,371. The full distribution is given in Figure 4. Whereas results in the paper


28
   Engen, Gale, and Uccello (1999) make four points. First, existing work suggesting the elderly do not decumulate
is flawed; housing should be the last asset to tap since it is illiquid and tax-preferred, and because some evidence is
based on cohorts that were considerably less mobile than the HRS cohort. Second, households have vigorously
extracted equity from houses in the 1980s and 1990s. Third, tax consequences of selling housing have fallen in
recent years making it difficult to make inferences about people’s willingness to downsize from earlier data. Fourth,
housing provides consumption services and thus represents wealth. Conceptually and from a policy perspective, it
seems odd to ignore one important source of wealth when considering economic well-being among households in
retirement.
                                                          25
are qualitatively similar if we exclude half of housing equity, we report results when using all net

worth for the remainder of the paper.

     There are at least three features of the model that could account for the fact that many

households appear to be accumulating significantly more than their optimal life-cycle targets.29

First, we assume households expected and received a real rate of return of 4 percent. To the

extent perceptions or realizations of real rates of return differ from our assumption, households

will accumulate less or more than the target. One way to probe the importance of this factor is to

make use of the limited geographic information available in the HRS.30 House prices on the East

and West Coasts increased substantially more over this period than house prices elsewhere.31 If

rate of return assumptions are systematically accounting for oversaving, we expect that

households living in the New England Division (MA, NH, VT, MA, RI, and CN) or the Pacific

Division (WA, OR, CA, AK, and HI) will be more likely than other households to significantly

exceed their targets.

     Second, households may intend to leave bequests. Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2003), for

example, argue that bequest intentions are the best way to reconcile wealth-income patterns in

several nationally representative datasets. We use HRS questions probing the subjective

likelihood of households leaving bequests of $10,000 and $100,000 to explore whether




29
   A fourth would be that our chosen preference parameters are incorrect. We explore the model sensitivity to
preference parameters in a later subsection.
30
   HRS rules prohibit using restricted-access geocoded data with the restricted-access earnings data. Given the
centrality of the earnings data to this project, we can only use the publicly available geographic information, which
breaks the United States into nine regions.
31
   The repeat-sales house price index increased 381 percent between 1975 and 1992 in the Pacific, 278 percent in
New England, and less than 120 percent in the East South Central, West South Central, and West North Central
Divisions. See http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/ushmc/fall02/histdat10.htm.
                                                         26
households with a high (or certain) likelihood of leaving a bequest of these magnitudes are more

likely than other households to exceed their wealth targets.32

     Third, households might expect to live longer than suggested by the life tables published by

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Households with expectations of greater

longevity will optimally accumulate more resources than predicted by our model. We use HRS

questions probing subjective expectations of life expectancy to explore the importance of this

factor in explaining oversaving.33

     We examine the importance of rate of return differences, bequest intentions, and longevity

risk along with factors in an empirical median regression model of “saving adequacy,” defined as

the difference between actual net worth (excluding DB pensions and social security wealth) and

optimal net worth. The results are shown in Table 5. There is a sharply increasing, positive

relationship between wealth accumulation and lifetime income starting in the sixth lifetime

income decile. There is also a strong positive relationship between net worth and social security

wealth and being self-employed and married. Households headed by men and black households

have lower wealth than white, female-headed households. Saving adequacy also declines with

the number of children in the family. There is no evidence that region of the country or

subjective life expectancies have any relationship with saving adequacy (or oversaving).

Bequest intentions, however, are positively, significantly related to acquiring more wealth than

the optimal target. This result is consistent with purposeful bequest intentions affecting life-

cycle wealth accumulation.



32
   The specific questions come from the 1994 wave of the HRS and read, “What are the chances that you [or your
husband/wife/partner] will leave an inheritance totaling $10,000 (or $100,000) or more?
33
   The specific questions come from the 1992 wave of the HRS and read, “What do you think are the chances that
you will live to be 75 (or 85) or more?”
                                                       27
IV.4. Alternative, “Naïve” Models

   In the conclusion of their paper on variation in retirement wealth, Bernheim, Skinner, and

Weinberg (2001) write, “the empirical patterns in this paper are more easily explained if one

steps outside the framework of rational, far-sighted optimization. If, for example, households

follow heuristic rules of thumb to determine saving prior to retirement….” Indeed, naïve or rule-

of-thumb models of consumption have had an important place in the consumption literature at

least since the Keynesian consumption function.

   The exceptionally rich data we have on household earnings contain a great deal of

information. Health shocks prior to retirement, unemployment, changes in labor demand and

supply, among other things, will be reflected in the 41-year series of earnings we have for most

households. Given the rich earnings data, it is natural to ask how much of the variation in HRS

wealth can be explained by applying simple, rule-of-thumb saving behavior to the household-

specific earnings trajectories. In doing this analysis, we continue to assume a 4 percent real

interest rate, as we have done in the baseline life-cycle simulations. Our results are summarized

in Table 6.

   The simplest model we examined assumes that households save a constant fraction of their

income, independent of their income or age. We iteratively sought the saving rate that

maximized the goodness of fit measure, R2. The fit-maximizing saving rate is 6.9 percent and

the model explains 7.1 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional distribution of wealth in the HRS. A

naïve model with age-varying and income-varying saving rates, in this case drawn from the

parameters estimated in Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2003, Table 3), explains 11.4 percent of the

variation in retirement wealth. The original formulation of the life-cycle model (Modigliani and


                                                28
Brumberg, 1954) where households save a constant fraction of permanent income (in this case,

5.8 percent) explains 16.1 percent of the variation in retirement wealth. It is clear that the

augmented life-cycle model presented in this paper, which explains 83.7 percent of the cross-

sectional variation in wealth, does a vastly better job matching the cross-sectional distribution of

wealth in the 1992 HRS than the rule-of-thumb models we examine.

     Our augmented life-cycle model includes many more parameters than the rule-of-thumb

models. With more parameters, model fit should improve. Our augmented life-cycle model has

a household-specific intercept, α i , of the household age-earnings profiles, in effect adding 6,322

parameters to the model. We think this is a sensible way to model earning expectations –

households presumably have a reasonable understanding of their place in the ability distribution,

given observable characteristics such as educational attainment and age. Nevertheless, we also

consider an alternative, more parsimonious version of the baseline model in which we assume

that all households possess identical α ' s . To do this we re-estimate the AR(1) process

(assuming identical α ' s within household types) and simulate the optimal decision rules. We

find that the model can account for 43.6 percent of the observed variation in 1992 wealth. Thus,

our model, even with relatively few parameters, does a fairly good job matching the 1992 cross-

sectional distribution of wealth in the HRS.

     Anther useful benchmark for our augmented life-cycle model is to compare its model fit to

reduced-form regression models. We regress wealth in 1992 against earnings and a host of other

household characteristics, in which each of the 41 years of earnings observations appear

separately.34 This regression accounts for 25.3 percent of the variation in wealth. If we add


34
   The model also includes a quadratic in age, indicator variables for race and ethnicity, marital status, educational
attainment, region, 17 occupations, 13 industries, two-earner household, retired, self-employment, unemployment,
                                                          29
quadratic terms in each year of earnings the resulting empirical model accounts for 29.7 percent

of the variation in wealth. Even a parsimonious parameterization of the augmented life-cycle

model that includes fewer parameters does a better job of explaining the observed variation in

wealth than a regression that incorporates separately the linear and quadratic terms of annual

earnings.

    Our last experiment with alternative models attempts to clarify the importance of the

augmented life-cycle model’s decision rules in explaining the model fit, relative to the unusually

rich earnings histories we use. To examine this, consider the following thought experiment.

Once we solve the model for each individual, we have the optimal decision rules. Now, rather

than using the actual earnings draws to obtain wealth predictions for 1992, imagine that we were

to obtain, for each individual, 10,000 (sequences of) draws from the empirical earnings

distribution and then use these draws to obtain predictions for wealth in 1992. The predicted

wealth level for each individual is the average value implied by the potential realization of all

such sequences. One can do the same for all the individuals in the sample and obtain the

goodness of fit between the model and the data. The resulting R2 is 41.1 percent. This suggests

that although it is important to have the earnings realizations, the decision rules arising from the

augmented life-cycle model are equally critical in arriving at such a close correspondence

between model and data.

IV.5. Other Model Features

    In this section we briefly examine three other features of the baseline model and show that

they are consistent with several well-established facts about consumption. First, a well-known


health status, pension coverage, past marital history, and counts of the number of children, number of children
between 12 and 17, and the number of children between 18 and 21.
                                                         30
fact from the consumption literature is that consumption is hump-shaped over the lifecycle (see,

for example, Carroll, 1997). Figure 5 reports mean optimal consumption and income by age for

our sample after we have netted out children’s consumption so as to keep family size constant.

Consumption is hump-shaped and peaks around age 46, whereas the peak in income occurs

around age 51. The patterns in Figure 5 mirror those reported in Gourinchas and Parker

(2002).35

       A second issue has to do with how our augmented life-cycle model can match the well-

known skewness of the wealth distribution. Our model predicts that the top 1 percent of our

sample holds about 17 percent of the wealth. The corresponding figure in the data is 24 percent.

So, just as is often claimed, the lack of bequest motives undermines the ability of the model to

match the wealth holdings of the very rich. But the model does capture a large part of the

skewness.

       Third, a more stringent test of our model is how well it can match the change in wealth

between 1992 and 2000. To put this in context, it is instructive to compare our model fit with a

regression of the difference in wealth levels between 1992 and 2000 against household

characteristics and earnings at every age.36 The resulting R2 is 3.6 percent. Introducing a

quadratic term for earnings (at each age) increases the R2 to 6.6 percent. In contrast, the baseline

model (with a 4 percent real interest rate between 1992 and 2000) generates an R2 of 28 percent.




35
     Prior to age 45 households in the model engage in “buffer stock” saving (Carroll, 2001). Carroll argues that a
                                                   1
version of the life-cycle model where ( (1 + r ) β ) γ = 1.0029 < g , where g represents that growth rate of income does
a very good job of capturing consumption-saving behavior during working ages. Our baseline parameters satisfy
this condition. Setting β = 1 , for example, leads to households beginning retirement wealth accumulation earlier in
life and a monotonically increasing age-consumption profile during working years.
36
   The regression model also includes the covariates listed in footnote 34.
                                                           31
We conclude that the model presented does a good job of capturing observed behavior, not just

of a cross-section at a point in time, but also changes over time across households.

IV.6. Sensitivity Analysis

    There are three model parameters that we specify exogenously before solving the model – the

discount factor ( β ), the coefficient of relative risk aversion ( γ ), and the real interest rate ( r ).

In this subsection we analyze the sensitivity of the results to our choices of β , γ , and r . Table

7 shows the results. As expected, increases in β and r increase the incentive to save more in

the future. In the life-cycle model this raises the optimal (or “target”) level of wealth. When

these targets are matched to the observed HRS data, more households fail to save adequately for

retirement. For example, raising the real interest rate from 4 percent to 7 percent increases the

fraction of households with wealth less than the optimal from 18.6 percent to 38.9 percent. An

increase in γ has a similar effect because, as households become more risk averse, precautionary

saving increases, increasing the optimal (or target) level of wealth accumulation and

consequently undersaving. Nevertheless, the degree of undersaving is not particularly high –

assuming that γ = 5 , for example, increases the fraction of households with wealth less than the

optimal from 18.6 percent to 35.7 percent in the baseline results.

    Another parameter that plays an important role is the persistence in earnings across ages.

Recall that these persistence parameters vary by type; they range from 0.58 for the single

household without a college degree to 0.76 for the married, two-earner household, in which the

head has a college degree. These parameters were estimated directly from the 41 years of Social

Security earnings data. But many life-cycle models assume more persistence in the earnings

process. The last line of Table 7 arbitrarily sets all persistence parameters in earnings

                                                    32
expectations to 0.9. Households understand that this dramatically increases the odds of retaining

a bad or good draw if one is received. The resulting R2 is 68.9 percent, and 27.6 percent of

households fail to meet their optimal targets. As expected, increasing the persistence in earnings

increases optimal wealth accumulation at retirement.

     Our sensitivity analysis leads us to conclude that within the range of values considered, most

households in the HRS appear to have saved adequately for retirement.37 Moreover, within a

reasonably broad range of parameter values, the model can explain at least 68.9 percent of the

cross-sectional variation in wealth in the 1992 HRS. These results do not depend at all on the

inclusion of households in the sample with fully imputed earnings histories. When we drop

households that did not allow the HRS to have access to their social security earnings records,

the results are nearly identical using our baseline parameters: 18.4 percent of households

accumulate less wealth than their optimal targets. Conditional on having a deficit, the median

shortfall is $5,028. And the model accounts for 84 percent of the cross-sectional distribution of

wealth in this subsample.

V. Conclusions

     In this paper we develop a rigorous approach for assessing the degree to which a

representative sample of households nearing retirement have prepared financially for that event.

We find strikingly little evidence that HRS households have undersaved. And because

consumption requirements likely fall when households reach retirement (if for no other reason

than work expenses fall), our standard may overstate required wealth. We also note that our

primary data come from 1992, well before the exceptionally strong stock market performance of


37
  If social security benefits are cut by 25 percent for all households, we find that 36.1 percent of households under-
save, almost twice as many as in the baseline model. But we think such benefit cuts are unlikely for the HRS cohort.

the 1990s. Because 81 percent of households meet or exceed their wealth targets (and most of

those who are below miss by a relatively small amount), we are skeptical that the consumption

changes around retirement documented by Bernheim, Skinner, and Weinberg (2001) are due to

inadequate retirement wealth accumulation.

    We also find it striking how much of the variation in observed wealth accumulation can be

explained by our life-cycle model. We explain over 85 percent of the variation in wealth for

married households, and over 70 percent for single, never-married households. And the results

presented reflect no tweaking or prior fitting of the model. If we had found major deviations

from the model and behavior, it would be difficult to determine whether Americans were

preparing poorly for retirement, or we had constructed a poor behavioral benchmark. The fact

that our predictions and data closely align suggests two things. First, as mentioned above,

Americans are saving enough to maintain living standards in retirement. And second, the life-

cycle model provides a very good representation of behavior related to the accumulation of

retirement wealth. Of course, we still admit the possibility that Americans are preparing poorly

for retirement, our underlying behavioral model is poor, and the errors, coincidentally, offset.

    Although the specific measures of undersaving and model fit clearly depend on parameter

values, our two main results – that the life-cycle model is capable of closely matching the cross-

sectional distribution of wealth in the HRS and that most HRS households are saving more than

their optimal targets – are not affected significantly by parameter choices that are within the

range commonly found in the related literature. We also find the life-cycle model does a much

better job of matching the cross-sectional distribution of wealth in 1992 than a naïve model in

which households save an income- and age-varying fraction of income.


                                                 34
    Turning to the question posed in the title of the paper: are Americans saving optimally for

retirement? The HRS covers a specific cohort of Americans – households age 51 to 61 in 1992.

Consequently, we need to be careful in generalizing our results for the HRS cohort to younger

households. This is particularly true if the generosity of social security is reduced in the future.

Moreover, saving too much has efficiency costs in the sense that, absent preferences about

intergenerational transfers or charitable contributions, reallocating consumption across time

could increase lifetime utility. Because we cannot determine whether the systematic oversaving

of HRS households reflects bequest motives, the expectation that social security will be reduced

in the future, other failures in our characterization of the economic environment, or reflects

nonoptimal behavior on the part of HRS households, we cannot definitively answer the question

posed in the paper title. But the paper provides new, strong support for the life-cycle model as a

good characterization of the process governing retirement wealth accumulation. And more

important, it adds considerably to our confidence that Americans are preparing well for

retirement.

                              Appendix I: Imputing Earnings in the HRS

     We have two problems that we address with the earnings data. For 77 percent of the 1992
HRS sample, we have access to each individual’s social security earnings records from 1951 to
1991. The social security earning records report wage, salary, and self-employment income up
to the earnings maximum (the earnings thresholds at which social security taxes are no longer
taken from income). For 92 percent of the respondents with Social Security earnings records, we
also have W-2 earnings records from 1980 to 1991. These W-2 records provide complete
earnings information for wage and salary earners and the self-employed. The first difficulty is
that 16 percent of positive social security earnings records are top-coded, and 41 percent of
respondents with social security earnings records have at least one top-coded observation.
     Our second problem is that 23 percent of observations refused to grant access to social
security earnings records. For these households we have self-reported earnings information for
their current job (or the most recent job if not employed) and as many as three previous jobs. We
need to estimate their earning profiles based on their self-reported earnings information.
     The goal is to use all available information to impute top-coded and missing earning
observations, and as a result obtain complete individual earnings histories. For the imputation,
we proceed in two steps. First, based on the social security and W-2 records, we estimate a
dynamic-panel Tobit model to obtain individual earning processes. Then, conditional on all
available earnings information, we use the estimates to impute the top-coded and missing
observations.

Estimation
     We start by describing our approach to estimating earnings for individuals with top-coded
earnings.
     For simplicity, suppose that we have earnings records of N individuals from time t = 0 to T,
where 0 is the first period that these individuals started working full time. Assume for the
moment that earnings are positive in each time period.38 Denote the logarithmic value of
individual i's actual (latent) and observed (by the researcher) earnings as yi*,t and yi,t,
respectively. The relationship between the observed and actual (latent) earnings can be described
as
                                                y i*,t if y i*,t < y ttc
                                      y i ,t =  tc
                                                y t if y i ,t ≥ y t
                                                              *        tc


where y ttc is the logarithmic value of the social security maximum taxable earnings at time t.
    The individual log-earnings process is specified as

                                             yi*, 0 = xi′,0 β 0 + ε i , 0
                                             yi*,t = ρyi*,t −1 + xi′,t β + ε i ,t , t ∈{1,2,...,T }
                                             ε i , t = α i + u i ,t                                         (6)

38
  Generalizing this to the case in which the earnings series begins after time 0 and the case in which some earnings
observations are zero is straightforward but detail-oriented, so we omit the discussion. We did treat these cases in
practice, however.
                                                             39
where xi,t is the vector of i's characteristics at time t, and the error term εi,t includes an
individual-specific component α i , which is constant over time and known to the individual
before time 0, and the unanticipated white noise component, ui,t . Notice that parameters β0 and β
are allowed to be different. In the following analysis, we employ random-effect assumptions
with homoskedastic errors
     (A1)        α i | x i ~ iid N (0,σ α2 )
        (A2)               u i ,t | x i ~ iid N (0,σ u2 ) ∀t
        (A3)                E[u i ,t | x i ,α i ] = 0, E[u i2,t | x i ,α i ] = σ u2 , E[u i ,t ui ,k | x i ,α i ] = 0, ∀t ∈ {0,1,.., T }, t ≠ k
where xi ≡ ( xi ,0 , xi ,1 ,..., xi ,T ) .
        These three assumptions imply that
                                                                     ε i = (ε i ,0 , ε i ,1 ,..., ε i ,T )′ ~ N (0, Σ)                                              (7)

with σ 2j ,k      = σ α2 + σ u2 for j = k, and σ 2j ,k = σ α2 otherwise. Our goal here is to obtain consistent
estimates of the true parameters θ * = ( β , β 0 , ρ ,σ α2 ,σ u2 ) . We do this by maximum likelihood.
     To construct the likelihood function for each individual's earnings series, notice that we can
write the joint distribution function of each pair of random variables ( y i ,t , yi*,t ) as
 g ( yi ,t , yi*,t | yi ,t −1 , yi*,t −1 , yi ,t −2 , yi*,t −2 ,....., yi ,0 , yi*, 0 ; x i ,θ ) . From the AR(1) assumption on earnings
made in (6), it follows that
       (A4)                  g ( yi ,t , yi*,t | yi ,t −1 , yi*,t −1 , yi ,t −2 , yi*,t −2 ,....., yi ,0 , yi*, 0 ; x i ,θ ) = g ( yi ,t , yi*,t | yi ,t −1 , yi*,t −1 ; x i ,θ )
In other words, of all the information about past realized and observed earnings, only
information from the previous period matters. As a special case, the conditional likelihood of the
pair ( yi , 0 , yi*, 0 ) is g 0 ( yi ,0 , yi*,0 | x i ,θ ) because there is no information about earnings before
period 0.
       Applying Bayes' rules to the density g( ), we have
              g ( yi ,t , yi*,t | yi ,t −1 , yi*,t −1 ; x i ,θ ) = h( yi*,t | yi ,t , yi ,t −1 , yi*,t −1 ; x i ,θ )q( yi ,t | yi ,t −1 , yi*,t −1 ; x i ,θ )             (8)
where the density for the observed log-earnings conditional on the past information is a
conventional Tobit likelihood function

and the conditional density is simply h( yi*,t | yi ,t = yttc , yi ,t −1 , yi*,t −1 ; x i ,θ ) for censored observations.
        Similarly, we can write g 0 ( yi , 0 , yi*, 0 | x i ,θ ) = h0 ( yi*,0 | yi ,0 ; x i ,θ )q0 ( yi ,0 | x i ,θ ) where the

                                                                                                    1{ yi*, 0 < y0tc }                                           1{ yi*, 0 ≥ y0tc }

        From (6) and (7), it is apparent that the functions f ( yi ,0 | x i ,θ ) and f ( yi ,t | yi ,t −1 , y                                                                    *

where c1, c2, ..., cn are the periods where the observed log-earnings are censored, i.e., equal to
their corresponding top-coded limits. Notice that, since we do not observe y i*,t when it is
censored, we integrate out y i*,t for censored observations. Unfortunately, the integration does not
yield any analytical solution, nor is direct numerical evaluation of the integral computationally
feasible in this case. As an alternative, Chang (2002) proposes using a GHK (probit) simulator to
deal with the computational burden of the integration.39 The estimation results are given in Table
A1.

  The GHK simulator gives a numerical approximation of a probit probability of interest. The GHK simulator is a
popular choice of probit simulators due to its relative accuracy; see Geweke, Keane, and Runkle (1994) for details.

§
 The dependent variable is the respondents’ natural-log-earnings. For samples with at most high school, the education variables
are (i) Years of Schooling, and (ii) No High School Dummy. For samples with at least a bachelor’s degree, the education
variables are (i) Professional Postgraduate Degree (MBA, J.D., M.D., or Ph.D.) Dummy, and (ii) Postgraduate Degree Dummy.
Standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.

      Imputation

     The idea is to impute top-coded and missing earnings observations with their conditional
expectations where the conditioning variables include both the individual’s characteristics and
observed earnings. The conditional expectations are calculated numerically on the basis of the
dynamic earnings model (6) and the distributional assumption (7). The imputation scheme is
similar for top-coded and missing observations; therefore, we only discuss the scheme for top-
coded observations here.40
        To be concrete, notice that (6) implies that
                E[ y0* | y, x,θ ] = x0′ β 0 + E[ε 0 | y, x,θ ]
                      E[ yt* | y, x,θ ] = ρE[ yt*−1 | y, x,θ ] + xt′β + E[ε t | y, x,θ ], t ∈{1,2,...,T }                                 (10)
where y = ( y0 , y1 ,..., yT ) is the series of individual i’s observed earnings (the individual subscript
i is omitted throughout this subsection). By construction, given information about individual’s
characteristics and observed earnings, E[ yt* | y, x,θ ] is on average the best guess for yt* . In other
words, for top-coded observations, equation (6) suggests the imputed values
                              y timp = E[ y t* | y t = y ttc ; y, x,θ ]
which requires knowledge of E[ε t | yt = yttc ; y , x,θ ] for every period t in which yt = y ttc . The
analytical form of E[ε t | yt = yttc ; y , x,θ ] is not available in our case; therefore, we calculate this
object numerically using the Gibbs sampling procedure.41
         To facilitate the discussion about details of the procedure, denote ε <t = (ε 0 , ε 1 ,..., ε t −1 )′ ,
ε >t = (ε t +1 , ε t +2 ,..., ε T )′ and ε −t = (ε 0 , ε1 ,..., ε t −1 , ε t +1 ,..., ε T )′ for any vector ε = (ε 0 , ε1 ,..., ε T )′ . Here,
we want to simulate R sets of ε that are consistent with the observed y and x given θ. The Gibbs
sampling procedure does this in 2 steps for each round of simulation.

          1. In the rth round of simulation, r = 1,2, ... ,R, generate a “random” initial value
              ε (0r ) = (ε 0( r,0) , ε 1(,r0) ,..., ε t(,r0) ,..., ε T( r, 0) ) which satisfies (6) given y, x and θ.
               Notice that ε t(,r0) is not identified when yt = y ttc . In this case, ε t(,r0) is chosen randomly
               under the restriction that yt*(, 0r ) ≡ ( yt* | ε <t = ε <t , 0 , ε t = ε t(,r0) ; x,θ ) ≥ y ttc . If yt −1 < yttc−1 and
                                                                                   (r )


               yt < yttc , ε t(,r0) is defined by (6), i.e. it is actually not random.
          2. Start with m = 1, draw a random number ε t(,rm) from t = 0, ..., T from the distribution of
               ε t | ε −t ; x,θ such that yt*,m( r ) = ( yt* | ε >t = ε (>rt ),m−1 , ε <t = ε <( rt ,)m , ε t = ε t(,rm) ; x,θ ) = yt if yt < yttc ,


40
   We can think of a missing earnings observation as an observation with top-coded value of 0, which is equivalent
to saying that we know nothing about earnings in that period (as opposed to the case in which we observe top-coded
earnings and know that the actual earnings is at least as large as the top-coded earnings).
41
   Briefly, Gibbs sampling is a procedure to draw a set of numbers randomly from a (valid) joint distribution. Then,
the random draws are used to estimate properties of any marginal distribution of interest, which is difficult to derive
analytically from the joint distribution. The procedure relies upon the law of large numbers, i.e., that moments of a
distribution can be estimated consistently from a set of random draws from that distribution.
                                                                        43
                and yt*,m( r ) = ( yt* | ε >t = ε >t ,m−1 , ε <t = ε <( rt ,)m , ε t = ε t(,rm) ; x,θ ) ≥ yttc if yt = yttc . (This is
                                                         (r)


                equivalent to drawing ε t(,rm) from ε t | ε −t ; y, x,θ .) Then, continue from m = 2 to m = M.

           With ε M , r = 1,2, ... ,R, an estimate of E[ε t | y , x,θ ] is
                       (r )


                                                                                     1 R
                                                                 Eˆ [ε t | y, x,θ ] = ∑ ε t ,(Mr )                                       (11)
                                                                                     R r =1
Given the estimate Eˆ [ε t | y, x,θ ] , we calculate the imputed value of earnings as
                                   y imp = x′ β + Eˆ [ε | y, x,θ ]
                                                     0           0     0              0

                                                                     t −1    + xt′β + Eˆ [ε t | y, x,θ ], t ∈ {1,2,..., T }              (12)

Notice that, by construction, y 0imp =       ∑ 0,M
                                           R r =1

                                                                    R r =1
 ytimp = yt if yt < y ttc and ytimp ≥ yt if yt = yttc .
         The remaining parts of this subsection (i) construct the functional form for the
conditional distribution of ε t | ε −t ; x,θ , and (ii) show how to draw a random number ε t(,rm) from
this conditional distribution to satisfy (6) given y, x and θ. More notation is required. For any
matrix Σ, denote Σt,t as the element of Σ on the tth row and tth column, Σ t , − t as the tth row of Σ
with the element Σt,t removed, Σ −t,t as the tth column of Σ with the element Σt,t removed, and
Σ −t , −t as the matrix Σ with the tth row and tth column removed.
           Recall the property of a joint-normal vector that
                   ε ~ N ( E[ε ], Σ) ⇒ ε t | ε −t ~ N ( µ t|−t , Σ t|−t )
                        µ t|−t = E[ε t ] + Σ t , −t Σ −−1t , −t {ε −t − E[ε −t ]} , Σ t|−t = Σ t ,t − Σ t , −t Σ −−1t , −t Σ −t ,t       (13)42
Recall from (7) that E[ε i ] = 0 and Σ = (1 − ρ )σ ε2 I T +1 + ρσ ε21T +1 , where 1T+1 is a (T+1) x (T+1)
matrix whose elements are all 1. Thus, µ t|−t = Σ t , −t Σ −−1t , −t ε −t , and Σ t , −t Σ −−1t , −t = Σ s , − s Σ −−1s , − s and
Σ t|−t = Σ s|− s for any t = 0, ..., T and s = 0, ..., T.
           Recall that we draw a value for ε t(,rm) randomly from the conditional distribution ε t | ε −t
such that, given ε >t ,m −1 , ε <( rt ,)m , ε t(,rm) , x,θ ,
                              (r )


                                                                      yt*,m( r ) = yt        if yt < yttc
                                                                                                                                         (14)
                                                                 yt*,m( r ) ∈ [ yttc , ∞) if yt = yttc
In practice, it is more convenient to work with the standard-normal transformation of ε t | ε −t
                                                               (ε t | ε −t ) − µ t|− t

                                                                           σ t |− t

From (6), ε 0 | ε −0 = ( y0* | ε −0 ) − x0′ β 0 and ε t | ε −t = ( yt* − ρyt*−1 | ε −t ) − xt′β , t ∈{1,2,...,T } .
Also, since ( yt* | ε −t ; x,θ ) = ( yt* | ε <t ; x,θ ) , ( yt*−1 | ε >t = ε >t ,m−1 , ε <t = ε <t ,m ; x,θ ) = yt*(−1r,)m .

  To see how this works, note first that for ε ~ N(µ, σ2), f(ε) = (2πσ2)-1/2exp(-0.5{ε-µ}/σ). Define z ≡ {ε-µ}/σ . It
follows that F(ε) = Φ(z(ε)), where Φ is the standard normal cumulative density function. Thus,
                          Φ ( z (ε ( r ) )) = F (ε ( r ) ) = ξ t( r ) + (1 − ξ t( r ) ) F (ε tc ) = ξ t( r ) + (1 − ξ t( r ) )Φ ( z (ε tc ))
In other words, drawing ε(r) from a truncated distribution of (ε|ε≥εtc) is equivalent to drawing z(r) = z(ε(r)) from a
truncated distribution of (z|z≥ztc) and then transforming z(r) back to ε(r).

A1. Social Security Function

       From the expected earnings profiles, we can calculate the lifetime summation of household
                                                           R
earnings up to the year of retirement as E R ≡ ∑ e j , where e j denotes the household earnings at
                                                           j=S

age j in a common base-year unit, and S and R denote the first and the last working ages,
respectively.44 Denote φ h and φ w as the fractions of E R that are contributed by the husband and
wife of the household, respectively.45 Based on E R , φ h and φ w , we can approximate the
household annual social security benefits as follows.
       (a) Calculate Individual Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)46
       Individual i’s annual indexed monthly earnings (AIME) can be approximated as
                                       AIME i ≈ φ i E R Li                                                         (16)
with
                                      Li = 12 × max{R i − 22,40}
where i = h (husband) or w (wife), and Li is the number of months of i’s covered period.47
Without loss of generality, we set Lw = 40 for single-male households and Lh = 40 for single-
female households.
    Individual PIA can be calculated as
               PIAi = 0.90 × min{ AIME i , b0 } + 0.32 × min{max{ AIME i − b0 ,0}, b1 − b0 }
                                                                                             (17)
                       + 015
                          . × max{ AIME i − b1 ,0}
where b0 and b1 are the bend points. For the 1992 formula, b0 = $387 and b1 = $2,333.


44
   As opposed to a discounted present value of earnings, the summation is a straightforward summation of earnings
in a common base-year currency unit which is the concept employed by the Social Security Administration.
45
   The terminologies “husband” and “wife” are not literal. In particular, we call a single male respondent “husband”
and a single female respondent “wife.” Without this simplification, we need separate treatments for married and
single households. Under this generalization,   φ ih   = 1 and   φ iw = 0 for single-male households, and φ ih = 0 and
φ iw = 1 for single-female households.
46
   Social security benefits derived from the calculations in this section are not precise because the calculated AIME
may be smaller than the actual AIME and, conditional on AIME being correctly calculated, the calculated household
benefits may be larger than the actual ones. For the former, the reasons are (i) we do not exclude 5 years of lowest
earnings from calculation, (ii) we use base-year (i.e. real) values of earnings after age 60 instead of nominal values,
(iii) we do not take into account earnings in retirement if respondents work beyond their household retirement dates.
For the latter, the reason is that we assume both husband and wife of a married household are eligible for collecting
benefits at the household retirement date. If one of them is not eligible at the retirement date, the approximation will
overstate the benefits. Nevertheless, by virtue of having complete earnings histories for most individuals, our
calculations are considerably more accurate than those in other life-cycle simulation models of wealth accumulation.
47
   Without the lower bound of 40 years in the max operator (max{Ri – 22, 40}), AIME would be too high for
households whose members retire before age 62. In addition, notice that we use the household retirement date (Ri)
rather than the individual retirement date.
                                                               46
      (b) Calculate Household Annual Social Security Benefits
      First, the individual monthly social security benefits are calculated as
                                ssb i = max{d own
                                               i
                                                  PIA i , d spouse
                                                            i
                                                                   PIA i ' s spouse , ssx i }                                        (18)
                                           i
where i’s spouse = h (w) if i = w (h), d own  is the fraction of i’s PIA that i would get if i collected
                              i
benefits based on i’s PIA, d spouse is the fraction of PIA of i’s spouse that i would get if i collected
benefits based on PIA of i’s spouse, and ssx i is the monthly benefit that i would get if i collected
benefits based on PIA of i’s ex-spouse.48 Without loss of generality, for single-male households,
  h
d spouse = d own
             w
                 = d spouse
                     w
                            = ssx w = 0 , and d spouse
                                                w
                                                       = d own
                                                           h
                                                               = d spouse
                                                                   h
                                                                          = ssx h = 0 for single-female
households. In addition, we set ssx h = ssx w = 0 for married households because we do not have
any information to determine ssx i . Similarly, ssx i = 0 for any single households without
information to determine their ex-spouses’ PIA.
     Finally, household i’s annual social security benefits can be approximated as
                                           ssi = 12 × ( ssbih + ssbiw )                     (19)
which, for a married household, is the benefits the household would get when both the husband
and wife survive. When one of the spouses in a married household dies, the annual social
security benefits of the surviving spouse is
                                ssisurvive = 12 × max{d ownh
                                                              PIA h , d own
                                                                        w
                                                                            PIA w }         (20)
In other words, we approximate the surviving spouse’s benefits to be the higher of the husband’s
and wife’s benefits that they would be able to collect on the basis of their own earning histories
(which determine their PIAs) and the household retirement date (which determines the factors d).
This approximates the actual guideline of the Social Security Administration.

AII.2. Defined Benefit pension:
     The annual defined benefit (DB) pension benefit is estimated as
      db = DB h {β 0h + β 1hUNION h + β 2hYRSV h + (γ 0h + γ 1hUNION h + γ h2YRSV h }φ hR eR } +
               DB w {β 0w + β 1wUNION w + β 2wYRSV w + (γ 0w + γ 1wUNION w + γ 2wYRSV w }φ wR eR }                                   (21)
           + β b0 DB h DB w + ξ
where the superscripts h and w indicate “husband” and “wife,” respectively. DBi is a binary
variable equal to 1 if i has a DB pension. UNIONi is a binary variable equal to 1 if i belongs to a
union at the DB job. YRSSVi is the number of years that i stays in the DB job up to i’s retirement
date. eR is the household earnings in the last period of work, and φ hR and φ wR indicate the
fractions of eR that belong to the husband and wife, respectively, with φ hR + φ wR = 1 by
construction. ξ is an error term that is assumed to be distributed as N (0, σ ξ2 ) .49 Finally, the
parameters to be estimated are β b0 , β 0h , β 1h , β 2h , β 0w , β 1w , β 2w , γ 0h , γ 1h , γ h2 , γ 0w , γ 1w , γ 2w and σ ξ2 .

48
   To recover the ex-spouse’s PIA, we first compute the benefit amount that a single respondent would get based on
her own earning history. Then, we compare the amount to the reported amount of social security benefits in the first
wave that the respondent reported collecting the benefits. If the reported benefit amount is higher, we assume that
the single respondent collected benefits based on her ex-spouse’s records and the reported amount is used to recover
her ex-spouse’s PIA.
49
   The specification is estimated with ordinary least squares using the White formula for the standard error.
                                                                     47
     db is calculated by assuming that the household receives annual DB pension benefits that
are constant in real terms from the first period of retirement until none of the recipients survive.
In particular, let dbwealth be the observed present discounted value of db.
                                     D
                                            db                          D
                                                                           π
                        dbwealth = ∑ π j         ⇒ db = dbwealth ∑ j
                                       j = R +1   δj                       j = R +1   δj
where δ j is the discount rate that converts pension benefits at age j into an equivalent value of
1992 dollars (i.e. having δ j 1992-dollars at age j is as good as having one 1992 dollar in 1992),
and π j is the probability that the household will survive at age j conditional on surviving in the
year that dbwealth was reported, R is the last period of work, and D is a terminal age (the
household will not live beyond this age). The estimation results are given in Table A2.

AII.3. Out-of-Pocket Medical Expenses

        We construct household annual medical expenses based on the (HRS-imputed) answers
to the four medical expense questions asked in the 1998 and 2000 HRS. The four questions are:

        E10. About how much did you pay out-of-pocket for [nursing home/hospital/
        nursing home and hospital] bills [since R’s LAST IW MONTH, YEAR/in the
        last two years]?

        E18a. About how much did you pay out-of-pocket for [doctor/outpatient
        surgery/dental/doctor and outpatient surgery/doctor and dental/outpatient
        surgery and dental/doctor, outpatient surgery, and dental] bills [since R’s
        LAST IW MONTH, YEAR/in the last two years]?

        E21a. On the average, about how much have you paid out-of-pocket per month for
        these prescriptions [since R’s LAST IW MONTH, YEAR/in the last two years]?

        E24a. About how much did you pay out-of-pocket for [in-home medical
        care/special facilities or services/in-home medical care, special facilities or
        services] [since R’s LAST IW MONTH, YEAR/in the last two years]?

We construct household annual medical expenses as one-half of E10 + E18a + 24*E21a + E24a.
The 1996 and 1997 household annual medical expenses are calculated from the information from
the 1998 HRS and, similarly, the 1998 and 1999 household annual medical expenses are
calculated from the information from the 2000 HRS. The sample included is all households
(HRS, AHEAD, CODA, and WB) that participated in and retained marital statuses between the
1998 and 2000 HRS. The estimation results are given in Table A3.
