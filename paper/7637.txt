Why Do Temporary Help Firms Provide Free
General Skills Training?

JEL No. D82, J31


                                           ABSTRACT

     Nominally free, unrestricted training in portable computer skills is offered by the majority of
U.S. temporary help supply (THS) establishments, a practice that is inconsistent with the competitive
model of training. This paper asks why temporary help firms provide free general skills training. The
answer proposed is that in addition to skills formation, training plays an informational role at THS
firms by eliciting private information about worker ability. The model is built on the premise that
training is more productive and therefore valuable to high ability workers. Firms offer a package of
training and initially lower wages that induces self-selection. Workers of high perceived ability
choose training in anticipation of a steeper wage profile while low ability workers are deterred by
limited expected gains. Firms profit from their sunk training investment via their short-run
informational advantage about ability and thereby limited monopsony power. Market competition
among THS firms reduces employer rents, yielding higher wages and more training. Detailed tests
of the model using representative establishment data on wages and training find strong support. The
analysis demonstrates that beyond providing spot market labor, THS firms gather and sell
information about worker quality to clients. The rapid growth of THS as a labor market information
broker implies that the demand for worker screening is rising.

Introduction

    Open the help wanted pages of a local newspaper and you are likely to find prominent advertisements

from temporary help supply (THS) firms offering free skills training in subjects such as word processing,

data entry, and in some cases computer programming. Manpower, Inc., the nation’s largest THS

employer, estimates that it trains more than 100,000 temporaries per year in the use of office automation

software. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’s (BLS) 1994 Occupational Compensation Survey (OCS) of

Temporary Help Supply Services found that 89 percent of temporary workers are employed by

establishments that provide some form of nominally free skills training. While not all workers train, a

1994 survey by the National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services (NATSS) found that almost

one quarter of current THS workers had received skills training while temporaries (Steinberg, 1994).

Training stints are normally brief but not uniformly so. Close to half of those trained received 11 plus

hours of training, and a third received more than 20 hours. As Krueger (1993) reported and recent BLS

analysis confirms (U.S. Department of Labor, 1996), training is almost universally given “up-front” with

no explicit charge and no contractual requirement of past or continued employment.1

    While skills training expenditures by THS establishment are modest – estimated at 4 percent of the

wages paid to trainees in 1995 and 9 percent in 1997 – the puzzle they present to the competitive model of

training merits investigation for two major reasons.2 First, while Becker’s (1964) Human Capital model

predicts that firms will never bear the up-front cost of general skills training due to the threat of poaching

or hold-up, recent theoretical work challenges this notion. Models by Acemoglu and Pischke (1998 and

1999), Chang and Wang (1996), and Katz and Ziderman (1990) demonstrate that if employers hold

private information about worker ability, they will fund general skills training up-front and capture the

1
  Krueger’s (1993) survey found that only 4 percent of THS establishments charge workers explicitly for training. The BLS
Occupational Compensation Survey did not attempt to capture employee-paid training.
2
  Industry estimates place the average cost per trainee at $118 in 1995 and $150 in 1997 (NATSS, 1996b; NATSS, 1998). The 5 –
9 percent estimate of training costs relative to trainees’ wage-bill is based on the following rough calculation: industry
expenditures on specific skills training equaled 1.0 percent of the wage-bill in 1995 and 1.9 percent in 1997 (NATSS, 1998); and
a recent survey by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (1999) estimates that 18 percent of temporary help workers receive specific skills
training and a 1994 survey by the industry placed this figure at 24 percent. Assuming (of necessity) that wages and assignment
lengths for trainees and non-trainees are similar, training costs roughly equal 4 – 9 percent of the wage-bill of trainees. To the
degree that trainees work longer stints or are in higher wage occupations, this figure would be accordingly lower. Industry



                                                                1
returns ex post. Consistent with this hypothesis, several studies find that workers who receive general

training from their employers do not appear to pay the costs through lower training wages as the Becker

model predicts (cf., Bishop, 1996; Baron, Berger, and Black, 1997).3 Yet this evidence is far from

definitive because most employer-sponsored training consists of both general and specific components.

Furthermore, unobserved worker ability is likely to bias these studies against finding that trainees earn

less than their marginal product during training.

    By contrast, the skills training given by temporary help employers (primarily end user computer skills)

is necessarily general. Moreover, the direct costs of this training which include computer equipment,

instructional materials, and training staff, are borne by THS employers. Importantly, training is not

restricted to workers who have already taken paid assignments. Close to half (44 percent) of all skills

training is given “up front” to allow workers to qualify for their first assignments.4 Because of these

institutional arrangements, the THS sector provides a unique setting for exploring whether and why firms

pay for general skills training. The analysis below indicates that acquiring private information – in

particular, screening worker ability – is a primary motivation.

    Second and equally importantly, understanding the informational role played by employer-paid skills

training at THS firms suggests a resolution to a puzzle raised recently by many analysts of the U.S. labor

market (Katz and Krueger, 1999; Segal and Sullivan, 1997a; U.S. Department of Labor, 1995 and 1999):

what function do THS firms serve in the labor market and why are they growing so rapidly, accounting

for 10 percent of net job creation between 1990 and 2000?5 The answer proposed here is that in addition

to providing labor services, THS firms gather and sell information about worker quality to the market – a

role in which skills training figures prominently. Understood in this light, the escalating use of THS in the

U.S. labor market appears something more than an outgrowth of employers’ desire for flexibility. Rather,


training expense data estimates include costs of trainers, externally contracted training and certification, computer hardware and
software, and rent and utilities on space used for training.
3
  In a similar vein, Loewenstein and Spletzer (1998) show that training in off-site vocational courses, which typically provide
general skills training, increases wages with the current employer much less than wages with future employers.

                                                                 2
the emergence of THS as a labor market information brokers suggests that employer demand for worker

screening has increased dramatically.6

    To explore these ideas, the paper presents a simple information-based model of skills training as an

ability screen and performs detailed tests using an unusual data source: a restricted access BLS industry

survey of wages and training in the THS industry encompassing an estimated 19 percent of all THS

establishments and 36 percent of all THS workers as of 1994. The model is premised on the view that

training is more productive – and hence valuable – to high ability workers, where ability is defined as

an individual’s facility and motivation at learning job skills. Workers are assumed to have imperfect

prior knowledge of their ability while employers cannot initially perceive ability but observe it

through training. Because of the learning advantage possessed by high ability workers, firms are able

to offer a package of training and initially lower wages that induces self-selection. Workers of high

perceived ability choose firms offering training in expectation of wage gains in permanent

employment while low ability workers are deterred by lower wages and limited expected gains.

Firms profit from their training investment ex post via their short-run informational advantage about

ability and thereby limited monopsony power.

    The model further explores how firms may adjust wages and training to accommodate competitive

pressure as proxied by a ‘markup’ parameter. Counter to the standard framework, the model indicates that

THS firms will choose to provide more training to attract skilled workers as competitive conditions

tighten. The intuition for this result is that due to their limited monopsony power, firms maximize profits

by providing socially sub-optimal training – equating marginal firm benefits with costs while ignoring

gains accruing to workers. When heightened market competition requires firms to raise wages, they

therefore find it optimal to provide additional efficient training that increases both wages and output.

5
  Abraham and Taylor (1996), Autor (2000), Castro (1993), Golden and Appelbaum (1992), Houseman (1997), Mangum, Mayall
and Nelson (1985), Polivka (1996), and Segal and Sullivan (1997a) offer a variety of perspectives on the recent growth of THS
employment.
6
  One likely cause is the growth of unjust dismissal doctrine which has raised employer risks in terminating workers (Autor,
2000; Dertouzos and Karoly, 1992; Dertouzas et al., 1988; Krueger, 1991; Miles, forthcoming). Another is recent changes in the



                                                              3
Since trainees earn less on average than non-trainees, competition squeezes employer rents, narrowing the

wedge between training and non-training wages.

     These predictions find strong support in the data. Wages are lower at firms offering training by a

modest but statistically significant magnitude; heightened market competition, as measured by a

Herfindahl index, substantially increases firms’ propensity to offer free training; and, although training

grows with market competition, the wage gap between training and non-training firms contracts

significantly. These findings support the view that training plays an informational role in the THS market

and that THS firms serve this informational role in the broader labor market. More generally, the

prevalence of skills training at temporary help firms suggests that private information is a viable

explanation for why firms fund workers’ general human capital investments.

1.      The THS industry: context, skills training, and motivations

A. Context

     After 25 years of growth exceeding 11 percent annually, employment in the THS industry accounted

for 2.6 percent of U.S. daily employment in 2000, nine times its relative size in 1972. Additionally, given

turnover rates exceeding 350 percent (NATSS 1996a), the industry’s point in time employment is likely

to substantially understate the number of workers who have contact with it annually.7 While the sources

of the industry’s rapid growth are a subject of controversy, recent surveys of employers’ use of flexible

work practices identify two sources of demand. First, employers most frequently use THS workers to fill

short-term positions where the cost of searching for a temporary direct hire is likely to exceed the cost of

hiring through a THS agency. Second, firms often use THS arrangements to screen candidates for

permanent positions, a pattern especially prevalent among employers increasing their use of THS workers

(Ballantine and Ferguson, 1999; Houseman, 1997; Staffing Industry Review, 1998).

     Why workers choose THS employment is uncontroversial. Current Population Survey (CPS) and


organization of production that have increased the returns to selectivity in hiring (Acemoglu, 1999; Ballantine and Ferguson,
1999; Levy and Murnane, 1996).
7
  Houseman (1997) estimates that there are 7 to 8 times as many THS positions created annually as exist at a point in time. Using
unemployment insurance data from the state of Washington, Segal and Sullivan (1997b) find that 5.0 percent of all Washington
state workers were employed through THS firms at some point during 1993 and 1994.


                                                                4
industry data demonstrate that the large majority – about two thirds – of workers choose THS as a means

to find permanent work and/or to supplement income during job search, while the remaining third prefer

to stay in THS (Cohany, 1996 and 1998; Steinberg, 1994 and 1998). Because workers primarily work

only briefly in THS due to a lack of preferred alternatives, it is reasonable to think of the industry as

facing quasi-fixed short run labor supply.8 In the model below, I assume that workers supply labor

inelastically to the THS sector for a short period and then transition to permanent employment.

B. Skills training: Methods and policies

    Job skills required by THS firms (primarily typing and clerical) were essentially static and training

negligible until the proliferation of workplace computing technology generated demand for new and

rapidly shifting expertise that could be mastered quickly (Oberle, 1990). As is documented in Table 1,

training is now a pervasive industry feature. Of 1,002 U.S. THS establishments surveyed by the Bureau of

Labor Statistics (BLS) in 1994, 78 percent offered some form of skills training and 65 percent provided

computer skills training. Computerized tutorials are the most common form of instruction (82 percent),

while 52 percent of establishments provide workbook exercises and 45 percent provide classroom-based

training. While THS firms are prone to overstate the efficacy and depth of their training, evidence of its

value is found in the fact that several leading firms sell the same training software and courses to

corporate customers that they provide for free to their workers.9

    Almost without exception, training is given prior to or between assignments. Although workers train

on their own time, they attend classes and use facilities and materials provided by the THS firm free of

charge. As noted above, training is not restricted to workers who have already taken paid assignments.

Autor, Levy, Murnane, 1999 (ALM hereafter) report that 44 percent of all skills training is given “up

front” to allow workers to qualify for their first assignments. Trainees are not contractually bound to take


8
  Cohany (1998) reports that 60 of THS workers choose THS because it is the only type of work they can find, because they hope
it will lead to permanent employment, or because of an unspecified economic reason. According to the 1995 CPS Contingent
Work Supplement, only 16 percent of temporary workers had spent more than a year in their current assignment.
9
  For example, Manpower, Inc. charges its clients $150 per trainee per day to provide its SkillWare™ training on site. In 1996
and 1997, Manpower generated approximately $5 million annually in training revenues and trained about 35,000 workers in each
year (personal correspondence, Sharon Canter, Director of Strategic Communications, Manpower, Inc., 1998). Manpower also
states that 88 percent of Fortune 100 companies have engaged it to provide computer skills training.


                                                              5
or retain a job assignment afterwards, nor would such a contract be enforceable.

   As documented in Table 1, firms employ several training policies: managers select trainees (44

percent), clients request and fund training (46 percent), and, most prevalently, all volunteers are trained

(85 percent). Since policies are not mutually exclusive, one might assume that more restrictive policies

are applied to more valuable forms of training (e.g., computer skills). Yet, among establishments that

provide computer training exclusively and report only one training policy, 62 percent provide strictly

voluntary training. Hence, it appears that computer (and other) training is given primarily on an ‘as

requested’ basis.

C. Skills training: The Human Capital model

   These facts run counter to the Human Capital model of training (Becker, 1964). In the competitive

case analyzed by Becker, workers pay for general skills training by accepting a wage below their

marginal product during training. The threat of poaching or hold-up ensures that workers earn their full

post-training marginal product and hence up-front general skills training is not provided. By contrast,

THS firms routinely give training up-front during unpaid hours and hence the opportunity for workers to

defray costs through a contemporaneously lower training wage is essentially non-existent.

   While several alternative explanations for these facts are conceivable within the standard framework –

including skill-specificity, labor market monopsony, and low rates of worker turnover – none appears

relevant. On the first point, if skills provided are firm-specific and hence (by definition) have no outside

market value, firms may invest in training up-front and reap returns ex post. Yet, logically, THS firms

must – and do – train in skills broadly demanded by their many clients, i.e. general skills that have many

buyers. Limited worker mobility after training might also make up-front training profitable, for example if

THS firms effectively operated ‘company towns.’ Yet THS markets are generally not concentrated in a

conventional sense, with most localities served by multiple firms. Finally, it is a common assumption in

the literature that low employee turnover facilitates employer-sponsored general skills training since

workers are unlikely to depart after training (Blinder and Krueger, 1996; OECD, 1993). If this argument

is correct then THS establishments – where turnover averages several hundred percent – are an

                                                      6
improbable venue for training.

D. Skills training: Alternative motivations

     THS managers interviewed for this research primarily cited three motivations for training: worker

recruiting/screening and retention, quality differentiation, and skill development. These ideas are

discussed in turn.10

     Because turnover is high, recruiting at THS establishments is ongoing. Applicants to THS firms are

heterogeneous, often having short work histories, limited credentials, and recent spells of unemployment

(Houseman and Polivka, 1998; Segal and Sullivan, 1997a). While THS firms offer a variety of benefits to

attract workers, training is distinct because it is thought to differentially attract desirable workers.

Training facilitates recruitment and assessment in three ways: pre-training exams measure the skills that

workers possess; tests before and after training permit firms to gauge workers’ ability to absorb new

skills; and workers’ motivation to take training is itself considered an emblem of skill or desirability.11

These facts concord with numerous findings in the economics literature that suggest that training and

ability are complements. For example, Acemoglu and Pischke (1998), Altonji and Spletzer (1991), and

Bartel and Sicherman (1998) report that workers with higher skills as measured by standardized test

scores are more likely to receive training, even conditional on education.

     The view that training facilitates worker screening is also prevalent in the THS industry literature. For

example, the industry trade association’s guide How to Buy Temporary Help/Staffing Services offers this

advice to client firms:

        How are potential temporary employees screened and tested? Does the company offer any
        training programs? This may help you determine the “quality” of workers you receive.

A Manpower, Inc. advertisement to customers reads:

        Manpower offers our employees many ongoing training opportunities – at no charge. This
        helps them increase their marketability and wage earning potential. Plus, it helps Manpower

10
   Interviews were conducted with approximately two dozen THS executives. Additional fieldwork included performing site
visits to THS firms, undergoing skills training and testing with software and materials provided by various firms, registering as a
THS worker, and conducting a national survey of THS establishments (analyzed in Autor, Levy, and Murnane, 1999).
11
   In all cases the author observed, training began and ended with assessment. Firms can of course test without training and some
do. This is unlikely to be as informative about ability, however, because testing will not normally gauge either motivation or
facility at learning.


                                                                 7
      and Manpower Technical continue to attract and retain the best workers.

   In addition to worker screening, these quotations suggest a related motivation for training: retaining

high quality workers. This view is consistent with the formal notion that private information developed

during training binds workers to firms, making turnover unattractive. While, perhaps unsurprisingly, THS

managers do not name asymmetric information as central to worker retention, they describe personnel

policies consistent with it. Workers are normally first placed at lower wage, lower skill assignments and

given better placements as they demonstrate success. Workers who test and train successfully and

perform well at assignments advance more rapidly while workers who perform poorly are rarely offered

additional placements. Consequently, poor workers disproportionately turn over while good workers

frequently remain. At a point in time, the incumbent employer knows more about worker quality than its

competitors, potentially giving rise to limited monopsony power.

   It is important to observe that the THS market is characterized by vertical (quality) differentiation,

with competing firms offering differing packages of cost and service. In a differentiated market, firms

occupying the ‘high end’ niche may need to carefully screen workers to meet customer expectations while

‘low end’ firms may find it equally profitable to hire all comers and charge clients a lower fee

accordingly. As a rule, providing testing and training helps THS firms to develop a reputation for

quality.12 For example, an article in Purchasing states (Evans-Correia, 1991):

      Most buyers agree that testing and training do make a more reliable worker… Businesses
      will have to pay a premium for temporaries with extensive testing and training. But… ‘it’s
      worth it.’

    A final motivation for training is of course skill development. While in theory training could serve

only a signaling role as in Spence (1973), the evidence cited above suggests that workers do gain

marketable skills from the training experience.

    Results from ALM’s survey of THS establishments support these qualitative observations. Managers

of THS establishments rated the following as important motivations for offering free skills training:




                                                      8
demonstrating a commitment to quality to customers (81 percent); improving workers’ performance at

assignments (79 percent); and recruiting or retaining workers (75 percent). Asked about the role that skills

training plays in recruiting, a substantial majority reported that “offering training particularly attracts

applicants with strong motivation” (91 percent) and “good skills” (77 percent).13

2.      Model

A. Context

     This section formalizes the ideas above – self-selection, private information, and skill development –

into an illustrative model of training in the presence of private information and derives testable

implications. The model is related to work by Spence (1973), Salop and Salop (1976), and Acemoglu and

Pischke (1998 and 1999). Salop and Salop advanced the hypothesis that personnel policies may induce

self-selection among workers possessing private information about their characteristics, a hypothesis

tested in the context of employee pensions by Ipollito (1997).14 The model parallels Spence in that

workers signal private knowledge about ability by their willingness to engage in a costly activity (i.e.,

taking lower wages).15 However, unlike both Spence and Salop and Salop, the present model leverages

the notion that once incumbent employers have privately observed worker ability, they hold limited

monopsony power. The model’s monopsony component is related to Acemoglu and Pischke (1999: AP

hereafter) and for the reader’s convenience, I use their notation where possible.16

     The model differs from AP and other previous work in important respects. First, whereas AP view

training’s role as strictly one of increasing output, the current model offers a theory of training as a

screening device used by employers to induce self-selection among workers of different unobserved

ability. Second, while AP examine only the case where monopsony profits are restricted to zero, the


12
   Since customers rarely see the same THS worker twice, the expectation of quality is critical. For example, Mitchell Fromstein,
former CEO of Manpower Inc., is paraphrased in Oberle (1990) as saying, “… the training, even if it’s bestowed on an employee
only for a short period, helps build good client relationships and the organization collects on the good will over time.”
13
   Results are from a sample of 603 establishments with a response rate of 73 percent (438 interviews). Fifty-seven percent of
participants provide free skills training. For responses tabulated above, the category ‘agree’ combines ‘agree’ and ‘strongly
agree’, and conversely for disagreement. See Autor, Levy and Murnane (1999) for details.
14
   See Heckman and Sedlacek (1985 and 1990) for a richer treatment of self-selection equilibria in labor markets.
15
   Hence, the model posits an implicit market for training as in Rosen (1974).
16
   Gibbons and Katz (1991) also explore the role of private information in labor markets although outside the training context.


                                                                9
current model explores how monopsonistic firms may optimally adjust training to accommodate varying

competitive conditions. Each of the three empirical implications derived and tested below is unique to the

current model.

B. Environment

     The model is a repeated three period game.17 In the first period, THS firms hire workers and provide

general skills training. Period 1 employment and training are publicly observed. Consistent with the up-

front policies at THS firms, no production occurs during the training period and no contracts are signed

for post-training employment. At the end of the first period, competing THS firms may make wage offers

to attract trained or untrained THS workers. Workers who receive a superior wage offer accept it.

Additionally, for exogenous reasons, workers separate from their first period firm with probability λ . In

the second period, workers are assigned by their THS firms to client sites where they produce output.

Clients pay the THS firm an hourly ‘bill rate’ equal to the expected productivity of workers assigned to

them. Workers receive an hourly wage from the THS firm that may differ from the bill rate. In the third

period, workers are hired into the permanent sector.

     Workers may be of either two abilities, η ∈{H , L} , where without loss of generality, I

normalize H = 1 and L = 0 . The distribution of worker ability is given by the parameter ρ which is the

fraction of type L workers in the population, known to firms, workers and clients. A worker’s output at

the client site is given by f (η,τ ) = η (1 + τ ) where τ is the amount of general skills training provided by

the THS firm. This multiplicative specification embodies the observation that workers of high ability

benefit more from training.18 The training cost function c(τ ) is assumed everywhere strictly increasing,

convex and differentiable with c(0) = c ′(0) = 0, c ′(⋅) > 0, c ′′(⋅) > 0 and limτ →∞ c′(τ ) = ∞ . These

assumptions ensure that some training is socially optimal.19 Firms, clients and workers are risk neutral.


17
   The repeated game structure assures that firms adhere to their advertised policies. I assume that deviating firms are punished in
perpetuity by workers who follow a trigger strategy. Successive generations of the game overlap since a new pool of workers
enters in each period.
18
   Any concave function with positive cross-partial derivatives between training and ability would work equally well.
19
   The normalization L = 0 means that low ability workers should not receive any training. More generally, the model indicates
that high ability workers should receive more training than low ability workers.


                                                                10
There is no discounting and workers maximize income over the three periods. Worker utility is therefore

U i ( w1 , w2 , w3 ) = w1 + w2 + w3 where wt (assumed non-negative) is a worker’s wage in period (t).20

     The flow of asymmetric information about ability drives the model. To capture the idea that workers

hold initially superior information, I assume that workers are ex ante indistinguishable to firms but that

each worker receives at the outset an imperfectly informative signal β about his or her own ability

where β ∈ {h, l} . High ability workers are more likely to receive a type high signal than are low ability

workers but no worker learns his type with certainty and, of course, workers understand that the signals

are probabilistic. I refer to β as the worker’s beliefs. The probability that a worker is of a given ability

type (high or low) conditional on his beliefs is P (η = H | β = h) = δ h > (1 − ρ ) and

P (η = H | β = l ) = δ l < (1 − ρ ) where 1 > δ h > δ l > 0 . This strict inequality indicates that workers’ beliefs

are informative but not infallible.

     While firms cannot initially distinguish worker ability, a central observation above is that firms learn

about ability via training. In the model, THS firms performing training will observe worker ability fully in

period 1 (prior to placement) whereas non-training firms will not. Consistent with the survey evidence

indicating that clients use THS arrangements to screen for permanent positions, I lastly assume that ability

becomes public knowledge during the second period while workers are at client sites.21

     Based on this structure, I first analyze the partial equilibrium case in which there are two firms – a

training and non-training firm – earning unequal profits, and then generalize the model to explore how

free entry (and, hence, equalized profits) impact training provision.22

2.1       Partial equilibrium: the restricted entry case
     Depending on parameter values, the model can produce several equilibria: a pooling equilibrium in

20
   The non-negativity assumption is reasonable in light of the fact that a majority of THS workers are likely to be capital
constrained (cf., Cohany, 1996 and 1998).
21
   These assumptions are stated in their strongest form. All that is required is that workers have superior initial information about
their ability and that, after hire, incumbent THS employers improve their informational position via training relative to outside
THS employers. Whether workers also update their beliefs is not consequential to the results.
22
   While I do not explicitly model here why permanent sector firms use THS workers, the extension is immediate. If permanent
sector firms cannot costlessly terminate workers (or renegotiate wages) after observing ability, they will prefer to use THS



                                                                 11
which all workers prefer not to train and hence none is offered; a pooling equilibrium in which all

workers prefer training and receive it; and a separating equilibrium in which workers with high ability

beliefs prefer training while those with low beliefs do not. This third case gives rise to a heterogeneous

training environment in which a subset of firms provide training. This is the equilibrium of empirical

relevance and it is analyzed below. Alternative equilibria are discussed in section A of the Appendix.

A. Wages at the separating equilibrium

      Working backwards from the separating equilibrium, I assume initially that there are two THS firms,

one offering training and the other not. Label these Firms 1 and 0 respectively ( F ∈ {1,0} ). Subsequently,

I derive the conditions that support worker separation by ability. Starting with the final (third) period, it is

immediate that workers’ permanent sector wages are set according to individual ability (publicly observed

in period 2) and training received (publicly observed during period 1).

(1)        wi ,3 (ηi , τ i ) = ηi (1 + τ i )

      Wages in period 2 will be set by competition among THS firms for labor. A firm that wishes to retain

a given worker in the second period must pay at least her opportunity wage. This opportunity wage is

determined by the expected productivity of workers that separate from their period 1 firm for a given

wage offer. The expected productivity of separators, denoted by ν (τ ) , is given by their expected ability

and training received:

(2)        ν (τ ) = E (η λ ) ⋅ (1 + τ ) .

      At the separating equilibrium, Firm 0’s applicant pool is composed exclusively of low ability belief

workers. Because it does not observe actual worker ability during period 1, Firm 0 deploys all applicants

to client sites in period 2 except for the fraction λ that turns over exogenously. Since Firm 0’s separators

are a representative subset of applicants and have not received any skills training, it follows that

w 2 ( 0) = ν ( 0) = δ l .

      At the training firm, the applicant pool contains only high ability belief workers. Given that beliefs are


arrangements to perform prior screening and to fill short duration positions where the expected labor plus termination costs


                                                               12
not fully informative, a fraction of these (1 − δ h ) are of low ability.23 Observe that because applicants are

ex ante indistinguishable, Firm 1 will provide the same training to each. After training, the firm loses λ

of its period 1 recruits to exogenous turnover. In addition, it will use its private information about ability

acquired during training to remove unproductive workers. Workers of low ability are offered a wage of

zero, their revealed productivity. Since some high ability workers have turned exogenously, all low ability

workers also separate to pool with the exogenous departures. Consequently, Firm 1 separators are a

mixture of exogenous departures of expected ability δ h and endogenous departures, all of low ability

( η = 0 ). Substituting into (2), outside firms will assess the expected productivity of Firm 1 separators as:

                       λδ h (1 + τ )
(3)        ν (τ ) =                     .
                      λδ h + (1 − δ h )

      This equation has three implications. First, because outside THS firms cannot distinguish exogenous

from endogenous Firm 1 separators, all Firm 1 separators workers command a wage of only ν (τ ) .

Second, because training only benefits high ability workers, wages in the outside market for Firm 1

separators rise less than one-for-one with training (observe that ν ′(τ ) < 1 ). Third, because Firm 1

privately observes each worker’s ability during training, it will counter any wage offered to its workers

except a wage that exceeds their productivity. Poaching is therefore unattractive. Accordingly, Firm 1

need only pay second period wages of w2 (τ ) = ν (τ ) , although all retained workers are of high ability.24

      A key result of this information structure, visible from (3), is that high ability trainees receive less than

their marginal product during period 2. How much less? A comparison of ν (τ ) and ν (0) reveals that

wages at Firm 1 may well be lower than at Firm 0, even though ability and training are both higher. This

result follows from the fact that it is not productivity that sets wages at Firm 1 but rather the degree of

adverse selection in the outside market. I return to this result below.



exceed the cost of a THS arrangement (including the markup as below).
23
   Hence at a separating equilibrium, workers and firms are equally informed of each workers’ ability belief since only high belief
workers apply to training firms and only low belief workers apply to non-training firms. Actual ability, however, is observed only
by the training firm in the subsequent period.
24
   See section B of the Appendix for a more detailed proof.


                                                                13
B. Client revenue and profit maximization

      Since training is publicly observable and population parameters are commonly known, a client’s

willingness to pay for THS workers from a given firm is simply the expected productivity of workers

retained into the second period. The firm’s bill rate, R (τ ) , will equal this expectation in equilibrium:

(4)        R (τ ) = E (η ) ⋅ (1 + τ ) .

It is immediate that R (0) = w(0) = δ l and R (τ ) = (1 + τ ) .

      Substituting Firm 1’s bill rate into its objective function and using ν (τ ) for w2 (τ ) yields:

(5)        max π = (1 − λ )δ h [R (τ ) − ν (τ )] − c(τ ) − w1    s.t. w1 ≥ 0
            w1 ,τ



Firm 1 chooses wages and training τ * to maximize profits and the first order condition for training is:

(6)        c′(τ * ) = (1 − λ )δ h [1 −ν ′(τ )], w1 = 0

This condition will be satisfied at τ * > 0 (and therefore π * > 0 ) since R′(τ ) = 1 , ν ′(t ) < 1 and c′(0) = 0 .

Hence, although training is provided ‘up-front,’ Firm 1 is able to recoup its investment ex post by

capitalizing on its informational advantage developed during training.25

C. Conditions for worker separation

      For workers to separate by ex ante ability beliefs, wages and training must satisfy the participation and

separating constraints – the conditions under which high type workers are recruited to firm 1 while low

type workers decline to apply there. Workers will apply to the firm where expected utility, the sum of

periods 1, 2 and 3 wages, is highest conditional on prior beliefs.

      For high ability belief workers, this implies a participation constraint of δ hτ * > ν (0) −ν (τ * ) . High

type workers apply to Firm 1 even if wages are as much as δ hτ * lower there because training yields an

expected wage gain of δ hτ * in period 3. For low ability belief workers, the separating constraint is

analogous but the inequality is reversed and δ l replaces δ h : δ lτ * < ν (0) − ν (τ * ) . Low belief workers will



25
  Note that in this two firm case, first period (training) wages are zero although they may be positive in the free entry case
explored below.


                                                                 14
also accept a lower wage at the training than non-training firm. Critically, since high belief workers gain

more in expectation from training, they will accept a larger period 2 wage deficit at the training firm.

      Combining these inequalities gives the necessary and sufficient condition for worker separation:

(7)        δ hτ * > ν (0) − ν (τ * ) > δ lτ *

In words, at a separating equilibrium, the expected period 3 wage gain for high belief workers offsets (at a

minimum) their training wage penalty in period 2, while the opposite is true for low ability belief

workers. Notice that a necessary implication of (7) is that ν (0) − ν (τ * ) > 0 . Wages at the training firm are

lower than at the non-training firm, an implication tested empirically below.

      We can characterize wages and self-selection in the labor market when (7) is satisfied. All high ability

belief workers are recruited to Firm 1 where they receive up-front training τ * in period 1, wage ν (τ * ) in

period 2, and wage ηi (1 + τ * ) in period 3, where ηi = 1 with probability δ h and 0 otherwise. All low

ability belief workers are recruited to Firm 0 where they receive no training in period 1, a wage of v(0) in

period 2, and a wage of ηi in period 3 where ηi = 1 with probability δ l and 0 otherwise.26 Note that these

results are only a partial equilibrium, however, inasmuch as entry is restricted to two firms and profits are

not equalized between them.27 These strictures are inessential and I relax them in the next section.

      Returning momentarily to the institutional details of THS employment, these private information

based results appear reasonable in a labor market with a relative abundance of new entrants, recent job

losers, and individuals with extended time out of the labor force and/or limited labor force attachment.

THS managers interviewed for this research were skeptical of workers’ resumes and relied on assessment

and demonstrated performance via job training and job placements to draw judgments. There is little

question that incumbent THS employers develop a better informational position regarding worker ability

than do outside buyers.


26
   It bears emphasis that for the separating equilibrium to occur, workers’ prior ability beliefs must not be fully informative. If
workers knew their ability with certainty, no low ability workers would apply to Firm 1 implying no informational monopsony
would be present in period 2 and hence no up-front training would be given in period 1. Up-front training must therefore generate
private information for firms to find it profitable.
27
   Specifically, Firm 1 earns positive profits while Firm 0 does not.


                                                                15
2.2     Equilibrium: The impact of competition on training and wages
      In this section, I relax the maintained restrictions on entry and profitability to explore the comparative

statics of training and wages under a range of market conditions proxied here by a profit parameter. This

parameter, π ≥ 0 , will equal the minimum per-worker profit or ‘markup’ demanded by each incumbent or

entrant THS firm including any firm engaged in poaching.28 This reservation profit parameter may arise

in several contexts, for example from a fixed cost of market entry that serves as a profit floor as in Salop

(1979) or from Cournot competition among market incumbents (cf. Tirole, 1988, section 5.5). In the

empirical work ahead, I use a Herfindahl index to proxy market conditions and hence either interpretation

is natural.29

      For the remainder of the analysis, I allow an unspecified number of training and non-training firms,

which I refer to as firms of Types 1 and 0. I continue to assume that (7) is satisfied, i.e., the separating

equilibrium holds. Competition and/or entry will ensure that per-worker profits are reduced to π at each

firm and further that all firms of a given type employ the same wage and training policies. Since firms

compete for both workers and clients, competition could arise in the product or labor market or both. To

simplify, I maintain the assumption that clients pay expected productivity and hence the locus of

competition is the labor market. An important assumption is that while competition dissipates rents

arising from asymmetric information, it does not dispel asymmetric information directly since firms must

continue to test and train to observe ability.

A. Equilibrium wages under multiple entry

      We can recalculate firms’ wage policies in light of these conditions. At non-training firms, the

minimum profit requirement is simply reflected in a debit to the wage of each worker:

(8)        v(0, π ) = δ l − π


28
  For non-training firms, the markup is earned on workers deployed to the client site since these firms make zero gain or loss on
workers that turn over in period 1. For training firms, the markup will equal the average per-worker difference between client
receipts and total costs (wages plus training) for all trainees, including those lost to turnover. If, instead, the profit metric
excluded separators, training firms could make net losses even while earning positive ‘profits,’ which would not be an
equilibrium.




                                                               16
Since Type 0 firms hire all comers and pay ex ante expected productivity, this wage policy generates

profits equal to the profit floor and cannot be profitably poached. Note that if wages are specified in

logarithms, π is simply a percentage markup of the bill rate over the wage.

      Outside wages for Firm 1 separators will now be determined by the expected productivity of

separators minus the markup:

                             λδ h (1 + τ π )
(9)        ν (τ π , π ) =                     −π
                            λδ h + (1 − δ h )

Notice that the profit parameter enters the outside wage function twice: directly because, in equilibrium,

firms hiring separators must receive the reservation profit; and indirectly, because firms’ training levels,

τ π , must respond to changes in π . Whereas Type 1 firms previously chose training via an unconstrained

profit maximization, they now choose training to maximize worker utility (i.e., the sum of workers wages

over three periods) subject to the minimum profit constraint, π . Substituting (1) for period 2 wages and

(9) for period 3 wages in the worker’s utility function, we have the firm’s maximization:

           max E ( w1 + w2 + w3 | β = h, F = 1) = w1 + ν (τ , π ) + δ hτ
            w1 ,τ
(10)
                      s.t. (1 − λ )δ h [(1 + τ ) − ν (τ , π )] − c(τ ) − w1 ≥ π , w1 ≥ 0

Observe that if a firm failed to maximize worker utility for a given profit level, a competitor – also

making profits π but offering a preferred combination of wages and training – would attract all high

ability belief workers.

B. Comparative statics

      Solving (10) for τ π , the firm’s optimal training choice given π , yields the following expression for

training as a function of reservation profits and worker ability:

                         é                      é      λδ h         ù                               ù
           c(τ π ) = min ê(1 + τ π )(1 − λ )δ h ê1 −                ú − π [1 − (1 − λ )δ h ], c(τ ) ú
                                                                                                 **

where τ ** is defined as the training level that maximizes social output during the remaining two periods

29
  More generally, as is well known, firms facing a constant elasticity of product demand (or labor supply) will optimally set
prices (wages) at a price-cost markup (markdown) inversely proportional to this elasticity. If, plausibly, added market


                                                                17
and hence satisfies c ′(τ ** ) = 2δ h . Totally differentiating (11) and rearranging yields:

                 ì (1 − (1 − λ )δ h )
          d τ π ï−                      <0        τ * ≤ τ π < τ **
(12)           = í c′(τ π ) − c ′(τ * )
          dπ ï
                 î          0                     elsewhere

where c′(τ * ) is given by (6). As is shown in section C of the Appendix, this derivative is negative,

implying that heightened competition (i.e., a fall in π ) generates an increase in training so long as

training is not already at the social optimum, τ ** (an unlikely case).

     The intuition for this result is visible in Figure 1 which plots the marginal cost of skills training against

the marginal gain to revenue, apportioned between worker wages and firm profits according to the

adverse selection condition set by (3). In the unconstrained profit maximizing case, the firm chooses

training to equate marginal training cost with marginal private gain, depicted as point τ * in the figure,

while ignoring the wage benefits accruing to workers. Training is therefore socially suboptimal. Now

consider a case where, in response to competition, the firm wishes to increase workers’ earnings by the

area A-B-C-D. One response is for the firm to pay A-B-C-D out of profits. Alternatively, the firm can

increase training from τ * to τ ** , thereby raising earnings equivalently but at cost A-C-D, which is strictly

less than A-B-C-D. Because the firm is able to provide additional training at an expense below the

combined marginal benefit to firm and worker, it necessarily chooses to provide more training when

competition requires it to raise wages.30

     The second key comparative static result is that wages rise with competition. Wages at non-training

firms rise one-for-one with competition as is seen by differentiating (8) with respect to the markup:

∂ν (0,π ) ∂π = − 1 . By contrast, wages at training firms move more than one-for-one with the markup

since competition induces wage changes both directly through π and indirectly through τ π :




competition increases this elasticity, firms will reduce their markups (markdowns) accordingly.
30
 By an application of the envelope theorem, it is shown in section D of the Appendix that at   τ * , the net cost of increasing
wages by a small amount through additional training is zero.


                                                               18

Recall, however, that in the separating equilibrium, wages at training firms are below those of non-

training firms. Hence, a third implication is that the predicted effect of competition is to limit the rents

firms extract from workers, narrowing the wedge between training and non-training wages.

     To close the model, note finally that first period (training) wages at Type 1 firms can be positive under

some market conditions. Specifically, solving (11) for Type 1 firms’ first period wage yields:

(14)                          [
          w1 (τ π ,π ) = max 0, π (1 − (1 − λ )δ h ) + c′(τ * )(1 + τ ** ) − c(τ ** )   ]
Although this wage is zero for most parameter values, if per-worker profits exceed π when training is at

its social optimum, Type 1 firms will disgorge excess earnings by paying positive training wages.31

C. Empirical implications

     In the subsequent sections, I test the three major predictions of the model. First is the proposition from

(7) that wages (for comparable jobs) pay less at training firms than non-training firms, a ‘separating’

condition necessary for training to yield self-selection by ability. The second prediction explored is

whether in response to market competition, firms provide more free skills training. Finally, I ask whether

wage gains spurred by competition are comparatively larger for workers at training than non-training

firms. Each of these theoretical predictions receives empirical support. I also discuss alternative

interpretations and provide supplementary evidence using survey data from ALM.

3.      Data description

     The BLS Occupational Compensation Survey of Temporary Help Supply Services (OCS hereafter)

provides a unique data source for analyzing the relationships among wages, training, and competition at

temporary help establishments.32 Conducted in 1994, the survey enumerates employment, wages, training

offerings, and training policies at 1,033 temporary help establishments in 104 Metropolitan Statistical

31
  The THS establishment survey performed by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (1999) captured several examples of THS
establishments paying positive wages during training, typically at the rate of $1 per hour.



                                                                  19
Areas (MSAs), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) or non-metropolitan counties throughout

the U.S (which, for brevity, are referred to as MSAs). An establishment is defined as all outlets of a firm

in an MSA and may encompass multiple offices. Thirty-eight percent of establishments belong to firms

residing in multiple regions. The sample comprises an estimated 19 percent of all THS establishments

employing 20 or more temporary workers in 1994 and 34 percent of all THS employment.33

   Surveyed establishments provided data for a payroll reference month on the hourly wage of assigned

THS workers classified into 47 detailed technical, clerical, blue collar, and service occupations. For

brevity, I refer to the first three of these groups as white collar, clerical/sales, and blue collar respectively.

Service occupations (3.9 percent of the sample) were excluded from the analysis because they do not

normally receive training, as were observations where occupation was unspecified, leaving 333,888

observations at 1,002 establishments.34

   In addition to wages and job titles, the primary component of the survey used below is detailed

information collected on skills training subjects and policies summarized in Table 1. Respondents

reported whether they offer skills training to each ‘collar’ in 8 subject categories: word processing, data

entry, computer programming languages, workplace rules and on the job conduct, customer service skills,

interview and resume development skills, communications skills, and other. I focus here on computer

skills because they are well defined, hold market value, and clearly constitute general skills training.

   Training policies were categorized as: all workers receive some training; workers volunteer;

establishment selects workers for training; and clients request and pay for training. Multiple responses

were permitted. Unlike the training subject data, these policies refer to the entire establishment rather than

workers in a collar. If a firm specifies multiple training policies, it cannot normally be determined which

32
   The author was permitted supervised access to this confidential BLS survey under the auspices of the BLS Student Volunteer
Program.
33
   Franchises of a firm are counted as independent establishments. The mean number of establishments owned by multi-region
firms is 7.9 with a standard deviation of 14.2. Confidentiality requirements prevent disclosure of the range of establishments
owned by multi-region firms. The survey universe includes only establishments with 20 plus workers. It is likely that
establishments with fewer workers provide a negligible share of THS employment.
34
   Inclusion of service occupations changes none of the substantive results. White collar occupations include professional
specialty, technical occupations, accountants and executive, administrative, and managerial occupations. Clerical occupations
include marketing, sales, and clerical and administrative support occupations. Blue collar occupations include precision



                                                              20
policy applies to what subjects and/or worker groups. For purposes of the empirical work, I combine the

‘all workers trained’ category with the ‘workers volunteer’ category into a ‘all/volunteers’ category

because it is apparent that many establishments that report training all workers actually train all workers

who volunteer. Since the majority (62 percent) of firms that checked the ‘all’ category also checked the

‘volunteers’ category, this decision had little impact on the substantive results. Firms that did not report

any training subjects (or only reported ‘other’) were coded as non-training firms, and firms that offered

training only to a specific collar(s) were coded as non-training firms for the collar(s) that they do not

train.35 The data do not enumerate which workers receive what training or what fraction is trained. To

account for the pairing of individual worker wage data with establishment level training data, I use

Huber-White standard errors with a clustering correction throughout. For further discussion of the OCS

survey, see U.S. Department of Labor, 1996.36

4.      Empirical results

     As is seen in Table 1, the vast majority – 78 percent – of temporary help establishments provide skills

training to their workers. Sixty-five percent of establishments provide computer skills training while 70

percent train in the ‘soft skills’ listed in the previous section. While these figures are weighted by BLS

national probability weights, the picture of extremely prevalent skills training at temporary help

establishments is unaltered by using unweighted, area-weighted, or employment-weighted frequencies.

4.1    Are wages lower at training establishments?
     For up-front skills training to induce self-selection by perceived ability, wages at training firms must

be lower than at non-training firms. Table 2 displays summary wage data for the 333,888 worker wage

observations used in the sample: 23,531 in white collar, 174,344 in clerical/sales, and 136,013 in blue


production, craft and repair, machine operators, assemblers, and inspectors, transportation and material movement occupations,
and helpers, handlers, and equipment cleaners. See BLS (1996) for corresponding SIC codes and job descriptions.
35
   Hence, for example, if a firm had a ‘client requests/pays’ policy and offered exclusively word processing skills to clerical
workers, it would be coded as having a ‘no training’ policy for white and blue collar workers.
36
   Two sets of BLS supplied probability sampling weights, national and area (MSA), are used for the analysis. Wage models use
national weights to approximate the U.S. THS wage distribution while models of the relationship between THS market
concentration and skills training or wages use area weights since the MSA is hypothesized as the relevant market. For some
analyses, I also employ regional and occupational employment data from the February 1995 Current Population Survey (CPS)
Contingent Worker Supplement, the CPS 1994 Outgoing Rotation Group files (ORG), and the Census 1990 IPUMS 1 percent
sample (cf. Ruggles and Sobeck et al., 1997). All CPS and Census data are weighted by sampling weights.


                                                              21
collar occupations. For reference, the last two columns provide wage means for THS workers from the

CPS February 1995 Contingent Worker Supplement (deflated to 1994 dollars) and wage means for all

hourly workers from the CPS 1994 Outgoing Rotation Groups. There is close agreement between the

OCS and CPS estimates for blue collar and clerical occupations. While the match is less precise for white

collar occupations, this is likely due to a small CPS wage sample for this group (n = 55).

A. Wage differentials between training and non-training establishments

   Before turning to regression estimates, Table 3 provides a bivariate comparison of mean wages at

training and non-training establishments in the 9 major occupational groups in the sample (3 in white

collar, 2 in clerical/sales, 4 in blue collar). The comparison is striking. In 8 of 9 occupations, mean wages

are lower at training establishments, with an average occupational wage difference of minus 6.4 log

points. Of course, these comparisons do not account for regional and occupational wage differences. To

control for these factors, I estimate the following equation:

(e1)    Wijk = α + δT j + γE j + Oi + Rk + ε ijk

where Wij is the natural logarithm of hourly wages of individual (i) at establishment (j) in MSA (k). T j is

a vector of establishment training variables, E j is a vector of establishment characteristics, Oi is a vector

of occupation indicators, R jk is a vector of MSA indicators, and ε ijk is a random error term assumed to be

composed of a person specific and establishment specific component. Given this error structure, (e1) is

estimated with Huber-White standard errors that allow for clustering at establishments. The parameter of

interest is δ , the wage differential at training establishments. Due to the inclusion of narrow MSA and

occupation indicators, δ effectively measures wage differentials among local THS establishments

potentially competing for the same workers and supplying labor to the same customers.

   Table 4 presents wage models for the full sample. The first column includes an indicator variable that

is equal to one if the establishment provides training and 8 major occupational indicators corresponding to

the occupational groups in Table 3 (a 9th is omitted). The coefficient on the training dummy indicates that

wages at training establishments are 3.4 log points lower than at non-training establishments. The second


                                                      22
column adds 103 MSA indicators to the model, reducing the training effect to 1.9 log points. The third

column replaces the major occupation indicators with 40 detailed occupation indicators, further reducing

the training coefficient to 1.6 log points which remains marginally significant (p = .08).

     While these results point in the predicted direction, they mask heterogeneity among training policies.

Although providing training to all workers who volunteer is the most commonplace policy (Table 1),

managers and/or clients also individually select trainees at 45 percent of establishments. It is not clear that

the screening model developed above should apply to these latter cases since access to training is not

governed by self-selection. Hence, in columns (4) – (6) of Table 4, I estimate wage models that allow

wage differentials to vary by training policy.

     The disaggregated estimates found in Table 4 columns (4) – (6) indicate that the negative wage impact

of employment at a training establishment is primarily accounted for by the ‘all/volunteers trained’

policy. The base specification in column (4) finds an estimated wage effect at ‘all/volunteers’

establishments of –3.4 log point. The ‘firm selects’ policy has an insignificant wage impact of 0.9 log

points, and the ‘client requests/pays’ policy has a marginally significant impact of –2.7 log points. After

conditioning on 103 region indicators in column (5) and detailed occupational controls in column (6), the

‘all/volunteers’ point estimate remains highly significant at –2.5 log points. The ‘client requests’ and

‘firm selects’ policies coefficients hover near zero and are not significant.37

B. Fixed effects estimates

     The wage differentials estimated above do not reflect ‘training wages’ in the conventional sense. Since

workers take training during non-work hours, estimated differentials must reflect either pre- or post-

training wages, or a combination of the two.38 A potential alternative reading, however, is that

establishments providing ‘all/volunteer’ training pay lower wages not due to training but due to other


37
   Wage models also include controls for the log of establishment size (measured by reference month employment within-collar)
and market size (measured by reference month MSA-collar THS employment), both of which are positively correlated with
establishment training propensity and in the case of establishment size negatively correlated with wages.
38
   As noted in the data description, wage observations reported in the OCS survey are assignment wages. Since an estimated 44
percent of training is given to allow workers to qualify for their first assignment (ALM, 1999), roughly half of wage observations
in the data are likely to reflect pre-training rather than post-training wages assuming that employment spells are of similar length
between the two groups.


                                                                23
amenities offered or unobserved (negative) quality differences correlated with training. One can partially

explore this objection using a fixed effects strategy. As noted above, 38 percent of sampled

establishments belong to multi-region firms, many of which do not offer uniform training across

establishments. This within-firm variation permits inclusion of fixed effects that remove each firm’s mean

wage ‘policy,’ thereby controlling for differences in quality or amenities prevailing firm wide.

Accordingly, the fixed effects models identify average occupational pay differentials across training and

non-training establishments belonging to the same firm.39

     To perform these estimates, I limit the sample to workers of multi-region establishments, leaving 50

firms, 395 establishments, and 201,314 worker observations. Column (1) of Table 5 presents the single

training indicator specification excluding firm fixed effects and including major occupation indicators.

The point estimate for the training variable is –5.5 log points. This coefficient does not prove robust to

inclusion of detailed occupation controls, however. Following the previous discussion, I next disaggregate

the training indicator into three policy categories. As with the pooled estimates above, it is the

‘all/volunteers’ policy that appears responsible for the negative training-wage relationship. Conditional on

detailed controls, the all/volunteers policy remains significantly negative at –3.7 log points. Even within

individual firms, only those establishments offering unrestricted skills training are found to pay lower

wages than their local competitors.40

     Models were also estimated separately by collar and by major occupation (9 total) using both pooled

and fixed effects models. Estimates of the by-collar models are found in Appendix Table A.41 These


39
   This strategy will clearly fail to solve the unobservables problem if there remain differences in quality or amenities that covary
with training across establishments belonging to the same firm. At a minimum, however, the fixed effects estimates provide an
important robustness test of the pooled estimates.
40
   A limitation of the estimates is that most of the standard ‘observables’ such as race, gender, education, and experience are
absent. Despite this absence, R-squared values range from 0.50 to 0.70 for detailed models, about 40 to 50 percent higher than
standard CPS cross-sectional wage regressions. One explanation for this substantial explanatory power is that the missing
variables (especially education) are well proxied by occupational controls – or, that these observables’ impacts on wages are
largely mediated by occupation. Given the standardized occupational titles supplied by THS firms, there may be only limited
additional payoff to education and experience once detailed occupation (and, implicitly, four digit industry) is controlled.
41
   Fixed effects estimates of policy dummies for white collar workers are difficult to interpret due to implausibly large (but in
most cases statistically insignificant) coefficients. These odd results are partly explained by collinearity among policy dummies
within the white collar sub-sample that makes identification of the specific policy impacts tenuous. At only 8 firms do policies
vary across establishments conditional on training being provided. While further limiting the sample to these 8 firms yields
somewhat more stable estimates, I conclude that the wage impacts for the white collar fixed-effects sample are not identified.


                                                                 24
disaggregated results confirm that the negative training wage relationship is pervasive among blue collar

and clerical occupations, is driven by ‘up-front’ training policies, and is comparable in magnitude to the

pooled occupation results above. White collar estimates generally find an insignificantly negative

training-wage relationship.42

    While unobserved negative selection on ability at training establishments could give rise to similar

patterns, this does not appear likely. For example, ALM report that establishments offering skills training

are substantially more selective in hiring THS workers than non-training establishments. In particular,

holding occupation constant, training establishments are significantly more likely than competing non-

training establishments in the same MSAs to require a high school diploma (19%), previous experience

(14%), previous training or skills certification (25%), and good English or verbal skills (15%).43 As noted

earlier, THS personnel interviewed for this research uniformly suggested that firms offering training

attract more able and motivated workers, an idea bolstered by econometric evidence indicating that

workers of greater ability – observed and unobserved – receive more training. These facts suggest that

unobserved selection works against a finding of a negative training-wage relationship.

C. Magnitudes

    While robust, it remains to ask whether the estimated wage differentials are plausible and

economically significant. While these differentials are modest (–3 to –5 log points), rough calculations

suggest that they are of a reasonable magnitude. For example, data sources cited in the introduction

indicate that industry expenditures on training were equal to 1.0 percent of the wage-bill in 1995. Using

the estimate from the OCS data that 73 percent of workers were employed at establishments providing

training, this would imply a break-even wage differential of 1.4 percent for all skills training, a figure that

should be compared to columns (1) – (3) of Tables 4 and 5.

    Providing a cost estimate by policy is more difficult since industry expenditures are not tabulated in


42
   Wage differentials estimated by major occupation indicate that training is associated with lower wages in 6 of 9 major
occupations, an effect primarily attributable to the ‘all/volunteers’ policy. When training subject dummies (corresponding to the 7
training areas) were included in the models, they were not as a group significant. Policy variables were robust to their inclusion.
43
   All estimates are significant at the 5 percent level or better. Estimates are converted from percentage points in ALM, Table 12
to percent above.


                                                                25
this manner and policies are not mutually exclusive. On the assumption that most training costs accrue to

the all/volunteers policy and further that training policies apply to equal subsets of workers at each

establishment, I estimate that 52 percent of workers are impacted by voluntary training policies.44 Under

this scenario, a break-even wage differential for the all/volunteers policy would be 1.9 percent, which

may be compared to the estimates in columns (4) – (6) of Tables 4 and 5. Both of these estimates fall

within the lower bound of the estimated wage differentials. One should bear in mind that the model does

not imply training establishment wage differentials will equal training expenses. Rather, the model

requires that workers are compensated for this differential by wage gains in permanent employment.

     This last point underscores that an ideal data source would permit an estimate of the hypothesized

wage gains that trainees receive upon entering the permanent sector. Although panel data on the wages

and training of THS workers do not to the author’s knowledge exist, survey data from ALM provide

evidence on a closely related question: do workers at training establishments find permanent placements

with greater frequency than other THS workers? Since panel data on individual earnings indicate that

wages typically increase by 10 to 20 percent upon exiting the THS sector (Segal and Sullivan, 1998), a

greater hiring rate out of training establishments would indicate greater expected wage gains for workers

at training establishments.

     THS establishments surveyed by ALM were asked the following question, “Of the workers [within the

establishment’s largest occupation category] who worked at an assignment last month, about what

percentage were hired by a customer last month?” A regression of their responses on occupation main

effects, MSA dummies, an indicator variable for whether or not the firm provides free training and an

intercept yields the following estimate (standard errors are in parentheses):




44
   In other words, if an establishment has three training policies, I assume that each applies to one-third of workers. It is realistic
to assume that the all/volunteers policy accounts for the majority of training expenses since training paid by the client is not
included in industry estimates and training in which the firm selects trainees is likely to be a substantially smaller share of
training. Note also that the calculation above does not imply that 52 percent of workers receive voluntary training – only that 52
percent of workers are at training establishments and covered by this policy. Since the Table 4 and 5 models estimate
establishment level training differentials, the 52 percent figure is the relevant number for calculating the ‘break-even’ differential.


                                                                  26
(e2)    Percent Hired = 8.34 + 6.07*Free Training - 0.49*Clerical/Sales - 1.51*White Collar
                        (2.42) (2.00)              (2.21)                (2.49)
Given a base placement frequency of 10.5 percent at non-training establishments, this estimate indicates

that workers at training establishments are substantially (approximately 60 percent) more likely to find a

permanent placement through their THS employer in a given month. These data appear to support the

model’s central implication that the wage profile of workers at training firms is, on average, steeper.

4.2    Does training increase with market competition?
   In contrast to the Becker model in which training levels are invariant to competitive conditions, the

present model predicts that general skills training provision will increase with heightened market

competition as firms compete to attract labor. The OCS is well suited to testing this prediction because it

includes data on approximately twenty percent of the 1994 U.S. universe of THS establishments (with

much greater coverage in larger MSAs). Additionally, the sampling weights implicitly provide complete

information on the count and size distribution of firms not directly surveyed.

   Using the weights, one may calculate a Herfindahl concentration measure for each of the three major

occupations in each MSA:

                                                           2
                     nk
                              æ         nk
                                                       ö
(e3)       H jk   = å ω ik ⋅ çç Eijk   å    Eijk ω ik ÷÷
                    i =1      è        i =1            ø

where (j) indexes occupations (white collar, clerical/sales, and blue collar), (k) indexes MSAs, (i) indexes

establishments within a region, Eijk is establishment occupational employment, ω ik is the BLS area

sampling probability weight for the establishment, and nk is the number of establishments in the MSA.

This equation is analogous to the textbook Herfindahl except that each sampled establishment’s market

share is deflated by the employment count at non-sampled establishments while the sum of squared

market shares is inflated by the imputed shares of non-sampled establishments.45

   The calculation implicitly assumes that ‘collar’ distributions at non-sampled establishments are

comparable to those of sampled establishments and that MSAs constitute distinct THS markets. This




                                                               27
latter assumption is clearly an approximation but is reasonable given that THS markets are by nature

local, circumscribed by the distance THS workers are willing to commute to assignments. A complete

measure of competition in the THS industry would also include factors such as the opportunity for direct

hire of temporary workers by non-THS firms and the concentration of THS customers. While these

measures are unfortunately not available, it is not obvious that their omission will introduce bias.

     Summary characteristics of regional markets both overall and by collar are provided in Table 6.

Although THS employment is concentrated in MSAs, the point-in-time populations of THS workers are

modest, averaging 1.0 percent of total employment. The mean number of THS establishments per MSA is

30.5, although not all supply labor in each collar.46 THS market concentration in sampled MSAs is on

average moderate but varies significantly. Some of the smallest non-metropolitan markets contain only a

single establishment while the least concentrated MSAs have a Herfindahl of under 0.05.

A. Estimation strategy

     Using a cross-section regression to estimate the concentration-training relationship would be

problematic since many local market factors may affect training such as the distribution of worker skills

and preferences, demand by clients, regional price levels, etc. While one might locate proxies for some of

these factors, this approach is unlikely to be convincing. An alternative strategy pursued here is to identify

the concentration-training relationship using within-MSA variation in the relative concentration of white

collar, clerical/sales, and blue collar occupations. Specifically, I estimate these models using the MSA-

collar Herfindahl index given by (e3) while employing MSA fixed effects. These fixed effects absorb

unobserved factors common to occupations in each market that affect the propensity to train while the

Herfindahl coefficient is identified by intra-market variation in concentration across ‘collars.’

Additionally, I control for collar main effects, within-collar occupation shares, and establishment and

within-collar market size as above, all of which may be important determinants of training.

     The estimating equation is:

45
 An establishment’s area weight is the ratio of sampled to unsampled establishments in the establishment’s size class in an
MSA.



                                                              28
(e4)      Tejk = α + δH jk + C j + φS ej + ζEej + γM jk + Rk + ε ejk

where (e) denotes establishments, (j) denotes occupational collars, and (k) denotes regions. Tejk is an

indicator variable equal to one if an establishment offers training to workers in a given collar, H jk is the

MSA-collar Herfindahl index as in (e3), C j is a vector of collar main effects, S ej is a vector of

establishment occupation share variables within collars, Eej is establishment-collar employment, M jk is

MSA-collar THS employment, Rk is a vector of MSA main effects, α is a common intercept, and ε ejk is

a random error term composed of establishment, region, and occupation specific components. The

parameter δ measures the degree to which if competition is relatively greater (lesser) in collar A than

collar B in market 1 versus market 2, training is also relatively more (less) prevalent in collar A than B in

market 1 than in market 2.

     Three computer skills training variables are used for the estimates: word processing, data entry, and

computer programming languages, as well as an ‘any computer skills’ aggregate. Since the dependent

variable is dichotomous, a non-linear model would be appropriate but is impractical due to the large

number of indicator variables in the equation. Accordingly, I estimate a linear probability model with

Huber-White standard errors that account for clustering within MSA-collar cells and are robust to

arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity. While the earlier results focussed on training policies and not

training subjects, I focus on training subjects here for two reasons. First, the model’s prediction is that

firms vary their training in response to market competition while the policies that complement this

training are invariant. Second and more pragmatically, the identification strategy requires an outcome

variable that varies by collar, as do the training subject dummies.

     The empirical strategy differs from the theory in one dimension. While the model predicts that added

competition will shift the intensive margin of training, the empirical work explores its impact on the

extensive margin. A practical explanation for the substitution is that the data speak only to the prevalence

46
 An establishment is coded as supplying labor in a collar if workers were employed in that collar during the survey reference
month. It is likely that some establishments provide workers in collars not present during the survey month.


                                                              29
of training and not its depth. More substantively, the model’s prediction of movement along only one

margin is an artifact of the simplifying assumption of two discrete skill groups, implying a constant ‘take-

up’ rate. If one posits a continuous ability distribution, it is readily seen that greater depth of training

implies that the participation constraint (7) is satisfied for workers lower in the distribution, leading a

greater fraction to prefer training.47

B. Concentration-training estimates

    Initial estimates and specification checks using the word processing training outcome are found in

Table 7. The dependent variable is equal to one if the establishment provides word processing training to

a given collar. Since the Herfindahl measures increases with concentration, the predicted sign of this

coefficient is negative. Column (1) estimates the bivariate training-concentration relationship and finds a

significant Herfindahl coefficient of -0.25. Column (2) adds controls for log establishment-collar and log

MSA-collar employment. As would be expected, larger establishments are more likely to offer skills

training. Training is also more prevalent in MSAs with greater THS employment. Conditional on these

additional controls, the Herfindahl coefficient becomes insignificantly positive. The third column adds

collar main effects which control for average training propensity by collar. The Herfindahl measure again

changes sign, obtaining a coefficient of -0.30, which is highly significant and remains robust to the

inclusion of 102 MSA indicators in Column (4).

    Subsequent columns perform two additional specification checks: removing the establishment and

market size measures, and augmenting the collar main effects with 6 occupational share variables within

collars.48 These substitutions have little impact on the Herfindahl coefficient or its standard error.

Notably, MSA-collar THS employment is estimated to have no significant impact on training propensity

in these models despite the substantial (negative) correlation between concentration and market size

( ρ ≅ −.80 in each collar). If the Herfindahl measure merely captured differences in training propensity


47
   The relationship is slightly more complex than suggested since providing training to workers lower in the distribution implies a
drop in average worker quality and hence an offsetting adjustment to training. If the ability distribution is well behaved (i.e.,
relatively smooth), however, the net effect of increased competition should be positive.




                                                                30
prevailing in large markets, it would likely not be robust to controlling for market size. The estimates

therefore show that market concentration exerts an independent effect on training.49

     The first four columns of Table 8 present the preferred (most detailed) specification above for each of

three computer skills outcomes and the ‘any computer training’ aggregate. In each case, the concentration

measure is negatively related to computer skills provision and, in 3 of 4 cases, significantly so. The most

substantial relationships are found for word processing and data entry training which are also the most

prevalent computer skills offerings. Paralleling the estimates in section 4.1.B, Columns (5) – (8) of Table

8 present fixed effects estimates of the training probability models. Fixed effects control for each firm’s

average propensity to train and hence identify the effect of concentration using within-firm, across-market

variation. These models provide a check on the possibility that the initial results are driven by the

differential presence of multi-region firms in large competitive markets, which due to scale economies

have a disproportionate tendency to train. The fixed effects point estimates are quite comparable to those

in Table 8 (with p<.01 for 3 of 4 estimates), indicating that training provision at multi-region firms is also

quite sensitive to local market conditions.50

C. Magnitudes

     The estimated impact of concentration on training is of meaningful economic magnitude. Taking the

example of word-processing, the standard deviation of the Herfindahl is approximately 0.25 (also equal to

its mean) while the point estimate of the Herfindahl coefficient in the word processing equation is -0.38.

A one standard deviation increase in market competition is therefore predicted to increase word-

processing training’s prevalence by about 9 percentage points. Using a base frequency of 63 percent

(Table 1), this yields an elasticity of approximately -0.15, also implying a sizable 15 percent growth per


48
   Occupational share variables correspond to the nine major occupation groups. Two share variables are included for white, one
for clerical/sales, and three for blue collar (with one share variable is omitted in each of the three collars). Variables sum to one
within a collar.
49
   Estimates that include the log market size measure but exclude the Herfindahl generally find a significantly positive market
size effect, suggesting that both variables proxy competitive conditions but that the Herfindahl is the more meaningful measure.
As would be expected given this collinearity, estimates that exclude the market size measure yield a larger and more statistically
significant Herfindahl coefficient.
50
   Consistent with the notion that firm-wide economies render training less sensitive to individual establishment size, the
establishment size coefficient is substantially attenuated in these models.


                                                                 31
standard deviation increase in competition. The comparable elasticity for data entry training is -0.23 and

for any computer training is -0.09.51

D. Instrumental variables estimates and other specification checks

     If unobserved factors that vary at the MSA-occupation level drive both THS market concentration and

training provision, the estimates above would be biased. A solution to this problem is to use an

instrumental variable that influences market concentration directly but is plausibly independent of training

provision except via its impact on concentration. A candidate instrument is the scale of the ‘target market’

facing THS firms, in particular the level of permanent (non-THS) occupational employment in the MSA.

Since THS establishments supply workers to fill short-term vacancies in permanent positions, the size of

permanent occupational employment in a given MSA will clearly impact the size of THS employment in

the same occupation and MSA. Moreover, if there is a minimum efficient scale to operating a THS

establishment, a larger target market will all else equal lead to lower THS employer concentration.

     To explore this relationship, Figure 2 plots log permanent employment against the log THS Herfindahl

by occupational collar for 89 MSAs matched between the OCS data and the 1990 Census IPUMS 1

percent sample. The figure reveals a sizable, well-determined negative relationship, indicating that a

considerable share of the variation in THS concentration is accounted for by differences in target market

size.52 A drawback to this instrument is that larger permanent employment might impact training

provision not through concentration but simply through market scale. As a check on this possibility,

instrumental variables estimates also control for log MSA-collar THS employment. If this variable is

found to positively impact training propensity conditional on the instrumented Herfindahl, this would

suggest that the exclusion restriction is invalid.

     Table 9 presents instrumental variables estimates of the training-concentration relationship using as

instruments for log MSA-collar THS concentration the log of 1990 permanent MSA-collar employment



51
   Implied training elasticities for multi-region firms are comparable but slightly lower due to higher base frequencies at these
firms.
52
   A regression of the log THS MSA-collar Herfindahl on log permanent MSA-collar employment yields an R-squared of 0.56,
0.53, and 0.57 for white collar, clerical/sales, and blue collar occupations respectively.


                                                                32
and its square interacted with collar dummies.53 Note that these estimates use the log rather than the level

of the Herfindahl index since, as Figure 2 makes evident, the relationship between the log Herfindahl and

log permanent employment is approximately linear. The instrumental variable estimates reinforce the

findings from the OLS models. Concentration continues to exert a strong negative impact on training

provision. Elasticities are somewhat larger for IV than OLS estimates, a pattern that may result from the

reduction in measurement error when instrumenting the Herfindahl. Given the concern raised above about

distinguishing the impact of market concentration from market scale, it is notable that log MSA-collar

THS employment has a weakly negative effect on training propensity in each of these specifications.

      OLS models were also estimated using the log of the Herfindahl, yielding smaller elasticities and

weaker while still significant t-statistics.54 A quadratic Herfindahl term was never significant. Because the

‘difference-in-difference’ estimates above are necessarily somewhat restrictive, I also provide in

Appendix Table B estimates of the impact of concentration on training propensity performed separately

by collar and excluding (by necessity) MSA fixed effects. Unlike the earlier models, these ‘difference’

estimates identify the concentration-training relationship using exclusively inter-market variation in

concentration. Although their precision is substantially reduced by exclusion of MSA fixed effects, they

confirm that a negative training-concentration relationship obtains for all training outcomes and collars.

      To summarize, THS establishments offer more training in markets where competition is estimated to

be more strenuous, even across establishments belonging to the same firm. These facts are consistent with

the model. A less favorable reading, however, is that skills training is primarily a non-wage benefit like

paid vacation that firms offer in response to heightened market competition. To distinguish the paper’s

monopsony model from this alternative hypothesis, it is necessary to ask whether training and non-

training firms to respond differentially to competition.

                                                                  33
distinct prediction is that competition yields differentially greater wage gains for workers at training than

at non-training establishments. Since at the separating equilibrium (and in the estimates above), trainees

earn less than non-trainees, the model implies that the wages of both groups will rise with competition

while the gap between them narrows.

A. Estimates of the impact of concentration on wages at training and non-training establishments

   To explore this implication, I estimate equation (e1) augmented with the MSA-collar Herfindahl

measure, initially entered in non-interacted form and later interacted with training policy variables. The

Herfindahl is specified in log form so that regression coefficients may be read as elasticities. Pooled and

fixed effects estimates are found in panel A of Table 10. The first column, which includes the log

Herfindahl, 40 major occupation indicators, log establishment size, log MSA-collar THS employment,

and region fixed effects, indicates a Herfindahl-wage elasticity of –0.027.

   To test the implication that wages respond differentially at training and non-training establishments,

column (2) replaces the Herfindahl main effect with an indicator for ‘training provided’ and two

interactions: Herfindahl times ‘training provided’ and Herfindahl times ‘no training provided.’ Consistent

with the model, the point estimates for the wage-concentration elasticity appear substantially greater at

training than non-training establishments, –0.034 and –0.012 respectively, although the data do not reject

the null hypothesis of equality between the two coefficients (p = 0.17).

   Fixed effects estimates of these models provide larger and more statistically significant point

estimates. The non-interacted Herfindahl-wage specification indicates a concentration-wage elasticity of –

0.61. Interacting the Herfindahl measure with training and non-training indicators reveals substantially

greater wage responsiveness at establishments offering training. In column (4), the Herfindahl-Training

elasticity is estimated at –0.068 and the Herfindahl-No-Training elasticity at –0.031, and the hypothesis of

equality between the two coefficients is rejected at the .05 level. The column (4) estimate implies that in a

fully concentrated market, wages at training establishments would be 9.9 log points below non-training

establishments, while in a market at the mean sample concentration (log Herfindahl equal to –2.04), this

gap would be only 2.4 log points. A one-standard increase in concentration (from the mean to –1.25) is

                                                     34
predicted to increase this gap to 5.3 log points.

B. Instrumental variables estimates and specification checks.

      As a check on the OLS results, Panel B of Table 10 presents instrumental variables estimates of these

models.55 For both pooled and fixed effects samples, the IV estimates indicate a significant Herfindahl-

wage elasticity. Moreover, this elasticity is substantially larger at training than non-training establishment,

although one cannot reject the null of equality between the training and non-training coefficients at

conventional significance levels. Importantly, log MSA-collar THS employment has no significant wage

impact in these estimates.

      To ensure that the estimates are not driven by functional form or white collar/non-white collar

differences, models were also estimated using a non-log Herfindahl measure and excluding white collar

observations. These specification tests yielded comparable results. Bivariate comparisons of mean wages

at training and non-training establishments by collar and major occupation within market concentration

quartiles also support the regression results. Most notably, the wage gap between training and non-

training establishments in the first 1st and 4th quartiles is substantially smaller in less concentrated

markets, both for clerical and blue collar occupations overall and for 5 of 9 detailed occupations. As with

the wage-training results, the relationships are less visible for white collar workers.56

C. Policy interacted specifications

      Since the voluntary training policy is at the core of the monopsony model, it is here where we would

expect to find a substantial relationship. To check this implication, I augment the wage models above by

interacting the log Herfindahl measure with each policy variable. Note that this multiple interactions

specification is potentially difficult for the data to identify because firms may hold multiple polices.

      Despite this limitation, the pattern of coefficients found in Table 11 demonstrates that the

concentration-wage effect is primarily mediated through firms offering an ‘all/volunteers’ policy. Most

notably, the fixed effect estimates in Panel B find a significant wage-concentration elasticity for the

     Instruments are specified as in table 9. F-statistics for first-stage estimates reject the null at the 0.001 level in all cases.

     A detailed table of bivariate comparisons is available from the author.


                                                                       35
all/volunteers policy while coefficients for the other Herfindahl-policy interactions and the Herfindahl-no-

training interaction are insignificant and close to zero.

D. Discussion

     The estimates in Tables 10 and 11 support the contention that market competition yields higher THS

wages. Most notably, this wage effect is significantly greater for workers at training than non-training

establishment, even with a given firm. Moreover, consistent with the monopsony framework, the effect is

limited to establishments offering unrestricted training. Since wages at training establishments are on

average lower than at non-training establishments, the results suggest that firms’ ability to extract the

costs and/or returns from up-front training is reduced by market competition.

     As noted above, if training were simply a job amenity like vacation or sick pay, an alternative reading

would be that firms augment their training, wages and perhaps other benefits, as competitive conditions

demand. Yet, this explanation would leave a puzzle as to why firms performing training appear to raise

their wages significantly more than others. This pattern suggests that there is something distinctive about

training, a view supported by survey evidence from ALM. Respondents were asked, “Hypothetically, let’s

say that conditions in your local temporary market got tougher because several competing offices opened

nearby. How likely are you to take the following steps?” A large majority of respondents was likely to

“increase wages” (68 percent) or “offer more attractive training opportunities” (62 percent). By contrast,

only a minority was likely to “increase vacation, holiday or sick benefits” (33 percent) or to “reduce

qualifications required for hire (15 percent).” Notably, the fraction likely to increase wages was 23

percent greater (p<.05) at training establishments than non-training establishments.

     A final direct test of the conceptual framework is to ask whether the markup that training

establishments command is higher than at non-training establishments.57 Establishments surveyed by

ALM were asked to report their typical wage markup on assignments within their major occupation. A


57
  This markup should be distinguished from the parameter π in the model. The margin between training firms’ wages and their
bill rate in the model is equal to π plus a term equal to the cost of training and a fraction of the difference between trainees’
productivity and their outside wage as is visible in (10). This distinction is important because, in the model, π does not differ
between training and non-training firms whereas the margin between wages and client bill rates is strictly higher at training firms.


                                                                36
regression of their responses on occupation and MSA main effects and an indicator variable for provision

of free training reveals that within the same MSAs and occupations, the wage markup at training

establishments averages 12 percent (5.5 percentage points, p<.01) above that at non-training

establishments, a pattern that holds across all three major occupational collars and is significant in the

case of clerical/sales and blue collar occupations. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a strictly

competitive view of the THS market, particularly given the finding that training establishments screen for

workers of higher quality and pay lower wages.58

5.      Summary and conclusion

     The principal argument of this paper is that training may usefully be viewed as a device for recruiting

and screening workers possessing greater motivation and ability to learn. The argument rests on three

observations: first, training is more productive and therefore valuable to high ability workers; second,

workers have some prior information about their ability that is not initially visible to employers; and third,

firms are able to learn about ability through skills training. Under these conditions, the model indicates

that firms may be able to offer a package of wages and up-front general skills training that induces self-

selection by ability, generating short-run monopsony profits.

     The idea that training may serve as a screening mechanism is not at odds with the canonical view of

training as a human capital investment; in fact, the model outlined here relies on the assumption that

training is both productive, and differentially so with workers of higher ability. A key distinction,

however, is that in the Becker model, workers pay ex ante or contemporaneously for general training,

whereas in the framework explored here, training is given up-front while training costs and returns are

shared ex post by worker and firm. A second contrast lies in the predicted relationship between training

and market competition. In the standard model, a movement from monopsony to competition shifts the

costs and benefits of training from firm to worker without altering the prevalence or depth of training. In

the present model, firms’ general under-provision of training makes it optimal for them to train more as


58
 The fact that training establishments command a higher markup provides further evidence against the view that they provide
unobservably lower quality workers.


                                                             37
competitive conditions tighten, thereby narrowing the earnings gap between trainees and non-trainees.

   Two conclusions follow from this research. First, as noted above, the rapid growth of THS

employment in the U.S. and increasingly in European and Asian labor markets has led many economists

to ask what specifically is the service that THS firms provide for which demand is growing so rapidly (cf.,

OECD, 1999). The answer provided here is that beyond providing spot market labor, THS firms gather

and sell information about worker quality to their clients. Consistent with this view, recent data indicate

that employers increasingly use THS arrangements for worker screening. Additionally, in some sectors,

THS firms have become a primary conduit for auditioning and hiring new workers (Ballantine and

Ferguson, 1999; U.S. Department of Labor, 1999). Hence, the rapid growth of THS as a labor market

information broker implies that the demand for worker screening is rising.

   Second, while the role of private information in general skills training has received considerable

theoretical attention, empirical evidence has proved much more elusive, no doubt because information-

based models are notoriously difficult to test. By studying employer-sponsored general skills training in a

setting where traditional explanations appear non-viable, the present analysis suggests that private

information is indeed central to an explanation of why temporary help firms provide nominally free

general skills training.

   Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveal that U.S. employers spent 16.6 billion dollars

on direct employee training costs in 1994. Of this total, 3.4 billion (20 percent) was paid to direct tuition

reimbursements and outside training funds, expenditures which almost certainly constitute primarily

general training (Frazis et al., 1998). This figure, which amounts to $91 per trainee, is only slightly below

the per-worker training investments made by THS firms in the same year. While present knowledge tells

us little about how much of this general training is in fact paid up-front by employers, the current analysis

indicates that this share could be considerable.

A. Alternative equilibria.

   If (7) is satisfied, the separating equilibrium obtains. If (7) does not hold because all workers wish to

train, the ex ante ability of the applicant pool at each firm will equal the population average (1 − ρ ) and

firms’ chosen training level will be τˆ which satisfies:

                                         é     λ (1 − ρ ) ù
(a1)     c ′(τˆ) = (1 − λ ) ⋅ (1 − ρ ) ⋅ ê1 −                ú
                                         ê (λ (1 − ρ ) + ρ ) ú

As can be readily checked by comparison with (6), τˆ < τ * . However, at τˆ , training may be unattractive to

low ability belief workers, in which case the preferences of these workers will negate both the pooling

and separating equilibria and no equilibrium will exist. This non-existence result is similar to Rothschild

and Stiglitz (1976). Alternatively, at τˆ , training may be unattractive to all workers, in which case a no-

training equilibrium will follow. Finally, training at τˆ may remain attractive to all workers, in which case

a training-only equilibrium will result.

B. Firm 1’s period 2 monopsony wage of ν (τ ) cannot be profitably poached.

   Firm 1’s period 2 wage is w2 (τ ) = ν (τ ) . If a competing firm were to offer a wage to Firm 1’s work

force of wc : ν (τ ) < wc ≤ (1 + τ ) , Firm 1 would also offer wc to its high ability workers thereby retaining

them and earning positive period 2 (per-worker) profits of (1 + τ ) − wc ≥ 0 . The competitor, by contrast,

would recruit only Firm 1’s low ability workers and hence make losses of − wc < 0 . If the competitor

instead offered a wage of wc = (1 + τ ) + ε , it would recruit all of Firm 1’s period 1 workers (high and low

ability) and hence make losses of (1 + τ ) ⋅ (δ h − 1) − ε < 0 . Hence, because Firm 1 will counter all raiding

wage offers except those that exceed a worker’s productivity, Firm 1’s strategy of paying w2 (τ ) = ν (τ )

cannot be profitably poached and therefore poaching does not occur in equilibrium.

C. Equilibrium training and wages increase with a fall in profits.

   The value of π that allows the firm to attain maximum profitability under multiple entry is:




                                                             43
(a2)     π* =
                             [                  ]
                 (1 − λ )δ h (1 + τ * ) −ν (τ * ) − c(τ * )
                              1 − (1 − λ )δ h

At π * , the profitability constraint is just satisfied (i.e., does not bind) while for π > π * there is no wage-

training package that satisfies the profit constraint. As can be checked by substituting into (11), the firm’s

chosen training level at π * is equal to its unconstrained value, τ * , given by (6). Setting profitability to

π = 0 (the fully competitive level), substituting into (11) and using (6) to obtain an expression for the

firm’s training choice, τ 0 , yields:

          c(τ 0 )               c ′(τ * )
(a3)              = c ′(τ *
                            ) +
           τ0                     τ0

This expression shows that the average cost of training at τ 0 is greater than the marginal cost of training

at τ * , implying by the strict convexity of c(⋅) that τ 0 > τ * . Therefore, the firm’s optimal training choice

is greater at π = 0 than at π * . Since (11) is continuous over τ ∈ (τ * ,τ ** ) , this implies that τ π ∈ (τ * ,τ ** ]

when π < π * and hence, τ π is weakly greater than τ * under all feasible profit conditions and is strictly

greater when reservations profits are below their maximum. Using the fact that

π < π * Þ τ π > τ * Þ c′(τ π ) > c′(τ * ) , we can sign the derivative of training with respect to π , equation

(12) from the text (reproduced below):

                ì − (1 − (1 − λ )δ h )
          dτ π ï                       <0            τ * < τ π < τ **
(a4)          = í c ′(τ π ) − c′(τ * )
          dπ ï
                î            0                       elsewhere

This derivative is negative over the interval τ ∈ (τ * ,τ ** ) since the numerator is positive and the

denominator negative. Therefore, optimal training is falling with an increase in reservation profits, and

conversely, rising as reservation profits fall.

   Note, finally, that (a4) is discontinuous at τ ** because for τ > τ ** , the marginal cost of additional

training exceeds the marginal productivity gain. Hence, for π : 0 ≤ π < π ** , the firm provides training

τ π = τ ** and pays a positive period 1 wage as given by (14) in the text.


                                                                  44
D. At the profit maximum, it is less costly to increase training and wages than to increase wages alone.

   This result is most easily illustrated by setting the profit level to its maximum π = π * . As noted in

section C of the Appendix, training at π * is equal to τ * and the profit constraint is satisfied with equality.

Hence, the firm’s training and profits are the same as in its unconstrained profit maximization. Assume

the firm must raise wages slightly to accommodate market pressure. It can increase its first period wage,

yielding a negative first order effects on profits as can be seen by differentiating maximized profits with

respect to w1 : ∂π * ∂w1 = −1 . Alternatively, the firm may increase training slightly which has two

associated costs, greater training expenditures and, because training is publicly observed, higher period 2

wages. However, additional training also increases revenue by raising worker productivity. The net cost is

obtained by differentiating maximized profits with respect to τ . Applying the envelope theorem yields:

          ∂π *
(a5)                      =0
           ∂τ    τ =τ *



Because profits are maximized with respect to training at τ * , the profit-training derivative is zero whereas

the wage-training derivative ( ∂π * ∂w1 ) is strictly negative because first period wages are set by a binding

constraint ( w1 ≥ 0 ). As was shown in section C of the Appendix, so long as training is in the range

τ ∈ [τ * ,τ ** ] , the firm finds it more cost effective to raise wages and training together rather than raising

wages alone. What (a5) indicates is that in the neighborhood of τ * , small training-induced wage increases

are essentially costless.

Notes. White collar occupations are professional specialty, technical, and executive and
managerial. Clerical/sales occupations are marketing, sales, and clerical and administrative
support. Blue collar occupations are precision production, craft and repair, machine operators,
assemblers, and inspectors, transportation and material movement occupations, and handlers,
equipment cleaners, and laborers. The sample includes 1,002 temporary establishments supplying
white collar, clerical, or blue collar temporary workers (establishments may supply more than one
type of worker). Training statistics by collar include only the sub-sample of firms supplying
workers in collar (n = 630, 859, and 755 for establishments supplying white collar, clerical and
blue collar workers respectively). All frequencies are weighted by BLS national establishment
sampling weights.

Notes. Huber-White standard errors (in parentheses) allow for grouped errors within region-collar cells. Models are weighted by BLS area
probability sampling weights. Each establishment may supply (and train) workers in 1, 2, or 3 collars. Pooled estimates include 630 white collar,
859 clerical/sales, and 755 blue collar observations from 1,002 establishments. Fixed effects estimates are limited to 50 multi-region firms, with
285 white collar, 379 clerical/sales, and 356 blue collar observations from 395 establishments. Occupational share variables measure occupational
distributions within collars: 2 in white collar, 1 in clerical/sales, and 3 in blue collar.

Notes. Huber-White standard errors (in parentheses) allow for clustered errors at establishments. All models
are weighted by OCS national establishment probability weights. Fixed effects estimates are limited to firms
whose training policies vary among establishments. Detailed occupation dummies are included for 14 white
collar occupations, 14 clerical/sales occupations, and 10 blue collar occupations in white collar, clerical/sales,
and blue collar estimates respectively. Estimates in columns (1) through (3) contain a total of 1,002
establishments, 630 employing white collar, 859 employing clerical/sales, and 755 employing blue collar
workers. Column (4) contains 14 firms and 111 establishments. Column (5) contains 21 firms and 137
establishments. Column (5) contains 14 firms and 119 establishments. Training policies are not mutually
exclusive.
