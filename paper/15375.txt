                                               ABSTRACT

In this paper, we employ both calibration and modern (Bayesian) estimation methods to assess the
role of neutral and investment-specific technology shocks in generating fluctuations in hours. Using
a neoclassical stochastic growth model, we show how answers are shaped by the identification strategies
and not by the statistical approaches. The crucial parameter is the labor supply elasticity. Both a calibration
procedure that uses modern assessments of the Frisch elasticity and the estimation procedures result
in technology shocks accounting for 2% to 9% of the variation in hours worked in the data. We infer
that we should be talking more about identification and less about the choice of particular quantitative
approaches.

1        Introduction

Over the past three decades, quantitative macroeconomics has witnessed controversies about the
role of formal econometric methods. While there is some broad consensus that the neoclassical
stochastic growth model — potentially augmented by heterogeneity, various types of frictions, and
diﬀerent sources of idiosyncratic as well as aggregate uncertainty — provides a useful framework
for substantive empirical work, there is less consensus on how such models should be parameterized
in view of the available economic data and on how to document the precision and robustness of
quantitative results. Following Kydland and Prescott (1982), many researchers calibrate dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, whereas other researchers use formal econometric
methods to parameterize DSGE models and study their quantitative implications.

        Most of the methodological controversy can be attributed to an apparent trade-oﬀ between
theoretical coherence and empirical ﬁt of macroeconomic models and its implications for empirical
research. In this paper, we make the case that it is not the choice of quantitative approach per se
that is responsible for empirical ﬁndings, but rather the implicit identiﬁcation of key parameters
associated with the particular mappings from data into the parameter space. Thus, sources of
identiﬁcation and not a controversy over the use of formal statistical methods should be at the
center of the debate in quantitative macroeconomics.

        To build our case, we measure the contribution of both neutral and investment-speciﬁc technology
shocks to movements in hours worked. We compare the answers obtained with the calibration and
likelihood-based estimation of a neoclassical stochastic growth model. The key parameter in the
analysis is the labor supply elasticity. If this elasticity is chosen according to the most recent
household-level estimates, those that carefully account for movements in and out of the labor force
as well as the joint behavior of two spouses, then productivity shocks are responsible for less than
10% of hours variation. For other values of the Frisch elasticity used in the calibration literature,
the contribution of technology shocks ranges from less than 1% to almost 150%. Our likelihood-
based analysis, implemented with Bayesian techniques,1 also leads to the conclusion that technology
shocks account for less than 10% of the variance of hours. Unlike previous papers, we carefully
discuss the source of labor supply elasticity identiﬁcation and its potential sensitivity to model
misspeciﬁcation in a likelihood-based framework.
    1
        Our use of Bayesian techniques instead of a frequentist econometric approach is partly a personal choice, and
partly a statement about the state of the art in DSGE model estimation. Diﬀerences between the two modes of
statistical inference are the object of other research.
                                                                                                  2


   To make our empirical analysis as transparent as possible, we have deliberately chosen a fairly
simple DSGE model, rather than a more sophisticated speciﬁcation as in Justiniano, Primiceri,
and Tambalotti (2009a). Our model allows us to focus on a single parameter, which is diﬃcult to
measure and at the same time crucial for the quantitative result. The diﬃculty in determining the
labor supply elasticity is in part caused by the stylized nature of our theoretical model. While a
more sophisticated DSGE model might remedy some of the misspeciﬁcations of a simpler model,
it is natural to confront the larger model with a richer set of observations. Hence, the data will
always have patterns that the enlarged model is unable to explain, and misspeciﬁcation will be a
concern. While our empirical analysis is concerned with a question of the form How much of Y can
be explained by X? our main point extends to other questions, for instance, about the quantitative
eﬀects of ﬁscal or monetary policy changes.

   Calibration procedures provide a clear-cut separation between the information used to parameterize
the model and the quantitative question that is being addressed by the theory. For instance,
inference about the sources of business cycle ﬂuctuations is not based on information about the
cyclical properties of macroeconomic time series, such as output and hours worked, unless the
theory has deemed this variability to be exogenous. While this approach may provide clear and
understandable answers, they are only as good as the information that has been used to restrict and
parameterize the models (and this information is rarely discussed). The fact that the calibration
approach ignores salient features of the economic time series that it wants to understand is often
seen as a serious shortcoming by its critics. Its advocates, on the other hand, emphasize that most
of our models are not designed to capture all the dynamics that we observe in macroeconomic
aggregates and that ignoring (some of) them makes the quantitative analysis more robust to model
misspeciﬁcation.

   A starting point for the use of formal econometric methods is the observation that DSGE
models deliver a complete multivariate stochastic process representation for the data they aim
to explain and hence a likelihood function. This likelihood function can in principle be used to
eﬃciently extract information about model parameters contained in macroeconomic time series
and to generate sharp quantitative results. Unlike in the calibration approach, inference about
the sources of business cycle ﬂuctuations will be based on all the available information about
the cyclical variability of macroeconomic time series. To the extent that a theoretical DSGE
model is not designed to capture all of the observed dynamics because it omits some important
alternative sources of business cycle ﬂuctuations or the internal propagation of exogenous shocks is
very stylized, one would need to remove eﬀects of non-modelled shocks from the data and/or enlarge
the theoretical model through the inclusion of additional shocks and frictions in the propagation
                                                                                                    3


mechanism to improve its ability to ﬁt actual data. For instance, both Smets and Wouters (2007)
and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) consider stochastic growth models that are enriched
by various forms of adjustment costs to generate more realistic dynamics. The authors of the
former paper augment their model by a large set of structural shocks to capture all comovements
of seven macroeconomic variables, whereas the latter paper essentially uses a structural vector
autoregression (VAR) to remove all variation from the data except for the ﬂuctuations generated
by monetary policy shocks.

   Regardless of aﬃliation with the calibration or estimation tribe, the following principles seem
desirable to us. First, a careful empirical analysis based on a dynamic macroeconomic model should
convey to the reader which model parameters are most inﬂuential in generating a quantitative
answer to the substantive question addressed in the study. Second, a detailed discussion (and
careful choice) of observations that are suitable to identify plausible values for the DSGE model
parameters is important. Third, measures of precision and/or robustness of the quantitative ﬁndings
should be reported.

   Documenting key properties of the model has nothing to do with a choice between calibration
and estimation. Instead parameter identiﬁcation is what is crucial in this respect. While the
identiﬁcation of model parameters is closely linked to, say, the choice of a criterion function for an
econometric estimator, we will make the case that the choice of the criterion function is context-
speciﬁc and should be preceded by a careful examination of which observations could be most
informative about particular parameters. Some calibrators simply take parameter values from
previous studies and plug them into their model without verifying that these parameter values lead
to the same observational patterns that have motivated their choice in the ﬁrst place. Researchers
who estimate DSGE models often ignore important observations and do examine whether it is
possible to identify all model parameters based on the autocovariance properties of the limited
number of time series that do enter the likelihood function. The recent surge of papers discussing
and diagnosing identiﬁcation problems in estimated DSGE models, e.g., Canova and Sala (2009)
and Iskrev (2009), is a testament to this neglect. While measures of precision in calibration papers
often take the form of robustness exercises that perturb key parameters, econometric studies tend
to make probabilistic statements about quantitative ﬁndings.

   Although our paper focuses on quantitative methodologies, a brief review of the very extensive
yet non-conclusive literature on the importance of technology shocks for ﬂuctuations of hours
worked is in order. We will distinguish between papers that calibrate DSGE models, estimate
DSGE models, and estimate structural VARs. A stylized version of the neoclassical growth model
                                                                                                                  4


calibrated to U.S. data can generate around 20% of the observed variation2 in hours worked (see
Cooley and Prescott (1995)). In Hansen (1985)’s indivisible labor model the volatility of hours
reaches about 66% of the actual volatility as long as households are capable of using lotteries to
allocate time to market activities. Other studies allow for variations of labor on both the intensive
and extensive margin, variable capital utilization, home production, imperfect competition, incomplete
markets, and labor search frictions. Based on our reading of the literature, the fraction of variation
of hours worked explained by technology shocks ranges from 10% to 80%, with a median of about
30%.

       Altug (1989) estimated the Kydland and Prescott (1982) one-shock time-to-build model using
maximum likelihood techniques. She introduced measurement errors to account for the ﬂuctuations
of hours worked (and other variables used in the estimation procedure) that are not driven by
technology shocks and obtained that the 12% of variation in hours was due to variation in technology
shocks. McGrattan (1994) estimates a stochastic growth model with distortionary labor and capital
taxes and ﬁnds that 20% of the ﬂuctuations in hours worked are due to technology shocks. Chang
and Schorfheide (2003) consider a home production model, which is estimated based on data of
aggregate output, hours worked, and consumption of durable goods. According to their analysis,
technology shocks account for 50% of the variation in hours worked. Galı́ and Rabanal (2004) ﬁt a
New Keynesian DSGE model to observations on output, inﬂation, interest rates, and hours worked
and ﬁnd that technology shocks have virtually no eﬀect on hours over the business cycle. Most
recently, Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2009a) estimate a state-of-the-art DSGE model
with nominal wage and price rigidities and ﬁnd that at low frequencies, hours ﬂuctuations are due
to a fairly persistent wage mark-up shock. At business cycle frequencies, 60% and 10% of the
variance of hours are explained by investment-speciﬁc and neutral technology shocks, respectively.

       In structural VARs, technology shocks are often identiﬁed through the assumption that they
are the only shocks that have a permanent eﬀect on labor productivity. Shapiro and Watson
(1988) estimate VARs using data on aggregate output, hours worked, the aggregate price level,
and interest rates. They report that 32% (40%) of the variation in hours is due to technology
shocks, assuming that hours have a stochastic trend (are trend stationary). Following the work
of Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997), the more recent literature distinguishes between
neutral and investment-speciﬁc technology shocks. Using a structural VAR, Galı́ and Rabanal
(2004) ﬁnd that neutral technology shocks explain very little of the variation in hours. Investment-
speciﬁc technology shocks, on the other hand, can explain about 60%. According to Fisher (2006),
   2
       Throughout the paper, we report ﬁndings in terms of variances or ratios of variances, because unlike standard
deviations variances are additive.
                                                                                                     5


neutral technology shocks account for 21% (15%) over the period 1955:Q1-1979:Q2 (1982:Q3 to
2000:Q4), whereas investment-speciﬁc technology shocks account for up to 47% (36%) of the
ﬂuctuations in hours worked. Canova, Lopez-Salido, and Michelacci (2007) estimate that the
contribution of the neutral technology shock to hours variation is close to zero, while the investment-
speciﬁc shock accounts for between 20% and 50% of the variance of hours.

    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present the model in Section 2. The
empirical analysis is carried out in Sections 3 and 4. In both sections, we parameterize the DSGE
model, then repeatedly simulate artiﬁcial data with the model using the two technology shocks
as driving forces, and compute the average ratio of the sample variance of simulated data to the
variance of postwar U.S. data. Section 3 focuses on standard calibration procedures. In particular,
we discuss how diﬀerent sources of information about the labor elasticity completely determine the
results. Productivity shocks are important for hours worked ﬂuctuations if the Frisch elasticity
is around two or larger. Section 4 reports on the DSGE model estimation using state-of-the-
art Bayesian techniques and the answer that it yields to our main question. We also provide
novel insights about the identiﬁcation of the labor supply elasticity in a likelihood-based approach.
Roughly speaking, the DSGE model incorporates enough restrictions to identify technology shock
innovations from the observables. The dynamic responses of labor productivity and hours to
these innovations identify the Frisch elasticity. However, to the extent that the estimated DSGE
model has diﬃculties reproducing the dynamic responses of a less restrictive vector autoregressive
speciﬁcation, this identiﬁcation approach is on shaky grounds.

    Finally, Section 5 concludes. In a nutshell, we think that the speciﬁc statistical methods
that are used to relate the model to the data are not the source of disparity in the quantitative
results. Instead, the disparity is caused by the identiﬁcation strategy that is used to choose the key
parameter, which is the labor supply elasticity in our application. The appendix provides detailed
information on the data set as well as the implementation of the empirical analysis. Data and
software to replicate the empirical analysis are available on the web at http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/˜schorf.



2    The Model Economy

We consider what we think is the latest implementation of the plain-vanilla real business cycles
model: a stochastic growth model with two types of technology shocks. A neutral productivity
shock aﬀects total factor productivity. The second shock is investment-speciﬁc and shifts the slope
of the transformation curve between consumption and capital goods. Our model is very similar
                                                                                                    6


to the one used by Fisher (2006). It is a simpliﬁed version of the model studied by Greenwood,
Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000) in that we only have one capital good and the degree of capital
utilization is ﬁxed.

    Instead of using a more elaborate model speciﬁcation as in Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti
(2009a), we focus on a frictionless version of the neoclassical growth model for two reasons. First,
our stylized theoretical model is likely to ﬁt worse, in terms of being able to track and forecast
the observed time series, than a more densely parameterized statistical model such as a VAR.
Therefore, our illustration captures a key aspect of most empirical work with DSGE models: the
theoretically coherent model is limited in its ability to ﬁt time series data and misspeciﬁcation
is a concern. Second, there will only be one parameter for which identiﬁcation is tenuous and
that crucially aﬀects the quantitative ﬁndings: the aggregate Frisch labor supply elasticity. This
makes it easy to pinpoint how the criterion functions, used to specify parameters in each of the
quantitative approaches, translate into diﬀerent answers for the role of technology shocks in shaping
the behavior of aggregate output and hours.

    The model economy is populated with a continuum of households with the following preferences:
                                              [∞    (                )]
                                                               1+1/𝜈
                                               ∑
                                                  𝑡          𝐻𝑡
                           max           𝐼𝐸 0    𝛽 ln 𝐶𝑡 − 𝜉            .                     (1)
                     {𝐶𝑡 ,𝑋𝑡 ,𝐻𝑡 ,𝐾𝑡+1 }                     1 + 1/𝜈
                                                𝑡=0

Here 𝐶𝑡 denotes consumption, and 𝐻𝑡 hours worked. The nice feature of these preferences is that
the parameter 𝜈 is the Frisch elasticity of substitution of labor. 𝛽 is, as always, the discount rate.
𝜉 aﬀects the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure and determines steady
state hours. There is a constant returns to scale production function given by

                                            1
                                     𝐶𝑡 +      𝑋𝑡 = 𝐴𝑡 𝐾𝑡𝛼 𝐻𝑡1−𝛼 .                                (2)
                                            𝑉𝑡

The left-hand side of (2) can be interpreted as a linear transformation curve between consumption
and investment goods. The slope of this curve is shifted by the investment-speciﬁc technology
disturbance 𝑉𝑡 . The right-hand side takes the standard Cobb-Douglas form, and 𝐴𝑡 is an exogenous
total factor productivity (or neutral) technology process. In other words, technology is subject to
two shocks: a standard neutral technology shock 𝐴𝑡 and a sector-speciﬁc technology shock 𝑉𝑡 .
Capital depreciates geometrically at rate 𝛿, yielding

                                      𝐾𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿)𝐾𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 .                                     (3)


    This economy is not distorted, and the standard procedure of solving the social planner’s
problem in order to ﬁnd the equilibrium applies. However, it is important to make a few notes in
                                                                                                   7


terms of National Income and Product Accounting (NIPA) that will link the model naturally with
the data. NIPA measures output in terms of the consumption good. Deﬁne 𝐼𝑡 = 𝑋𝑡 /𝑉𝑡 , and hence
the aggregate resource constraint can be written as

                                     𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 = 𝐴𝑡 𝐾𝑡𝛼 𝐻𝑡1−𝛼 .


   Under competitive markets, the relative price of a unit of the investment good using the
consumption good as numeraire, 𝑃𝑡 , gives us the technology shock 1/𝑉𝑡 . Using the investment
series and some considerations to be detailed below to get the appropriate depreciation rate, we
can construct a series for capital 𝐾𝑡 . From here, using the Cobb-Douglas assumption on production
and the average labor share for the entire sample period as an estimate of 𝛼, we can obtain the
series 𝐴𝑡 using (2) (see, for example, Rı́os-Rull and Santaeulalia (2009) for details).

   The static Euler equation deﬁnes the labor supply schedule that, after substituting the marginal
productivity of labor with its associated equilibrium wage, can be expressed as

                                                  1 𝑊𝑡 𝜈
                                                (      )
                                          𝐻𝑡 =           .
                                                  𝜉 𝐶𝑡

The dynamic Euler equation, again substituting expressions for the relative price of the investment
good and the interest rate, is of the form
                                       [            (              )]
                                         𝑃𝑡+1 /𝐶𝑡+1
                             1 = 𝛽𝐼𝐸 𝑡               (1 − 𝛿) + 𝑅𝑡+1 ,
                                           𝑃𝑡 /𝐶𝑡

                                                      𝛼−1 1−𝛼
                                   𝑅𝑡+1 𝑃𝑡+1 = 𝛼𝐴𝑡+1 𝐾𝑡+1 𝐻𝑡+1 .

   At this point our model has two exogenous disturbances, namely a neutral and an investment-
speciﬁc technology process. To examine the eﬀect of technology ﬂuctuations on hours worked, we
assume that

               (ln 𝐴𝑡 − ln 𝐴0 − 𝛾𝑎 𝑡) = 𝜌𝑎,1 (ln 𝐴𝑡−1 − ln 𝐴0 − 𝛾𝑎 (𝑡 − 1))                      (4)

                                           +𝜌𝑎,2 (ln 𝐴𝑡−2 − ln 𝐴0 − 𝛾𝑎 (𝑡 − 2)) + 𝜎𝑎 𝜖𝑎,𝑡

                (ln 𝑉𝑡 − ln 𝑉0 − 𝛾𝑣 𝑡) = 𝜌𝑣,1 (ln 𝑉𝑡−1 − ln 𝑉0 − 𝛾𝑣 (𝑡 − 1))                     (5)

                                           +𝜌𝑣,2 (ln 𝑉𝑡−2 − ln 𝑉0 − 𝛾𝑣 (𝑡 − 2)) + 𝜎𝑣 𝜖𝑣,𝑡 .

Thus, the log technologies ﬂuctuate around a linear deterministic trend path, given by ln 𝐴0 + 𝛾𝑎 𝑡
and ln 𝑉0 + 𝛾𝑣 𝑡, respectively. If the autoregressive coeﬃcients sum to one, the ﬂuctuations are non-
stationary and the technology processes can be rewritten as AR(1) processes in terms of growth
                                                                                                                        8


rates. The most widely used speciﬁcations for the neutral technology process can be easily obtained
as special cases of (4). If 0 ≤ 𝜌𝑎,1 < 1 and 𝜌𝑎,2 = 0, then technology follows a stationary AR(1)
process. If 𝜌𝑎,1 + 𝜌𝑎,2 = 1, then technology has a unit root and the serial correlation of its growth
rates is −𝜌𝑎,2 , which is often assumed to be zero. In order to restrict the autoregressive processes
in (4) and (5) to trend stationarity, it is convenient to re-parameterize them in terms of partial
autocorrelations 𝜓1 and 𝜓2 . Omitting the 𝑎 and 𝑣 subscripts, we let

                                             𝜌1 = 𝜓1 (1 − 𝜓2 ),     𝜌2 = 𝜓2 .                                         (6)

In case of a unit root 𝜓1 = 1. The analysis in this paper is conducted under the assumption that
the two innovations 𝜖𝑎,𝑡 and 𝜖𝑣,𝑡 are normally distributed with mean zero and variances 𝜎𝑎2 and 𝜎𝑣2 .
Moreover, we assume that they are uncorrelated at all leads and lags.3

       Regardless of whether the technology shocks have a stochastic trend component (unit root) or
are trend stationary, the following transformations generate stationary variables:
                                                                                             1      𝛼
                     𝑌𝑡      𝐶𝑡     𝐼𝑡       𝑋𝑡       𝐾𝑡+1       𝑊𝑡
                        ,       ,      ,          ,         ,       ,    where     𝑄𝑡 = 𝐴𝑡1−𝛼 𝑉𝑡 1−𝛼 .
                     𝑄𝑡      𝑄𝑡     𝑄𝑡      𝑄𝑡 𝑉𝑡     𝑄𝑡 𝑉𝑡      𝑄𝑡

To approximate the model dynamics, we rewrite the equilibrium conditions in terms of these
detrended variables, derive a non-stochastic steady state, log-linearize the equilibrium conditions
around the steady state, and use a standard procedure to solve the resulting linear rational
expectations system. For this extremely simple economy, a log-linear approximation is typically
used in the literature as it is deemed to be accurate enough.

       The parameters of the model economy belong to three categories: the four that aﬀect the steady
state of the model are 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛿, and 𝜉 (capital share of output, discount rate, depreciation rate, and
relative weight of consumption and leisure in the utility function); those that aﬀect the law of
motion of the technology disturbances which are ln 𝐴0 , 𝜓𝑎,1 , 𝜓𝑎,2 , 𝜎𝑎 , ln 𝑉0 , 𝜓𝑣,1 , 𝜓𝑣,2 , and 𝜎𝑣 ; and
the Frisch labor supply elasticity 𝜈, which in this particular model economy only aﬀects non-steady
state behavior (the appropriate choice of 𝜉 makes sure that this is the case), and hence the internal
propagation mechanism.

       We will subsequently examine the role of shifts in investment-speciﬁc technology and total factor
productivity for ﬂuctuations of hours worked. The model economy serves as a theoretical framework
for the quantitative analysis and will be calibrated in Section 3 and estimated in Section 4. In
   3
       In principle, one could model ln 𝐴𝑡 and ln 𝑉𝑡 as vector autoregressive processes. However, empirically it turns out
that the cross-correlations are small. Since the extension to a VAR process seems neither quantitatively important
nor essential to the methodological issues discussed in this paper, we decided to impose that the two technology
shocks are uncorrelated.
                                                                                                     9


particular, we use calibration and estimation techniques to determine numerical values for its
parameters, simulate data from the model based on random draws of the technology processes, and
compare the variance of the model-generated data to the sample variance of postwar U.S. data.



3      Calibration

The calibration process starts by choosing targets that are used to obtain parameter values. These
targets are not supposed to involve the answer that is pursued. Consider our speciﬁc application.
We measure the fraction of cyclical variation in hours that is due to technology shocks. If we would
use the cyclical variability of hours as a target, we would attribute all of it to technology shocks,
since these are the only shocks in the model. We would obtain an answer of 100% by construction.
Thus, the calibration does not use evidence from time series movements of endogenous variables
that are centrally related to the question that is addressed.

      For our model economy, most, but not all, of the parameters (labor share of output 𝛼, depreciation
rate 𝛿, discount rate, 𝛽, and weight of leisure in the utility function 𝜉) are easily determined
by choosing steady-state conditions pertaining to NIPA aggregates, rates of return, and average
fraction of time allocated to market activities. We discuss how to set them in Section 3.1. Simple
assumptions on competition in factor markets and the Cobb-Douglas shape of production yield
a theory-consistent construction of the exogenous shock series. Our method of obtaining the
parameters that control the process for the two technology shocks is described in Sections 3.2
and 3.3. Obtaining a value for the Frisch elasticity, 𝜈, is, however, less straightforward. Hence, we
pursue several diﬀerent strategies to determine a suitable value in Section 3.4.

      Once values for all model parameters have been speciﬁed, the answer that we are searching for
is the size of the ﬂuctuations of output and hours in the model in response to technology shocks
relative to the ﬂuctuations of these variables in the data. We obtain the answer by simulating
output and hours worked data from the log-linearized model economy. We then compute variance
ratios for HP-ﬁltered (with the smoothing parameter set to 1600) simulated and actual data. Unless
otherwise noted, our analysis is based on data from 1955:Q3 to 2006:Q4. Our ﬁndings are reported
in Section 3.5. Precise data deﬁnitions are provided in the appendix.


3.1     Exploiting Steady-State Relationships

According to our speciﬁcation, factor markets are competitive and the aggregate production function
has a Cobb-Douglas form. Hence, the implied labor share 𝑊𝑡 𝐻𝑡 /𝑌𝑡 is equal to 1 − 𝛼. While
                                                                                                                     10


the observed labor share is time-varying (see, for instance, Rı́os-Rull and Santaeulalia (2009)), it
displays no clear trend. Hence, we target the steady state of the model to have the average labor
share in the data, which we take to be 0.34. We also target an investment to output ratio of 28%, a
yearly interest rate of 4%, and a value of leisure of 2/3 of total available time. These choices yield
values of 𝛼 = 0.34, 𝛽 = 0.99, and 𝛿 = 0.013 in quarterly terms.4 The value of parameter 𝜉, while
necessary to set steady-state leisure to two-thirds, actually does not aﬀect the decision rules in a
log-linear approximation and is irrelevant for the behavior of the model.


3.2       Empirical Measures of the Exogenous Disturbances

In the model economy, the investment-speciﬁc technology shock is the relative price of investment
in terms of consumption. We construct this relative price by combining a price index for quality-
adjusted equipment investment with a price index for investment in structures. With regard to
the equipment investment price index, Gordon (1990), Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997),
and Cummins and Violante (2002) reveal substantial evidence of biases in the trend of oﬃcial
price indexes due to the lack of quality adjustment. We build on the annual series of Cummins
and Violante (2002) to construct our quarterly series of quality-adjusted equipment investment.
Quarterly movements are imputed based on the oﬃcial index reported by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) in the Fixed Asset Tables (FAT-BEA). As a price index for investment in structures
we use the consumption deﬂator, 𝑃𝑡𝐶 . The two indixes are combined with a Tornquist aggregator
to obtain a quality-adjusted price index for total investment, 𝑃𝑡𝐼 . We then deﬁne

                                          𝑃𝑡 = 𝑃𝑡𝐼 /𝑃𝑡𝐶     and 𝑉𝑡 = 1/𝑃𝑡 ,                                         (7)

normalizing the index such that 𝑃0 = 1 in 1947.

       The series for the neutral technology process 𝐴𝑡 is typically computed using measures of per
capita real output 𝑌𝑡 , capital 𝐾𝑡 , labor input 𝐻𝑡 , and an estimate of the capital input share 𝛼:

                                      ln 𝐴𝑡 = ln 𝑌𝑡 − 𝛼 ln 𝐾𝑡 − (1 − 𝛼) ln 𝐻𝑡 .                                     (8)

What is non-standard in our analysis is that we have to construct a quality-adjusted capital stock.
To do so, we begin by generating a quarterly series for investment in eﬃciency units:

                                                 𝑋𝑡 = (𝐼𝑡𝐸 + 𝐼𝑡𝑆 )/𝑄𝐼𝑡 ,
   4
       The deﬁnition of labor share has many subtleties that we avoid here altogether; see the aforementioned Rı́os-Rull
and Santaeulalia (2009) or Cooley and Prescott (1995). The three parameter values also determined the capital-
to-output ratio, which is sometimes used for calibration instead of the investment-to-output ratio. For our model
speciﬁcation, capital measured in consumption terms is 2.54 times yearly output.
                                                                                                    11


where 𝐼𝑡𝐸 and 𝐼𝑡𝑆 are total nominal investment in equipment and structures, respectively, and 𝑄𝐼𝑡 is
the quality-adjusted price index that appears in (7). The quality-adjusted capital stock is obtained
by the perpetual inventory method:

                                          𝐾𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿)𝐾𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 ,

where 𝛿 corresponds to the average of Cummins and Violante (2002)’s physical depreciation rates
for total capital. The initial capital stock 𝐾0 is calibrated using the observed level of output and
the investment to output ratio in 1947.


3.3     Parameterizing the Shock Processes

Based on the measures of ln 𝐴𝑡 and ln 𝑉𝑡 , it is straightforward to estimate coeﬃcients for the
autoregressive models (4) and (5). Rather than using least-squares methods, we employ Bayesian
techniques to estimate the shock processes. This makes the estimates directly comparable to those
reported for the full DSGE model in Section 4. Bayesian estimates are obtained by combining a
prior distribution for the parameters of an econometric model, generically denoted by 𝜃 ∈ Θ, with
a likelihood function
                                  𝑝(𝑌 ∣𝜃) 𝑝(𝜃)
                                                                ∫
                        𝑝(𝜃∣𝑌 ) =              ,      𝑝(𝑌 ) =         𝑝(𝑌 ∣𝜃) 𝑝(𝜃) 𝑑𝜃.             (9)
                                     𝑝(𝑌 )                      𝜃∈Θ

Here 𝑝(𝜃) denotes the prior density, 𝑝(𝑌 ∣𝜃) is the likelihood function, that is, the joint probability
density function of the data 𝑌 given 𝜃, 𝑝(𝜃∣𝑌 ) is the posterior density, and 𝑝(𝑌 ) is the so-called
marginal likelihood.

      As discussed in Section 2, the AR(2) shock processes are parameterized in terms of partial
autocorrelations 𝜓1 and 𝜓2 ; see (6). These processes are trend stationary if −1 < 𝜓1 , 𝜓2 < 1
and become diﬀerence stationary if 𝜓1 = 1. We estimate the parameters subject to 0 ≤ 𝜓1 < 1
(deterministic trend) and 𝜓1 = 1 (stochastic trend). In the former case, we assume that the ﬁrst
order partial autocorrelation has a Beta distribution with mean 0.95 and standard deviation of
0.2. For both the diﬀerence-stationary and trend-stationary speciﬁcation it is assumed that the
second-order partial autocorrelation is uniformly distributed on the interval (−1, 1). Our priors are
fairly agnostic with respect to the average growth rate of the technology processes and the location
parameters ln 𝐴0 and ln 𝑉0 , which determine the log levels of the technology disturbances. The
priors for the innovation standard deviations are centered at 1% with a large variance. A summary
is provided in Table 1.

      We construct a joint likelihood function for the two technology processes based on a sample that
ranges from 1955:Q3 to 2006:Q4, conditioning on observations from 1954:Q3 to 1955:Q2. Posterior
                                                                                                                      12


means and 90% probability intervals are reported in Table 2. Both technology processes are highly
persistent and the estimates of 𝜓1 exceed 0.97. The growth rates of the neutral technology process
are essentially uncorrelated, that is, 𝜓ˆ2,𝑎 is near zero, whereas growth rates of ln 𝑉𝑡 are strongly
serially correlated with 𝜓ˆ2,𝑣 ≈ 0.8. It is interesting to note that the deterministic component of
technology growth is solely due to ln 𝑉𝑡 , which implies that it is embodied in the physical capital
stock.

       In a Bayesian framework, one can assign probabilities to competing model speciﬁcations and
update these probabilities in light of the data. We are considering a deterministic and a stochastic
trend speciﬁcation for the technology shock processes, say ℳ0 and ℳ1 . According to Bayes
Theorem, the prior odds in favor of the stochastic trend speciﬁcation, 𝜋(ℳ1 )/𝜋(ℳ0 ), are updated
via marginal likelihood ratios (so-called Bayes factors) to obtain posterior odds:5

                                          𝜋(ℳ1 ∣𝑌 )   𝜋(ℳ1 ) 𝑝(𝑌 ∣ℳ1 )
                                                    =       ×          .                                            (10)
                                          𝜋(ℳ0 ∣𝑌 )   𝜋(ℳ0 ) 𝑝(𝑌 ∣ℳ0 )

We report log marginal likelihood values for our two speciﬁcations (see (9) for a deﬁnition) in the
last row of Table 2. The Bayes factor in favor of the stochastic trend version is approximately 𝑒20 ,
indicating that it is preferable to impose the unit roots.


3.4       Calibrating the Labor Supply Elasticity

At this point, we have chosen numerical values for all model parameters except the Frisch labor
supply elasticity 𝜈. Given our speciﬁcation of preferences, the steady state does not depend on this
parameter. A variety of approaches have been pursued in the literature to parameterize 𝜈, which
we describe in turn.


Calibration through long-run growth properties.                         A reasonable description of the last 100
years of Western experience is the statement that while there has been a massive increase of wages,
by an order of magnitude if not more, interest rates and the allocation of hours per capita have
not displayed any such long-run trend. Most preference structures are not consistent with this
pattern. The most widely used preferences in business cycles research that are consistent with this
                                                                      (𝑐𝛾 ℓ1−𝛾 )1−𝜎
long-term behavior belong to the Cobb-Douglas family,                      1−𝜎      ,   where ℓ = 1 − 𝐻 is leisure and
the endowment of time is normalized to one. The Frisch elasticity of this speciﬁcation is given by
        1−𝐻∗
𝜈=       𝐻∗ ,   where 𝐻∗ is the steady-state value of hours worked. Clearly, with these preferences the
   5
       Marginal likelihood values can be interpreted as a measure of in-sample ﬁt that is adjusted by a penalty for model
complexity.
                                                                                                                     13


Frisch elasticity is determined not from short-run variation in hours worked but from the choice of
steady-state hours and indirectly through the lack of variation in the long run.6 If the average hours
worked per adult per week is set to one third,7 which is a standard choice, the implied elasticity
is 2. A choice of 25 hours per week that weighs young people and retirees more heavily yields an
elasticity of 3.


Non-convexities and lotteries. Most of the variation in hours over the business cycle occurs
along the extensive margin (number of workers rather than hours per worker). To account for
such variation, Rogerson (1988) developed a model where agents care about leisure but face a non-
convexity in the opportunities to work. These agents can use a lottery arrangement to maximize
the utility ex ante. Ex post some will work and the others will not. After aggregation, this
arrangement yields quasi-linear preferences for a representative consumer and the economy-wide
elasticity of substitution can be inﬁnite, regardless of the individual value of the Frisch elasticity.
To see this, assume now that ℎ ∈ {0, ℎ}, and that the agent chooses a probability of working 𝑝,
solving
                                                                    1+1/𝜈
                                               max ln 𝑐 − 𝑝 𝜉 ℎ                                                    (11)
                                                 𝑐,𝑝

subject to ℎ ∈ {0, ℎ} and 𝑐 = 𝑤 𝑝 ℎ + 𝑎, for some wealth 𝑎. In this context, the aggregate amount
                                                                                                       1/𝜈
of hours is just 𝐻 = 𝑝ℎ and the intratemporal ﬁrst-order condition implies 𝑤/𝑐 = 𝜉ℎ                          . Thus, we
can replace the individual agents by a representative household that chooses 𝐶 and 𝐻 to maximize
                                                                   1/𝜈
ln 𝐶 − 𝜉𝐻 subject to 𝐶 = 𝑤 𝐻 + 𝑎, where 𝜉 = 𝜉ℎ                           . Note that the utility function of this
representative household is obtained from (1) by setting 𝜈 = ∞. Hansen (1985) used these lottery
arrangements as the source of his calibration strategy in a seminal paper and not surprisingly found
that hours move a lot in response to productivity shocks.8 We will use a Frisch elasticity value of
100 to implement these ideas while avoiding numerical instability.
   6
       Other types of preferences used in the literature that are consistent with a balanced growth path are those posed
by King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988). With these preferences, the steady-state level of hours also determines the
Frisch elasticity of substitution. Herrendorf and Rı́os-Rull (2009) argue that balanced growth paths do not impose
any real restrictions on business cycle models.
   7
     The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports (http://www.bls.gov/opub/working/page17b.htm) 67 hours per week
worked by a married couple between the ages of 25 and 54. Conventionally, we think of 100 hours per week per person
as the available discretionary time.
   8
     Kydland and Prescott (1991) built a model with both intensive and extensive margin with the use of lotteries
and calibrated it using both balanced growth path restrictions and the relative volatility of hours and bodies.
Unfortunately, this strategy found few followers.
                                                                                                            14


Calibration from outside the model: Direct estimates of the elasticity of labor supply
from micro-level studies. There is a large literature that provides estimates of the Frisch
elasticity based on micro-level studies.9 These estimates are typically very small. In his survey
paper, Pencavel (1986) reports that most estimates for men are between 0 and 0.45, with 0.2 being
a typical point estimate. The labor supply elasticity is typically measured based on information
about the intensive margin of prime age white males, who are full-time workers in most periods.
However, it is well documented that a large fraction of hours ﬂuctuations is accounted for by
movements in and out of employment (see, for instance, Kydland and Prescott (1991) who describe
the extensive margin as responsible for two-thirds of the variation), and that those that have
the most hours variation along the cycle are not prime age males (see Kydland (1984), Rı́os-Rull
(1993), and Kydland and Prescott (1993)). In addition, Domeij and Floden (2006) argue that,
due to borrowing constraints, the estimates may be biased downward up to 50%. Imai and Keane
(2004) estimate the elasticity explicitly accounting for human capital accumulation and obtain a
value as high as 3.82. With human capital accumulation of the learning by doing variety, the macro
models would need to be adjusted as in Chang, Gomes, and Schorfheide (2002). More recently,
Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2007) estimate a value for the household elasticity of 0.72
using a deﬁnition of the household that includes both a husband and a wife, while Heathcote,
Storesletten, and Violante (2008) obtain 0.38 when taking into account household heterogeneity
and measurement error but without using the notion of a multi-person household. To encompass the
wide range of micro-level estimates, we report the behavior of an economy with Frisch elasticities
of 0.2, 0.38, and 0.72, respectively.

       To summarize, the calibration strategy involved in setting the Frisch elasticity of labor supply
does not have a unique or an uncontroversial target to be satisﬁed by an inﬁnitely lived, representative
agent model. Consequently, we will consider ﬁve values for the labor supply elasticity in the
remainder of this section. First, 𝜈 = 2 represents a value that is chosen based on strong functional
form assumptions and balanced growth path considerations. Second, we consider 𝜈 = 100, which
essentially captures the quasi-linear preferences in Hansen (1985)’s indivisible labor model. Finally,
𝜈 = 0.2 represents micro-level estimates based on labor adjustments of males along the intensive
margin, while 𝜈 = 0.38 and, especially, 𝜈 = 0.72 are micro-level estimates that take to heart some
of the criticisms of macroeconomists (Rogerson and Wallenius (2007), for instance) about what is
the object of interest when measuring the aggregate labor supply elasticity.

3.5       Quantitative Results

We are now in a position to examine the answers obtained from the diﬀerent calibration strategies.
The main ﬁndings are reported in Table 3. The top panel of the table contains results for the trend
stationary parameterization of the shock processes given in the left half of Table 2, whereas the
bottom panel summarizes results under the assumption that the shocks are diﬀerence stationary
with parameters given in the right half of that table. Conditional on the two parameter settings,
we simulate the linearized DSGE model for 310 periods using only the neutral technology process
(A), only the investment-speciﬁc technology process (V), and both technology disturbances (A+V).
We discard the ﬁrst 100 observations and calculate the variances of HP-ﬁltered output and hours
based on the remaining 210 observations. These variances are then divided by the variances of
HP-ﬁltered postwar U.S. aggregate output and hours worked. The simulation steps are repeated
1,000 times, and the entries in Table 3 correspond to means and standard deviations of the variance
ratios across the 1,000 simulations.

       The variance ratios for hours worked lie between 0.01 to 1.50, an enormous range that encompasses
all possible answers. The diﬀerences arise not from the shock processes but from the choice of
substitution elasticity. An elasticity based on the logic that preferences have to be consistent with
balanced growth yields an answer of 0.3210 (0.29 for the stochastic trend speciﬁcation). Assuming
the existence of complete markets and indivisibilities results in hours moving (much) more in the
model than in the data. An elasticity based on males responses mostly along the intensive margin
yields essentially no contribution of productivity shocks to movements in hours. If we take the
Frisch elasticities estimated by Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2008) in their clever use of
closed form solutions when taking into account household heterogeneity and measurement error
(0.38), and by Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2007) (0.72) using the total household hours
variation speciﬁcation, the answers that we obtain are 0.03 and 0.09, respectively (0.02 and 0.07 if
we impose unit roots).

       The answers that one obtains are somewhat sensitive to the choice of shock process (deterministic
versus stochastic trend). The contribution of technology shocks is larger for the deterministic trend
than for the unit root speciﬁcation. However, more striking is the enormous sensitivity to the
Frisch elasticity, which generates variations in the results by more than two orders of magnitude.
Interestingly, the investment-speciﬁc technical change is the main culprit of hours variation with
over 80% of the total variation in all model economies. Output variation, on the other hand, is
  10
       This is the same answer obtained by Kydland and Prescott (1991). They reported a ratio of standard deviations
of about two-thirds, which corresponds with around 0.44 in terms of variances.

mostly driven by the neutral technology process.11 The variance ratios for output range from 20%
to 80%. Output variation is directly aﬀected by the neutral technology shock and indirectly through
the ﬂuctuation of hours and capital over the business cycle.



4         Bayesian Estimation of the DSGE Model

We now turn to the search for the answer of how important are productivity shocks for movements
in hours when using formal econometric methods.                    We use Bayesian estimation techniques,12
partly as a result of personal tastes and expertise and partly because they reﬂect state-of-the-
art econometrics and are by now widely used in practice. First, we choose the observables and the
model speciﬁcations to be estimated. Second, we describe how we elicit priors for DSGE model
parameters and for Frisch elasticity of labor supply, and then discuss posterior estimates. Third,
we present variance ratios for hours worked computed from HP-ﬁltered simulated and actual data
for all model speciﬁcation and data set combinations. Finally, we discuss the identiﬁcation of labor
supply elasticity and shed light on why our estimation yields a fairly low estimate of it.


4.1         Data and Estimated Speciﬁcations

A crucial step in the estimation is the choice of observables 𝑌 that enter the likelihood function
𝑝(𝑌 ∣𝜃). Since the goal is to determine the contribution of productivity shocks to the variation of
hours, these series should be ingredients for our estimation. Following the tradition in econometrics,
we use labor productivity instead of total factor productivity, because the construction of the latter
would require the knowledge of parameters that we are trying to estimate. Fortunately, according
to our theory the investment-speciﬁc technology shock is under perfect competition exactly the
relative price of consumption versus investment. This gives us the three main series to use in the
estimation: labor productivity 𝑌 /𝐻, hours worked 𝐻, and relative price of investment goods 𝑃 .

         With three series and two shocks, one encounters a well-known singularity problem. According
to the model, there exists a linear combination of the three series that can be predicted without
error conditional on past observations. To overcome the singularity, researchers either introduce
measurement errors, e.g., Altug (1989), or include additional shocks, e.g., Leeper and Sims (1994).
In our case, as we want to measure the contribution of productivity shocks, we have to give the
    11
         One should not compare the contribution of the neutral shock with the total factor productivity (TFP) shock
in most of the literature because they are computed very diﬀerently. In fact, the procedure that we followed in this
paper reduces the role of the neutral technology shock because we increase the size of the stock of capital.
  12
     A detailed review of the Bayesian estimation of DSGE models can be found in An and Schorfheide (2007).
                                                                                                                     17


model economy a solid additional mechanism to also move hours. This makes it more attractive to
add structural shocks and not just measurement errors. Given the ﬁndings of, among many others,
Hall (1997) and Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2007), a natural additional shock is a preference
shock that aﬀects the choice of hours worked. Consider the following variation of the utility function
                        1+1/𝜈
                      𝐻𝑡
𝑈𝑡 = ln 𝐶𝑡 − 𝐵𝑡 𝜉     1+1/𝜈     , where ln 𝐵𝑡 = 𝜌𝑏 ln 𝐵𝑡−1 − (𝜎𝑏 /𝜈)𝜖𝑏,𝑡 is such a preference shock. This will
be our baseline speciﬁcation.

       We will also consider two additional speciﬁcations for the sake of completeness. First, instead
of a preference shock, one can introduce a demand shock, such as a government spending shock,
which changes the aggregate resource constraint to 𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 . We assume that government
expenditures are ﬁnanced by lump-sum taxes and are determined as a time-varying fraction of
total output, 𝐺𝑡 = (1 − 1/𝑔𝑡 )𝑌𝑡 . The process for government expenditures is exogenous and
evolves according to ln(𝑔𝑡 /𝑔 ∗ ) = 𝜌𝑔 ln(𝑔𝑡−1 /𝑔 ∗ ) + 𝜎𝑔 𝜖𝑔,𝑡 .13 Second, we consider a version of our
model in which the preference shock and the government expenditure shock are simultaneously
active. Consequently, we denote the resulting model speciﬁcations by {𝐴, 𝑉, 𝐵}, {𝐴, 𝑉, 𝐺}, and
{𝐴, 𝑉, 𝐵, 𝐺}.14

       Since the accumulation of the quality-adjusted investment series provides a measure of the
capital stock, which in combination with aggregate output and hours worked identiﬁes the neutral
technology shock via the production function (see Section 3.2), we consider ln 𝑋𝑡 as a fourth
observable. We estimate the model speciﬁcations based on three samples: {𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃 }, {𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑋},
and {𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃, 𝑋}, with the qualiﬁcation that only the four-shock model is estimated based on
the four-variable sample.


4.2       From Priors to Posteriors

Priors.       The prior distributions for the coeﬃcients of the two technology processes are identical
to those used in Section 3.3 and summarized in Table 1. As before, we will estimate versions of
the DSGE model speciﬁcations in which technology shocks are stationary and versions in which
we impose unit-root restrictions. The prior densities for the remaining DSGE model parameters
are provided in Table 4. When we estimated only the shock processes, we introduced the location
parameters ln 𝐴0 and ln 𝑉0 . For the estimation of the full DSGE model based on time series of the
  13
       This speciﬁcation leads to the relationship ln 𝑌𝑡 = ln(𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 ) + ln 𝑔𝑡 and implies that the government share of
output is stationary.
  14
     Modern variations on this model, containing additional frictions such as sticky prices and wages (and choices of
households outside their labor supply function), monopolistic competition, monetary distortions and the like, allow
for many more shocks. See, for example, Smets and Wouters (2007).
                                                                                                    18


log levels of output, hours, and the relative price of investment, we parameterize the DSGE model
in terms of ln 𝑌0 , which replaces ln 𝐴0 , as well as ln 𝑉0 and the steady-state level of hours ln 𝐻∗ ,
which replaces 𝜉. This re-parameterization simpliﬁes prior elicitation because in principle it allows
us to use pre-sample observations. However, as before, we use fairly uninformative priors for these
location parameters.

   The elicitation of the prior distributions for 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝛿 follows the same steps as the calibration
in Section 3.1. Note that this elicitation is based on observables that are not included in the
likelihood function, such as real interest rates, the labor share, and the size of the capital stock.
We use degenerate priors for two of the parameters: discount factor and depreciation rate are ﬁxed
at 𝛽 = 0.99 and 𝛿 = 0.013. Based on the labor share data, we choose a prior for 𝛼 that is centered
at 0.34 with a standard deviation of 0.02. The prior distribution for the autocorrelation of the
preference shock is centered at 0.8 and has a standard deviation of 0.1. The corresponding values
for the government spending shock process are 0.95 and 0.1. We set 𝑔 ∗ = 1.2 if the government
spending shock is included in the model and equal to one otherwise.

   Our prior for the Frisch labor supply elasticity is centered at the balanced growth path value of
𝜈 = 2, but with a standard deviation of one. Hence, a 90% a priori credible interval encompasses
values found in studies that use micro-level data for employed males, as well as the values necessary
to be able to explain most of the observed volatility in hours worked in a stochastic growth model
driven by technology shocks. We will also brieﬂy discuss how our results change if we center the
prior for 𝜈 at 0.72 instead of 2, which is the value obtained from Heathcote, Storesletten, and
Violante (2007)’s analysis of micro-level data.


Sample period and estimation. All versions of the DSGE model are estimated based on
observations from 1955:Q3 to 2006:Q4, conditioning on observations from 1954:Q3 to 1955:Q2. This
conditioning will allow a comparison of marginal likelihoods between the DSGE model speciﬁcations
and a VAR. We use the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods reviewed in An and Schorfheide (2007)
to obtain draws from the posterior distribution of the DSGE model parameters. Detailed estimation
results are provided in Table A-1 in the appendix. As long as the relative price of investment is
included as an observable in the estimation, the estimates of the technology shock parameters
are very similar to those reported in Table 2. If the DSGE model is estimated on the Y/H, H,
X data set, then 𝜓ˆ2,𝑣 is close to zero, meaning that the growth rates of the investment-speciﬁc
technology process are approximately serially uncorrelated. In part due to the fairly tight prior
on 𝛼, the posterior mean estimates fall in the range of 0.32 to 0.39. Thus, the speciﬁc statistical
methods used here did not change the estimates of these parameters. The coeﬃcient estimates
                                                                                                    19


for the preference and government spending shocks are such that the model is able to capture the
variation in output and hours worked that is not explained by the two technology shocks. We will
now turn to the estimates of the Frisch elasticity, which is the parameter that really matters, as it
determines the answer to our quantitative question.


Estimates of the Frisch elasticity.        Table 5 reports 90% posterior credible intervals for the
labor supply elasticity. If the observables consist of productivity, hours worked, and the relative
price of investment, the credible intervals span the range 0.05 to 1.1 and are somewhat larger if
the shocks are assumed to be trend stationary, yet highly persistent. If the price of investment
is replaced by the quantity, the estimates of 𝜈 tend to increase, in particular if the government
spending shock is included as shock in the model. Finally, if the four-shock model speciﬁcation is
estimated based on four series, the labor supply elasticity estimate drops to the range of 0.03 to
0.27. To summarize, if we use three shocks, the elasticity estimates are in the range of those recently
estimated by Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2007, 2008) that are the modern version of
studies that use micro data, while the use of four shocks reduces the estimate to values obtained
using only the variation of the intensive margin of males.


4.3     Quantitative Results

So far, the econometric analysis has generated multiple sets of parameter estimates, which in
turn will lead to a multitude of answers for our quantitative question. However, not all model
speciﬁcations ﬁt the time series data equally well, and one can use a measure of time series ﬁt to
assign more weight to parameter estimates and predictions obtained from model speciﬁcations that
attain a better ﬁt. Formally, as in Section 3.3, we use log marginal likelihoods to update prior
model probabilities.

      For each of the three data sets, Table 6 reports log marginal likelihood diﬀerentials (or log
Bayes factors), using the speciﬁcation with the highest marginal likelihood as a benchmark. For
the Y/H, H, P data set it appears to be slightly preferable to impose unit roots in the two technology
processes and to augment the DSGE model with a government expenditure shock. Based on Y/H,
H, X observations, the trend-stationary speciﬁcations are preferred in the three-shock models.
However, the best ﬁt is obtained by the four-shock version with unit root technology processes.
However, the log marginal likelihood diﬀerentials are overall fairly small, indicating that the data
can only imperfectly discriminate among the various speciﬁcations.
                                                                                                          20


       Given a set of prior probabilities for the various DSGE model speciﬁcations, the log marginal
likelihoods can be transformed into posterior probabilities, using a generalization of (10).15 Table 7
reports the posterior probabilities that are calculated under the assumption that for each data set,
all DSGE model speciﬁcations have equal prior probability. Cells for model speciﬁcations with
essentially zero posterior probability are left blank. While these posterior probabilities are not
suitable for comparisons of estimates (and their quantitative implications) across data sets, they
do provide coherent model speciﬁcation weights conditional on a particular data set.

       For each model speciﬁcation and data set combination, Table 8 reports means and standard
deviations of variance ratios computed from HP-ﬁltered simulated and actual data. All entries refer
to the combined eﬀect of neutral and investment-speciﬁc technology shocks on output and hours
worked, and the boldfaced entries indicate posterior probabilities higher than 5%. The variance
ratio results mimic the labor supply elasticity estimates: high elasticities yield large eﬀects. The
largest eﬀect of technology shocks on hours worked ﬂuctuations is obtained from the A, V, G
speciﬁcation estimated based on Y/H, H, X data, explaining about 20% of the observed variation.
Weighted by posterior model probabilities, we conclude from the Y/H, H, X data that 6% of
hours ﬂuctuations (and 26% of output ﬂuctuations) are generated by technology shocks. The
corresponding numbers for the Y/H, H, P data set are 2% and 21%, respectively. Due to the small
value of the estimated labor supply elasticity based on the Y/H, H, P, X data set, hours essentially
do not move in response to technology shocks and they explain about 21% of output ﬂuctuations.
Comparing the standard deviations in Tables 3 and 8, it is apparent that accounting for parameter
uncertainty increases the variability of the variance ratios substantially. We re-estimated some of
the models with a prior for 𝜈 centered at 0.72. This lowers the posterior estimates of 𝜈 and slightly
reduces the importance of the technology shocks for hours ﬂuctuations.

       A recent literature uses an expanded version of the neoclassical growth model, includes various
nominal and real frictions as well as several additional shocks, and provides an answer to the
same question that we pursue. Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2009a) estimate one of
these expanded models with the same Bayesian techniques used in this paper. They assess the
contribution of technology shocks (especially investment-speciﬁc shocks) to be up to 60% of hours
variation at business cycle frequencies. The reasons for this discrepancy with our ﬁndings include
the fact that in their environment with ﬁxed wages, a fraction of agents is unable to re-optimize
their price and forced to supply whatever number of hours is demanded at the posted price; thus,
even with small Frisch elasticity, hours tend to move a lot in response to technology shocks. Another

       Consider a collection of models ℳ𝑚 , 𝑚 = 1, . . . , 𝑀 . The posterior probability of ℳ𝑚 is 𝜋(ℳ𝑚 ∣𝑌 ) =
                                       ∑𝑀
𝜋(ℳ𝑚 )𝑝(𝑌 ∣ℳ𝑚 )/𝑝(𝑌 ), where 𝑝(𝑌 ) =    𝑚=1 𝜋(ℳ𝑚 )𝑝(𝑌 ∣ℳ𝑚 ) and 𝜋(ℳ𝑚 ) is the prior probability of ℳ𝑚 .
                                                                                                     21


source of discrepancy, at least compared to our estimation with the Y/H, H, P and Y/H, H, P,
X data sets, is the fact that they treat the investment shock as a latent process, which turns
out to be much more volatile than the relative price of investment. Justiniano, Primiceri, and
Tambalotti (2009b) include the relative price of investment as an observable but allow for an
additional (unobserved) shock, to the marginal eﬃciency of installed investment. They ﬁnd that
this shock plays a big role in accounting for hours variation relative to the observed shocks to the
relative price of investment. Liu, Waggoner, and Zha (2009) impute most of the role in shaping
ﬂuctuations (especially when focusing on the Great Moderation) on the role of neutral technological
shocks, capital depreciation shocks, and wage mark-up shocks, while they argue that investment-
speciﬁc technology shocks played a small role.

      Overall, the econometrics procedure points to a relatively low labor supply elasticity, especially
if we let two additional shocks (government expenditure and preference shocks), on top of the
productivity shocks, move hours. There is, however, one important caveat. In Table 6 we also
report log marginal likelihoods for a VAR with four lags under a Minnesota prior. For all three
data sets, the VAR attains a better time series ﬁt than the DSGE model speciﬁcation as indicated
by the positive marginal likelihood diﬀerence in excess of 30 relative to the preferred DSGE model
version. The superior ﬁt of the VARs is evidence for DSGE model misspeciﬁcation in the sense
that some of the theory implied cross-equation restrictions are at odds with the data. We now
look in more detail at how these procedures identify the elasticity, and the extent to which such
identiﬁcation results are convincing.


4.4     Identiﬁcation of the Labor Supply Elasticity

The likelihood-based estimator, at the heart of econometrics, delivers a parameter value for which
the model implied autocovariance function of the observables matches the sample autocovariance
function as closely as possible in terms of a statistical metric. It does so by forcing each shock
in the model to contribute particular autocovariance features, which in total have to mimic the
sample autocovariances. This matching is, unfortunately, often diﬃcult to interpret because there
is no transparent link from patterns in the data to particular parameter estimates. The goal of this
section is to shed some light on why our likelihood-based estimation yields a fairly low estimate of
the labor supply elasticity.

      In a traditional simultaneous equations model that characterizes demand and supply in a
market, the identiﬁcation condition for the supply elasticity is the availability of an observable
exogenous variable that only shifts the demand curve. One can then measure the simultaneous
                                                                                                   22


change in prices and quantities in response to a change in the demand shifter, which in turn identiﬁes
the supply elasticity. Identiﬁcation in a DSGE model is more complicated for two reasons. First,
unobserved structural shocks rather than directly observed exogenous variables play the role of
demand and supply shifters. Second, any given structural shock is likely to shift both the demand
and the supply function simultaneously. A neutral technology shock, for example, tends to increase
labor demand because the marginal product of labor increases. At the same time, this rise in
income generated by higher productivity might induce the household to reduce its labor supply.
Thus, if one has direct observations on an exogenous shock and the supply and demand curves shift
simultaneously, the challenge is to disentangle the slopes of both curves. If the exogenous shock is
a latent variable, then the identiﬁcation of the labor supply elasticity becomes even more tenuous
because the mapping from the observables into the latent shock might depend on it.

   According to our simple DSGE model, data on the relative price of investment can serve as
direct observations for the investment-speciﬁc technology shock. Thus, the {𝑚𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃 } and
{𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃, 𝑋} data sets include direct observations of a shock that shifts the labor market
equilibrium. Moreover, data on output, hours worked, and quality-adjusted investment implicitly
generate an observation of the neutral technology shock as follows. According to the capital
accumulation equation:
                                   𝑡−1
                                   ∑
                          𝐾𝑡+1 =         (1 − 𝛿)𝑗 𝑋𝑡 + (1 − 𝛿)𝑡−1 𝐾1 ,   𝑡 > 1.
                                   𝑗=0

Since 𝛿 > 0 for 𝑡 suﬃciently large, the capital stock is well approximated by a weighted average
of past investment. As in the calibration analysis, the neutral technology shock can be recovered
from the production function
                                                       𝑌𝑡
                                             𝐴𝑡 =            .
                                                    𝐾𝑡 𝐻𝑡1−𝛼
                                                     𝛼

Notice that the construction of 𝐴𝑡 does not depend on the value of the labor supply elasticity 𝜈 and
recall that 𝛼 can be identiﬁed from labor share observations, which entered our analysis indirectly
through the prior distribution.

   The assumption that the technology shocks are exogenous generates exclusion restrictions that
are suﬃcient to identify dynamic responses of labor market variables to innovations in 𝜖𝑣,𝑡 (𝜖𝑎,𝑡 )
in the {𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃 } {𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑋} and {𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃, 𝑋} data sets. Since the two technology shocks
enter the model in an identical manner, without loss of generality we will focus on the response
to an investment-speciﬁc technology shock. Along the response to a technology shock, the labor
supply condition, here written in terms of temporal diﬀerences Δ, has to be satisﬁed:

                                                    ˆ𝑡 − Δˆ
                                          Δℎ̂𝑡 = 𝜈(Δ𝑤     𝑐𝑡 ).                                  (12)
                                                                                                   23


Here ℎ̂𝑡 denotes hours in percentage deviations from its steady state, and 𝑤
                                                                           ˆ𝑡 and 𝑐ˆ𝑡 denote
percentage deviations of detrended real wages and consumption from their respective steady states.
Since consumption is not included in the list of observables used in our likelihood-based estimation,
we will replace it by a function of wages, hours, and technology shock. Assuming that 𝜓1,𝑣 = 1,
that is, the investment-speciﬁc technology process is diﬀerence stationary, we show in the appendix
that in response to a one standard deviation investment-speciﬁc technology shock in period 𝑡 = 1
the wage and hours dynamics for 𝑡 > 1 can be expressed as:
                             [                                         ]
                                        ∗      −1               𝑡−1 𝜎𝑣
                     Δℎ̂𝑡 = 𝜈 Δ𝑤  ˆ𝑡 + 𝑟 (1 − 𝛼 )𝑤ˆ𝑡 − (−𝜓2,𝑣 )          ,                       (13)
                                                                   1−𝛼

where 𝑟∗ = 𝑅∗ /(𝑅∗ + 1 − 𝛿), and 𝑅∗ = 𝑒(𝛾𝑎 +𝛾𝑣 )/(1−𝛼) /𝛽 − (1 − 𝛿). Recall that 𝑟∗ and 𝛼 are
identiﬁable from long-run averages of the labor share, real interest rates, and the investment-capital
ratio, which enter our estimation objective function implicitly through the prior distribution. Thus,
information on the impulse responses of wages (which are equal to average labor productivity in
our Cobb-Douglas environment with constant factor shares) and hours worked to an investment-
speciﬁc technology shock, which is encoded in the likelihood function, suﬃces to identify the labor
supply elasticity.

    Broadly speaking, technology shocks for which we can implicitly construct observations independently
of the labor supply elasticity play the same role as exogenous demand shifters (or instrumental
variables) in the analysis of traditional simultaneous equations systems: they perturb the market
equilibrium and move prices and quantities. However, in DSGE models these technology shocks tend
to shift both supply and demand. Since the slope of the labor demand function is through functional
form assumptions essentially identiﬁed from the average labor share, observing the movements of
wages and hours in response to the perturbation is suﬃcient for the determination of the labor
supply elasticity.

    Thus far, we have established that the labor supply elasticity is identiﬁable based on the
information (both prior and sample) that we are using in the estimation. We will focus on the
{𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃 } data set and the {𝐴, 𝑉, 𝐵} DSGE model speciﬁcation in which technology shocks are
diﬀerence stationary and the third shock is a preference shock. Using actual and simulated data we
estimate a structural VAR(4) in labor productivity growth, hours worked, and investment-speciﬁc
technology growth, imposing the following identiﬁcation restrictions: two of the three shocks driving
{𝑌 /𝐻, 𝐻, 𝑃 } are technology shocks. The investment-speciﬁc technology growth (inﬂation in the
relative price of investment) is exogenous and follows an AR(1) process. The non-technology shock
does not shift the labor demand schedule upon impact because capital is ﬁxed in the short-run.
These restrictions are also hardwired into our DSGE model.
                                                                                                      24


       Based on the Y/H, H, P data set, we construct posterior estimates of the DSGE model
parameters subject to the restrictions that the two technology shocks have a stochastic trend and
that the Frisch elasticity is equal to either 0.2 or 2.0. We then use these estimates to generate two
time series of 2,000 observations, one based on a model with a low Frisch elasticity and one based
on a large Frisch elasticity. The resulting VAR-based impulse response estimates are depicted in
Figure 1. While the response estimates of productivity and hours to a neutral technology (A) shock
and a non-technology (B) shock obtained from actual and simulated data more or less match, there
is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence across samples between the estimated response of productivity and hours
to an investment-speciﬁc technology (V) shock. For instance, based on actual data the productivity
response to the investment shock is negative, whereas it is (slightly) positive for simulated data.
Thus, in view of this impulse response mismatch, the DSGE model appears to be misspeciﬁed or the
investment shock to be mismeasured, which is consistent with the evidence from the log marginal
likelihoods reported in Table 6.

       The hours responses provide conﬂicting information about the labor supply elasticity. To match
the responses to an investment shock and the non-technology shock, the labor supply elasticity
should be small; that is, a value of 0.2 is preferred over a value of 2. To reproduce the empirical
response to a neutral technology shock, on the other hand, a large Frisch elasticity is needed.
The estimate of 𝜈 is ultimately determined by the implicit weighting of the discrepancy between
sample and DSGE model implied autocovariance functions (and hence VAR-based impulse response
function estimates) encoded in the likelihood function. It turned out to be low, which suggests that
the B- and V-shock responses received relatively more weight than the A-shock response.

       To the extent that the relative price of investment potentially provides only a noisy measure
of investment-speciﬁc technology and overstates the serial correlation of technology growth rates
or the propagation of the investment shock is incorrectly modelled, heavily relying on the hours
response to an innovation in the price of investment goods for the identiﬁcation of a key parameter
may be undesirable. Rather than using the implicit weighting of the likelihood function, one could
construct an alternative estimator of 𝜈 based on weighting schemes that place more weight on,
say, the response to a neutral technology shock.16 This estimator of 𝜈 would be larger than the
estimates reported in Table 5. Ultimately, such a procedure is likely to reproduce the same answer
to the question of the importance of technology shocks, which is obtained from a structural VAR.
This VAR uses only a minimal subset of restrictions implied by our theoretical model, just suﬃcient
to identify innovations to structural shocks.
  16
       Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) follow this path when estimating a monetary DSGE model by
matching responses to a monetary policy shock.

5    Conclusion

The analysis in the previous sections suggests that the diﬀerences in the answers provided by the
various quantitative methods are not due to the statistical apparatus but instead due to the source
of identiﬁcation of key parameters, a fundamental economic issue. In a perfect world, diﬀerent
sources would yield mutually consistent conclusions after the precision of the information has been
properly accounted for. Unfortunately, that is not the case if one works with fairly stylized and
to some extent misspeciﬁed models, as we do in quantitative macroeconomics. The reality is that
diﬀerent identiﬁcation approaches often yield conﬂicting results.

    Our application illustrated that among calibrated models, the answers diﬀer dramatically
depending on the source of information about the Frisch elasticity. While it is easy to doubt
the two extreme values (which are based on middle-aged full-time working white men, the most
irrelevant group from a business cycle point of view or in never seen lotteries), the value of 2 is
also not free from strong criticism. It is based on the logic of balanced growth paths, which has
come under attack recently (Herrendorf and Rı́os-Rull (2009)). After all, it is hard to see what
insights long-term trends generate for business cycle issues. The use of micro based estimates that
take into account both the work of men and women and the intensive and extensive margins as in
Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2007, 2008) deliver arguably the most plausible estimates
of 𝜈 and imply that between 3% to 9% of hours ﬂuctuations are explained by technology shocks.

    Understanding the source of parameter identiﬁcation in the context of likelihood-based estimation
is diﬃcult and has been neglected in the recent literature on DSGE model estimation. We made
some progress in the context of our fairly stylized stochastic growth model by characterizing the
model-implied restrictions that identify structural shocks and comparing VAR impulse response
functions estimated based on actual and simulated data. While this analysis is useful for understanding
whether parameters are identiﬁable, it is diﬃcult to disentangle what drives a particular estimate,
once it becomes apparent that there are patterns in the data that the model is unable to reproduce.
Moreover, this approach is potentially sensitive to mismeasurements of shock innovations as well
as misspeciﬁcation of the propagation mechanisms, such as omissions of short-term adjustment
mechanisms that generate hump-shaped instead of monotonic responses. Nonetheless, based on our
Bayesian estimation, we ﬁnd that across diﬀerent model speciﬁcations about 6% of the variation of
hours is due to technology shocks, though some speciﬁcations yield estimates as high as 20%. It is
interesting to note that despite very diﬀerent sources of identiﬁcation, our preferred calibration and
the Bayesian estimation yield similar answers, conditional on a common theoretical framework.
                                                                                               26


   The exercises conducted in this paper have convinced us that, regardless of our preferences
for quantitative methodologies, we should place more emphasis on searching for reliable sources of
identiﬁcation of key parameters and making these sources transparent to our audience.

A.2        The Relative Price of Quality-Adjusted Investment

We construct the relative price of quality-adjusted investment, 𝑃𝑡𝐼 , as a Tornquist aggregate of the
price index of quality-adjusted equipment investment and the price index of structures investment.
We use the price index of consumption, 𝑃𝑡𝐶 , as a proxy for the price of structures investment.18
Based on 𝑃𝑡𝐼 and 𝑃𝑡𝐶 , we deﬁne the relative price of investment goods (using the consumption good
as numeraire) as
                                                               𝑃𝑡𝐼

Its inverse, 𝑉𝑡 =     𝑃𝑡 ,   is investment-speciﬁc technical change. We set 𝑉0 =         𝑃0    = 1, that is, we assume
real capital is equal to capital in eﬃciency units in 1947.

Quarterly Quality-Adjusted Price Index for Investment in Equipment, QAPIEQ𝑡 . We
use the U.S. 1947-2000 annual series provided by Cummins and Violante (2002) for the price index
of equipment investment, QAPIEQ𝐶𝑉
                               𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 , and impute the quarterly movements of the oﬃcial FAT-

BEA price index of equipment investment, OPIEQ𝑡 , using the Denton method. For the years after
2000, we use the oﬃcial price index OPIEQ𝑡 , rescaled such that it equates the value in Cummins
and Violante (2002) in the year 2000. Thus, we consider that the hedonic methods used to compute
the oﬃcial price index correctly quality-adjust most of types equipment investment after 2000.

Quarterly Quality-Adjusted Price Index for Total Investment, 𝑃𝑡𝐼 . We use a Tornquist
price index aggregate that weights growth rates of the price index of investment in equipment
and the price index of investment in structures by their nominal shares 𝑠𝐼𝐸𝑄
                                                                         𝑡   and 𝑠𝐼𝑆𝑇
                                                                                  𝑡   . Nominal
equipment investment is the sum of private equipment investment (PrivIEQ𝑡 ), government equipment
investment (GovIEQ𝑡 ), changes in inventories (ChInv𝑡 ), and consumer durables (CD𝑡 ). Nominal
structures investment is the sum of private structures investment (PrivIST𝑡 ) and government
structures investment (GovIST𝑡 ). The growth rate of the quarterly quality-adjusted price index for
total investment is
                               (                 )                     (                 )

                                                                                   𝑡−1
                  𝜆(𝑃𝑡𝐼 ) =                          𝜆(QAPIEQ𝑡 ) +                           𝜆(𝑃𝑡𝐶 ),

where 𝜆(𝑥𝑡 ) = (𝑥𝑡 − 𝑥𝑡−1 )/𝑥𝑡 and changes in the price index for consumption goods, 𝜆(𝑃𝑡𝐶 ), serve
as proxy for inﬂation in the price of structures. The level of quarterly quality-adjusted price index
  18
       As is the standard in previous literature, we use the consumption deﬂator as the price index for investment in
structures (see Fisher (2006) and Canova, Lopez-Salido, and Michelacci (2007)). This provides internal consistency
in the way we compute the quality-adjusted price index for total (equipment + investment) investment — one of
the elements of output is investment, hence, the alternative use of an output (instead of a consumption) deﬂator
potentially distorts the very same measure we are trying to compute, an investment deﬂator.

for total investment is recovered recursively,

                                        𝑃𝑡𝐼 = 𝑃𝑡−1

                                                   [1 + 𝜆(𝑃𝑡𝐼 )].

We use the initial value 𝑃0𝐼 suggested in Cummins and Violante (2002).

Quarterly Price Index for Consumption, 𝑃𝑡𝐶 . We use a Tornquist price index aggregate that
weights growth rates of price indexes for nondurables consumption (food, clothing and shoes, and
others) and services (household operations, transportation, medical care, recreation, and others)
by their nominal shares. Let 𝑃𝑡𝐶,𝑖 be the price index for nondurable consumption/service good 𝑖 in
quarter 𝑡 computed as the ratio between nominal consumption of good 𝑖, CONS𝑖𝑡 , and the quantity
index of good 𝑖, QCONS𝑖𝑡 . Let 𝑠𝑖𝑡 be the corresponding nominal share of good 𝑖 in period 𝑡. Then,
the growth rate of the price index for consumption is
                                               ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝑠𝑖𝑡−1
                                   𝜆(𝑃𝑡𝐶 ) =                   𝜆(𝑃𝑡𝐶,𝑖 ),
                                                       2
                                                 𝑖

The level of the consumption price index is recovered recursively,

                                       𝑃𝑡𝐶 = 𝑃𝑡−1
                                              𝐶
                                                  [1 + 𝜆(𝑃𝑡𝐶 )]

where we set 𝑃0𝐶 such that the initial relative price of investment is equal to one; see below.


A.3    Neutral Technical Change

The series of neutral technical change is computed using measures of real output 𝑌𝑡 , real capital 𝐾𝑡 ,
and labor input 𝐻𝑡 , together with an estimate of the input shares of production. Real output 𝑌𝑡 is
computed as the nominal gross national product, GNP𝑡 , deﬂated by 𝑃𝑡 . We convert output, capital,
and hours in per capita terms dividing by civilian noninstitutional population 𝑃 𝑜𝑝16𝑡 . We explicitly
consider capital quality improvement represented by the historical fall in the real price of investment.
To do so, we build quarterly series for investment in eﬃciency units and physical depreciation rates
that we use to construct series of quality-adjusted capital stock. Quality adjustments substantially
change the series of capital — real capital falls below capital in eﬃciency units and aﬀects the trend
of neutral technical change.

Quarterly Quality-Adjusted Investment, 𝑋𝑡 . Total investment in eﬃciency units is deﬁned
as total deannualized nominal investment deﬂated by the quality-adjusted price of investment,

                                               InvEQ𝑡 + InvST𝑡
                                       𝑋𝑡 =                    .
                                                     𝑃𝑡𝐼
                                                                                                   A-4


Quarterly Quality-Adjusted Depreciation Rates, 𝛿𝑡 . We build on the time-varying annual
physical depreciation rates for total capital provided in Cummins and Violante (2002) for the period
            𝐶𝑉 . For the years after 2000, we assume a constant depreciation rate equal to that
1947-2000, 𝛿𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟
in year 2000. We deﬁne 𝛿 as the average quarterly depreciation rate over the period 1955:Q3 to
2006:Q4: 𝛿 = 0.013.

Quarterly Quality-Adjusted Capital Stock, 𝐾𝑡 . We have created quarterly quality-adjusted
investment series, 𝑋𝑡 , and quarterly series for the quality-adjusted depreciation rate, 𝛿𝑡 . Then
we can construct the series of capital in eﬃciency units recursively using the perpetual inventory
method,
                                        𝐾𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿) 𝐾𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡

where the initial capital stock in eﬃciency units, 𝐾0 , is calibrated using the steady-state investment
equation
                                 𝐾0   𝑉0 𝐼0
                                    =       (1 − (1 − 𝛿) exp (−𝜆𝐾 ))−1 .
                                 𝑌0    𝑌0
We obtain the unconditional mean of the investment-output ratio is 0.284, and the quarterly capital
per capita growth rate averages 1.08%. This yields an initial quarterly capital-output ratio of 11.6
(or 2.92 annually), which together with the initial value of real output pins down an initial eﬃcient
capital stock.

Neutral Technical Change, 𝐴𝑡 . The series of neutral technical change is computed as

                                                         𝑌𝑡
                                            𝐴𝑡 =               ,
                                                   𝐾𝑡𝛼   𝐻𝑡1−𝛼
             ∑     𝛼𝑡
where 𝛼 =        𝑡 𝑇    is the average capital share augmented to incorporate capital income from
government capital and durables.

ﬁlter by assuming that all hat-variables are equal to zero in period 𝑡 = −20, where 𝑡 = 1 corresponds
to the ﬁrst observation in our sample. All likelihood function values in this paper are computed
conditional on the ﬁrst four sample observations (𝑡 = 1, . . . , 4).



C     Impulse Response to a Technology Shock

We will show that the impulse response function of labor productivity and hours worked suﬃces
to identify the labor supply elasticity. It is apparent from (A.2) that the two technology shocks
enter the system in an identical manner, at least as far as detrended output, consumption, wages,
hours, capital, and the rental rate of capital is concerned. Hence, without loss of generality we will
focus on the response to an investment-speciﬁc technology shock. We will assume that 𝜓1,𝑣 = 1
and deﬁne 𝑣˜𝑡 = 𝑣ˆ𝑡 /(1 − 𝛼) and omit the hats from all other variables. Thus, the impulse response
function has to satisfy the following equilibrium conditions:

                                 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 𝑘𝑡 + 𝑣˜𝑡                                                 (A.4)

                                𝑤𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − ℎ𝑡

                                 𝑐𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑐𝑡+1 ] − 𝑟∗ 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑡+1 ] + 𝐸𝑡 [˜
                                                                       𝑣𝑡+1 ]

                                 ℎ𝑡 = 𝜈(𝑤𝑡 − 𝑐𝑡 )

where 𝑟∗ = 𝑅∗ /(𝑅∗ +1−𝛿), 𝑠𝑐 = 𝑔∗ 𝐶 ∗ /𝑌 ∗ , 𝑠𝑖 = 𝑔∗ 𝐼 ∗ /𝑌 ∗ , and 𝛿 ∗ = 1−(1−𝛿)/(𝑞 ∗ 𝑣 ∗ ). To construct
the impulse response function we assume that the system is in its steady state prior to 𝑡 = 1, that
𝜖𝑣,1 = 1, and 𝜖𝑣,𝑡 = 0 for 𝑡 > 1. Thus, the time-path of the technology growth process is given by

                                                     𝜎𝑣
                                𝑣˜𝑡 = (−𝜓2,𝑣 )𝑡−1       ,   𝐸𝑡 [˜
                                                                𝑣𝑡+1 ] = 𝑣˜𝑡 .                      (A.5)
                                                    1−𝛼
                                                                                                   A-7


After period 1 there is perfect foresight along the impulse response, and for any variable 𝑥𝑡 it is
the case that 𝐸𝑡 [𝑥𝑡+1 ] = 𝑥𝑡+1 . With this in mind, we write the system for 𝑡 > 1 as

                                 𝑤𝑡 = 𝑦 𝑡 − ℎ𝑡                                                   (A.6)

                             Δ𝑐𝑡+1 = 𝑟∗ (𝑦𝑡+1 − 𝑘𝑡+1 ) + (𝑟∗ − 1)˜
                                                                 𝑣𝑡+1

                                 ℎ𝑡 = 𝜈(𝑤𝑡 − 𝑐𝑡 )

                                 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑠𝑐 𝑐𝑡 + 𝑠𝑖 𝑖𝑡

                                 𝑤𝑡 = 𝛼(𝑘𝑡 − ℎ𝑡 ) − 𝛼˜
                                                     𝑣𝑡

                               𝑘𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿 ∗ )𝑘𝑡 + 𝛿 ∗ 𝑖𝑡 − (1 − 𝛿 ∗ )˜
                                                                        𝑣𝑡

The Frisch elasticity can be obtained from the response function of wages, i.e., labor productivity,
and hours worked, because it has to satisfy

                                    Δℎ𝑡+1 = 𝜈(Δ𝑤𝑡+1 + Δ𝑐𝑡+1 ).                                   (A.7)

While we do not use direct information on consumption in our empirical analysis, we can deduce
from (A.6) that

                       Δ𝑐𝑡+1 = 𝑟∗ (𝑦𝑡+1 − 𝑘𝑡+1 ) + (𝑟∗ − 1)˜
                                                           𝑣𝑡+1

                               = 𝑟∗ (𝑤𝑡+1 − (𝑘𝑡+1 − ℎ𝑡+1 )) + (𝑟∗ − 1)˜
                                                                      𝑣𝑡+1

                               = 𝑟∗ (𝑤𝑡+1 − 𝛼−1 𝑤𝑡+1 − 𝑣˜𝑡+1 ) + (𝑟∗ − 1)˜
                                                                         𝑣𝑡+1

                               = 𝑟∗ (1 − 𝛼−1 )𝑤𝑡+1 − 𝑣˜𝑡+1 .

Thus, for 𝑡 > 1 the impulse response function of wages and hours needs to satisfy
                                [                                         ]
                                           ∗      −1               𝑡 𝜎𝑣
                     Δℎ𝑡+1 = 𝜈 Δ𝑤𝑡+1 + 𝑟 (1 − 𝛼 )𝑤𝑡+1 − (−𝜓2,𝑣 )            .                    (A.8)
                                                                    1−𝛼

Since 𝑟∗ , 𝛼, 𝜓2,𝑣 , and 𝜎𝑣 can be identiﬁed independently from information other than that contained
in the impulse response function of hours and wages to a technology shock, we deduce that 𝜈 is
identiﬁable as long as the initial response of hours worked to a technology shock is non-zero.
