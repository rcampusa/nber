The typical family in the US is now a dual-earner couple, yet relatively few studies examine the
retirement decision in a household context. This paper explores how husbands' and wives' retirement
behavior is influenced by their own financial incentives from Social Security and private pensions

and by "spillover effects" from their spouses' incentives. I find that men and women are similarly
responsive to their own incentives. I further find that men are very responsive to their wives'

incentives but that women are not responsive to their husbands' incentives and present evidence to
suggest that this may be due to asymmetric complementarities of leisure. Policy simulations suggest
that the omission of spillover effects will bias the estimated effect of changing Social Security policy
on men's labor force participation.

I. Introduction

        The typical family approaching retirement today in the US is a dual-worker family. This

is a recent development resulting from dramatic changes in the labor force behavior of both older

men and older women during the post-war period. During this period, men shifted towards

exiting the labor force at much earlier ages; for example, the labor force participation rate for

men aged 55-59 dropped from 92% in 1957 to 78% in 2002. 1 At the same time, factors such as

changing social norms, declining fertility, and increased demand for women’s labor led to large

increases in the labor force participation of all women, including older women; the participation

rate for women aged 55-59 rose from 38% in 1957 to 64% in 2002. In the Health and Retirement

Study, a data set of people now reaching retirement age, nearly three-quarters of couples had

both spouses in the labor force at or after age 50.

        The striking drop in male labor force participation has inspired a large literature on the

effect of Social Security and pensions on men’s retirement. However, two related and important

issues remain vastly understudied. First, although older women are now nearly as likely to be in

the labor force as older men, the effect of Social Security and pensions on women’s retirement

decisions is not well understood. The existing literature on this question relies on data from the

1970s, excludes private pensions, and does not draw on recent insights in the men’s literature

about the importance of using forward-looking incentive measures and of considering the

identification of retirement incentive impacts.

        A second overlooked issue in the traditional literature on retirement is the possibility that

retirement incentives faced by the worker’s spouse may have “spillover effects” on to the

worker’s own decision. Such spillover effects are likely, due both to income effects and to

Bureau of Labor Statistics web site (data.bls.gov, series LFU604801/802/901/902).


                                                         1
complementarity (or substitution) of leisure between the spouses, but have not been explored

much in the previous literature, especially outside the context of a structural model. If spillover

effects are important, the failure to estimate household models of retirement decision-making

may lead to significant errors in predicting the effect of a change in Social Security policy on

retirement behavior.

       The purpose of this paper is to calculate the retirement incentives facing husbands and

wives as a result of Social Security and private pensions and to use the incentive measures to

explore these two questions. Specifically, I estimate reduced-form models of the effect of each

spouse’s retirement incentives on their own and their spouse’s retirement decisions. This paper

uses the best recent data on retirement, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes

administrative data on both Social Security and private pension entitlements.

       There are several key findings. First, I find that women are as responsive to their own

retirement incentive measures as men; if the increment to retirement wealth resulting from

additional work is raised by $1,000, this is associated with a reduction of 0.9% of baseline

retirement for men and 1.3% of baseline retirement for women. Second, I find that women’s

retirement incentives have important spillover effects on the husband’s retirement decision that

are approximately as strong as both the direct effect of her incentives on her own retirement and

the direct effect of his incentives on his retirement. In contrast, the spillover effects of the

husband’s incentives on the wife’s retirement are found to be small and statistically insignificant.



       These results have several important implications. First, they demonstrate that women

are strongly influenced by their own economic variables in making retirement decisions and are

not merely following their husbands. Second, they suggest that the common assumption in the




                                                   2
past literature that the husband’s retirement decision is independent of the wife’s retirement

status and her other covariates is incorrect and that joint modeling of retirement decisions may be

appropriate. One explanation for the finding that the wife exerts a stronger influence on the

husband’s retirement decision is asymmetric complementarities of leisure: husbands’ enjoyment

of retirement may depend much more on the wife’s also being retired than vice versa. As

suggestive evidence in support of this hypothesis, I show that a subset of women who would be

expected to have a strong complementarity of leisure effect are similarly influenced by spillover

effects as the full sample of men. Third, the results suggest that simulations of the effect of

changes in Social Security policy on men’s retirement may yield incorrect answers if spillover

effects are ignored. I simulate two policy changes and find that the effect of the policy changes

on the probability of men being in the labor force at age 65 is underestimated by 13-20% if

spillover effects are omitted.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces some facts on

retirement patterns, explains key features of Social Security and private pensions, and reviews

the relevant literature. Section III presents the data and empirical strategy and describes the

retirement incentive measures used in the paper. Section IV presents the main results, explores

the asymmetric complementarities of leisure hypothesis, and presents policy simulations to

measure the importance of spillover effects. Section V concludes.



II. Background

Retirement Patterns

       Older women are important economic actors within the household. First, as illustrated in

Figure 1, the labor force participation rates of older women are increasingly similar to those of




                                                  3
older men, due to a major decline in men’s labor force participation and an equally significant

increase in women’s labor force participation over the past fifty years.2 In 2002, 69% of men

and 55% of women aged 55-64 were in the labor force. A decomposition of the increase in

women’s labor force participation indicates that married women are responsible for this trend, as

the participation rate of single women has remained relatively constant. Thus the rise in female

labor force participation is the rise of the dual-earner couple.

         A second indicator of married women’s independence as economic agents is the

retirement hazard by age. For men, large spikes in the retirement hazard at ages 62 and 65 have

been well documented in past work, and Social Security is thought to play a significant role in

explaining the spikes.3 Figure 2 confirms the existence of these spikes for married men in the

HRS and, strikingly, finds that the hazard for married women is virtually identical (the age 65

spike for women is spread out over ages 65-66, but sample sizes are small at this point). This

suggests that women’s retirement decisions may be influenced by the same factors that influence

men’s decisions, such as Social Security, and does not suggest that wives always retire with their

husbands, as wives are typically several years younger.

         In fact, joint retirement among spouses is a common but far from universal phenomenon.

Using data from the 1970s, Hurd (1990) and Blau (1998) find that about one-third of couples in

which both spouses are in the labor force at age 50 retire within one year of each other. It is

difficult to replicate this calculation in the HRS, as one-third of couples had both members still

in the labor force at wave 5. Nonetheless, among the couples whose retirement patterns are

known, 15% of couples retired together, in 31% of cases the wife retired first, and in 54% of

2
  Though most analysis has focused on the post-war decline, Costa (1997) finds that the decline in men’s labor force
participation began in 1880. Quinn (1999) argues that the trend toward earlier retirement for men ended in the mid-
1980s.
3
  Burtless and Moffitt (1984) show that the age 62 peak did not exist prior to the introduction of benefit availability

cases the husband retired first. Although joint retirement is certain to become a more significant

phenomenon in the HRS in the future, as the couples still in the labor force are more likely to

retire together, this tabulation demonstrates that retirement patterns are heterogeneous, with joint

retirement accounting for a minority of retirement patterns.

        Given the narrowed gap in older men and women’s labor force participation, the

similarity between men and women’s retirement hazards, and the heterogeneity in retirement

patterns among couples, it is clear that women are independent economic actors within the

household. Therefore, it is critical to understand the process by which women make retirement

decisions and the interplay between husbands’ and wives’ decisions.



Institutional Features of Social Security and Pensions

        The institutional features of Social Security are well-known and described in more detail

in Coile and Gruber (2000) and elsewhere. In the simplest terms, workers are eligible for Social

Security retired worker benefits if they have forty quarters of work in covered employment.

Benefits are computed by calculating the worker’s average indexed monthly earnings over his

best 35 years (AIME), applying a progressive formula to get the basic monthly benefit amount

(Primary Insurance Amount, or PIA), then applying an actuarial adjustment to the PIA if the

worker claims benefits before or after the normal retirement age (NRA, legislated to rise from 65

to 67). Benefits are first available at age 62 and are subject to an earnings test prior to the NRA.

Social Security also provides dependent benefits. A worker’s spouse is entitled to a benefit of

50% of the worker’s PIA and a surviving spouse to 100%; actuarial adjustments apply and a

spouse who is dually entitled as a retired worker receives only the larger of the benefits for


at age 62. Lumsdaine and Wise (1994) find the financial incentives in Social Security cannot completely explain the
age 65 spike; however, the program may still play a role by setting up a focal age of normal retirement.


                                                        5
which s/he is eligible. Benefits are funded with a payroll tax of 12.4%, paid half by employers

and half by employees.

         Additional work affects Social Security wealth in several ways. First, the additional year

of earnings may replace an earlier zero or low earnings year in the AIME calculation, raising the

benefit. Second, work beyond age 62 implies a delay in claiming benefits (if earnings are above

the earnings test floor).4 Benefits are foregone for a year, but future benefits are higher due to

the actuarial adjustment. Delayed claiming also raises survivor benefits (benefits are based on

the worker’s age at claiming) and dependent benefits (spouses are forced to delay claiming these

benefits, though they may claim their own retired worker benefits if dually entitled). Finally,

additional work results in additional payroll taxes.5

         Private pensions may also affect retirement decisions. Pensions are a key component of

retirement wealth: the Social Security Administration (2002) reports that 17% of aggregate

income received by households age 65 and older is from employer-provided pensions. Defined

benefit pension plans in particular offer strong incentives for work at certain ages due to plan

provisions such as vesting and early and normal retirement ages. Kotlikoff and Wise (1987) find

that the accrual in pension wealth at key ages such as the normal retirement age may be equal to

as much as 200% of salary in some extreme cases. Thus it is critical to incorporate pensions into

any analysis of retirement incentives and labor force participation.




4
  The earnings test now applies only until the worker has reached the NRA; however, before the year 2000, workers
were subject to an earnings test until age 70. All calculations in the paper use the precise rules faced by a particular
individual at the time.
5
  This paper treats payroll taxes as affecting the after-tax wage, rather than Social Security wealth, since it makes
little sense to treat payroll taxes differently from other taxes on labor income.

Previous Literature

         Two strands of the retirement literature are relevant for this paper: the literature on Social

Security, pensions, and men’s retirement and the literature on women’s and couples’ retirement.

         The former literature encompasses many studies and methods. The early studies estimate

reduced-form models of the effect of Social Security wealth on retirement, reduced-form models

incorporating the increase in wealth from working one more year or to a focal age such as 62 or

65, and structural models of retirement using a lifetime budget constraint.6 However, this

literature suffers from several problems. First, the reduced-form models are often insufficiently

forward-looking, focusing on the one-year accrual in retirement wealth rather than the entire

future path of accruals. Second, the identification of retirement effects in reduced-form models

is suspect, as Social Security benefits are a function of past earnings and lifetime earnings are

likely correlated with retirement.7 Third, many of these papers exclude private pensions and rely

on now-outdated data from the 1970s, primarily the Retirement History Survey (RHS).

         Subsequent papers have addressed these problems. Stock and Wise (1990a, 1990b)

develop a structural “option value” model that measures the gain in utility from delaying

retirement to the optimal age and find it predicts retirement well in a sample of workers from one

firm. Later authors (Harris 2001, Panis et. al. 2001, Gustman and Steinmeier 2002a) structurally

estimate the option value model using the HRS, though some report difficulty in getting the

model to converge. Using the HRS, Coile and Gruber (2000) estimate reduced-form versions of


6
  For examples of these three strands of literature, see Boskin and Hurd (1978), Diamond and Hausman (1984), and
Hurd and Boskin (1984); Fields and Mitchell (1982) and Hausman and Wise (1985); and Burtless and Moffitt
(1984), Burtless (1986), Gustman and Steinmeier (1985). Diamond and Gruber (1998) offer a more detailed review
of the literature.
7
  Support for this concern is found in Krueger and Pischke (1992). They use a natural experiment resulting from the
phase-out of double indexation of Social Security benefits for the “notch baby” cohort and find no break in the time-
series trend toward earlier retirement by the affected cohort.


                                                          7
the option value model and of their “peak value” model, which calculates the financial (rather

than utility) gain of working to the optimal retirement age.8 They control for current and lifetime

earnings in a flexible way to avoid the identification problem and find that forward-looking

incentive measures have significant explanatory power for retirement, though one-year accruals

do not. Despite differences among these studies, the common assumption is that a husband’s

retirement decision is unaffected by his wife’s decision and that there are no spillover effects of

the wife’s retirement incentives on the husband’s decision.

        There is also an older literature that looks at the effect of Social Security and the

husband’s retirement status on married women’s retirement decisions. Findings from these

studies are mixed.9 However, this literature is subject to the same concerns as the early men’s

literature. The use of old data may be particularly problematic for women, as the behavior of

today’s female workers may differ substantially from that of women retiring in the 1970s.

Further, though husband’s retirement status is included, the assumption that it is exogenous

clearly must be tested; if it is invalid, estimates from these models may be biased.

        Finally, there is a small literature on couples’ retirement consisting of papers that

estimate structural models of family retirement. The early papers (Hurd 1990, Blau 1998,

Gustman and Steinmeier 2000) rely on datasets from the 1970s and 1980s, which often lack full

information on Social Security and pension entitlements, while later papers (Gustman and

Steinmeier 2002b, Johnson and Favreault 2001, Maestas 2001) use the far superior HRS. These

authors typically find that complementarity of leisure is much more important in explaining joint


8
  Samwick (1998) estimates a reduced-form option value model using the Survey of Consumer Finances, but must
impute Social Security earnings histories.
9
  McCarty (1990) and Vistnes (1994) find evidence that women respond to the one-year Social Security wealth
accrual, while Pozzebon and Mitchell (1989) find that women do not respond to the change in wealth resulting from
working to age 65. Similarly, the authors have different findings regarding the effect of a retired husband on a
wife’s participation. See Weaver (1994) for a more detailed summary of this literature, including papers by Clark,
Johnson, and McDermed (1980), Henretta and O’Rand (1980), Campione (1987), and McBride (1988).


                                                        8
retirement than either correlation in preferences or shared household finances. These authors

also find that having a retired spouse increases the probability of retirement; for example,

Gustman and Steinmeier (2002b) estimate that the effect is equivalent to that of being one year

older for men or three-quarters of a year older for women.

         The goal of this paper is to estimate reduced-form models of the effect of each spouse’s

retirement incentives on their own and their spouse’s retirement decisions in order to learn

whether men and women respond similarly to financial incentives for retirement and whether

spillover effects are significant. The paper will take advantage of insights from the recent

literature on men’s retirement and of the availability of excellent information on Social Security

and pension entitlements in the HRS. The pros and cons of estimating reduced-form vs.

structural models are well-known. Structural models require particular parameterizations of

household behavior. If the chosen structure is correct, such a model is preferable in that it allows

the recovery of utility parameters; however, it is generally not possible to test whether this choice

is correct, and an incorrect choice will bias the results. A reduced-form analysis of couples’

retirement behavior is agnostic about household behavior and is thus less ambitious but more

transparent. Therefore, it will be a useful complement to the small existing literature on couples’

retirement. Also, this paper will explicitly estimate the bias that results from predicting the

effects of policy changes without using a household model, which has not been done in previous

literature.10 11



10
   Blau (1998) explores the effect of raising one spouse’s benefit at age 65 on the couples’ labor force transitions;
however, he finds that this raises the probability that both spouses work and the probability that the unaffected
spouse exits while the other spouse works, so the net spillover effect is difficult to determine. Also, he uses the RHS
and controls only for current benefits and benefits at age 65, a more limited parameterization than that used here.
11
   A final paper worthy of mention is Baker (1999). He analyzes the 1975 introduction of the spouse’s allowance in
Canada for women aged 60-64 who were married to men aged 65 or older, a change that provided a strong incentive
for eligible women and their husbands to retire due to means-testing of benefits. Using a differences-in-differences
strategy, Baker finds that affected husbands and wives reduced their labor supply.

III. Data and Empirical Strategy

Data

         The data used in the analysis is the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This is a survey

of individuals aged 51-61 in 1992 and their spouses, with re-interviews every two years; the first

five waves of the data (1992-2000) are now available. This data contains extensive information

on employment, health, and family structure and can be linked to Social Security earnings

histories and to pension plan data from firms for a majority of the sample, allowing for accurate

calculation of retirement incentives.

         The sample for the analysis is selected as follows. I begin with 4,972 married couples at

wave 1 and drop 127 couples due to one spouse being born before 1922 and subject to a different

set of benefit rules. Dropping couples with a missing Social Security record for either spouse

lowers the sample size to 3,233;12 dropping couples in which one spouse has never entered the

labor force or retired prior to age 50 further lowers the sample to 1,908. Dropping observations

in which either spouse reports having a pension but the HRS pension data is missing lowers the

sample to 1,152 couples.13 Generating couple-year observations for all years between 1980 and

1999 in which both members of the couple are between the ages of 50 and 69 and in the labor

force results in the final sample of 6,204 couple-year observations.14

         The definition of retirement necessarily differs for observations before and after 1992

because of the different data available. For the earlier years, an earnings based definition is used;

if earnings are positive in two consecutive years then zero, the individual is considered to have



12
   Haider and Solon (1999) note that Social Security records appear to be missing essentially randomly.
13
   I am grateful to Steve Venti for allowing me to use his constructed measure of self-reported pension wealth.
14
   In the analysis, standard errors are corrected for repeated observations on the same couples.


                                                         10
retired in the last year with positive earnings.15 Starting in 1992, earning reports are biannual, so

the definition is based on self-reported labor status at each wave and the stated retirement date.



Retirement Incentive Measures

         Social Security and pensions may affect retirement through both the level of retirement

wealth and the increase in wealth resulting from future work. The wealth level effect operates

through the present discounted value of retirement wealth (PDV), which is the stream of future

Social Security and pension benefits the family has earned based on its work to date, discounted

for mortality risk and time preference.16

         The wealth accrual effect can be captured by several incentive measures. The simplest

such measure is the accrual (ACC), the change in retirement wealth that results from working

one additional year. However, Coile and Gruber (2001) show that the accrual of Social Security

wealth is non-monotonic for many people, and it is well known that pension wealth often

exhibits large spikes at particular ages. Thus there may be a small or even negative return to this

year’s work but a large positive return for some future year of work, and the accrual will miss

this. Results with the accrual will be presented below, but it is not the preferred measure.

         A second alternative is the option value measure (OV) developed by Stock and Wise

(1990a,1990b). This model is based on the individual’s indirect utility over work and leisure:
                          R −1                            T
              Vt ( R) =   ∑p
                          s= t
                                 s|t d
                                       s− t
                                            ( ys ) g +   ∑p
                                                         s= R
                                                                s|t   d s − t [ k * Bs (r )]g



15
   This definition is applied only to years after age 50. Although Ruhm (1990) estimates that one-quarter of
household heads reenter the labor force after initially retiring, such behavior is outside the scope of this analysis.
16
   Benefits are discounted using a 6% real discount rate and the age and sex specific U.S. life tables from the SSA
Trustees Report (1995), intermediate assumption. The calculation accounts for the joint survival probabilities of
both spouses and for the benefits received by the couple in each state (with appropriate actuarial adjustment). A 6%
discount rate is chosen because Coile et. al. (2002) show that this would make it optimal to claim Social Security
benefits immediately upon retirement, which is what nearly all workers do.


                                                                           11
where R is the retirement date, d is the discount factor, p is the probability of being alive at some

future date conditional on being alive today, y is income while working, B is retirement benefits,

gamma is a parameter of risk aversion, k is a parameter to account for the disutility of labor

(k>=1), and T is maximum life length. The OV measure calculates the utility gain from working

to the optimal future retirement date relative to retiring today. A reduced-form version of the

option value model is employed here.17

         A third possible measure is peak value (PV), which is equal to the PDV of retirement

wealth at its maximum value minus the PDV today. This is similar to accrual, except it is the

accrual to the year in which PDV is maximized rather than the one-year accrual; if PDV has

already reached its maximum, PV is equal to the accrual. This can be thought of as a financial

version of the option value measure (utility parameters are set to one), except that it does not

incorporate wages. The effects of both PV and OV on retirement will be examined below.

         In order to calculate each spouse’s incentive measures, one must make an assumption

about the retirement behavior of the other spouse, as Social Security benefits depend on both

spouses’ entire earnings histories. I calculate each spouse’s incentive to work conditional on the

other spouse retiring at age 62. This seems plausible, given that the median retirement age in my

sample is 62 for both men and women. I have also calculated the incentive measures assuming

the spouse retires at age 60 or 65 and the results using those measures are very similar.




17
  The assumed utility parameters are K=1.5, gamma=0.75, and a real discount rate of 6%; re-estimating the model
with different parameters suggests that the log-likelihood is quite flat with respect to parameter choice. For both OV
and PV calculations, real earnings are projected to grow at about 1%, matching assumptions made by the SSA Board
of Trustees (1995), Table II. Ruhm (1990) notes that retirement often includes a post-career bridge job with lower
earnings; however, the calculations treat continued employment at the same job as the relevant alternative to
retirement, as it is impossible to know what other options might be available to each worker. I am grateful to Dean
Karlan for assistance in writing the program that calculates the worker’s PIA at all future retirement dates.

Empirical Strategy

         The goal is to estimate the direct impact of each spouse’s incentive variables on their own

retirement decision and the spillover effect of own incentive variables on the spouse’s retirement

decision. I thus estimate equations of the following form:

         RETht = b0 + b1 PDVct + b2 IMht + b3 Xht + b4 AGEht + b5 EARNht + b6 AIMEht

                  + b7 IMwt + b8 Xwt + b9 AGEwt + b10 EARNwt + b11 AIMEwt + b12REGc + b13Yt + eh

where h denotes the husband, w the wife, and c the couple; RET is a dummy indicating if the

worker retires this year; PDV is retirement wealth and IM is the retirement incentive measure

(ACC, PV, or OV);18 AGE is a set of age dummies, EARN is potential earnings next year, AIME

is lifetime earnings, X is individual characteristics (race, education, industry and occupation,

experience and its square, job tenure and its square, age difference with spouse), Y is year

dummies, and REG is region dummies. Symmetric equations are estimated with the wife’s

retirement as the dependent variable. The equations are estimated as probits.

         It is useful to consider the source of identification of the effect of incentive variables on

retirement. Retirement incentives vary across people due to many factors, including: own age,

birth cohort (due to changing mortality and Social Security rules), AIME, and next year’s

earnings (relative to past lowest); spouse’s age, birth cohort, AIME, and earnings; interactions of

the above and non-linearities in the Social Security benefit formula; and eligibility for a pension,

provisions of the firm’s pension plan (normal retirement age, etc.), and own work history as it

affects the pension (hire date, etc.).

         It is important to control for those factors that likely have an independent influence on

retirement. For example, as Social Security benefits are a non-linear function of AIME,


18
  PDVt is calculated for each person assuming that he or she retires at t and that the spouse retires at age 62, thus the
husband and the wife have slightly different PDVs (corr=0.97). For the analysis, the simple average is used.


                                                           13
estimates that fail to control for AIME may pick up a spurious effect, such as a propensity of

higher earners to retire later because they enjoy their work more. This analysis adopts a control

function approach and controls in a very rich way for the factors that may influence retirement to

address any possible spurious effects. The richest specification includes age dummies for both

spouses, full interactions of the age dummies, a quartic in earnings and AIME for both spouses,

and interactions of the earnings and AIME quartics of both spouses.19

        Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. The mean annual retirement rate in the sample

is 4.7% for men and 4.1% for women and the average age in the sample is 57.1 for men and 54.6

for women. The average annual accrual of retirement wealth is $1,698 for men and $1,279 for

women, and the average peak value is $14,766 for men and $11,541 for women.20 However,

there is substantial heterogeneity in all these figures, as is evident from the large standard

deviations. The PDV of Social Security and pension wealth for an average couple is $230,651.

Option value is measured in utility units, so it is not directly comparable to the other measures.



IV. Results

Effects of Own Incentive Variables

        Tables 2 and 3 show the key coefficients from the probit models. Results are shown for

the three incentive measures (ACC, PV, and OV) and for three sets of covariates: 1)

demographic variables only, 2) adding quartics in earnings and AIME, and 3) adding interactions

between the age dummies of husbands and wives, the earnings quartics of husbands and wives,

and the AIME quartics of husbands and wives. These rich specifications should control for the


19
   As OV directly incorporates earnings, earnings explain a large fraction of the variation in the OV: for men, age
dummies and a quartic in earnings explain 72% of the variation in OV and only 15% of the variation in PV.
20
   Figures are in $1992. Obviously, the magnitude of the accrual, peak value, and PDV figures is highly dependent
on the discount rate chosen.


                                                         14
variation in the incentive measures resulting from current and past earnings, which may not be a

valid source of identification for retirement effects.

       The first three rows of Table 2 show the effect of the husband’s incentive measures on his

retirement. The accrual coefficients are negative but not statistically significant; this lack of

significance is not particularly surprising, as the accrual does not capture the option value that

work this year provides by enabling work in future years when there may be larger accruals. By

contrast, the PV coefficients are negative and highly significant for all sets of control variables.

In the preferred specification (with demographics and quartics in current and lifetime earnings),

an increase in PV of $1,000 is associated with a decrease in the husband’s probability of

retirement of 0.040%, or 0.9% of baseline retirement; the results are not significantly different in

the other specifications. The OV coefficients, though not directly comparable to the PV

coefficients, are also negative and statistically significant. Thus men respond to their forward-

looking incentive measures from Social Security and pensions as expected, but the magnitude of

the effects is relatively modest.

       The response of women to their incentive measures is quite similar, as shown in the first

three rows of Table 3. In the preferred specification, a $1,000 increase in the wife’s PV decreases

her retirement probability by 0.054%, or 1.3% of baseline retirement. As for men, using

forward-looking incentive measures is important: the effect of accrual is negative but

insignificant, while OV has a consistently negative and significant effect.

       The last row in Tables 2 and 3 shows the effect of the PDV on retirement. As expected,

higher wealth is associated with an increased probability of retirement. The effect is very similar

for men and women and is quite significant except in the OV specifications for men. In the

preferred PV specification, a $10,000 increase in PDV raises the probability of men’s retirement




                                                  15
by 0.047%, or 1.0% of baseline retirement and raises the probability of women’s retirement by

0.049%, or 1.2% of baseline retirement.21



Effect of Spouse’s Incentive Variables

         The spillover effect of each spouse’s incentives on the other’s retirement is explored in

the middle three rows of Tables 2 and 3. In theory, the spillover effect could be positive or

negative, as there are income and complementarity of leisure effects that work in opposite

directions: if one spouse can increase the couple’s retirement wealth by staying in the labor

force, the other spouse may consume some of the additional wealth in the form of leisure and

retire earlier, or may retire later if the value of leisure is diminished.22

         As shown in Table 2, the spillover effect of the wife’s incentive on the husband’s

retirement is negative, so the complementarity of leisure effect dominates the income effect; this

effect is highly significant and is similar in magnitude to the direct effect of the husband’s

incentives on his retirement. In the preferred specification, a $1,000 increase in the wife’s PV

leads to a 0.038% decrease in his probability of retirement, or 0.8% of baseline; the OV results

are similar.23 This suggests that the past literature on men’s retirement may be omitting an

important variable by neglecting the wife’s retirement incentive variables.

         The middle three rows in Table 3 show the spillover effect of the husband’s incentive

variables on the wife’s retirement. Strikingly, these coefficients are small, mostly positive, and

never statistically significant, suggesting that women do not respond to their husbands’

21
   A full set of results including all covariates is available from the author upon request. In probit models including
variables for health status and health insurance (not shown here), retirement incentive measures have very similar
effects to those discussed here and health variables generally have the expected effects.
22
   Substitution of leisure is also possible; for example, if spouses perform both market and non-market labor, an
increase in the return to market work for one spouse may encourage the other spouse to shift towards non-market
labor. However, the previous literature suggests that complementarity of leisure is more likely.
23
   For accrual, the spillover effect is greater than the effect of the husband’s incentives on his retirement and



                                                           16
retirement incentives from Social Security and pensions. The finding that men respond to their

wives’ incentives but women do not respond to their husbands’ incentives is the exact opposite

of the assumption made in the traditional retirement literature, and merits further analysis.2425

         One possible explanation for this finding is that there are asymmetries in the

complementarity of leisure effect: husbands’ enjoyment of retirement may depend much more on

the wife’s also being retired than vice versa. This might be the case if, for example, wives are

able to busy themselves with volunteer work, grandchildren, or housework if the husband works,

but husbands are less able to occupy themselves with hobbies if the wife works and dread being

expected to help out more with housework. For wives, a weak complementarity of leisure effect

and the income effect may roughly cancel out, leading to no overall response to husbands’

incentives. For husbands, a strong complementarity of leisure effect may outweigh the income

effect, so that a large financial incentive for the wife to keep working encourages both spouses to

stay in the labor force.26

         One way to explore the asymmetric complementarities of leisure hypothesis is to examine

whether there are differences in men’s and women’s answers to questions about how they think

about retirement and time with their spouses. Table 4 displays the answers given in 1992 for the

subset of the sample in which neither spouse had previously retired. By a slight margin,

husbands are more likely to report that they enjoy time with their wives on all relevant questions.


significant; however, accrual is not the preferred incentive measure for the analysis.
24
   Desmet et. al. (2002) reproduce the analysis presented here in the context of Belgium and find that women
respond to their husbands’ incentive variables but not vice versa.
25
   Several specification checks suggest that the strong spillover effect on the husband’s decision is not the result of a
non-linear effect of own incentives being picked up by the spillover coefficient. First, the correlation between
spouses’ incentive variables is very low, less than 0.15 for all three incentive variables. Second, the effect of the
husband’s incentive variable on his retirement is very similar when the wife’s incentive variable is omitted from the
model. Third, adding a quartic in the husband’s incentive variable to his retirement regression does not affect the
coefficient on the wife’s incentive variable.
26
   The sociology literature provides some support for this explanation. In a study of married couples in NY, Moen
et. al (2001) find that newly retired men whose wives continued to work were the least happy retirees and that
returning to work was the best solution for these men; for newly retired women, having a “happy marriage” was a


                                                           17
Specifically, men are more likely to say that they find time with their spouse extremely enjoyable

(33% to 27%), that they like to spend time doing things together with their spouse (52% to 49%),

that they agree or strongly agree that they look forward to retirement only if they can retire at the

same time as their spouse (62% to 60%), and that they think having more time with their spouse

in retirement is very important (61% to 60%). The data also indicate that women may have more

options for retirement activities, as they are more likely than their husbands to say that spending

more time with children (42 to 33%) or on volunteer work (17 to 13%) is very important and

equally likely to say that spending more time on hobbies or sports or having the chance to travel

is very important. While there is some suggestion in the data that men’s enjoyment of their

leisure may depend more on the presence of the spouse than vice versa, the differences between

men and women’s answers to these questions are in fact fairly small.

         A more direct way to examine whether complementarity of leisure affects behavior is to

see whether the response to the spouse’s incentive variables differs for those who report a strong

complementarity of leisure time with their spouse vs. those who do not. As no single question

perfectly captures complementarity of leisure, the dummy variable is defined in three different

ways based on the first three questions in Table 9.27 The dummy variable is interacted with the

spouse’s incentive variable, with the expectation that the interacted spillover effect will be

negative, as the complementarity of leisure effect will likely outweigh the income effect for this

group. The sample for this analysis excludes couples in which one spouse retired prior to 1992,

since the retirement expectation questions are first available in 1992.


more important factor than having a retired husband in determining retirement satisfaction.
27
   The three questions are: a) is time spent together with spouse extremely enjoyable; b) do you like to spend time
doing things together with spouse; c) do you agree/strongly agree that you look forward to retirement only if spouse
can retire too. (Note: c is defined as agree or strongly agree because the strongly agree group is extremely small).



                                                         18
         The results of this analysis for peak value are presented in Table 5. In the wife’s

retirement model, interacting the complementarity of leisure dummy with the husband’s

incentive measure has the expected outcome: the overall spillover effect is negative and

significant for this group, indicating that the complementarity of leisure effect outweighs the

income effect for them. For this group of women, the magnitude of the spillover effect is similar

to that found for the full sample of men in 2. By contrast, the spillover effect for the other group

is now always positive, reflecting the dominance of the income effect, and significant in the case

of definition 2. The coefficients on own incentive measure weaken in sign and significance for

some of the specifications, while PDV remains positive and significant.

         The lower panel of Table 5 repeats this exercise for the husband’s retirement models.

Here, the effect of interacting the complementarity of leisure dummy with the wife’s incentive

measures is less dramatic. Prior to introducing the interactions, the coefficient on the wife’s PV

is negative and significant. The coefficient on the interacted PV is a larger negative number, as

we would expect, while the coefficient on the non-interacted PV remains negative but is smaller

and no longer significant, suggesting that the complementarity of leisure effect may more than

offset the income effect even in this group.

         To summarize, the above provides some suggestive evidence that asymmetric

complementarities of leisure may explain the spillover results from Tables 2 and 3. First, men

are slightly more likely to report enjoying time with their spouse and appear to have fewer

retirement activities planned. Second, the subset of women who are categorized as having strong

complementarity of leisure are found to have a similar response to their spouses’ incentive

variables as the full sample of men, while both subsets of men appear to have a strong


The three dummies are equal to 1 if: 1) a and b are true; 2) a and c are true; 3) a, b, and c are true. Results are
similar if the dummy is based on a or b alone, but less significant if based on c alone.


                                                           19
complementarity of leisure effect.28 This suggests that a stronger complementarity of leisure

effect for men may explain the greater importance of spillover effects for men’s decisions.



Policy Simulations

           The omission of spillover effects from the retirement model may lead to an incorrect

estimate of the effect of a change in Social Security policy on retirement. Specifically, if a

policy change alters the retirement incentives of both spouses and if the wife’s incentives affect

the husband’s decision, then neglecting to include this spillover effect will bias the estimated

effect of the policy change on men’s retirement behavior. In this section, I calculate the

difference in the predicted effect of a policy change when spillover effects are included.

           I simulate two changes in Social Security policy: an immediate increase in the normal

retirement age (NRA) to 67 and an immediate increase in the delayed retirement credit (DRC) to

8%.29 The expected effects of the policy changes on the incentive variables and on retirement

are as follows. Raising the NRA lowers PDV and has different effects on the return to work

depending on the age of the worker through changes in the actuarial adjustment, so the net effect

on retirement is ambiguous.30 In the sample, implementing this policy lowers mean PDV by

about $11,500 and lowers mean husband’s PV by about $900 and mean wife’s PV by about

$400. Raising the DRC to 8% raises PDV for those already working past age 65 and raises the

incentives for those under 65 to keep working until 65, so the net effect on retirement is also

ambiguous. In the sample, implementing this policy raises mean PDV by $250 and raises mean

husband’s PV by over $900 and wife’s PV by over $150.

28
  Gustman and Steinmeier (2002b) conduct a similar exercise within the context of their structural model of
retirement behavior and obtain analogous results.
29
     Both policy changes are currently legislated to be phased in gradually over the next 20 years
30
     Specifically, the change lowers the return to work at ages 62-63 from 6.67% to 5%, does not affect the return to



                                                            20
        The bias resulting from excluding spillover effects is calculated as follows for each

policy change. I first estimate the average retirement probability at each age pre-policy change

and post-policy change for a “true” retirement model including the spouse’s incentive variable.

Starting with a sample of 100 men in the labor force at age 50, I apply the pre- and post-policy

change retirement probabilities by age to generate two survival functions; the difference between

them is the cumulative effect of the policy change on the probability of being in the labor force at

a particular age. I then repeat this exercise for a “naïve” retirement model excluding the

spouse’s incentive variable. The percent difference between the cumulative effect of the policy

change calculated using the “true” and “naïve” models is the estimate of the bias resulting from

excluding spillover effects.

        The results of this analysis are presented in Table 6 for the OV model.31 Both policy

changes are found to decrease the probability of retirement: using the “true” model, the

probability of being in the labor force at age 65 is 1.0 percentage points lower with the NRA

reform and 1.5 percentage points lower with the DRC reform. The “naïve” model excluding

spillover effects is found to underestimate the effect of the policy change relative to the “true”

model including spillover effects. At age 65, for example, the effect of the policy change is

underestimated by 13% in the NRA reform and by 20% in the DRC reform.

        The magnitude of the bias is significant but modest. One possible explanation for why

the bias is not larger is that, while women’s incentives have a strong influence on men’s

retirement decision, the effect of the policy changes on women’s incentives is often modest, as

discussed above. Nonetheless, these estimates suggest that analysts who aim to make accurate

estimates of the effects of policy changes should incorporate spillover effects, as estimates


work at age 64, and raises the return to work at ages 65-67 from the DRC (cohort-specific) to 6.67%.
31
   Estimates of the bias from the PV and OV models are quite similar for the DRC reform, though for the NRA



                                                       21
excluding spillover effects are found to significantly underestimate the true effect of a policy

change on labor force participation.



VI. Conclusion

         The large literature estimating reduced-form models of the effect of Social Security and

pensions on retirement has neglected two important questions: the effect of women’s retirement

incentives on their own retirement decisions and the spillover effects of each spouse’s incentives

on the other spouse’s retirement decision. This paper addresses these questions using a rich new

data set, the Health and Retirement Study, and taking full advantage of recent insights in the

literature on men’s retirement regarding identification of retirement impacts and the importance

of incorporating forward-looking incentive measures.

         I have two major findings. First, I find that the response of women to their own incentive

measures is virtually identical to the response of men: in increase of $1,000 in own dynamic

retirement incentives lowers the probability of retirement by 0.9% of baseline for men and by

1.3% of baseline for women. Second, I find that spillover effects from the wife are an important

determinant of the husband’s retirement: an increase of $1,000 in the wife’s dynamic incentives

lowers the probability of the husband’s retirement by 0.8% of baseline. I further find that

spillover effects from the husband have small and statistically insignificant effects on the wife.

         These findings run counter to the conventional wisdom and long-standing assumption in

the traditional retirement literature that men’s retirement is unaffected by their wives’

characteristics, and indicate that joint modeling of couples’ retirement decisions is appropriate. I

suggest that a weaker complementarity of leisure effect for women may explain the lack of

significance of the husband’s spillover effects. As confirmatory evidence, I show that men are


reform, the estimates of bias from the PV model are larger but quite variable at different ages.

                                                          22
slightly more likely to say that they enjoy spending their leisure time with their spouses and that

a subset of women who would be expected to have a strong complementarity of leisure effect

have a similar response to spillover effects as the full sample of men.

       Omitting spillover effects from a model of men’s retirement does not significantly bias

estimates of the effect of the husband’s retirement incentives on his retirement. However,

simulations of the effect of changes in Social Security policy on men’s retirement may still be

biased, as they neglect to take into account the effect that the change in the wife’s incentives will

have on the husband’s decision. Simulations of two policy changes suggest that omitting

spillover effects leads to an underestimate of the effect of the policy on the probability of being

in the labor force at age 65 of 13-20%. This suggests that analysts who wish to make careful

estimates of the effect of policy changes should estimate household models of retirement

decision-making.
