Charity and Favoritism in the Field: Are Female Economists Nicer (to Each Other)?

                                             ABSTRACT

Using a very large sample of matched author-referee pairs, we examine how the gender of referees
and authors affects the former’s recommendations. Relying on changing matches of authors and referees,
we find no evidence of gender differences among referees in charitableness toward authors; nor do
we find any effect of the interaction between the referees’ and authors’ gender. With substantial research
showing gender differences in fairness, the results suggest that an ethos of objectivity can overcome
tendencies toward same-group favoritism/opposite-group discrimination.

I. Introduction

       Discrimination is perhaps the most heavily researched topic in the field of labor

economics and perhaps even among all endeavors in applied economics. Much less work

has been done on differences in fairness/charitableness by individuals with different

characteristics, but that too is attracting increasing attention (e.g., Andreoni and

Vesterlund, 2001, and the extensive summary by Croson and Gneezy, 2009). Very little

research   has    combined   these   two    topics,   asking   whether   the   amount    of

favoritism/discrimination exhibited varies with the extent of the match between the

parties (but see Parsons et al, 2011, Price and Wolfers, 2010, for differences by

race/ethnicity, and Dillingham et al, 1994, for some sparse evidence on gender).

       Our purpose here is to combine these two questions, focusing on differences by

gender. In particular, we ask whether women are generally more or less generous than

men in making up-or-down recommendations about others’ work, and whether their

degree of generosity is affected by the gender of those whose output they are asked to

judge. While we despair of distinguishing favoritism toward one’s own group from

discrimination against another, at least our results provide some evidence on whether the

extent of favoritism/discrimination differs by gender of the favoring/discriminating party.

       Perhaps analogously to the theory of religious sects (Iannaccone, 1992), one

might argue that the degree of solidarity within a group is a function of its relative size—

that smaller groups will be more cohesive and more likely to favor other members of the

group. We test this possibility too here, examining whether women favor other women

more when they account for a smaller share of the relevant population of those making

the judgments or being judged.
II. Modeling Preferences and Favoritism

       We seek to model interactions between members of two groups, with within-

group distinctions by gender. Call the two groups that are involved authors and referees.

Members of the two groups interact on what they perceive to be a one-to-one basis, with

authors seeking a judgment of their work, referees either giving their approval or not.

Denote authors as Ai (i = 1,…, I) and referees as Rj (j = 1,…, J). Denote the gender of an

author or referee by f(Ai) or f(Rj), equaling 1 for females and 0 for males. The utility of

referee Rj when matched with author Ai is:

(1)    U(Ai , Rj) = μi + ψj + αf(Ai) + βf(Rj) + λf(Ai)f(Rj) + εij .

The terms μi and ψj indicate the idiosyncratic values of author i’s work and referee j’s

valuation of papers, respectively. Finally, there is some randomly distributed

unobservable effect, εij , that results with each author-referee match.

       A paper is recommended for acceptance if:

(2)    U(Ai , Rj) > 0 ,

which occurs with probability:

(3)    Pr{μi + ψj + αf(Ai) + βf(Rj) + λf(Ai)f(Rj) + εij > 0}.

To understand the meaning of the parameters in (3), view the idiosyncratic μi and ψj as

random draws, so that the composite error term is eij = μi + ψj + εij. Letting G(.) denote

the c.d.f. of -eij, the acceptance-recommendation probabilities of interest are:

       Pr(accept | male referee, male author)       = G(0)
       Pr(accept | male referee, female author)      = G(α)
       Pr(accept | female referee, male author)      = G(β)
       Pr(accept | female referee, female author) = G(α+β+λ) .




                                                                                         2
Therefore, the effect of female authorship on a male referee’s acceptance probability is

G(α)-G(0) and on a female referee’s acceptance probability is G(α+β+λ)-G(β). The

relevant “difference-in-difference” effect is then [G(α+β+λ)-G(β)]-[G(α)-G(0)].1 This

difference-in-difference will be positive (negative) if female referees are comparatively

more (less) generous than male referees when matched with female authors.

          The formulation of utility in (1) implicitly assumes that the referees j can identify

the gender of authors i. If this were not so, then we would expect that λ ≡ 0, since, from

the viewpoint of referees j, f(Ai) would be noise. (Note that α could still be non-zero if

paper quality differs by authors’ gender.) Generalizing (1) and (3) to account for the

possibility that in some cases the identity of authors is known, while in others it is not, we

obtain:

(3’)      Pr{μi + ψj + αf(Ai) + βf(Rj) + λf(Ai)f(Rj)

                  + α’Zijf(Ai) + β’Zijf(Rj) + λ’Zijf(Ai)f(Rj) + εij > 0},

as the expanded condition for the probability of recommending acceptance, where Zij is

an indicator of whether f(Ai) is known to referee j. With this expanded formulation, we

would expect λ = 0 and would infer whether there is within-group favoritism from the

difference-in-difference        effect,    which     for    Zij=1    (author     gender     observed)      is

[G(α+β+λ+α’+β’+λ’)-G(β+β’)]-[G(α+α’)-G(0)].

III. Matching Data to the Model

          In order to estimate the parameters describing charity and favoritism, we need a

panel of referees and authors that is sufficiently long that individual idiosyncrasies can be

accounted for through multiple observations on the same referee matched to different

interaction-variable parameter λ. See Ai and Norton (2003).


                                                                                                            3
authors. Referees should also be aware of the author’s gender, so that there is scope for

them to indulge their preferences, if any, for their own gender. Obviously, the latter

problem does not arise in laboratory work—parties’ gender can, if the experimenter

desires, be identified to others. The former problem generally cannot, however, be

handled extensively in what are typically very short-duration laboratory experiments.

         Our data set contains all the submissions to a leading field journal that were sent

out to referees between 1986 and early 2008. The journal had a strict policy of double-

blind refereeing, so that it took some effort for referees to discover whether they matched

the author’s gender. We cannot know whether or not they discovered that a match did or

did not exist—whether Z=1 or 0. Evidence from another journal (Blank, 1991), however,

suggests that even in the late 1980s referees could identify authors of half the papers they

were assigned. This fact suggests that Z = 1 for many of these assignments.

         In case the ease of identifying authors has changed, we need a proxy for Z that

might indicate whether it was possible for the referee to make this discovery. Today it is

trivial to discover the identity of the authors of most unpublished scholarly papers by

doing an internet-based search for the paper’s title.                  Such internet discovery was

presumably far less prevalent during the early part of our sample.2 We thus proxy Z by

dividing the sample period into three parts: 1986-1994, when author gender could not be

identified via the internet (but perhaps could be through working paper series, direct

knowledge of the paper, etc.); 2000-2008, when authors’ gender could be identified

easily via the internet; and 1995-1999, when the degree of identifiability via the internet

 Whereas 45 percent of American adults in 2000 had reported using the internet in the previous month,
only 9 percent had reported doing so in 1996 (Statistical Abstract of the United States, various years). The
internet-usage statistic is not available before 1996, but would no doubt indicate lower usage percentages.



                                                                                                          4
may have been unclear. In most of our comparisons and estimation, we drop matches

from this middle period.3 To the extent that authors’ gender is more likely to be known

to the referee (Z=1) in the late period (2000-2008) than in the early period (1986-1994),

our ability to detect statistically a gender-matching effect would be greater in the late

period.

          2940 initial submissions were sent to at least one referee. In the early period not

all authors’ names were listed in the data file, so that, as Table 1 shows, for only 70

percent of the papers were all the authors identifiable. In the later period the records

were nearer to being complete. Authors’ gender was completely identifiable on 80

percent of the manuscripts, with our inability to identify authors’ gender due mostly to

ambiguity about the gender identification of various given names. Around one-sixth of

the papers for which the gender of all authors could be identified had only female

authors, and one-third had at least one female. Both fractions increased between the early

and late periods, significantly so for the “any female” category. Because of differences in

both levels and changes of the “all female” and “any female” classifications, our analysis

considers both classifications as indicators of female authorship (f(Ai)=1).

          The journal used 6165 referees to judge these papers, but we were unable to

identify the gender of 32 of them. A total of 1514 different referees judged papers during

this time period. One instance of refereeing was most common, but 179 individuals

judged at least ten manuscripts (and the busiest referee judged 36 papers). Of the

from 1986-2008 in the estimation.



                                                                                                         5
identifiable referees, 19 percent were women, a percentage that increased significantly

between the early and late periods, as Table 2 demonstrates.

       The identification strategy here relies on multiple matches between a referee and a

variety of authors, and multiple matches of a particular article to referees. It is thus

identical to the strategy used to identify firm-worker match effects by Abowd et al (1999)

and, in the context of discrimination, by Parsons et al (2011).           This approach is

unaffected by the identity of the (very few) editors, so long as they do not assign referees

to articles based on their belief that particular referees will or will not discriminate/show

favoritism that depends on the gender of the authors.

       As Table 2 also shows, the matching of authors and referees was not random by

gender over the entire period: Female referees were more likely than male referees to be

matched with papers that had any or all female authors. This was not true during the

early period. The relatively few papers that had female authors were only slightly more

likely than others to be assigned a female referee; but in the late period there was more

gender matching, especially of papers on which all authors were women. The difference

in the extent of gender-matching with “all-female” and “any-female” papers may reflect

the specialization of women in certain sub-fields. Regardless, this phenomenon justifies

accounting for this non-randomness in our estimation.

       Each referee was asked to rate the assigned paper on a four-point scale, with the

possible ratings being: accept; accept with minor changes; accept with major changes;

reject. As the first two columns of Table 3 indicate, referees recommend that roughly

half of the papers be rejected. A recommendation of outright acceptance is extremely

rare—most positive recommendations involve the referee offering asking for major




                                                                                           6
changes in the manuscript. The crucial thing to note in the table is the comparison by

gender. In the entire sample, and in each sub-period, there is absolutely no evidence of

any difference in charitableness by gender: Chi-square tests are very far from rejecting

the null hypothesis that the distributions of judgments by male and female referees are the

same. Ignoring possible gender differences in the quality of papers that are assigned, the

evidence in Table 3 is consistent with the view that the women judging others’ work were

no more or less charitable than their male counterparts within any time period.4

         Comparing responses across periods, however, suggests a slightly different

implication. While the rejection rate among males rose by 2.1 percentage points between

the two periods, the rejection rate among female referees rose by 11.0 percentage points,

a double-difference of 8.9 percentage points (s.e. = 3.9). The women who refereed in the

late period were significantly less charitable than their male counterparts, as compared to

the earlier period.

         This last comparison ignores the likelihood that the identity of the authors

changed and the possibility that the female referees were assigned different kinds of

papers in the two periods (which we saw was true along the dimension of gender

matching). To examine the charitableness issue further, and to test for gender-matched

favoritism, Table 4 presents estimates of the equations (3’) describing refereeing

decisions. In light of the fact that there are very few recommendations of outright

acceptance or even acceptance with minor revisions, we define the outcome as non-reject

versus reject. For both all-female and any-female papers, we interact the referee’s gender


4
 Referees’ views do matter: All 13 papers rated “accept” by at least one referee and not below “accept with
minor revision” by the other(s) were eventually published in the journal. Also, there is substantial, but far
from complete agreement on quality by referees. For example, if one referee rated a paper at least “accept
with minor revision,” 28 percent of the other referees (in two-referee cases) also rated it at least this highly.


                                                                                                               7
with an indicator of the authors’ gender. Also, to account for the possible changing non-

observability of authors’ gender, and thus to provide estimates of α’, β’ and λ’, we

include interactions with an indicator for the judgment being made in the late period.

         We first estimate the equations using simple logit regressions, then using

conditional logit regressions (conditional on the identity of the referee). The conditional-

logit results limit variation in the outcome to differences in the interaction of a particular

referee with authors of different gender, thus accounting for the referee-specific

idiosyncrasies ψj in (3’). While we have no information on referees’ characteristics

(other than gender), we include a quadratic in the number of previous times a person had

refereed for the journal—a measure of experience.

         The results from both the logit and conditional-logit specifications in Table 4

yield the same conclusions about the possibility of gender favoritism: It is simply not

evident in these data. None of the difference-in-difference estimates (the “Difference”

rows near the bottom of the table) is statistically significantly different from zero. The

point estimates are also quite small, ranging from 0.1 percentage points to 4.4 percentage

points for the logit specifications. Even if referees in both periods could identify the

gender of the authors of the papers they were assigned (so that Z=1 equally in both

periods),      our     estimates      for     the     separate      sub-periods        show       that    no

favoritism/discrimination based on gender matching/non-matching was apparent.5

Moreover, the triple differences, the coefficients on the interaction term of female

referees with female authors and the Late period (2000-2008), are all essentially zero.

5
 One additional possibility is that some of the control variables, particularly experience, are related to the
impacts of the gender match and its effects in the separate sub-periods. Interactions of referee experience
with the referee-author match and its interaction with the sub-period identifier were essentially zero and
had no effect on our conclusions about the possibility of favoritism.



                                                                                                            8
            The biggest change from the early (1986-1994) to the late (2000-2008) period

appears in the author-gender effect upon male referees. Male referees between 1986 and

1994 were more likely to recommend rejection of female-authored papers (11.2

percentage points more likely in the first column, with a 95-percent confidence interval of

[4.1, 18.2]). This difference disappears in the late period for the logit specifications. The

change does not necessarily reflect anything about gender favoritism, however, as an

increase in the quality of female-authored papers could also explain the difference.

            One might thus argue that the relevant idiosyncrasies are manuscript- rather than

referee-specific.6          To examine this possibility, we re-estimated (3’) using logits

conditional on manuscript identifiers (which causes any variable that does not vary across

referees on the same manuscript to drop out of the equation). Here again, the author-

referee gender interaction was insignificantly different from zero in both the early and

late periods. Finally, when we account for both referee and manuscript idiosyncrasies,

we find no qualitative differences (although standard errors increase, as one would

expect, with the increase in the number of fixed effects).7

            These estimates do not account for the likelihood, as indicated by the across-

period comparisons in Table 3, that a change in the mix of referees altered observed

behavior between periods. Perhaps women who refereed during the early period were

6
    Clustering by manuscript or by referee has essentially no effect on the standard errors.
7
 Another potentially confounding problem is a gender difference in self-selection. Willingness to complete
the assigned task may differ by gender, with women perhaps being more compliant (as they are in their
propensity to complete surveys—Moore and Tarnai, 2002). Differential selectivity will only bias the
results if the propensity to complete the task is related to the charitableness of doers and refusers. We
cannot get at this problem, since we have no information on non-compliant referees. If men are more likely
not to comply, and non-compliers are nastier, then our results are biased in favor of finding that female
referees are less charitable than males. A related difficulty may arise from the selection of referees by
editors. We cannot solve these problems completely; but the fact that the fraction female referees is
slightly above the fraction female in the American Economic Association (Donald and Hamermesh, 2006)
should allay some concerns about this issue.


                                                                                                        9
inherently more favorable to female authors, but could not observe authors’ gender, while

female referees who entered the refereeing pool during the late period discriminated

against female authors. This might have occurred because of the increase in female

representation in the set of referees—possibly a reduced sense of solidarity among later

cohorts of female economists. If this were correct, we would estimate λ’ = 0, even though

the agents’ preferences exhibited favoritism in one case (the early referees) and

discrimination in the other case (the new referees in the late period).

       To examine this possibility, we re-estimated the equations, restricting the sample

to the 295 individuals who refereed in both the early and late periods. The estimates for

this reduced sample are presented in Table 5. A comparison to the results in Table 4

suggests that the apparent lack of favoritism or discrimination could not have resulted

from the changing mix of referees. Even within this sub-sample there is no evidence of a

significant change in behavior toward female authors when the authors’ genders became

more readily observable. The parameter estimates are quite similar across the two tables.

IV. Conclusions and Implications

       Whereas many previous studies have found differences in altruism by gender, our

examination of a unique and very large sample on author-referee outcomes in a high-

stakes field environment yields no evidence of gender differences. Even accounting for

the idiosyncrasies of both the judge and the judged, we still find no such differences.

Moreover, we find no evidence of relative favoritism toward one’s own gender by either

men or women.

       Female and male economists, at least in this specific setting, appear to behave

similarly and in a gender-neutral manner. This might be the result of some inherent sense




                                                                                       10
of fairness, with participants feeling that exercising their prejudices is inappropriate in

this particular judging activity—that “there own identity is often tied to their self-concept

as experts who are able to stand above their personal interest” (Lamont, 2009, p. 9).

Moreover, given the absence of an interaction of experience with gender, our results

suggest either that there is no self-selection by gender attitudes, or that fairness/non-

discrimination develops very early in the scholars’ professional careers. Combined with

previous findings, our results suggest that gender differences in fairness and favoritism

are context-specific. Future research, including laboratory experiments, might examine

how the extent of fairness/lack of favoritism depends on the perceived importance of the

particular two-sided relationship.
