       Legality and Reality: Some Evidence on Criminal Procedure*

     There is widespread concern that the criminal justice system,

particularly in large urban areas, is breaking down under the strain of

an increasing demand for its services and inadequate resources. At the

center of the system, located between the police and the prisons, are

the criminal courts. Allegedly, the courts no longer serve the interest

of law-abiding citizens or the constitutional rights of persons accused

of crimes. Defendants are treated capriciously with the guilty and

dangerous recycled through the courts and set free within hours of their

arrest, while the innocent languish in jail for lack of bail funds.

Statistics on rising crime rates, recidivism, arbitrary sentencing practices,

court delay, and prison riots are taken as further evidence that the courts

are failing. What has been notably scarcer is systematic empirical
                                                              2.




research on the criminal court system--research that can contribute to

our understanding of the actual workings of the system and enable us to

develop policies for improvement. The purpose of this study is to begin

to remedy this deficiency by applying the quantitative techniques of

economics to an analysis of some important issues in criminal court pro-

cedure.

     The theoretical framework for the study is based on my two recent

papers on the courts and on the bail system.     In these papers, I

advanced hypotheses on the determination of bail, and the effects of

pretrial status and other variables on plea bargaining, sentencing and

other methods of disposition. In this study, I attempt to test these

hypotheses using a rich source of data: a random sample of 858 defendants

in criminal court in New York City in 1971 containing detailed information

on the defendant's prior criminal record and socio-economic characteristics,

the criminal charges against the defendant, the various court proceedings

involving the defendant, and the outcome of the case.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the sample

and defines the variables used inthe study. Section II contains an empirical

analysis of the determinants of pretrial status where we analyze the factors

determining the terms on which a defendant may obtain his pretrial liberty.

Section III, the main section of the paper, tests whether the factors

determining pretrial liberty are also significant predictors of the

amount of harm a defendant will do if released on bail. This enables us

to distinguish between the two dominant hypotheses on the social function

of bail. The first asserts that the primary function of a bail system

is to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial; the second emphasizes

the desirability of using the bail process as a means of preventing future
                                                               3.




crimes by defendants.      Our empirical analysis reveals that the

second hypothesis is more consistent with actual behavior: the factors

that lead to the setting of higher bail bonds (which, in turn, are

shown to reduce the likelihood of pretrial liberty) are significant

predictors of the likelihood of coninitting crimes during the period of

pretrial liberty but have little predictive power in explaining the high

disappearance rate (around 30 per cent) of persons released on bail.

This finding, which is the main contribution of the study, provides a

powerful rationale (that is, the prevention of future crimes during the

period of pretrial liberty) for the operation of the current bail system--

though a rationale that some would argue is inadequate when weighed against

the restrictions imposed on the rights of the accused. Section IV focuses

on the disposition of cases where we examine the role of pretrial deten-

 tion, delay and other variables on the outcome of cases. Section V summarizes

 our findings and presents concluding remarks.

                              I. The Data

      The data for our study is a random sample of 858 defendants in

 New York County who were represented by the Legal Aid Society during the

year 1971.      The sample was limited to defendants whose arraignment took

 place in the first half of 1971, and whose cases were in the Society's

 closed files as of December 15, 1971. Cases were placed in the closed

 files if there were no further proceedings involving the defendant.

 Thus, our sample consists of completed cases which allows us to trace each

 defendant through the courts from his arraignment to the final disposition

 of his case.     The sample excludes females, juveniles, and youthful

offenders    (roughly, males under 21 years of age), defendants who replaced
                                                               4.




Legal Aid counsel with private counsel, and defendants whose cases

were disposed of at the time of their arraignment. A defendant's

arraignment takes place within 24 hours of his arrest, and a substantial

proportion (roughly 37 per cent of cases in the Society's closed files)

are completed at this time. Frequently, the charges against the defendant

are dismissed at the arraignment because the complaining witness does

not appear. Since the procedural questions we seek to investigate do

not come into play until after the arraignment, the exclusion of these

cases is consistent with our overall interest.

    There are other limitations to the data that should be noted. Legal

Aid is restricted to low income defendants. However,the majority of

criminal defendants in New York City have low incomes as evidenced by the

fact that the Legal Aid Society serves as counsel to about 70 per cent

of all defendants in New York.     The similarity between our sample of

Legal Aid defendants and all criminal defendants in New York City is

apparent from the data presented in Table 1 on the method of disposition

of cases, the proportion of defendants not appearing, and the proportion

of Supreme Court cases.     One must also be cautious about deriving infer-

ences on the operation of the criminal justice system in the U.S. from data



limited to low income defendants in New York, particularly in view of the

belief that New York's judicial system is more overburdened and closer to

collapse than that of other large cities. Finally, it would be incorrect

to treat the sample as representative of the population of criminal offenders

in New York or elsewhere. Defendants are persons arrested and charged with

a crime and their characteristics may be very different than a sample that

also included offenders who were not apprehended.

     Table 2 presents a portrait of defendants in the sample classified

by the type of offense and the severity of the charge. The sample is

widely distributed among offense types with the largest proportion of

defendants (29 per cent) accused of drug offenses (including both possession

and sale with the former being the less severe offense). ' With respect



to the severity of the charge, the majority of defendants in the sample

are accused of felonies (61 per cent). Since defendants are typically

charged with multiple offenses, the severity and offense class are deter-

mined by the most severe charge against the defendant. The second part of

Table 2 indicates the New York Penal Code penalties (in years) for the

various felony and misdemeanor charges. These penalties in turn are the

basis for a rough index of the severity of the charge against the defendants

(see Table 3).

     For convenience we present in Table 3 a list of the variables used

in the empirical analysis. The definitions of the variables given in the

table are brief and where necessary they are supplemented in the text.

For further reference we also include in Table 3 the means and standard

deviations of the variables.




                      II. Pretrial Status

     The pretrial status of a person arrested and charged with a crime is

affected by the court's decision regarding the terms on which the defendant

may obtain his pretrial release, and the defendant's demand for release

or his ability and willingness to meet the terms set by the court. The

first part of this section investigates the former question.   We analyze

the factors determining the size of the bail bond, and the related

question of whether the defendant is offered the option of a cash

alternative (that is, depositing a relatively small amount of cash as

an alternative to posting a bail bond). The second part of this section

analyses the empirical determinants of the defendant's demand for pre-

trial release with particular reference to the effects of the "price"

charged for release and the defendant's socio-economic characteristics.

The Determination of Bond

     Multiple regression equations were estimated on the dependent variable,

the dollar value of the bond set by the court. The specification of the

regression equation is as follows:

                         +   +       +       +    + u.               (1)
            BOND1=
where X, Y, Z and D are vectors of severity of offense variables, criminal

record variables, socio-economic variables and dummy offense variables

respectively, u is the residual, and the subscript i denotes the particular

defendant. (See Table 3 for the definition of variables included in these

classes.)

     The purpose of including in equation (1) variables measuring the

severity of the offense (the X vector) and the defendant's prior record

(the Y vector) is based on two hypotheses:

     Hypothesis I. The size of the bond is a position function of the

     harm the defendant is expected to do if released where harm

     includes either or both (a) the likelihood the defendant will

     interfere with the proceedings against him (primarily by fleeing

     or not appearing), and (b) the potential dangerousness of the

     defendant in terms of crimes comitted during the period of

     pretrial liberty.
                                                                   12.




    Hypothesis II. The severity of offense variables (except for

    possibly the confession variable) and the prior record variables

    are positively related to the amount of harm a defendant will do

    if released on bail.   In other words, these variables provide

    information on harm (Hypothesis II), and this information is then

    utilized by judges (Hypothesis I) in setting bond.

We will assume provisionally that the second hypothesis is in fact true,

and test the first hypothesis by examining whether the severity of the

offense and prior record variables are positively related to the size of

bond in equation (1).

    The variables included in the severity of offense category require

further explanation. The severity of the formal charge (the ASC variable)

is a direct estimate of the severity of the offense that allegedly took

place.     According to Hypotheses I and II this variable should have a

positive and significant effect on the size of the bail bond. The

inclusion of other variables in the severity of offense category is based

on the possible inaccuracy of the ASC variable alone. For example, the

more serious the injury to a complaining witness (    i.e.,   the victim),

holding the formal charge constant, the greater the actual severity of the

crime and hence (according to hypotheses I and II) the greater the size

of bond.      Or defendants resisting arrest or having weapons in their

possession at the time of their arrest, holding the formal charge constant,

may be considered to have committed a more dangerous offense and hence

will have higher bail bonds.      The final variable included (somewhat

arbitrarily) in the severity of offense category is whether the defendant

confessed prior to setting the bond (the CON variable). We are uncertain

about the expected effect of this variable on bond.
                                                                 24. F.

55 continued

      rate of disappearance by setting more difficult terms for pretrial

      release may still be a goal of the bail system but according to our
                                                 well
      empirical results this goal would be equally/served by setting bond

      randomly among defendants. One rationale of setting bond on the

      basis of the severity and extent of one's prior record is to prevent

      defendants with greater probabilities of committing crimes from

      obtaining pretrial liberty. Note that one can never totally reject

      the hypothesis that judges are attempting to forecast the probability

      of disappearance in setting bond since it is conceivable that they

      are attempting to do so but are unsuccessful in their efforts.



56.   It must be noted that our empirical findings are not intended as either

      an indictment or defense of the existing bail system. We have quanti-

      fied certain statistical relationships between bail setting and pre-

      trial harm, but have not attempted to measure the social costs of

      operating the bail system in comparison to the gains from preventing

      pretrial crimes. For example, although the factors used in setting

      bond also predict pretrial crime, they may be subject to considerable

      error. Thus, detained defendants may have higher probabilities of

      committing crimes during pretrial liberty than those not released,

      and yet a majority of those detained may not commit any crime had they

      been released. Moreover, if the aim of public policy were exclusively

      the prevention of pretrial crime, the ideal solution would be to jail

      every defendant.

    1. The Severity of Offense Variables. Overall, our findings

strongly support our predictions. The major indicator of severity, the

ASC variable, is positive and the most significant variable in all

equations in Table 4. Each additional unit (year) of severity adds on

average about $135 to the defendant's bond ;   for   example, a Class B

felony compared to a Class E felony is an increase in severity from 2 1/2

to 16 2/3 years, which in turn adds about $1900 to the size of bond. The

most significant of the other severity variables is an injury to the

complaining witness (INJ) where a severe injury adds between $400 and

$775 to the defendant's bond, other things constant. The resist arrest

variable (RES) has the predicted positive sign in all regressions but is

only marginally significant. The remaining severity of offense variables

(WPN and CON) have no significant effects on the size of bond.

    2. Criminal Record Variables. The criminal record variables behave

in a manner that is highly consistent with Hypotheses I and II. Both

past felonies (FEL) and past misdemeanors (MIS) have positive and signi-

ficant effects in all regression equations in Table 4, while past violations

(VIOL) have positive but insignificant effects. Of equal importance is

the relative rankings of these variables in the estimated regression

equations. In particular, a past felony arrest is statistically more

significant and has nearly four times the impact on the defendant's bond

than a past misdemeanor (for example, a past felony adds about $100 to

the bond while a past misdemeanor adds about $25, other things constant).

Since Hypothesis II combines both the severity of the offense and the

defendant's criminal record in forecasting the amount of harm from pre-

trial release, the empirical finding that past felonies have larger
                                                               17.




quantitative effects and are substantially more significant than past

misdemeanors and violations is understandable. Felonies are more severe

offenses, and hence a record or past felony arrests would indicate that

the defendant is expected to do greater harm if released that a defendant

with a past record of misdemeanors and viOlations.     We emphasize some

caution in interpreting the FEL, MIS and VIOL variables because they

indicate arrests not convictions (though based on the high rate of convic-

tions in the current sample, arrests are probably highly correlated with

convictions). The parole or probation variables (PAR) is, however, a

measure of a prior conviction and one that may have resulted in a jail

sentence. This variable is highly significant and has a strong positive

impact on the size of bond in all regressions. A defendant on parole or

probation (holding constant prior arrests, the severity of the current charge

and other variables) has, on average, to post approximately a $600 higher

bond to obtain pretrial liberty than a defendant not on parole or probation.

    The outstanding detainer variable (DEl) has a positive but non-signifi-

cant effect on the defendant's bond in all regressions in Table 4. An

outstanding detainer is a request to hold the defendant for a variety of

reasons such as a parole violation, a bail violation on a pending charge,

or a warrant for his arrest in another jurisdiction.      Since increasing

the size of bond is the principle means of detaining a person, one would

expect a positive relationship between bond and the presence of a detainer.

Part of the effect on bond of a detainer is picked up by the parole and

pending variables, but some additional effect remains though it is not

significant.

    The final indicator of a defendant's criminal record is the pending
                                                                18.




variable (PEND). A defendant who has a pending charge has in the past

been arrested and charged with a crime, released on bail, and then

rearrested and charged with committing a new offense (that is, the current

charge) during the period of pretrial liberty.       One would expect the

pending variable to be an important deterninant of the bond. Since we

are arguing that prior information is a useful predictor of future behavior

(Hypothesis II) one predictor of this harm is the fact that the defendant

has recently comitted a crime during the period of pretrial release. .ii

The results contained in Table 4 are consistent with this hypothesis. The

regression coefficients on the pending variable are positive and significant

in all regressions, and indicate that a pending charge is associated with

about a $500 increase in the size of the bond holding constant the other

variables.

    3. Socio-Economic Variables. Employment in legal activities (the

EMP variable) and the amount of earnings from legal employment (the EARN

variable) have significant negative effects on the size of the defendant's

bond in equations 4.3-4.5. Forty-seven per cent of the sample are currently

employed at the time of their arrest, and their average earnings is $106

per week. As weekly earnings rise due to both greater labor force

participation and higher hourly wages, the results in Table 4 indicate that

the size of bond falls.      This is consistent with the view that legal

earnings or employment are taken as crude measures of the defendant's

"ties" to the conmunity and as indicators of the likelihood that he will

appear for subsequent court appearances if released on bail. Whether this

variable in fact has any predictive power in forecasting nonappearances by

defendants will be tested later. The other socio-economic variables (AGE,

NYC, PREM and INC) have no significant effects on the size of bond. Except
                                                              19.




for NYC, the standard errors of these variables are all larger than their

respective regression coefficients.

    4. The Dumy Offense Variables. Equation 4.5 differs from 4.4 in

that eight dumy variables indicating the specific crime category of the

defendant's offense have been added to 4.5. The dummy variables are

robbery (e.g.,        1 if the defendant is accused of robbery and 0 if he

is not), assault, burglary, stolen property, larceny, forgery, possession

of a dangerous weapon and "other" offenses--with the excluded category being

drug offenses. We include the durrmy variables to answer the following

question: Is there anything significant about the particular offense that

results in the setting of a lower or higher bail bond once we hold constant

the severity of the offense, the defendant's criminal record and his socio-

economic characteristics? The answer for the group of offenses taken

together is "no". An F-test performed on the eight dummy variables leads

us to accept the null hypothesis that the eight make no significant contri-

bution to the reduction in the residual variance of the equation.

Cash Alternatives to Bond

    Up to this point, the empirical analysis has focused on the deter-

minants of the size of the bail bond. However, posting a bond to obtain

pretrial release may not be the only option available to the defendant.

Some defendants are given the choicebetween posting a bond or depositing

with the court an amount of cash that is typically a small fraction of

the bond. The option of a cash alternative will generally reduce the diffi-

culty of making bail since it eliminates the necessity of having access

to large sums of cash (for example, cash equal to the amount of the bond)

or assets that can be used as collateral for one's bond. Therefore, the
                                                                20.




possibility of cash alternatives means that an analysis of differences

in bond amounts alone may not accurately reflect differences in the

terms on which defendants may obtain their pretrial release. For example,

if one observed that a large proportion of defendants were given the option

of a cash alternative and that the proportion increased as the amount of

the bond increased, then this would seriously undermine the conclusion

that factors such as the severity of the offense, criminal record, etc.

are significant determinants of the terms of pretrial release. We can

investigate this and related questions using the data presented in Table 5

on the frequency of cash alternatives and their dollar amounts cross-clas-

sified by the size of bond.

      The results of Table 5 indicate that: (1) the number of defendants

with cash alternativez are concentrated in the $500 bond category (i.e.,

82 per cent of defendants given cash alternatives were in this group); (2)

the proportion of defendants given the cash option rapidly declines with

the size of bond (except between the $2000-$3000 and $3500-$5000 classes

though the difference between 36 and 4.4 per cent is not statistically

significant); and (3) the amount of cash alternative tends to rise with the

size of bond (except for the sharp decline for the two defendants with

cash alternatives in the $3500—$5000 bond class). Overall, increases in

the size of bond generally understate the difficulty of being released on

bail. Hence, our finding based on the bond regressions that the severity

of the offense, criminal record, etc., are important determinants of the

terms on which the defendant may obtain pretrial liberty is strengthened

by the greater likelihood of a cash alternative for a defendant with

relatively low bond.

    and 20 had bond set between $20 and $300. ror the latter group, 15 had a bond of

                                                                  22.




The Probability of Pretrial Release

    In theory, monetary requirements should have a significant negative

effect on ths probability of pretrail release since the greater the "price"

the defendant is required to pay to obtain pretrial release, the more likely

it will exceed the maximum he is willing to pay, and the less likely he

will be released. The maximum amount the defendant is willing to pay (given

the length of time of pretrial detention and the probability of reapprehen-

sion if released) will be positively related to the opportunity         cost of

his time, his wealth, the value he places on the non-pecuniary aspects of

pretrial liberty net of consumption provided him in prison, and any reduc-

tions in the expected future values of these variables resulting from pre-

trial detention (for example, lower expected future earnings if pretrial

detention raises the probability of conviction).

    Table 6 presents data on the proportion of defendants released cross-         S
classified   by the size of bond and the option of a cash alternative. At

one extreme--the distinction between defendants not required to post any

bond and those required to pay something--monetary factors have a signifi-

cant effect on reducing the probability of pretrial release. Of the 333

defendants released prior to the dispositionof their cases, 253 were

released on their own recognizance ( i.e.,    100 per cent of those with a

$0 bond) while only 13.2 per cent (i.e.,     80 defendants) of defendants

required to post bond or pay a cash alternative were released.           This

result is not surprising since our sample consists of Legal Aid defendants;

i.e.,    persons in the lower tail of the income distribution where a

relatively small financial requirement is likely to exceed the maximum

amount they are able to pay. We also observe that at each level of bond

(greater than zero) the proportion released is substantially greater for
                                                                                      23.

 defendants given a cash alternative, and that for defendants without

 a cash alternative the proportion released sharply declines as the size

of bond increases. It is apparent from Table 6 that monetary requirements

 set by the court have a strong bearing on the pretrial status of defendants.

      In order to measure the relative importance of variations in bond and

cash alternatives and the effects of other variables (for example, socio—

economic factors) on pretrial status, multivariate analysis is required.

However, the presence of a dichotomous dependent variable (   i.e.,     the

defendant is either released or not released) creates a problem in the

choice of the appropriate statistical method.

      One approach is to treat a dichotomous dependent variable as if it were

a continuous variable, and estimate by ordinary least-squares (OLS) a

linear probability function of the form

                     =    +   ctV. + u .
                                                                      (2)

           -I



(which takes the value 1 if the defendant is released and 0 if he is not)

and      and V. are vectors of regression coefficients and independent

variables respectively. Several problems arise from the use of OLS in

the case of a dichotomous dependent variable. These include the sensi-

tivity of the estimated regression coefficients to the location of the

explanatory variables (particularly, to extreme values), the inapplicability

of the usual tests of significance of the estimated coefficients, the

possibility that predicted values of some observations may be negative

or greater than one, and the heteroskedasticity of the residuals. To

avoid these difficulties we chose a maximum likelihood method of estimating

a logit model where the logit specification of the probability function

The maximum likelihood method handles individual observations, restricts

the predicted values of the probability to between 0 and 1, and yields

asymptotic t-ratios that enable one to test the significance of the

estimated coefficients.

     The coefficients in (3) are easily interpreted. For example, let

equal the coefficient on the variable Vk (where Vk denotes one of the

independent variables in (3)). We have

                     log (P r/(1—P r))
                                                =                                      (4a)

Since Pr/(l_Pr) equals the odds of being released on bail, k equals the

proportionate change in the odds per unit change in Vk. The derivative,

Pr/Vk when evaluated at the mean probability of comitting a crime

allows us to compare directly the logit results with the regression co-

efficients derived from the linear probability model.

                                                                                             (5)
                                                                       26.




where the defendant's bond, the option of a cash alternative, and the

dollar amount of the cash alternative are denoted by BOND, CA1 and CA2

respectively, and where        is a vector of socio-economic characteristics

defined in Table 3.

   One predicts that an increase in the defendant's bond will lower the

probability (or odds) of making bail, that the option of a cash alterna-

tive will raise the probability, and that an increase in the dollar amount

of the cashalternative (given this option) will lower the probability.

The interaction variable BONDCA1 is included to test the hypothesis that

increasing the amount of the bond will have no effect on the probability

of release when the defendant is given the option of a cash alternative.

The probability estimates are limited, however, by the absence of data on

variables that should affect the maximum amount the defendant is willing

to pay for release (   e.g.,         non-pecuniary aspects of detention, and

changes in future values of earnings and wealth), and by the availability

of imperfect measures of other relevant variables. In the latter category

are the socio-economic characteristics of defendants that are used to

approximate both the opportunity cost of detention and the defendant's wealth.

   The logit equation in Table 7 shows that the bond and cash alternative

option variables are highly significant determinants of the probability of

pretrial release (as measured by the t-ratios on the appropriate interaction

variables). The logit estimates indicate, for example, that if the defendant

is not given a cash alternative (i.e.,        CA1 =   0),   a $100 increase in bond

leads to a reduction in the probability of release by .036 (at the mean

or by about 27 per cent. Alternatively, a $100 increase leads to a 30 per

cent reduction in the odds of pretrial release (for example, at the mean

odds this is a reduction from about .16 to .11). As predicted, increasing

 the amount of bond produces no significant effect on the probability

 of release when the defendant is given the option of a cash alternative

 (CA1 =   1).   The impact of a cash alternative can be illustrated as follows:

 a $100 cash alternative, assuming bond is set at $500, will raise the

defendant's probability of rease by .13 (at the mean probability) or by

about 100 per cent. Similarly, this $100 option increases the odds of

pretrial release by slightly more than 100 per cent. We also observe

that increasing the amount of the cash alternative by $100 reduces the

odds of pretrial liberty by about 26 per cent, though this effect is not

significant (i.e.,       the t-ratio =   1.3).   In contrast to the bond and

cash alternative variables, the socio-economic variables are not signifi-

cant determinants of the probability of pretrial release.       Except for the

variable denoting residence in New York City, which has a positive and

marginally significant effect on the probability of release, the t-ratios

on the other socio-economic variables are all less than one.      Moreover, a
test on the joint significance of all five socio-economic variables

(including NYC) is consistent with the hypothesis of no effect10ne explana-

tion of the non-significance of these variables is that they are inaccurate

estimates of a defendant's ability to finance bail because they do not

reflect regularity of employment, past earnings, savings, etc. or because

other sources of income (e.g.,            illegal sources) are negatively

related to measures of legal employment, earnings and other income.

Finally note that the OLS estimate of the probability function are quite

similar in magnitude and significance to the logit equation.

      III. Forecasting the Harm From Pretrial Release

  We observed in the regression analysis of Table 4 a significant statis-

tical relationship between the size of bond and variables measuring the

severity of the defendant's offense, his criminal record, and his socio-

economic characteristics. The crucial question is whether these variables

also predict the amount of harm a defendant will do if released on bail

(Hypothesis II, p. 12). If this question is answered affirmatively, then

in combination with the analysis of bond and pretrial release in general,

we will have identified an important social function of the existing bail

system and provided a rationale for its existence. The two sources of harm

we investigate are crimes comitted during the period of pretrial release,

and the disappearance of released defendants.

Crimes During the Period of Pretrial Release

   The expected harm from crimes comitted during the period of pretrial

liberty can be subdivided into two components: the probability of comitting

a crime (or crimes), and the severity of the crime. We examine first the

former component. Unfortunately, the data available are not ideal and thus

our findings mustbe interpreted with some caution. We lack data on the

commission of crimes during the period of pretrial liberty by defendants

released on bail on their current charge.       Nevertheless, information

can be derived on crimes committed during the period of pretrial liberty

from the 59 defendants in our sample who at the time of the arrest on

their current charge also have a pending charge. This group of defendants

had in .the recent past been arrested and charged with a crime (i.e.,

their pending charge), released on bail, and then rearrested and charged
                                                                 30.




with committing a new crime during the period of pretrial liberty

(i0e.,      their current charge).     One may object to treating all

defendants with a pending charge as if they were identical to persons

committing a crime during the period of pretrial release. Forty of the

59 defendants with a pending charge were in fact convicted on their cur-

rent charge, 10 had their cases dismissed and 9 disappeared. On the

other hand, to treat only the 40 convicted defendants as the group com-

mitting crimes during the period of pretrial release would eliminate some

who actually committed crimes but were not convicted. Some "guilty

defendants may have had their charges dismissed because of a technicality,

and there is no reason to presume that all defendants who disappeared did

not comit crimes. In view of our ignorance regarding which group is most

representative of defendants committing crimes, we present results for both

all pending defendants (59 defendants) and pending defendants who are

convicted (40 defendants). The former probably include some who did not

commit crimes during the period of pretrial release while the latter group

probably exclude some who did. (Hereafter, we refer to both groups as

the "Pending Group", and when necessary distinguish between the two by

the   terms All Pending" and "Convicted Pending".)
      We can now compare the two Pending Groups with the group of defendants
released on bail who have no pending charges (hereafter, the "Non-Pending
Group".) The purpose of this comparison is to test whether there are

significant differences in the characteristics of the Pending and Non-Pending

groups (which would then be characteristics that forecast pretrial harm),

and whether these characteristics are related to the factors that determine

the size of bond. To illustrate, suppose we find that the Pending Group
                                                                 31.




has a longer criminal record (at the time of their arrest on the pending

charge) than the Non-Pending Group. This would indicate that prior

criminal record provides information on the likelihood of comitting a

crime during the period of pretrial liberty. And one could infer that

the reason prior record is used in setting bond is because of the informa-

tion it conveys on pretrial harm.

    Table 8 contains for the Pending and Non-Pending groups the means

and standard deviations of independent variables used in the bond regres-

sions. Clearly, for the Pending group we desire variables recorded at

the time of the pending offense since it is these values that are available

to judges setting bond on the pending offense, and these values that are

relevant to predicting the conunission of an offense during the period of

pretrial liberty (   i.e.,   the current offense for persons with a pending

charge). Data are available on the severity and type of pending charge.

Unfortunately, there were no data relating to the pending offense for

several variables entered in the bond regressions.        Furthermore,
several variables included in Table 8 for the Pending Group should be used

with caution because they were recorded at the time of the arrest on the

current charge and hence may have changed since the time of the pending

charge. Specifically, data on employment, earnings, other income and residence

in Table 8 were recorded at the time of the current arrest. Data on the

type of offense (i.e.,       the eight dumy variables in the bond regression)

are also excluded from Table 8 since a comparison of means is clearly

inappropriate. (We pursue these variables with other statistical tests

later on.)

  There are 59 defendants with a pending charge at the time of their arrest on the
current charge and 40 of these were convicted on their current charge. 328 defendants
are in the Non-Pending Group (defined as defendants relased on bail on the current
charge who had no pending charge at the time of their arrest on the current charge).
Note that the Non-Pending Group of defendants released on bail excludes 5 defendants
with a pending charge who were released on bail on their current charge.
 b
  ASC is the severity of the pending charge for the Pending Group and the severity of the
current charge for the Non-Pending Group. EEL, MIS, and VIOL are prior record variables
for the Pending Group at the time of their arrest on the pending charge, and hence the
pending charge is not counted as a prior arrest. The remaining variables are all
recorded at the time of the current arrest and, therefore, may be subject to error as
estimates of their values at the time of the pending charge for the Pending Group.

   The data in Table 8 present a striking picture of the differences

between the two groups of defendants. The Pending group were accused

prior to their release on bail with having committed a more severe crime

(the ASC variable), had a record of more prior felony and misdemeanor

arrests, had a greater proportion of persons on parole or probation,

and had a lower average earnings than the Non-Pending group.     On the

other hand, there appear to be no statistically significant differences

between the Pending and Non-Pending group in their age, residence, previous

and current employment, and legitimate income (exclusive of earnings). Over-

all, these results have an important bearing on understanding the operation

of the bail system. They suggest that the variables that are statistically

significant determinants of the defendant's bond (   e.g.,     severity of

the charge and criminal record) also provide information on the likelihood

that a defendant will be charged with comitting an offense during the

period of pretrial liberty, and that the variables that are not sfgnificant

determinants of bond (   e.g.,     age, residence, other income, previous

employment) do not provide such information. One can infer, therefore, that

the reason judges use the severity of the defendant's charge and his prior

criminal record (and not the defendant's age, residence, previous employment

and other income) as a guide in setting bond is because the first set of

variables provides some information as to the likelihood that the defendant

will commit a crime during the period of pretrial liberty.

    Although the data in Table 8 provide insights into identifying the

factors that predict crimes committed during the period of pretrial liberty,

the analysis of one factor at a time does not allow us to estimate the net

amount of information yielded by any one factor when all other factors are
                                                                        34.




 held constant. To do this we have estimated a probability function for

 pretrial crimes using the maximum likelihood method previously described.

 The logit specification of the probability function is the following

 P     =   l/[l+e

                         lx.

 pretrial liberty for the i— defendant (which takes the value 1 if the

 defendant is in the Pending group and 0 if he is in the Non-pending group).

 X, Y, Z and 0 are sets of variables defined in Table 3, although the vari-

 ables included in each set (except for D) are limited to those contained in

 Table 8.

       Estimates of the probability function of crimes committed during the

 period of pretrial liberty are presented in Table 9. Equations 9.1-9.3

 are maximum likelihood Logit results where all defendants with a pending

 charge are included in the Pending group; equations 9.4-9.6 are also Logit

 results but the Pending group only includes defendants convicted on their

 current charge; and equations 9.7-9.8 are OLS results that can be compared

 to 9.3 and 9.6 respectively.

       The findings in Table 9 are generally consistent with the results

 in Table 8 and the bond regressions in Table 4. Both the severity of the

 charge against the defendant and his criminal record (past felonies, past

misdemeanors, parole but not past violations) have significant positive

 effects on the probability of committing crimes during the period of

 pretrial liberty.             These findings are largely unaffected by which

defendants are included in the Pending group, and by whether Logit or OLS

techniques are used. The magnitude of the coefficients can be illustrated       S
in   the following examples. A defendant charged with a class C felony,

compared to one charged with a class A misdemeanor, which adds 9.4 years

to the ASC variable, has approximately a .09 greater probability of being

charged with a new crime during pretrial liberty, other things constant.

Since the mean probability of being charged is between .10 and .15, a person

accused of a class C felony has about a 60 to 90 per cent higher probability

of being arrested and charged with committing a crime during pretrial

liberty than a person initially charged with a class A misdemeanor. Alterna-

tively, each unit increase in the severity of the initial offense raises

the odds of being charged with committing a crime during pretrial liberty

by between 7 and 11 per cent. A unit increase in past felonies raises the

probability of a pretrial crime on average by about .01 or roughly 7 to 10

per cent, or raises the odds by about 10 to 12 per cent. More strikingly,

for a defendant on parole the probability of being charged with committing

a crime during pretrial liberty rises by between .13 and .18 or more than

100 per cent and the odds increase by approximately 150 per cent.       In

sum, the results on severity of the offense and prior criminal record

strongly support the hypothesis that these variables are positively related

to the probability of committing crime during the period of pretrial liberty.

Since it has previously been shown that judges set bail according to these

same variables, we now have a powerful rationale for such procedure; namely,

that severity of the initial charge and prior record provide judges with

information on the likelihood of a defendant doing harm when released on

bail. The remaining variables in the equations are generally not significant

predictors (except for age, which is significant in 9.1 and marginally

significant in 9.2 and 9.4) of the likelihood of committing a crime during

pretrial liberty. For the residence (NYC), previous employment (PREM),
                                                               39.




other income (INC), and the type of offense variables (0), these findings

are in accord with the earlier bond regressions (that is, these variables

do not predict crimes during pretrial liberty and are not used in setting

bond). On the other hand, employment or earnings, which had negative and

significant effects on the size of bond in Table 4, have negative (as

expected) but insignificant or marginally significant effects on the

probability of committing a crime during pretrial liberty.     We emphasize,

however, that predictions about the likelihood of comitting a crime need

not be the sole criterion for setting bond. Forecasts on the severity of

the crime and the likelihood that the defendant will not appear for future

legal proceedings are also relevant.

Severity of Crime

    We explore the question of severity using multiple regression analysis

in which the dependent variable is the severity of the current charge (ASC).

The sample is restricted to defendants with a pending charge (i.e.,     the

Pending Group) since we are interested in the ability to forecast the severity

of the crime committed during the period of pretrial liberty, given that a

crime has been committed. The independent variables include the same

variables used to forecast the probability of committing a crime during the

period of pretrial release. The regression equations are presented in

Table 10 where equation 10.1 includes all pending defendants and equation 10.2

includes pending defendants convicted on their current charge. The results

of the two regression equations are quite similar except for the NYC vari-

able, which is marginally significant in 10.1 but insignificant in 10.2.

Of particular interest is the prior felony variable which is a highly signi-

ficant predictor of the severity of the offense comitted during pretrial
                                                                                40.

liberty. This result together with the finding that prior misdemeanors

is insignificant in Table 10 suggest why we observed in Table 4 that

prior felonies had a greater impact than prior misdemeanors on the

defendant's bond. Prior felonies predict both the probability and

severity of the crime during pretrial liberty while prior misdemeanors

only predict the probability. Of the two other criminal record variables,

parole is insignificant while prior violations is significant. However,

the more violations, other things the same, the less severe the crime

during pretrial liberty. This appears to run counter to the hypothesis

that the longer one's criminal record, the greater the harm from pretrial

liberty. One possible explanation is the presence of serial correlation

in the severity of crimes--that is, persons with more arrests in the past

on violations, other things constant, are more likely to be arrested for

violations in the future.      However, the type of serial correlation is

complex because the severity of pending charge (ASC) had an insignificant

though positive effect on the severity of the crime during pretrial liberty.

Thus, to the extent that serial correlation of severity exists, it does not

run strongly from the imediate past charge (pending charge) to the current

one but instead must reflect a pattern over several past offenses and the

current offense.

    The effects of the socio-economic variables in Table 10 should be

viewed cautiously. As noted previously, NYC, EMP, EARN, PREM and INC are

recorded at the time of the current not the pending arrest. Employment

and earnings which had significant negative effects on the defendant's bond

have no significant effect in predicting the severity of the current

charge.      Moreover, the Logit results of Table 9 indicated that
                                                                42.




employment and earnings had no significant effects on the probability of

committing crimes during pretrial liberty. The effects of age in Table 9

and Table 10 indicate that older defendants have both a lower probability

of committing crimes and comit less severe crimes during pretrial

liberty. (The former effect is marginally significant while the latter

effect is significant.) We have no explanation for the effects of age;

however, it is apparent from the bond regressions that the information

conveyed by age is not utilized in setting bond.

    The power to predict the severity of crimes using prior information

need not be confined to crimes during pretrial liberty. We can examine

all defendants in our sample and ask whether prior information forecasts

the severity of their current charge. Equation 10.3 presents the results

for defendants without a pending charge, the majority of defendants in our

sample. Here the prior criminal record variables have no significant

effects on the severity of the current charge. The only significant vari-

able in equation 10.3 is employment which shows that employed defendants

are charged with committing less severe crimes. However, an F-test on the
                  entire
joint effect of the/set of independent variables leads us to accept the

null hypothesis that jointly these variables have no significant power to

predict severity.      Exactly why we have better success in forecasting

severity of crimes committed during pretrial liberty remains an interesting

puzzle.

Disappearance

    The second source of harm from pretrial liberty is the disappearance

of defendants released on bail. Disappearance frustrates the criminal

proceedings against the defendant, gives released defendants added time to
                                                                43.




commit illegal acts, and generally weakens the deterrent effect of criminal

sanctions. Data are available on the disappearance of defendants released

on bail on their current charge, making it possible to test directly the

determinants of the disappearance rate.      Since the dependent variable

is dichotomous (1 if the defendant disappears and 0 if he does not ),   the

estimation technique employed is 'the maximum likelihood Logit method

described earlier.

    Two questions are of interest in the analsyis of disappearance.

First, are the factors that determine the size of bond also significant

predictors of the probability of disappearance? Second, does the size of

the defendant's bond and the presence of other financial requirements

provide any deterrence to disappearing?

    These two questions are interrelated. One stated purpose of the

existing bail system (and many would argue the only "legal" purpose) is

to deter disappearance by setting a money payment or bond that is forfeited

if the accused does not appear in court. In theory, the higher the bond

the greater the cost to the defendant of disappearing and hence the less

likely he will disappear. This hypothesis has been widely challenged. It

is argued that the use of professional bondsmen to post bonds for the

defendant shifts the potential financial loss to the bondsman and removes

the incentive for the defendant to appear at trial. This may be countered

by arguing that the risks of disappearance are not shifted entirely because

bondsmen require collateral and defendants are liable for the amount of the

bond if it is forfeited. Further, bondsmen have incentives to protect

their investment via the policing of defendants and informal mechanisms exist

to ensure the appearance of defendants in continual trouble with the law
                                                                           44.




(e.g.,                the prospect of not finding a bondsman in the future).

Although arguments can be advanced for or against the deterrent effect
                               the
of bond, the question of/actual effect on disappearance remains open

because of the absence of empirical analysis.             A second purpose for

investigating the latter question is that bond and other financial factors

must be held constant in order to test the hypothesis that the severity of

offense, criminal record, etc. are predictors of disappearance. Assuming

that the size of the defendant's bond deters disappearance, the failure

to hold bond constant could lead to the conclusion that the severity of

offense and criminal record have no effect on the incentive to disappear

since whatever partial effect exists is offset by a higher bond.

    The Logit specification of the probability of disappearing                    for

the i defendant is

                      -(0+1BOND.+2CA1.+3(BOND.CA1 )4(CA1 CA2)1
    =    1/El   + e      +5X.+6Y.+7Z.+8D.+u.)]                             (7)




where X, Y, Z and D are vectors of variables denoting severity of offense,

criminal record, socio-economic characteristics, and type of offense

respectively, and BOND, CA1 and CA2 are financial variables. The specifi-

cation in equation (7) of two interaction variables,
                                                               BONDCA1 and CA1CA2,
requires some explanation. The inclusion of BONDCA1 is based on the hypo-

thesis that the deterrent effect on disappearing of increasing the defendant's

bond will be weakened or even eliminated by giving the defendant the option

of posting a cash alternative of a given amount. Thus, in equation (7) we

expect        to be negative and i3. to be positive and of approximately the same

magnitude as f. The interaction term CA1CA2 is simply the dollar value

of the cash alternative (since if CA2 >        0, then CA1 =   1   and if CA2 =   0,   then

CA1 =   0).           the coefficient on CA1•CA2, should be negative because the
                                                                45.




greater the amount of cash required for pretrial liberty the greater the

amount lost if the defendant disappears.      Table 11 presents both Logit

and OLS estimates of the probability function of disappearance for defendants

released on bail, and Table 12 evaluates the interaction variables in the

probability function.

    Tables 11 and 12 indicate thatfinancial variables have some effect in

deterring the disappearance of defendants released on bail. The only signi-

ficant financial variable in the logit equation (at the .05 but not the

.025 level of significance) is the size of the defendant's bond providing

he is not given a cash alternative option. --'   Here a $100 increase in

bond is associated with a .05 reduction in the probability of disappearing

(at its mean value) or alternatively, with a 25 per cent reduction in the

odds of disappearing for released defendants. More strikingly, a $500

increase in bond reduces these odds (at their mean value) from .377 to .124

(from about 4 in 10 to slightly more than 1 in 10) or by about 67 per cent.

However, if the defendant is also given the option of a cash alternative,

increases in bond have no significant effect (as predicted) in reducing the

probability of disappearing.      The logit coefficients on the remaining

combinations of financial variables presented in Table 12 are all insignifi-

cant and less than their respective standard errors. For example, giving a

cash alternative to a defendant with a $500 bond does not significantly alter

the probability of disappearing. This is not surprising because the impact

of a $100 cash alternative should be felt primarily for large values of bond.

When bond is raised to $1500, a cash alternative of $100 substantially

 increases the probability of disappearing (by .323 in Table 12) but again

 this effect is not significant.-' We also find that increasing the amount

of the cash alternative has a negative though insignificant effect on the

probability of disappearing. Finally, note that Logit and OLS estimation

methods yield approximately the same results for the financial variables.

    The results of Table 11 indicate that the main determinants of the

defendant's bond--the severity of the charge (ASC), prior felonies (FEL) and

parole or probation status (PAR)--are not significant predictors of the

probability of disappearing. In fact, the more severe the charge, the

greater the number of prior felonies and the more likely the defendant is

on parole, the lower the estimated probability of disappearance, other things

constant. Although none of these coefficients approach significance, their

negative signs hardly support the view that these variables are positive

predictors of disappearing. Of the other variables in Table 11 only the

presence of an outstanding detainer (DET) and resisting arrest on the current

charge (RES) were positive and significant predictors of the probability of

disappearing. In addition, both of these variables had a positive but non-

significant effect on the defendant's bond (see Table 4). One should also

point out that the coefficients on the age variable (AGE) are marginally

significant in Table 11, indicating that older defendants are less likely

to disappear. Age was also negatively related to the probability of

committing crimes during pretrial liberty and to the severity of these

crimes, though these results were significant in only a few equations. This

information, however, was not utilized in setting bond where the regression

coefficient on age was always less than its standard error. Six dummy

offense variables were included in each equation in Table 11. The coefficients

on these variables were generally insignificant but jointly they had a

significant effect on the probability of disappearing.      This contrasts
                                                               49.




with the absence of any significant joint effects of offense type in the

bond regression or in the equation on the probability and severity of

crimes during pretrial liberty.

Forecasting Harm: Some Concluding Remarks

    Our empirical analysis has revealed that the main factors determining

the defendant's bond are also significant predictors of crimes comitted

during the period of pretrial liberty but that these same factors have

little power in forecasting the relatively high disappearance rate (around

30 per cent) during this period. We have reproduced in Table 13 the rele-

vant regression and logit coefficients from the earlier tables that illus-

trate this important finding.

    All independent variables that are included in Table 13 were statisti-

cally significant in the bond regressions, and all were entered in the

equations on pretrial harm. Four of these variables--the severity of the

initial charge, prior felony arrests, prior misdemeanor arrests, and parole

or probation status--had positive and significant effects on either the

probability (odds) that the defendant coimiits a crime during pretrial liberty

or the severity of the pretrial crime given its comission. That is, var-

iables measuring the seriousness and extent of a defendant's criminal record

provide information on the occurence of criminal acts during pretrial liberty.

Data limitations allowed only incomplete analysis in the pretrial crime

equations of several variables included in the bond regressions.          However,

the tests that were carried out suggested that the insignificant variables

in both the equations on the probability and on the severity of pretrial

crimes were also insignificant in the bond regressions.            In contrast,

none of the variables in Table 13 had any significant impact on the probability

(odds) of disappearing. The only two significant predictors of dis-

appearance (aside from the financial variables) were the outstanding

detainer and resist arrest variables, and neither had a significant

effect on the defendant's bond.

    On the basis of these results, one can infer that judges are setting

bond according to estimates of expected harm during the period of pretrial

liberty, and that they are being guided in this decision by variables that

are significant predictors of one type of harm; namely, crimes committed

during the period of pretrial liberty.     Moreover, it would not be

unreasonable to conclude that the principle social function of the existing

bail system (as it operates in New York City) is to prevent defendants from

committing additional crimes not from disappearing.      This finding is in

sharp contrast to the traditional view of bail which asserts that the sole

legal purpose of money bail is to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial

and that to use bail otherwise--that is, to prevent future criminal acts--is

a violation of the Constitution. Critics of the criminal justice system are

 keenly aware of this conflict between theory and practice, and have argued

 at length that the actual operation of the bail system bears only a faint

 resemblence to its legal purpose. Many of these critics, however, deny that

 bail serves any useful purpose because they contend that judges and other

 law enforcement personnel do not have the information or skills to forecast

 pretrial crimes with any reasonable degree of accuracy. Our empirical

 analysis casts considerable doubt on this latter assertion.

     One is tempted to ask why judges behave as if they are more concerned

 with preventing defendants from committing crimes than from disappearing

 during pretrial liberty. Although a comprehensive answer is beyond the scope
                                                                  52.




 of the present study, it is useful to speculate on possible reasons.

 Prima facie there appears to be an incentive for judges not to follow the

 policy outlined above because this policy is widely believed to be illegaland

 unconstitutional.    Numerous scholars, public officials, appellate judges,

 and various organizations including the Legal Aid Society of New York and

 the Vera Institute have spoken out against the use of bail for purposes of

 preventing pretrial crimes. And in at least one instance a suit was brought

challenging the constitutionality of the bail system. -'-"   In so far as
judges are responsive to the criticisms of these groups or to possible sanc-

tions (e.g.,         suspension or dismissal) from pursuing an "illegal" bail

policy, then one is unlikely to observe the setting of bond based on estimates

of future criminal activities. On the other hand, one can point to forces

that may produce a response more consistent with our empirical findings.

For example, if a defendant comits a crime during pretrial liberty and is

apprehended, it is immediately apparent which judge was responsible for the

defendant's release. In turn, the judge may receive adverse publicity

depending on the severity of the defendant's crime, and the judiciary in

general may become the target of public criticism against a legal system

that is turning loose dangerous criminals. However, if a defendant disappears

(assuming his case has not already received a great amount of notoriety), it

is difficult to identify the judge responsible unless the defendant subsequently

commits a crime and is arrested. Obviously, the relative importance of the

opposing incentives cannot be determined a priori but requires a careful

analysis of the explicit sanctions, rates of promotions, behavior of elected

versus appointed judges, non-pecuniary benefits, etc.


                                                                                   S
                                                                53.




    A related issue but one that is more specific to New York City is to

ask what bail policy might be expected in a community where allegedly there

is a crisis in law enforcement. Consider the following possible circum-

stances: crime rates are high and rising; a significant fraction of persons

who are arrested and then released on bail fail to show up voluntarily for

subsequent court appearances; only a small fraction of these defendants are

reapprehended because of the limited enforcement resources and the large

number of disappearances; defendants are rarely denied requests to delay

their case and hence are able to put off for long periods the ultimate dis-

position of their case; and the resources of the prosecution are so strained

by the large caseload and long delays that defendants, particularly, those

free on bail, are offered trivial sentences in exchange for pleading guilty.

One response to such a system is to punish and convict persons at the only

stage that is often possible--the stage immediately after their arrest. That

is, at the time of the defendant's arraignment, bond would be fixed at rela-

tively high levels when there is a strong presumption of factual guilt. A

higher bond would increase the likelihood of the defendant's pretrial deten-

tion, which is equivalent to immediate punishment, and would also increase

the likelihood of future punishment following the disposition of his case.

In these circumstances, bond and more generally the terms set for pretrial

release serve as indicators of the judges estimate of both the defendant's

factual guilt and the appropriate punishment. One should then observe a

significant relationship between the size of bond and both the probability

of conviction and severity of punishment, other things constant. Note that

it is not necessary that using the bail system for the purpose of punishment
                                                                              54.




  would generate the features of bail that we have empirically observed.                  S
  The link must be that defendants with more extensive criminal records
                                                                                    and

  currently accused or more severe crimes are not only more likely to

  commit crimes if released on bail but are also more likely to be factually

  guilty.   —

                        the next section we attempt to gain incites, into this

 question by examining the relationship between bond, pretrial detention

 and the disposition of cases.



                             IV. THE DISPOSITION OF DEFENDANTS

         In this section we analyze the empirical determinants of the dis-

position of cases. We make no attempt to examine the choice among dif-

ferent methods of disposition, particularly the choice between a settlement

and a trial, since all but seven defendants in our sample had their cases

disposed of without a trial.                Instead we focus on the factors determining

the sentence received by the defendant, including the important question of

the effect of pretrial status on the sentence.

        There are two main hypotheses regarding the relationship between

pretrial status and the disposition of the case. The first asserts that

defendants not released on bail are, as a consequence of their detention,

more likely to be convicted and more likely to receive longer prison sen-

tences than comparable defendants released on bail. One can argue that

pretrial detention reduces the productivity of the defendants inputs into

his case (both his own time and market inputs such as the services of an

attorney). This in turn increases the probability of the defendant's con-

viction ii a trial, which would weaken his bargaining power, and lead him

to accept worse terms in a pretrial settlement.
                                                                55.




      The second hypothesis and one developed in the last section is

that pretrial detention is the result of a greater probability of con-

viction adjusted for the severity of the offense. This is because judges

supposedly use the setting of bond and other terms of pretrial release as

a mecnanism for punishing defendants whom they believe are more likely

to be convicted and to receive jail sentences. According to this hypothesis

a finding of a positive relationship between detention and the severity

of the sentence is expected; however, this would indicate that the sentence

and not pretrial detention was the causal factor.

       One can distinguish empirically between these two hypotheses by

including as independent variables both the defendant's bond and his pre-

trial status in a regression equation on the defendant's sentence. If

the second hypothesis is correct, one should observe a positive coefficient

on the bond variable since the amount of bond incorporates information on

the probability of conviction adjusted for the severity of the offense.

If one still finds a negative effect of detention on the sentence with bond

entered in the equation, this would then support the hypothesis that pretrial

detention had an independent adverse effect on the defendant's sentence.

Stated differently, if the regression were to exclude the defendant's bond,

then the coefficient on the bail variable would be measuring both the effect

of pretrial detention and the effect of prior information on the expected

sentence (since the greater the bond, the greater the likelihood of pretrial

detention).

       Formally, we have the following recursive system of equations.
                                                                    56.

In equation (8) BOND is a positive function of the severity of the offense

(the X vector), prior record (the V vector) and socio-economjc characteristics

(the Z vector). We have argued and provided substantial empirical evidence

that the X and V variables affect BOND because (a) judges set bond according

to estimates of pretrial harm and (b) X and V provide such information.          We

are now hypothesizing that BOND also includes predictions about the defendant's

expected penalty. This expected penalty is in part related to the X and .V

variables; however, the residual, u1, also contains such information-—pre-

sumably the greater the value of U1, the greater the expected penalty other

things constant. In equation (9), the defendant's pretrial status, denoted

by BAIL (which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the defendant is released

and 0 if he is detained), is determined by the size of BOND (or, more generally,

the terms of pretrial release) by the socio-economic variables.            The

sentence variable in turn is affected by pretrial status, plus information

on the expected outcome (contained in the BOND variable), plus any additional

effects due to the X, V and Z vectors of variables. The failure to include

the BOND variable in equation (10) would mean that BAIL would pick up the

influence of BOND since u1 is assumed to be positively correlated with the

expected sentence and defendants released on bail are more likely to have

negative u11s.

      Table 14 presents the regression estimates of equation (10). The


                                                                                      .
                                                                 57.




dependent variable in all equations is the defendant's sentence (SENT),

which ranges from zero in the event of a dismissal or probation to 15

years (though only 18 defendants received sentences in excess of 1 year).1

The definitions of all independent variables are given in Table 3.

       The most striking result in Table 14 is the positive and highly

significant effect of the defendant's bond on his sentence. The importance

of this effect is illustrated in the following examples. At the mean values

of the other independent variables, a $0 bond is associated with an average

sentence of about 21 days, a $500 bond with a sentence of 56 days, a $1500

bond with a sentence of 125 days, and a $2000 bond with a sentence of about

1 year. Since less than 3 per cent of our sample have sentences in excess

of 1 year, it follows that variations in bond (within the range in which

bond is set) can account for a large fraction of the average differences in

sentences among defendants. These findings provide strong support for the

hypothesis that at the initial stages of the criminal proceedings, judges

are setting bond, in part, according to forecasts of the defendant's sentence.

Thus, defendants likely to receive major penalties because they are accused

of severe offenses or have lengthy prior records will have relatively high

bonds and ten.! to be detained. In contrast, defendants likely to receive

minor sentences if convicted will have relatively low bonds and tend to be

released.      How does one interpret these empirical findings? We speculated

at the end of Section iii on the possible adaptation of a criminal justice

system to a situation where disappearance rates are relatively high and

resources for reapprehension are severely limited. In these circumstances

the determination of bond becomes the vehicle for effecting punishment because

if the accused is released at this time, punishment becomes a remote possibility.!5"

This interpretation is clearly consistent with our empirical evidence.

       It is more difficult to generalize on the effects of pretrial

status. In equations 14.1, 14.3 and 14.4 there is no significant difference

between the sentence of released and detained defendants, holding constant

the other variables. --'   In   equation 14.2, we observe a significant positive

effect of pretrial detention on the sentence (    i.e.,   a significant negative

coefficient on BAIL) but this is due to the deletion of the bond variable.

Once the latter is entered, as in equations 14.1, 14.3 or 14.4, the signifi-

cance of pretrial status is eliminated. On the other hand, equations 14.6

and 14.7 yield a different interpretation. In these equations the dichotomous

bail variable was replaced by two pretrial status variables; DAYS-i and DAYS-2

which are defined respectively as the number of days from arrest to disposi-

tion of the case for detained and for released defendants.         (The means

of these variables are 29 and 62 days respectively.) If pretrial detention

has an adverse effect on the outcome, one might expect that the greater the

amount of detention, as measured by days detained, the greater the defendant's

sentence. Alternatively, there is no compelling reason to expect a relation

between days at liberty (DAYS-2) and the sentence (assuming a disposition

of the case). This is precisely our findings in equations 14.6 and 14.7.

Although BOND continues to be the dominating variable, DAYS-i has a positive

and highly significant effect on the sentence, indicating that the greater

the length of pretrial detention, other things constant, the more severe the

sentence.      In contrast, DAYS-2 is marginally significant and of smaller

magnitude than DAYS-i. Pretrial detention, therefore, has an independent

and adverse effect on the defendant's sentence but this is only observable

when one differentiates according to the length of detention.
                                                                  61.




       We can sumarize the results of the other independent variables

in Table 14.   (1) The severity of the charge (ASC), which is measured by

the statutory penalty of the offense, has a significant positive effect

on the sentence though the effect is diminished (as expected) by inc-luding

eight dumy offense variables in 14.4 and 14.7. -- The coefficients

on ASC indicate that, other things constant, each year of a statutory penalty

is associated with between 8 and 22 days of sentence, or a ratio of statutory

penalty to sentence of between 43 and 17 to 1   This understates the total

effect of statutory penalties because we have shown in Table 4 that severity

is a significant determinant of the defendant's bond which in turn affects

the sentence. The total effect of ASC must include the indirect effect

operating through the defendant's bond. 7_91 (2) Of the other variables in

the severity of offense group (CON, WPN, INJ and RES), only an injury to

a complaining witness (INJ) has a significant positive impact on the sentence,

and this effect is substantial. For example, a serious injury produces a

direct effect on average of about 114 days plus an indirecteffect via

bond of between 36 and 55 days.      (3) Since prior felonies, misdemeanors

and parole or probation status are insignificant in Table 14, they only

effect the sentence indirectly via bond. These indirect effects are weak

for prior felonies and misdemeanors; for example, an additional prior felony

arrest adds about 7 days to the sentence. The indirect effect of a defendant

on parole or probation is about 45 additional days of sentence. The pending

variable is significant and positive in equations 14.1-14.4, adding between

70 and 100 days to one's sentence, but insignificant when dismissals are

excluded in equations 14.5 to 14.7. Thus the significance of a pending charge


                                                                                 .
                                                                62.




in Table 14 is due to its role in reducing the likelihood of a dismissal.

The estimated indirect effect of a pending charge is about 40 days.   (4)

All socio-economic variables have standard errors that are greater than

their regression coefficients in Table 14 and hence are insignificant

direct determinants of the sentence. Emplyment or legal earnings, however,

will affect the defendants sentence via their influence in reducing bond.

(5) The dummy offense variables, entered in 14.4 and 14.7, are jointly insigni-

ficant, indicating that the type of offense (given information on bond,

severity of offense, etc.) is not a statistically significant factor in

determining the defendant's sentence.


                        V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

      At the outset we remarked on the widely held belief that the current

operation of the criminal justice system is capricious and nearly random.

According to this position, for example, the determination of bail and the

disposition of cases would largely be the product of the whim of judges and

others, and would not be systematically related to the nature and circum-

stances of the defendant's offense or his prior criminal record. This view

is at variance with our analysis. The two major empirical findings of this

study may be summarized as follows.

      1. The defendant's bond and more generally the terms of his pretrial

release were strongly influenced by various measures of the severity of the

defendant's offense and his prior criminal record. Thus, the more severe

the defendant's offense and the more extensive his criminal record, the

greater the size of his bond and the lower the probability of his pretrial

release. Severity and prior record were, in turn, significant predictors
                                                                63.




of crimes committed during the period of pretrial liberty but had little

power in forecasting the relatively high disappearance rate (around 30

per cent) of released defendants. On the basis of these results it is

not unreasonable to infer that the rationale for utilizing severity and

prior record variables in setting bond is that these variables provide

information on the expected harm from pretrial liberty where harm is

measured by additional crimes.

      2. The major determinant of the defendant's sentence was the size

of his bond. Our explanation for this finding is that at the time bond is

set judges are forecasting the likelihood of the defendant's conviction

and the appropriate punishment. The forecast is then incorporated into the

bail setting process by setting bond at relatively higher values for

persons expected to receive more severe sentences, and setting bond

at relatively lower values for persons likely to receive negligible

sentences. We also observed that pretrial detention, as measured by days

of detention, had an independent adverse effect on the sentence, though

the dominating factor on the sentence was always the defendant's bond.

      Are the above findings incompatible? On the one hand, bond incorporates

information on the probability of pretrial crimes, and on the other, bond

provides an estimate of the defendant's sentence. However, in a criminal

justice system where disappearance rates are relatively high for released

defendants and where limited resources inhibit the reapprehension of

defendants who disappear, punishment is only possible at the time of the

arraignmen; when bond is being set and the defendant is in the custody of

the state. In these circumstances, setting bond according to the severity

                                                                                .
                                                                 64.




of the offense and prior record allows one to "kill two birds with one

stone." A high bond serves the joint purpose of preventing pretrial

crimes by detaining persons with higher probabilities of conilnitting

these crimes and of incarcerating persons most likely to receive jail

sentences on their current offense.

      The use of the phrase "Legality and Reality" in the title of this

paper should by now be apparent. The observed manner in which the bail

setting process operates in New York City conflicts with the overwhelming

view of the legal purpose of bail. To argue further that the bail setting

3.   The sample was developed by the Society not for the purposes of

     this study but for their own use in litigation in New York City.

     The Society filed a brief [Brief for Appellee, Bellamy v. Abruczo

     (N.Y. Sup. Ct., March 1972)1 challenging the constitutionality of

     New York's bail system, and supported their challenge with exten-

     sive statistical analysis based on the sample.



4.   There is one important exception. If a defendant disappeared and

     had not been reapprehended by the end of 1971, he was also placed

     in the closed files. This case is "completedt' in the sense that the

     defendant has disappeared. We should point out that 133 defendants

     disappeared but only 95 disappeared who were released on bail. One

     might wonder how a defendant can disappear if he is not released on

     bail. Legal Aid attorneys have indicated to me that this is not so

     puzzling. Correction records are manually kept, records get mis-

     placed, several defendants my have the same name (real or aliases),

     etc. The net effect is that a jailed defendant may not be located

     at the time of a scheduled court appearance. If he is not found

     shortly, he will be coded as having disappeared. Eventually, one

     hopes he will be found (that is, "reapprehended" by the Correction

     Department). The following quote from the N.Y. Times (October 5,

     1973 on p. 35 under "Metropolitan Briefs") is illustrative: "Justice

     Leff declared a mistrial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, blaming

     the Correction Department for failing to deliver one of three defendants

     in a robbery trial.   .   .   . Justice   Leff said, 'I haven't the vaguest

     idea where Mr. Dollston is. He is somewhere in the custody of the

     Correction Department, and even they don't know where he is.'
                                                                3. F



5.    236,000 cases were filed in the Criminal Court of N.Y.C. in 1971

      (see Annual Report of the Criminal Court of the City of New York,

      1971).   The Legal Aid Society reports 184,851 criminal case assign-

      ments in 1971 (see The Legal Aid Society 96th Annual Report, 1971),

      which represents 78 per cent of the cases filed in N.Y. C. Criminal

      Court. This figure overstates the number of completed cases by the

      Society since in some cases private counsel replaces Legal Aid counsel.

      (Based on a random sample of 423 cases of the Society's closed files,

      private counsel replaced Legal Aid in 12 per cent of the cases.)

      Assuming a 12 per cent replacement rate would reduce the per cent of

      cases handled by Legal Aid to 69 per cent.



6.    The major discrepency between the sample and all New York defendants

     is that the former has a higher rate of guilty pleas and a lower rate

     of dismissals than the latter. This is probably explained by the fact

     that the N.Y. County and City data also include cases disposed of at

     the arraignment which tend to have a high rate of dismissals because

     of early decisions to drop prosecution when complaining witnesses do

     not show up or when the initial evidence appears inadequate. As indi-

     cated, the Legal Aid data exclude cases disposed at the arraignment.

     One should also note the slightly higher rate of disappearances in N.Y.

     County compared to our sample (23 compared to 19 per cent). This is

     expected since disappearances in N.Y. County are estimated by warrants

     issued after a defendant fails to appear. Since some of these defendants

     may subsequently reappear after the warrant is issued, the actual

     number of disappearances will be lower. A defendant is not counted as

     having disappeared in the Legal Aid sample if he reappears (before the

     end of 1971) after a warrant is issued on his initial disappearance.
                                                                 4. F




6. continued

     Finally, note that the counties of New York City are not entirely

     homogeneous. For example, the disappearance rate in New York City

     is 31 per cent compared to 23 per cent for Manhattan. This is due

     to a 46 per cent disappearance rate in Brooklyn (   i.e.,   Kings County).



7.   The classification of offenses is generally based on the classification

     given in the N.Y. Penal Code. To limit the number of classes and

     to limit the number of defendants placed in the "other" category, we

     classified whenever possible a defendant into one of the eight categories.

     For example, the assault class includes defendants accused of menacing

     and reckless endangerment, and the burglary class includes persor

     arrested for possession of burglary tools and criminal trespass. The

     category ot other offenses in Table 3 is a catch-all that includes

     among others: disorderly conduct, loitering, bribery, homicide (one

     defendant) and certain motor vehicle offenses such as unlicensed

     operation of vehicles and leaving the scene of an accident.



8.   This hypothesis is derivable from an optimal bail system--one in

     which the number of defendants released is determined according to the

     criterion of maximizing a net benefit function from re1eae (see Landes,

     "The Bail System: An Economic Approach," p.. cit., particularly pp.

     88-89). An increase in expected harm increases the marginal costs of

     release which in turn leads to a higher equilibrium price for release

     and a reduction in the probability of release. Harm may be broadly

     defined to include predictions about crimes committed by a defendant
                                                                   5. F



8. continued

     during the period of pretrial liberty and the likelihood the

     defendant will disappear and thus frustrate the criminal proceedings

     against him. There is much disagreement over whether it is a viola-

     tion of the Constitution for the first of these factors, predictions

     about future crimes, to enter the bail setting process. However, the

     sub rosa practice of setting high bail as a means of detaining defen-

     dants believed to be dangerous is widely acknowledged.



9.   Any index of severity is bound to be somewhat arbitrary because of

     the selection of weights. For this reason we experimented with another

     index--felony A equaled 8, felony B equaled 7 and so forth. The use

     of the latter as an index of severity instead of the one based on

     statutory penalties (the ASC variable) did not alter the results of

     our empirical analysis. A further difficulty with using ASC as an

     estimate of the offense is that some discretion is given to the authori-

     ties in determining the formal charge. For example, suppose two defen-

     dants commit identical offenses but the evidence against the first is

     stronger than against the second. If expectations about convictions

     are taken into account in fixing the formal charge, the first defendant

     may be charged with a more serious offense than the second.



10. Of course, the greater the injury to the victim, the more probable the

     formal charge will be adjusted upward. However, a given offense in the

     penal code need not specify the exact degree of injury and hence a

     range of injuries is consistent with a given formal charge.
                                                                  6. F




11.    The resist arrest variable has a more obvious direct relation to

       expected harm and hence the size of bond. Assuming a positive cor-

       relation between current and future behavior, a defendant who resists

       arrest today will have greater expected costs of reapprehension if

      released on bail. And an optimal bail model predicts that the higher

       the costs of release, the greater the bond.



12.     It can be argued that the promise of a low bond and hence a greater

        likelihood of release is used as a method of inducing the defendant

        to confess. If this were the case, a negative relationship between

        CON and BOND would be observed in the regression equation. Alterna-

        tively, it can be argued that a positive relationship would be observed

        because a confession indicates that the defendant's guilt has for all

        practical purposes been established and hence there is no reason to

        release him prior to the formal adjudication of his case. It is in

        the latter sense (i.e.,    confession indicates the defendant actually

        committed the offense) that the confession variable belongs in the

        severity of offense category.



13.     If the Z variables are in fact negatively related to the probability

        of disappearing and hence the expected costs of reapprehension, then

        Z and BOND would be inversely related in an optimal bail system
                                                                  7. F



14.    95 defendants had to be deleted from the sample when all variables

      were entered because no information was available on one or more of

       these variables for each of the 95 defendants. The variable that

       resulted in the deletion of the most defenddnts was the employment

       or earnings variable which was missing for 77 observations. (Note

       that if employment was known earnings were generally reported; how-

       ever, when a person was employed but earnings were not reported, we

       assigned the mean value to earnings for that observation.) To test

       if the deletion of 95 observations with missing values systematically

       altered the regression results we reestimated equation 4.1 using the

       smaller set of observations. This is equation 4.2 in Table 4. A com-

       parison between 4.1 and 4.2 reveals no significant differences. We

       should also point out that 254 out of 860 defendants had a zero bond

       (that is, these defendants were released on their own recognizance).

      When a sizable fraction of the sample has a zero valued dependent vari-

       able, the regression coefficients may be biased toward zero. However,

      a comparison of regressions where the zero bond defendants were deleted

       (these regressions are not included in the tables of the text) with

       regressions that included this group showed no important differences.



15.   The differences in the regression coefficients on the felony and misdemeanor

      variables are statistically significant in the equations in Table 4.

      The t-statistics on these differences are in the range of 5.0.
                                                                         8. F



16.    Data were also available on the number of felony arrests within 12

      months of the current arrest, and the number that occurred more than

      12 months before the current arrest. (FEL variable is the sum of the

      two numbers.) Similarly, misdemeanors and violations can be broken

      down in this manner. One can then test the hypothesis that greater

      importance is attached to more immediate arrests. This was done by

      defining 4 criminal record variables (FEL1=felony arrests within the

      last 12 months, EEL2 =      felony   arrests more than 12 months ago, M-V1 =

      misdemeanors   plus violations within the last 12 months, M-V2 =          mis-
      demeanors plus violations more than 12 months ago), and then reesti-

      mating equation 4.4 using these four variables instead of FEL, MIS, and

      VIOL. The regression coefficients and t-values (in parentheses) were

      as follows:


      FEL1
                     3.37 (2.8)                              .41 (.82)
                                                 M—V1

                      .84 (3.6)                  M—V2        .26 (1.8)
      FEL2
      (We do not present the regression coefficients and t-values of the

      remaining variables in equation 4.4 since they were unaffected by this

      substitution.) These results suggest that not only are prior arrests,

      particularly felony arrests, important determinants of bond but that

      greater weight is given to more recent arrests in forecasting harm from

      pretrial liberty. The difference between the regression coefficients

      on FEL1 and EEL2 is substantial (that is, a recent felony arrest adds

      $337 to the defendant's bond while a past felony arrest adds $84) and

      statistically significant. The difference between M-V1 and M-V2 though

      positive is not statistically significant.
                                                                   9. F



 17.     One can get a rough notion of the source of the outstanding detainer        .
        by examining the proportion of defendants with detainers who are on

        parole and who have pending cases, and compare these proportions with

        the respective categories for all other defendants. The results below

        indicate that defendants with detainers are heavily represented in the

        parole and pending groups. For example, 23 per cent of defendants with

       detainers also have a pending charge whereas only 4 per cent of defendants

       without detainers have a pending charge, and 14 per cent with detainers

       are on parole while only 4 per cent without detainers are on parole.


                        Pending   No Pending    Parole       No Parole
       Detainers          23%       77%            14%         86%




                                                                                     .
       No   Detainers      4%       96%             4%         96%


18.    In our sample, the current charge is never bail jumping for defendants

       with a pending charge.



19.    A difficulty with statistically testing the effect of a pending charge

       on bond is the result of a se1tctivity bias in our sample. Certain

       characteristics of defendants on which data are not available (for example,

       the defendant's physical appearance, attitude, race, etc.) may result

       in the setting of a lower bond, raising the likelihood of the defendant's

       release. The fact that a defendant was released on bail on the earlier

       pending charge indicates that he probably possessed some of these favor-

       able characteristics. If he still possesses them, this would operate

       to reduce the bond on the current charge (adjusting for the increase

       in his prior record). Hence, the pending variable could have an off-

       setting negative impact on bond.
                                                                 10. F




20.   Although we find statistically significant effects on bond of the

      severity of offense and prior record variables, one might take the

      view that our analysis is deficient because we have only explained

      about 25 per cent of the variance (see the R2's, in Table 4) in bond.

      However, it is not obvious that an R2 of 25 per cent is not "high"

      given the nature of the dependent variable. Although bond in principle

      is a continuous variable, it tends in practice to be fixed at intervals

      of $500. In our sample (see Table 5) we observe that 253 defendants

      had bond set at $0, 20 had bond between $20 and *300, 257 had bond of

      $500, 131 had bond of $1,000,   56 had bond of $1,500, and so forth.

      With this distribution, in which the authorities do not make continuous

      and fine adjustments in the size of bond, we will tend to find sizeable

      residuals of predicted around actual values. This is reinforced by

      the use of a large numLer of independent variables in our regression

      equations which make it more likely that we will predict a continuous

      distribution of bond values.



21    When both the earnings and employment variables are entered in the

      same equation, neither is significant though both have a negative

      sign. The correlation coefficient between earnings and employed is .47.



22.   The F-ratio is 1.33 (with 8 and 739 degrees of freedom) which does not

      approach a conventional definition of significance. This nonsignificance

      is due in part to the fact that the everity of the charge variable

      (ASC) already incorporates information on the offense category. For

      example, robbery is eitherclass B, C or D felony with 52 per cent of
                                                                                           11. F



 22 continued

       robbery defendants accused of a class B felony. Larceny defendants

       are about equally divided between a misdemeanor A and a felony E.

       Hence, a defendant accused of robbery will have a greater value for

       the ASC variable than a defendant accused of larceny. The association

       between the offense classes and the ASC variable can be tested by

       estimating an auxiliary regression of ASC on the eight dummy variables.

      This is presented below where D1 =                  assault,     D2 =   burglary,    D3 =     larceny,
       D4 =   robbery,    D5 =   stolen   property, D6 = dangerous weapon, D7 =                     forgery,
      D8 =    other,   and the left out variable (              i.e.,         the constant in the

      regression) is drugs.

      ASC =    3.56 +            +           -            +            -            +           +           +
                         .85D1       .30D2       l.56D3       8.67D4       2.30D5       .45D6       .32D7       .l6D8
                         (1.89) (.67)            (3.85)       (20.81) (5.37)            (.77)       (.55)       (.28)

                                                                                        R2 =    .43.
      The above regression indicates that 43 per cent of the variation in ASC

      is explained by the offense category of the defendant. A comparison

      of the regression equations 4.4 and 4.5 show that the main effect of

      introducing the eight offense variables is (as expected) to reduce the

      t-value of the ASC variable by about 30 per cent.



23    For a more complete analysis of the defendant's gain from pretrial

      liberty and the amount he is willing to pay for pretrial liberty see

      W. Landes, "The Bail System: An Economic Approach", p. cit.



24.   Defendants are generally released on bail within a few days of their

      arrest. In our sample, 321 defendants were released within two days

      of their arrest and the remaining 12 were released within seven days

      of the arrest.

25.    See M. Nerlove and S. J. Press, "Notes on the Log-Linear or Logistic

       Model for the Analysis of Qualitative Socio-Economic Data," mimeographed

       August 23, 1972, for a systematic presentation of the logit model and

       an analysis of the problems associated with ordinary least squares

       estimation of a dumy dependent variable. Basically, the m4ximim

       likelihood method of estimating the logit model is as follows. Arrange

       the defendants so that the first n' defendants are released and the

       last n-n' defendants are detained, and then write the logarithmic like-

       lihood function as

                       n'             n
                       Elog(P) +Elog (1
                      i=1         i   i=n'+l        I


       where r is specified as in (3). The log likelihood function is then
               1
       maximized with respect to      and l This yields a system of non-linear

       equations from which estimates of       and the vector l can be obtained

       by iterative procedures.



26.    Defendants with a $0 bond have a probability of release equal to 1,

       and are,therefore, excluded from the estimation of the probability

       function.



 27.   Note that the dollar value of the cash alternative enters as the inter-

       action term CA1.CA2.



28.    That is, log(PI(l_P))/ BOND or Pr/aBOND given that CA1 =        1   should

       not be significantly different than zero. The specification in (6)

       defmes alog(P/(l_P))/3BOND as equal to 1+f33CA1, and 3Pr/BOND

       as equal to (i+3CAl)(Pr(l_Pr))

29.   The socio-economjc variables (EMP, EARN, INC, and PREM in Table 3)

      do not fully measure opportunity cost and wealth because among other

      things, they exclude earnings and wealth from illegal sources. The

      defendant's age (AGE) and residence (NYC) are also included as

      explanatory variables because both may indirectly reflect the defen-

      dant's access to assets for financing release and the willingness of

      bondsmen to post bond. For example, if it is less costly for bondsmen

      to supervise defendants living in New York City than those outside the

      City, posting bond for the former compared to the latter should lower

      the bondsman's risk of forfeiture of the bail bond. The predicted

      effect of age on making bail is uncertain. Although younger persons

      generally have fewer assets, they may have greater access to assets

      of parents.

                                                                               .
30    The x2 statistic (with 5 d.f.) on the joint effect of the socio-

      economic variables is 2.72. Note that earnings was also insignificant

      when it was entered !n the logit equation in place of the employment

      van able.



31.   This explanation is still consistent with using earnings or employment

      in setting bond (as was observed in Table 4) because judges may view

      only legal sources o1 income as indicators of one's attachment to the

      community.




                                                                               .
                                                                  14. F

32.   If this data were available, we could directly test whether the

      charact2ristics of persons with respect to prior criminal record

      (i.e.,    prior to current charge), severity of current offense, etc.

      differed between defendants who were and were not subsequently con-

      victed of crimes comitted during the period of pretrial liberty.

      Even this data would be flawed because some offenders would not be

      caught and some convicted offenders may not have committed the alleged

      offense. Another possible and more subtle difficulty with such data,

       if it were available, is the following. Assume that prior criminal

      record and certain unmeasured (in our empirical analysis) character-

       istics of defendants are .ignificant predictors ot the likelihood

       of committing crimes during the period of pretrial release. Let

       judges be aware of these facts and let them set bond according to the

       defendant's record and these unmeasured characteristics. Defendants

       with both an extensive criminal record and adverse characteristics

      will have a high bond set and hence few or none of them will be released.

       Defendants with a similar criminal record but favorable characteristics

       will have a low or zero bond set and will be released. Hence, a sample

       of r&eased defendants will contain some defendants with a long

       criminal record and some with no or an insignificant criminal record.

       However, the former group will contain primarily those with favorable

       unmeasured characteristics (since those with unfavorable characteristics

       will tend to be detained) while the latter group will have both defen-

       dants with favorable and unfavorable unmeasured characteristics. Con-

       sequently, we may observe no significant difference in the propensity

       to comit crimes during pretrial liberty between the two groups because

       we are not holding constant an important variable (i.e.,     the unmea-

       sured characteristics). Note that if we still found a significant effect
                                                                  15. F



32 continued

      of prior record on crimes committed during the period of pretrial

      release, then we would have found an even stronger effect if the

      unmeasured characteristics were held constant.



33.   None of these defendants were rearrested solely on the basis of a

      bail violation (for example, 'jumping bail") on their pending charge.

      A bail violation may have been one of the charges against the defendant

      but it was not the most severe charge. The latter charge for all

      defendants in the sample involved a new criminal offense.



34.   Comparisons between the Pending and Non-Pending groups will tend to

      understate the power of variables to forecast crimes during the period

      of pretrial liberty for two reasons. (1) We are assuming (incorrectly)

      that the Non-Pending group is equivalent to the group of released

      defendants who do not commit crimes during their period of pretrial

      liberty. Undoubtedly, the Non-Pending group includes some defendants

      who will in fact commit crimes during the period of pretrial release.

      This means that if defendants in the Pending group have on average

      significantly longer criminal records than those in the Non-Pending

      group, then we also expect the likelihood of committing crimes during

      the period of pretrial liberty among defendants within the Non-Pending

      group to bc greater the longer their criminal record. Hence, the

      observed difference in the average criminal record between the Pending

      and Non-Pending group should be smaller than the difference between the

      Pending ind a subset of the Non-Pending group, namely, those who do not

      commit crimes while released on bail. (2) Defendants released on bail
                                                                  16. F

34 continued

     with long criminal records will tend to have other unmeasured charact-

      eristics that are favorable to low bond (otherwise it is unlikely

      they would be released) and these characteristics may be correlated

     with a low probability of committing crimes during pretrial liberty.

      (See footnote 32 for a more complete explanation of this point.)

          One can roughly estimate the per cent of defendants in the Non-

      Pending group who will in fact be subsequently rearrested and charged

     wiLh committing a crime during the period of pretrial liberty. This

      can be illustrated by the following hypothetical figures. Suppose in

      period 1, 1000 persons are arrested and 400 are released on bail, and

      further assume that it takes one period to dispose of a case through

      the legal system. In period 2, 1000 persons are also arrested of whom

      100 have pending charges against them, and again 400 are released on

     bail (though no one with a pending charge is released). Let these

      same figures persist in the future--1000 arrested, 400 released and

      100 with pending charges. Since all cases are disposed of within one

     period, there are at most 400 persons at any moment in time who could

     commit an offense n bail. The number arrested and accused of committing

     an offense while released is 100, or 25 per cent of those reieased

      (which is equal to the ratio of pending to released in any one period).

     The use of the latter ratio as an estimate of the proportion of those

     released who commit a crime during the period of release would be less

     accurate if there were changes over time in some of the variables assumed

     constant. In our sample there are 328 defendants without a pending

     charge who are released on bail (   i.e.,   the Non-Pending group) and

     59 defendants with a pending charge. Thus, 18 per cent is a crude estimate

     of the proportion released who will be charged with comitting a crime

     during the period of pretrial
                                     liberty.
                                                                 17. F




35.   There were no data for the pending offense on the following variables:

      bond, confession prior to setting bond; possession of a dangerous

      weapon; injury to complaining witness; whether the defendant forcibly

      resisted arrest; and whether there existed an outstanding detainer.

      Note that it would be highly misleading to use the detainer variable

      at the time of the current charge because it may have been issued

      precisely because the defendant had a pending charge and committed

      a bail violation (e.g.,        jumping bail) during the period of

      pretrial liberty.



36.   The parole and probation variable should be treated with caution since

      it is possible that some defendants with a pending charge may have been

      recorded on parole or probation (at the time of the current charge)

      precisely because they had a pending charge.



37.   As noted earlier, the earnings and employment variables, which were

      recorded at the time of the current arrest, may have changed for the

      Pending group between the time of their pending and current charges.

      Moreover, the change need not be random since employment and earnings

      may be adversely affected by the presence of a pending charge. Thus,

      the statistically significant difference between the Pending and Non-

      Pending groups for earnings and the marginal significance for employ-

      ment may be spurious in the sense that they do not accurately reflect

      differences in these variables between the Pending group at the time

      the pending charge occurred and the Non-Pending group.


                                                                                .
                                                                  18. F




38.   Equation 9.1 differs from 9.2 and 9.3 because 30 observations had to

      be eliminated from the latter two equations to add the parole and

      the socio-economic variables. For an identical reason, equations

      9.5 and 9.6 contain 27 fewer observations than 9.4.



39.   The coefficient on past felonies is significant at the .05 level

      in equation 9.1 but its significance diminishes to .10 (in a one-tail

      test) in the remaining Logit equations. Moreover, the magnitude of the

      coefficients on past felonies are less than on past misdemeanors which

      suggests (surprisingly) that the latter has a bigger impact than the

      former on the probability of committing a crime during the period of

      pretrial liberty. One should not conclude, however, that greater weight

      should be attached to past misdemeanors than past felonies in setting

      bond since we have not yet examined the relationship between these

      criminal record variables and the severity of the offense committed

      during the period of pretrial liberty and the probability of disappearance.



40.   This result should be interpreted with caution as indicated earlier

      in footnote 36.



41.   The equations with earnings substituted for employment are not repro-

      duced in Table 9. The coefficients and t-ratios (in parentheses) on

      earnings using the specification of equation 9.3 was -.003 (.81) and

      using the specification of equation 9.6 was -.006 (1.44). The remaining

      coefficients in these equations were virtually unchanged.
                                                                   19. F



42.   This argument would also be applicable to our finding that past

      misdemeanors have an insignificant effect on the severity of the

      current charge.



43.   The regression results on earnings (EARN) are not presented in

      Table 10. When EARN was substituted for EMP in 10.1 and 10.3, it

      was      insignificant.



44.   The F-statistic is .90 with 9 and 706 degrees of freedom.



45.   This was not possible in the analysis of crimes during the period

      of pretrial liberty because data were unavailable on which defendants

      released on bail on their current offense comitted crimes.



46.   If judges anticipate higher probabilities of disappearance and set

      bond accordingly, the empirical analysis is further complicated because

      the deterrent effect of bond may not be observable in a single equation

      model. That is, a higher propensity to disappear for a released defen-

      dant will be associated with a higher bond which in turn will offset

      the higher propensity. Therefore, one might observe identical prob-

      abilities of disappearance across defendants with different size bonds.

      We attempt to deal with this problem by holding constant variables

      likely to be associated with higher propensities to disappear

      (e.g.,     severity of offense and criminal record variables) when

      estimating the effect of bond and other financial variables on the

      probability of disappearance.
                                                                 20. F



47.   There is an additional complication in estimating the partial effect

      of criminal record, etc. on disappearance that has already been dis-

      cussed in connection with the commission of crimes during pretrial

      liberty (see footnote 32). For example, a defendant with a longer

      criminal record, holding constant bond and the remaining measured

      variables, would tend to have other (nonmeasured) characteristics that

      lead to the setting of a lower bond compared to a defendant with a

      shorter record. Assuming that the characteristics that reduce bond

      are favorable to appearing for court hearings, etc., then we may

      observe no significant positive effect of criminal record on disappearance

      (because of our failure to hold nonmeasurable characteristics constant)

      even though the true effect is positive. This means our empirical

      analysis will be biased against finding a significant positive effect

      of the criminal record variables, etc.on disappearance even though bond is

      held constant. Put differently, if the bail system is operating effici-

      ently in the sense that judges are utilizing available information on

      the likelihood of disappearance to set bond, then defendants with long

      prior records who are released will primarily be those with other

      characteristics (that we cannot measure) that reduce the likelihood of

      disappearance. On the other hand, if judges are making "mistakes",

      then we should be able to pick out a positive effect of criminal record

      in the empirical analysis once bond is held constant because a longer

      criminal record will not be associated with favorable characteristics

      but rather with a "mistake" in setting bond. Indirect support for the

      latter interpretation comes from our findings on pretrial crimes. If
                                                                       21. F



47 continued

       released persons with extensive prior records, etc. had some unmeasured

        favorable characteristics that reduce the probability of disappearing,

       we might also expect these characteristics to be associated with the

        absence of pretrial crimes. The latter hypothesis, however is not

        consistent with our empirical findings. In order to still advance

        the favorable characteristics hypothesis, one would then have to

        argue that these characteristics provide asymetrical information (i.e.,

                 they are associated with less disappearances but not with less

        pretrial crimes). Without further evidence on the content of these

        unmeasured characteristics, this would be a highly tenuous argument.



 48.    The net effect of the cash alternative option on d in equation (7)

        is Pd/DCAl =
                           2 + (BOND)    +
                                             4(CA2)]
                                                         -
                                                             d•   We expect Pd/3CAl

        >   0 except in the special case where the cash alternative is so large

        relative to the defendant's bond that it exerts the same deterrent

        effect on disappearing as bond. As indicated in the text, we expect

             >    0 and    <   0.



 49.    A couparison of disappearance rates in relation to bond shows dis-

        appearance rates of 12.5 per cent (10/80) for defendants with a

        positive bond or cash alternative and 33.5 per cent (85/253) for

        defendants with a zero bond. Thus the ROR group (that is, released

        on their own recognizance) had nearly 3 times the rate of disappearances

        as the non-ROR group. Note that this comparison is for all 333

        released defendants while the equations in Table 11 exclude 26 of

        these persons because of missing information on one or more independent

        variables.
                                                                  22. F



50.   That is, one accepts the null hypothesis that    +    =0   in

      equation (7).



51.   Part of the reason for an insignificant effect of a cash alternative

      option is that the computation of the standard error of Pd/CAl (or

      3log(Pd(l_Pd)/CAl) involves the standard error of     in equation (7)

      weighted by bond-squared. Although the bond values used in Table 12

      are moderate, they are still far greater than the mean bond in the

      sample of released defendants (about $140) because about 75 per cent

      of the latter are released on their own recognizance (that is, a $0

      bond). Hence, the reliability of estimates of Pd/3CAl tend to be weak

      for values of bond that greatly exceed the mean value in the sample.

      Alternatively, if we were to use a lower value for bond in our com-

      putation, then the operational distinction between a bond and cash

      alternative would be destroyed, and in this instance aPd/3CA1 would

      also be insignificant.



52.   At the .05 level of significance (in a two-tail test) only the "other"

      offense class was significant in equations 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3. In

      both equations 11.1 and 11.2 the    statistic on the joint effect of

      the dumy offense variables was significant at the .01 level.    In

      equation 11.3 the F-ratio on the offense variables was significant

      at the .05 but not the .01 level.
                                                                  23. F



53.   The following variables were not included in the probability of

      pretrial crimes or severity equations because of the absence of

      data: confession, possession of a dangerous weapon, resist arrest,

      injury to a complaining witness, outstanding detainer and the amount

      of bond on the pending charge. Note that the injury variable was

      significant in the bond regressions. Further, the parole, residence,

      employment, earnings, other income and age variables are subject to

      inaccuracies because they were recorded at the time of the current

      and not the pending arrest.. Finally, the pending charge variable,

      which was an important determinant of bond, cannot be included in the

      probability or severity equations because a crime comitted during

      pretrial liberty is measured by the presence of a pending charge.



54.   Two exceptions should be noted. First, as indicated, employment and
                                                                                .
      earnings are significant variables in the bond regression but were

      not related to either crimes during pretrial liberty or disappearing.

      Thus, the purpose of setting a lower bond in response to legal employ-

      ment and earnings remains unclear. Secondly, age was inversely related

      to all measures of harm (though in most cases the relationship was

      marginally significant) but was not used in setting bond.



55.   Although we have shown that increasing the size of bond and withholding

      the option of a cash alternative has some deterrent effect on the

      probability of disappearing for a defendant released on bail, the

      important point is that judges are setting bond based on variables that

      forecast crimes and not disappearance. Put differently, reducing the
                                                                 24. F.

55 continued

      rate of disappearance by setting more difficult terms for pretrial

      release may still be a goal of the bail system but according to our
                                                 well
      empirical results this goal would be equally/served by setting bond

      randomly among defendants. One rationale of setting bond on the

      basis of the severity and extent of one's prior record is to prevent

      defendants with greater probabilities of committing crimes from

      obtaining pretrial liberty. Note that one can never totally reject

      the hypothesis that judges are attempting to forecast the probability

      of disappearance in setting bond since it is conceivable that they

      are attempting to do so but are unsuccessful in their efforts.



56.   It must be noted that our empirical findings are not intended as either

      an indictment or defense of the existing bail system. We have quanti-

      fied certain statistical relationships between bail setting and pre-

      trial harm, but have not attempted to measure the social costs of

      operating the bail system in comparison to the gains from preventing

      pretrial crimes. For example, although the factors used in setting

      bond also predict pretrial crime, they may be subject to considerable

      error. Thus, detained defendants may have higher probabilities of

      committing crimes during pretrial liberty than those not released,

      and yet a majority of those detained may not commit any crime had they

      been released. Moreover, if the aim of public policy were exclusively

      the prevention of pretrial crime, the ideal solution would be to jail

      every defendant.
                                                                     25. F



 57.    The Legal Aid Society of New York brought a suit in 1972 (see

        Bellamy v. Abruczo, N.Y. Sup. Ct., March 1972) challenging the

        New York bail system. However, their major argument was that the

        use of money bail, which made it unlikely that low income defendants

        woud obtain pretrial liberty, was in violation of constitutional

        guarantees of equal protection of the laws and due process of law.



 58.    One may also argue that the systematic features of the setting of

        bond in New York City are not representative of the operation of all

        bail systems. Instead, these features are most app1icble to a

        criminal justice system where large numbers of defendants disappear

        and hence where the imposition of criminal sanctions almost requires

        pretrial detention.



59.     Of the remaining 851 defendants, 133 disappeared, 218 were dismissed,

       and 500 entered guilty pleas.



60.    See W. Landes, "An Economic Analysis of
                                                 the Courts," p. cit., pp. 71-73,
       91-95 for an elaboration of the
                                         argument that pretrial detention reduces
       the productivity of the defendant's inputs together with some quantita-

       tive estimates of these effects
                                         using data across counties in the U.S.
       in 1962. It is also claimed that
                                           released defendants receive more
                                                or
       favorable sentences if they are
                                         employed/regularly participate in a

       counselling program. Since these options are conditional on liberty,

       this would further widen the observed difference in sentences between

61.    Obviously the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. That

       is, persons with higher expected sentences may be more likely to

       be detained and detention may increase the expected sentence.



62.    Estimation of equation (9) was by the maximum-likelihood logit

      method (see Table 7) where the dependent variable was the odds of

       pretrial liberty and not BAIL. Observations with a $0 BOND were

       excluded from this estimation (weakening the negative effect of BOND

       on pretrial liberty) and several cash alternative variables were

       added to the estimated equations. Since the purpose here is not

      to reestimate (9) but to illustrate the recursive nature of our system,

       the linear specification without the cash alternative is sufficient.



63.    Several problems arise in the estimation of the sentence equations.

       (1) No data are available on convictions resulting in fines. Hence

       some defendants would be included in the zero sentence class if they

       received only a fine. If the sentence included the option of a jail

       sentence or a fine, then the defendant's jail sentence would be the

       sentence variable in our sample.(2) There is some uncertainty as to
                                   a
       the proper classification of/defendant who disappeared and hence

       where there is no formal disposition. Since disappearances are

       concentrated in the released group, their inclusion (by assigning a

       zero sentence to persons who disappear) in the regression would tend

       to bias upward the effect of pretrial detention on the sentence.

       Alternatively, disappearing is one way to avoid penalties (providing

       one is not reapprehended) and thus does reflect a real difference in
                                                                 27. F

63 continued

      outcome between released and detained persons. The estimates in

      Table 14 exclude defendants who disappear. In a later footnote

      we indicate the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of

      the disappearance group. (3) There are 388 defendants in our sample

      who received jail sentences. Thus only 54 per cent of our observa-

      tions have a non-zero dependent variable (when defendants who dis-

      appeared are excluded from the analysis). Under these circumstances

      it is questionable whether ordinary least squares is the most

      appropriate estimation technique.



64.   An alternative hypothesis that might appear consistent with the

       findings in Table 14 is that a high bond drains the defendant's

       resources and hence raises his conviction probability and sentence.

       This would imply, however, that variations in bond for detained

      defendants alone would have no impact on the outcome, other things

       constant. This can be tested by reestimating equation 14.1 for the

       subset of detained defendants. The regression coefficient on BOND

       continues to be positive and highly significant (= .017 with a t-value

       of 7.80) and of the same order of magnitude as the coefficient on

       BOND in 14.1.



65.    13 per cent of released defendants received a jail sentence in

       comparison to 66 per cent of detained defendants. Since a large

       number of released defendants voluntarily appear for their court

       hearings, the probability of receiving a jail sentence •is probably

       substantially smaller than .13 for defendants who disappear.
                                                                28. F



66.   Both this result and the result on the bond variable do not depend

      on the exclusion of defendants who disappear from the regression

      analysis. When these defendants are included, the reestimation

      of 14.1 which 858 defendants yields coefficients and (t-values) on

      BOND and BAIL respectively of .018 (11.135) and .031 (.580), and

      the reestimation of 14.4 with 764 defendants yields .019 (10.656)

      and .045 (.738) for BOND and BAIL respectively.



67.   DAYS-i and DAYS-2 are not available for persons who disappeared or

      whose cases were dismissed. Thus, regressions using the days vari-

      ables contain at most 504 defendants or the subset of defendants that

      entered quilty pleas and went to trial. The deletion of dismissals

      means that 221 defendants who had a zero value for the sentence

      are dropped from the empirical analysis. Since dismissals are rela-

      tively concentrated in the released group (55 per cent of dismissals

      were released on bail compared to 23 per cent in the non-dismissed

      group) and in the lower bond values ($775 average bond compared to

      $1284 for those not dismissed), one might expect the results on BOND

      and BAIL in 14.5-14.7 to be weaker. This may be offset by the large

      number of zero values for the dependent variable when dismissals are

      included which biases the regression coefficients towards zero. A

      comparison between 14.1 and 14.5,where 14.5 excludes dismissals,

      reveals that the elimination of dismissals does not alter our results

      on BOND and BAIL nor does it alter substantially the coefficients

      of the other independent variables. The similarity between 14.1 and

      14.5 further suggests that inferences on the effects of the days

      variables in 14.6 and 14.7 are likely to hold up had data allowed all

      defendants to be included in the regression estimates.
                                                                  29. F



68.   One reason for the observed effect of DAYS-i may be that the

      sentence variable does not reflect the fact that a defendant

      receives credit towards his sentence for the amount of pretrial

      detention. Consider the following situation: a defendant detained

      for 60 days receives a sentence of 60 days and is released immedi-

      ately after his guilty plea is formally entered, and another

      defendant detained for 30 days receives a 30 day sentence and is

      also released. Although in both cases the actual sentence is zero

      and hence there is no effect of pretrial detention, our empirical

      analysis would show a positive effect of detention on the sentence.

      To test for this we reestimated equations 14.6 and 14.7, substracting

      from the sentence the amount of pretrial detention. Thus, if the

      latter exceeded or equalled the sentence measure in Table 14, we

      set the actual sentence equal to zero. The regression coefficients

      and (t-values) on BOND, DAYS-i and DAYS-2 after this adjustment

      are given below.

          equation       BOND          DAYS-i            DAYS-2

          14.6            .021          .002               .001
                         (9.361)       (2.893)            (1.100)

          14.7            .021          .004               .001
                         (8.408)       (3.566)            (1.483)

      Although the effect of DAYS-i is reduced (as expected) it is still

      positive and statistically significant. BOND remains highly signi-

      ficant and the dominating variable. Note that it is not obvious

      that the above adjustment is desirable. If the sentence (prior to

      our adjustment) has already been reduced for days detained, then

      our additional adjustment is clearly incorrect.

69.   See footnote 22 for the empirical relation between ASC and the

      offense variables.



70.   Differentiating equation (10) with respect to ASC yields

           (SENT)   —      aBOND
           \SC      — 2 ASC        +


      where A3 is the regression coefficient on ASC. Since B0ND/ASC
                1

      is approximately 1.4 (from Table 4) and A2 in Table 14 is nearly

      .02, the intirect effect of one year of ASC is about .028 or about

      10 days. Hence the total effect of one year of a statutory penalty

      is between 18 and 32 days of sentence. Indirect effects of other

      variables in equations (8) and (10) are calculated in an identical

      manner.



71.   INJ was the only variable in the severity of offense group (aside

      from ASC) that was significant in the bond regressions in Table 4.

      Note that the total estimated effect of a non-serious injury to

      a complaining witness is half the effect of a serious one.
