On the Relationship Between Mobility, Population Growth, and Capital Spending in the United
States

NBER Working Paper No. 16970

                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between public capital spending and population dynamics
at the state level. Empirically, we document two robust facts. First, states with faster population growth
do not spend more (per capita) to accommodate the needs of their growing population. Second, states
whose population is more likely to leave do tend to spend more per capita than states with low gross
emigration rates. To interpret these facts, we introduce an explicit, quantitative political-economy
model of government spending determination, where mobility and population growth generate departures
from Ricardian equivalence by shifting some of the costs and benefits of public projects to future residents.
The magnitude of the empirical response of capital spending to mobility is at the upper end of what
can be explained by the theory with a plausible calibration. In the model, more mobile voters favor
more spending because the maturity of states' debt is very long term and costs are shifted into the future
more than benefits.

1         Introduction
The sharp recession recently experienced by the United States has highlighted once more the
plight of states whose finances are bound by constitutional restrictions on their indebtedness. The
gap between many states’ revenue projections and their anticipated expenses calls into serious
question their ability to balance their books without substantial help from the federal government,
which is not bound by similar rules. Throughout the recession, the federal government has been
able to borrow large resources from the capital markets.
        While almost all states are in principle prevented from borrowing to cover their ordinary
budget, most of them are permitted to issue bonds to pay for capital improvements. This rule,
commonly known as “the golden rule,” has long been rationalized with the fact that capital
improvements benefit generations to come, who should be called to share the burden.1 Current
expenditures presumably benefit only the current generation who should therefore bear all the
costs. Of course, such a rationale only holds in an economy that is far from Ricardian equivalence,
for otherwise government debt would have no effects on allocations and welfare (Barro [4]).
        In this paper, we look at the evidence that variation across states in capital spending is
driven by departures from Ricardian equivalence stemming from mobility and population growth
through the lens of a model that explicitly incorporates an interaction between dynamic economic
and political decisions.
        To this end, we build a dynamic political-economy model, where voters choose the provision
of public goods anticipating that their future costs (and benefits) will be shared with incomers
and will not be borne (and enjoyed) by a household once it emigrates. Our model builds on
Bassetto with Sargent [7], generalizing results to an environment with many states and time-
varying demographics, so that the parameters of the model can be directly matched to the
regression coefficients from our state-level empirical analysis. More generally, our research fits
into a broader research agenda that studies the interaction of dynamic economic and political
decisions to understand fiscal policy and government debt; a few examples of this pursuit are
Klein, Krusell and Rı́os-Rull [17], Azzimonti [1], Battaglini and Coate [8, 9, 10], Azzimonti,

        See e.g. Studensky [25].

Battaglini and Coate [2], Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti [24], and Bachmann and Bai [3].
       Our starting point is a simple environment where the population is spread across differ-
ent states, and voters choose public spending year by year, taking into account the exogenous
prospects for mobility that they face and an exogenous path for population growth in the state
they reside in.2 Voters discount future costs and benefits of their policy choices more heavily
than efficiency would dictate: this occurs because they neglect costs and benefits that will accrue
to future residents of the state that are not yet present. This effect will be larger, the faster
a state’s population is growing or the more turnover among residents. In the absence of any
restriction on government indebtedness we would thus expect states to run large deficits. How-
ever, as mentioned above, the manifestation of the golden rule in the U.S. states prevents voters
from financing non-capital expenses with debt. If strictly enforced, the golden rule fully restores
incentives to provide the correct amount of nondurable public goods: this is because both costs
and benefits accrue immediately, and no long-term consequences emerge. However, in the case
of public capital, both benefits (of current investment) and costs (of current debt issuance) spill
over into the future. These costs and benefits could align if debt issuance were structured so
that the debt was paid off at the same time as the benefits accrued, but in practice the two need
not be aligned correctly. In particular, whether costs or benefits will be shifted further into the
future depends on many parameters, but especially on the duration of capital and the limits on
the maturity of debt and the fraction of debt financing. The shorter the duration of capital, the
longer the maturity of debt, and the larger the fraction of debt financing, the more costs are
shifted to the future relative to benefits, to the point that voters might actually be induced to
overspend.
       The degree by which cost/benefit mismatches lead to inefficient spending depends on how
far away the demographic structure is from Ricardian equivalence. At one extreme, in a world
of no mobility and no population growth, the set of voters would be fixed and the distribution
   2
       By assuming that the evolution of population is exogenous, we abstract from the capitalization effects that
play a very important role in the literature on urban economics. A recent survey of this research is in Ross
and Yinger [21]. By looking at state-level data rather than local data, we expect capitalization to be much less
prevalent.



                                                         2
of costs and benefits over time should be irrelevant. In the presence of mobility and population
growth, the model delivers quantitative predictions on how these population attributes affect
capital spending. It is these predictions that we take to the data.
   In our empirical exercise we use state-level panel data to document two main facts:

  1. For a given population growth rate, capital spending is positively related to mobility, i.e.,
      it declines with the fraction of the population that remains in the state in any given year.
      This implies that the capital stock increases with gross migration.

  2. Capital spending by the states reacts to population growth less than would be needed to
      preserve a constant capital stock per capita. This implies that the capital stock per capita
      declines with population growth.

   While mobility has sometimes appeared in previous empirical studies of state-level spending
(see Poterba [19]), to our knowledge we provide the first systematic evidence that gross interstate
mobility is an important predictor of state-level spending, both using within- and across-state
variation. The predictive power of gross state mobility persists even after we control for other
measures of mobility, such as net interstate mobility or mobility within the state. This is en-
couraging for our model, where gross state mobility, as distinct from those alternative measures,
plays a central role.
   Our main objective is to interpret the magnitudes of the coefficients that we find relative
to our model’s sharp quantitative predictions about the degree of departure from Ricardian
equivalence. A positive relationship between mobility and capital spending is interpreted by
the model as evidence of too much borrowing: when future costs exceed the benefits, a more
mobile population is more prone to overspending. The magnitude of the empirically measured
link between mobility and spending is economically important, and it is in fact at the upper end
of what the theoretical model can deliver.
   In matching the second fact to the theory, accounting properly for implementation delays
is important. In a world in which public projects are completed within a period (a year) of
their approval, it would take implausibly large departures from Ricardian equivalence for public
investment to fall as much behind population growth as it does in our data. But in reality,

                                                3
gathering bids, signing contracts, and completing construction take more than a year. In the
presence of implementation delays, the model predicts a weaker link between capital spending and
population growth: in the short run, spending is predetermined and investment per capita may
respond negatively to population growth; in the longer run, a growth shock today will not fully
persist into the future, and implementation delays will then dampen the optimal response by the
voters. We are able to derive testable implications that are independent of the precise structure
of implementation lags: these are based on measuring the response of spending to distributed
lags of population growth (and mobility). These measures suggest that the relationships in the
data are not far from what the model would predict if states are adhering to the golden rule.
    Our final experiment estimates the fraction of debt financing that would be needed in the
model to match the response of public investment to mobility and population growth in the
data. Although our overidentifying restrictions are often statistically rejected, the estimate for
public investment is close to 100%, the value that should arise if states abide by the golden rule.
Similar inference for current expenses suggests a small, but positive fraction of debt financing;
this is what we would expect if there is a little margin to bend the golden rule.
    In the remainder of the paper, section 2 presents the model through which we interpret the
data; it derives the equilibrium relationship between government spending, population growth,
and mobility, provides intuition on its nature, and discusses ways in which this relationship can be
informative about the parameters of the model. Section 3 describes the data and provides a brief
institutional overview. Our main results are presented in section 4, while section 5 speculates on
directions for future research.



2     Model

2.1    Primitives

The model we adopt is based on Bassetto with Sargent [7]. However, we explicitly introduce
here the sources of variation across states (jurisdictions) and over time that will form the basis
of our estimation procedure. While highly stylized, the model we present provides an explicit


                                                 4
account of the forces that drive political decisions, and thus offers a transparent interpretation
of the findings of our empirical exercise.
       We consider N states (jurisdictions), each populated by a continuum of households. Each
state n is characterized by the following random variables:

    • nst , the population growth in state s at time t.

    • θst , the probability that a household living in state s at t − 1 is in the same state at t. For
         simplicity, we assume that the probability of moving is independent of age; time variation
         in mobility will thus affect all residents uniformly.3

    • φst , a measure of the household preference for public goods in the state;

       We assume that all residents of a state share the same mobility and the same preferences
for (state-level) public goods.4 By assuming that these random variables depend on the state,
rather than the household, we make our analysis tractable, but our results would be robust to
the extent that moving costs are high.5
       Within period t, a household residing in state s has preferences given by

                                                           G1−σ
                                                  cit + φst st ,                                                  (1)
                                                           1−σ

where cit is consumption of a private good by household i (residing in state s) and Gst is the per
capita level of a state-level public good.6
   3
       As shown in Bassetto and Lepetyuk [6] (e.g., figure 1), variation by age is not as important, except for the
old that are far from being pivotal. For the same reason, we can safely abstract from the probability of death:
except for the old, this is much smaller than the probability of moving. Introducing a constant probability of
death would complicate our intermediate steps, but would not affect the final expressions that we take to the
data.
   4
     Upon moving, each household thus inherits a new mobility and preference parameter, based on its new state
of residence.
    5
      For evidence of limited mobility across states, see Meyer[18] and Gelbach [13]. Kennan and Walker [16] also
estimate very high moving costs for the large majority of residents of a state, limiting the pool of potential movers.
A model of policy determination with endogenous mobility is developed in Bassetto [5].
  6
    We assume that public goods are subject to congestion externalities. This seems appropriate for state-level


                                                          5
       Households discount the future at a rate β. We assume that the probability that a household
that moves from one state to another will move back is negligible. Because of this, households
discount future benefits from the public goods and future taxes in the state in which they reside
by βθs t+1 .
       In each period, each person alive produces y units of output, which can be either consumed
as a private good7 or invested in the public good. The per capita level of the public good evolves
in the following manner:
                                                    1−δ
                                          Gst =            Gs t−1 + γst ,                                        (2)
                                                   1 + nst
where δ is the depreciation rate of the public good and γst is public spending per capita in period
t in state s. In our empirical specifications, we will consider several public goods, characterized
by different degrees of durability; in particular, we will constrast current expenditures (for which
we assume δ = 1) to capital expenditures. The analysis developed here immediately generalizes
to multiple public goods by assuming that each good enters additively in the utility function.8
In particular, our key equations (7) and (9) will hold for each good independently.
       Each state has a government that is empowered to levy income taxes and produce public
goods.9
       The government faces a budget constraint, that links the evolution of its debt per capita Bst
to the deficit it runs in every period:

                                                         Bs t−1
                                      Bst = (1 + rt )           + γst − Tst ,                                    (3)
                                                        1 + nst

where rt is the real interest rate, and Tst are tax revenues per capita.
public goods, since it is doubtful that the relative magnitude of Delaware vs. California is a major driver of public
amenities in the two states. Supporting this view, our population-based measure of state size is not significant in
our regressions.
   7
     The private good is nondurable. Private capital could be introduced with no effect on the results, if income
taxes are restricted to labor; see Bassetto with Sargent [7].
                                                                                          1−σ

                                                                                PM       Gsjt j
     The preferences over M public goods would thus be described by cit + j=1 φsjt 1−σ       j

     Given that all residents of a state are identical and that location and income are exogenous, income taxes are
equivalent to fixed lump-sum payments.

       Taxes and spending are chosen by majority vote each period by the residents of the state,10
subject to two borrowing restrictions. The first restriction limits to a value x the fraction of
public spending that can be financed with debt. The constitutions of most U.S. states prevent
borrowing, except to finance capital expenditures; this would correspond to x = 0 for current
(nondurable) expenses, and x = 1 for capital projects.11 We will both study the implications of
setting x to these values and make inference on x from the data. The second restriction limits
the duration of debt. In the model, this is represented by a parameter α, which represents the
minimal fraction of outstanding debt that must be retired in any given period. This parameter
is a parsimonious representation of the limited duration of debt issued by U.S. states; for some
states, this limit is imposed by their constitution, while in other cases it might be driven by other
forces that are outside of the model, such as the lack of liquidity of maturities longer than 30
years. The two borrowing restrictions give rise to the following lower bound on taxes, given by
the fraction of spending that cannot be financed with debt, plus the minimum debt repayment:

                                                             α + rt
                                       Tst ≥ (1 − x)γst +            Bs t−1 ,                                (4)
                                                             1 + nst

Given household preferences, the equilibrium interest rate of the economy is the constant rt =
(1 − β)/β.


2.2        Equilibrium

Details of the definition and characterization of an equilibrium are provided in the appendix. In
brief, voters equate the marginal benefit of an additional unit of investment with its cost, taking
into account the discounted value of future benefit and cost changes that are triggered by today’s
vote. We focus on Markov equilibria, where the equilibrium level of public capital is independent
of the past. In these equilibria, any additional investment in public goods beyond the equilibrium
  10
       Given our assumptions, all residents will share the same preferences, and the vote will be unanimous.
  11
       Pension obligations are an important grey area in the states’ and localities’ budgets, as witnessed by the
recent experience of states that have borrowed to fund these obligations. Funding pensions with debt violates
the golden rule by transferring the costs of current employees to future taxpayers. Inman [14] shows evidence of
strategic manipulation along these lines.


                                                         7
level would only last for one period, and will be reversed in the subsequent period. This implies
that the marginal benefit of a new project is equal to its marginal benefit in one period, which
is φst G−σ
        st . While the level of the public good is altered for only one period, the tax implications

stretch into the future. On the cost side, equations (3) and (4) imply that an additional unit of
Gst increases time-t taxes in state s by 1 − x units.12 In period t + 1, in accordance with the
equilibrium, spending in the public good is reduced by (1 − δ)/(1 + ns t+1 ) units to restore capital
to the level that would have prevailed without the additional spending in period t. Period-t + 1
taxes respond to this investment reduction by (1 − x)(1 − δ)/(1 + ns t+1 ). Period-t + 1 taxes
are also affected by the additional debt (x) issued in period t. Of this debt, the state must pay
interest (at a rate (1 − β)/β) and a fraction α of principal. The combined effect for period t + 1
is thus given by                                                             
                                   (1 − x)(1 − δ)       x               1−β

An additional unit of spending in period t has no further effects on public spending beyond
period t + 1, but the consequences of debt from the changes in spending in both periods t and
t + 1 linger, and taxes in period t + j vary by the following amount:
                             j                       
                             Y       1         1−β
                           x                       + α [δ − α](1 − α)j−2 ,           j > 1.

                                 1 + n s t+v    β

Whether taxes increase or decrease after period t + 1 depends on whether the public good
depreciates faster or slower than the rate at which government debt is paid back. When the
public good is not very durable and debt is paid back slowly, we have δ > α and taxes increase
in the long run.
       To a resident of the state at time t, the expected present value of taxes per unit of public
investment, Qst , is the discounted sum of all these present and future tax changes:

       It is straightforward to show that voters will always choose to postpone taxes as much as possible, i.e., they
will choose taxes so as to make (4) bind.

      In voting, a resident will equate the marginal utility of the additional public good provision in
period t with the expected present value of tax changes that will be triggered by this additional
provision:

This expression confirms that voters choose a level of public capital that is independent of
past choices (if they expect future voters to do the same), thereby validating the nature of the
equilibrium that we conjectured.


2.3       Equilibrium Approximation: Capital

To simplify our expressions, we linearize log Qst around nst = 0 and θst = 1, and assume that
population growth and (one minus) the mobility rate follow AR(1) processes with autocorrela-
tions ρn and ρθ and long-term means n̄ and θ̄. This yields the following expression for the present
value of taxes per unit of investment that the current voters are expecting to pay:

To derive intuition, we consider three components of equation (7) in turn:

  1. log(1 − β(1 − δ)). This is the only term that would apply if nst ≡ n̄ = 0 and θst ≡ θ̄ = 1.
        With no population growth and no mobility ever, this is a standard representative-agent
        economy where Ricardian equivalence holds. Consequently, neither the fraction of debt
        financing x not debt maturity α have any effect on public good provision. Furthermore,
        it is straightforward to verify that the representative agent votes for the efficient level of
        Gst .13

      See the appendix for the derivation of the efficient level.

2. A term that captures the deviations from efficiency that arise when ρn and ρθ are zero:
                                                                  
                            1 + n̄ − θ̄               1 − β(1 − δ)
                                         β(1 − δ) − x                .                    (8)
                          1 − β(1 − δ)                1 − β(1 − α)

  In this case, the expectations about future mobility and growth are equal to their uncon-
  ditional values n̄ and θ̄. When x = 0 (there is no debt issuance), higher mobility (1 − θ)
  and/or population growth (n) between period t and period t + 1 imply a higher effective
  discount factor by the voters. As a result, costs to current voters go up, and this leads
  to an accordingly lower level of government investment (provided depreciation is less than
  full, i.e., δ < 1). When debt issuance is allowed at the margin (x > 0), costs in the form of
  debt repayment are also shifted into the future, reducing the inefficiency caused by mobility
  and population growth. The degree to which borrowing is effective at restoring efficiency
  depends on the relationship between δ and α: δ measures the decay of capital (and hence
  the rate at which benefits shrink) into the future, whereas α measures the speed of debt
  repayment (and hence the rate at which costs shrink). The higher δ (the lower α), the less
                                                            β(1−δ)(1−β(1−α))
  debt is needed to restore efficiency. When x goes above       1−β(1−δ)
                                                                             ,   the term in brack-
  ets is negative, and costs are shifted further into the future than benefits, and deviations
  from Ricardian equivalence imply overspending.

  This logic is also helpful in understanding the case in which ρθ ≈ ρn ≈ 1. In this case,
  deviations from efficiency (derived from both this term and the remaining terms in equation
  (7)) are given by                                                
                           1 + nst − θst               1 − β(1 − δ)
                                          β(1 − δ) − x                ,
                           1 − β(1 − δ)                1 − β(1 − α)
  which is equal to the term (8) simply replacing the unconditional means n̄ and θ̄ with the
  current values of the shocks nst and θst , which are perceived as permanent shocks for the
  future.

3. The remaining terms in equation (7) capture the way in which the speed of the repayment
  schedule interacts with the demographic processes as nst and θst converge (in expectation)
  back to their long-run steady states. When ρn and ρθ are less than 1, the interaction
  between these terms and the one in equation (8) is less straightforward and the level of

                                            10
         debt that restores efficiency will result from canceling out of the three terms where x
         appears. In practice, our estimates of ρn and ρθ are both close to one, so that the three
         levels of debt that cancel out each of the bracketed terms in equation (7) will be very
                                                         β(1−δ)(1−β(1−α))
         similar, and the average will be close to           1−β(1−δ)
                                                                          .

       Based on the intuition developed above, the model predicts that the stock of public capital
will be lower in states with more population growth and/or higher mobility if no borrowing is
allowed. When enough borrowing of sufficiently long maturity is allowed, this relation reverses,
and more population growth (mobility) is associated with higher capital. This is more likely to
happen for capital that depreciates faster.
       To gain further insight, in figures 1 and 2 we plot the log of the stock of the public good as a
function of the fraction of households that stay within the state from one year to the next (“the
stayers”) and the degree to which debt financing is allowed.14 In both figures we set β = 0.96,
σ = 0.2, and α so that the half-life of debt is 15 years; we set population growth to 0 (to isolate
the effects of mobility), we assume constant mobility, and no implementation lags. Finally, we
also assume constant preferences, and we normalize φst so that the efficient provision of the
public good (in logs) is 0.
       In figure 1 we set δ = 0.03, which may be appropriate for major infrastructure investment,
whereas figure 2 adopts δ = 0.06, in line with many estimates of the depreciation of private
capital.
       Not surprisingly, figures 1 and 2 show that Ricardian equivalence holds if there is no mobility
(θ = 1), while spending departs more and more from the efficient level when the fraction of stayers
decreases. More interestingly, the sign of this departure depends on the circumstances. Under
a pure balanced budget (x = 0), we unambiguously obtain that public capital is underprovided.
However, under 100% debt financing, when capital is not very durable (δ = 0.06) costs are shifted
into the future (relative to benefits) to an extent that makes it worthwhile for voters to actually
overprovide public capital. In this case, increasing mobility (decreasing the fraction of stayers)
increases the provision of public capital. The main implication observed in these figures is that,
  14
       The effects of population growth are analogous to those of mobility, so we do not plot them here.



                                                         11
for high degrees of debt financing, we should observe a positive relationship between the level
of public capital and mobility for capital goods subject to rapid depreciation, and a negative
relationship for very long-term projects.


2.4        Equilibrium Approximation: Identification of Factors Affecting
           Investment

The discussion above refers to the stock of public capital and assumes that projects are im-
plemented as soon as they are approved. In the data, we actually observe the flows of public
investment (and expenses in nondurable goods); moreover implementation lags are likely as bid-
ding and contracting may wait until after voter or legislature approval and projects may take
several years to complete. We adjust for both of these before we take our model to the data.
In the model, the investment flow is captured by the variable γst , which can be easily computed
from (2) and (6). We account for implementation delays by assuming that capital projects are
approved by voters k years before they are implemented. Voters take into account the resulting
shift of both costs and benefits into the future.15
  15
       In our analysis, both benefits and costs are subject to the same delay. We are mostly concerned with delays
arising from planning and bidding, periods in which little actual spending occurs.

This equation shows how the parameters of the model affect the relationship between public
investment, population growth, and mobility. Our empirical strategy is based on testing the
model by running the corresponding regression:

Interpreting the individual coefficients in the sums in (10) is difficult because the corresponding
coefficients in (9) are very sensitive to implementation lags. As an example, using our baseline
parameters of Table 1, we would expect b0 ≈ 17 if there are no implementation lags, while
b0 = −1 with implementation lags of a year or longer. The intuition is straightforward: in the
first case, investment ramps up immediately with population growth, to accommodate the needs
of the additional population; in the second case, total investment is predetermined by the voters’
previous decisions, so it actually falls in per capita terms if population grows faster, only to
increase at a later date.
      Fortunately, the dependence of individual coefficients on implementation lags can be over-
come by aggregating distributed lags. These sums correspond to dynamic patterns of change in

where J > k is any number greater than the number of years of delay in implementation.
       Bn corresponds to the change in investment in response to a shock in the growth rate of
population of magnitude ρ−J
                         n in period t−J that decays at the rate ρn through period t (attaining

a magnitude of 1 in period t). Bθ has the same interpretation for a mobility shock. Bθ∗ corresponds
to the change in investment when the fraction of stayers increases by the same amount in periods
t − J through t.
       Equations (11) and (12) are appealing in that they do not depend at all on the specific value
k. However, inference based on these coefficients relies heavily on the interaction between the
persistence of mobility and population growth and the depreciation of capital. The simple sum
in (13) is much easier to interpret, and will not be very sensitive to k when ρθ is close to one, as
we estimate in the data.17
       To gain further intuition, consider first what happens under efficient provision of the public
good. The efficient level is given by

                                                   φst G−σ
                                                        st = 1 − β(1 − δ).
  17
       It might be surprising that the two sums given by (12) and (13), which are quite similar for ρθ ≈ 1, might
have significantly different interpretations from the perspective of the model. The explanation for this apparent
puzzle can be seen from equation (9). For the typical values of the depreciation rate and the discount factor,
these expressions imply a very large coefficient in the difference between θst−k and θs t−k−1 . Hence, even small
changes in ρθ may have a significant impact on the overall sum. In the data, the high degree of autocorrelation
in θst implies that measuring the effect of the difference in mobility rates from one period to the next is difficult.
The straight sum in (13) bypasses this difficulty.

                                                              14
From equation (2), this implies that investment is
                                        1/σ                       1/σ
                                 φst             1−δ       φs t−1
                    γst =                     −                           .                     (14)
                            1 − β(1 − δ)        1 + nst 1 − β(1 − δ)
The efficient level of investment is driven by the total population of the state, independently of
the gross migration flows. For this reason, θst plays no role in equation (14), and our estimates
of Bθ and Bθ∗ would thus be zero. When a state’s population is growing, equation (14) shows
that additional investment is needed to provide a constant capital stock per capita. After taking
logs and the appropriate linearization, the resulting coefficient Bn would be equal to (1 − δ)/δ,
which is the first term in (11).
   When Bθ and Bθ∗ are different from zero, we can infer from their sign whether mobility is a
force that generates underprovision or overprovision of public capital in the model. Take Bθ∗ first,
since it is the easier term to interpret. When no borrowing is allowed (x = 0), underprovision of
public capital occurs, and this is more severe the lower θst is, since a lower probability of staying
magnifies departures from Ricardian equivalence. As can be seen from (13), this is reflected in
Bθ∗ > 0. As x increases, Bθ∗ decreases, until it eventually becomes negative when mobility starts
being a factor that generates overprovision of public capital.
   The coefficient Bθ embeds a level effect, that is identical to the one described for Bθ∗ , and a
time-trend effect. The trend effect works in the opposite direction of the level effect. Consider
the case of underprovision (say, x = 0). Bθ measures the response to a shock that increased
θs t−1 by ρ−1
           θ , and decayed to an increase by 1 in θst . This shock implies an increase in the

desired level of capital that is greatest in period t − 1. As of period t, the desired level of
capital is still higher than without the shock, but the decay implies that it is lower than period
t − 1. Investment reflects this desire for drawing down the stock. When depreciation is low,
undepreciated capital from the previous period is sufficiently high that drawing down the stock
requires curtailing investment in period t, and the overall effect of the shock on investment can
be negative in that period (even though θst is higher than it would have been in the absence
of the shock). In contrast, when depreciation is high, not much of the additional capital from
period t − 1 remains, and investment needs to remain elevated to deliver the higher period-t
capital stock that is warranted in consequence of the lingering positive shock to the fraction of

                                                 15
stayers. We thus conclude that, for goods that are not too durable, underprovision is associated
with Bθ > 0, whereas the reverse is true when δ < 1 − ρθ .
      The intuition for Bn is completely analogous to the one about Bθ , except that the “neutral”
value of this coefficient is (1 − δ)/δ, due to the need to provide additional capital when the
population grows faster. To discuss one of the cases, when x = 0 more population growth leads
to more underprovision of the public good. If δ > 1 − ρn , this level effect dominates, and the
response to population growth is smaller than (1 − δ)/δ, the level that is necessary to preserve
the stock of capital per capita. If δ < 1 − ρn , then the trend effect dominates the level effect,
and underprovision is associated with Bn > (1 − δ)/δ.
      We illustrate the working of the coefficients further by looking at their values under our
baseline calibration, presented in Table 1, and exploring their sensitivity to various parameters.
      At the parameter values of Table 1 we obtain the following values:

                                      Bn ≈ 6.8, Bθ ≈ −3.5, Bθ∗ ≈ −9.5.

Consider Bθ∗ first. Our calibration implies that the benefits of capital goods are more weighted
towards the present than the taxes needed to pay off the debt. This implies that 100% debt
financing generates incentives for overprovision of capital (i.e., the term in brackets in (13) is
negative).18 This incentive is lower, the closer we are to Ricardian equivalence and thus the
higher the fraction of the population that stays within the state from one year to the next. Bθ∗
captures this effect, and the model predicts a negative coefficient.
      In the case of Bθ , the point estimate for 1 − δ − ρθ turns out to be very close to 0, so that
the level and time-trend effects cancel out almost exactly. We thus expect this coefficient to be
close to 0, and not very informative of over/underprovision of public capital.
      For Bn , the confidence interval for ρn still spans 1 − δ, but a greater part lies in the range
for which 1 − δ − ρn > 0. In this range, the time-trend effect dominates the level effect. Hence,
when x is such that public capital is overprovided (i.e., when the term inside brackets in (11) is
negative), public investment responds less to population growth than it would if it simply kept
 18
      The marginal debt financing that would make mobility a neutral force on the stock of public capital is about
81%.


                                                        16
up with providing infrastructure for the newcomers: Bn < (1 − δ)/δ ≈ 15.7.19
       Figure 3 shows how our coefficients of interest depend on the fraction of debt financing. Bθ
and Bθ∗ cross the neutral level of 0 at 81% debt financing. The response of Bθ to changes in x
is more muted, since 1 − δ − ρθ is close to zero. For values of ρθ < 1 − δ, Bθ would become
increasing in x. Bn crosses its neutral level of 15.7 at 84% debt financing. Since δ < 1 − ρn , the
time-trend effect dominates, and Bn is decreasing in x (i.e., overprovision is associated with a
coefficient that is below the neutral level (1 − δ)/δ).
       Figure 4 illustrates the role of the elasticity of the demand for the public good (σ −1 ). For
small values of the elasticity, the provision of the public good does not respond much to the price
as perceived by the voters, and the coefficients remain close to their neutral values, and far from
those that we will estimate empirically. We choose σ at the lower bound of the existing estimates
to allow public good provision to respond in a meaningful way to our variables of interest.
       Figure 5 displays the relationship between our coefficients of interest and the depreciation of
public capital. In the case of the simple sum Bθ∗ , this relationship is straightforward. For low
depreciation rates, x = 1 leads to underprovision, and Bθ∗ > 0. As δ increases, Bθ∗ crosses zero
and becomes more and more negative: for goods that are less and less durable, the benefits are
more and more skewed towards the short run relative to the costs, and greater overprovision
occurs. For Bn and Bθ , the relationship is more complex: over/underprovision interacts with
the time trend/level effect. At very low depreciation rates, public capital is underprovided, and
the time-trend effect dominates: hence Bn > (1 − δ)/δ and Bθ < 0. At high depreciation rates,
public capital is overprovided, but the level effect dominates the trend effect, so Bn and Bθ turn
around and once again we have Bn > (1 − δ)/δ and Bθ < 0. This is why it is more difficult to
rely on these measures to establish over/underprovision.
       Finally, figure 6 shows how Bθ and Bθ∗ are affected by the autocorrelation ρθ . In the case
of the simple sum Bθ∗ , this autocorrelation matters because it governs the rate at which future
costs and benefits decay. A low autocorrelation implies that mobility reverts quickly, and voters
  19
       Since ρn 6= ρθ , the marginal debt financing that would make population growth a neutral force on the stock
of public capital is not the same as that that would neutralize population growth. However, it is very similar, at
about 84%.


                                                         17
respond less to its current deviations from the long-term mean, which means that Bθ∗ is closer
to 0. In the case of the discounted sum, this interacts with the time-trend effect, that becomes
dominant at low levels of correlation and thus implies Bθ > 0 even though our parameter values
are such that public capital is overprovided.



3     Data and Institutional Features of the States
The assumptions in the model correspond to many of the basic features of state government
finance in the United States. Nearly all states operate under the strictures of balanced budget
requirements. These mandate that, at some point in the budgeting process, current expenditures
are expected to be paid out of current revenues. States differ in when in the budget process
balance must be obtained. As a result, these can differ in how binding they are in practice.
For example, the Illinois constitution states, “The Governor shall prepare and submit to the
General Assembly... a State budget for the ensuing fiscal year....Proposed expenditures shall not
exceed funds estimated to be available for the fiscal year as shown in the budget.” In Illinois, the
legislature is also required to pass a balanced budget. However, if circumstances change within
the fiscal year, the state can borrow to cover unexpected deficits.
    Borrowing for capital expenditures lays outside these balanced budget requirements and sep-
arate provisions cover state ability to issue debt for capital projects. In Illinois, for example,
the state can issue debt provided that it is for a specific purpose and is approved by 3/5 of the
legislature or by a majority of voters in a referendum. Nearly all states also have capital budgets
that specifically detail how capital projects are to be financed.
    For most municipal bonds, the state issues debt of a certain duration, gets the money up
front, spends the money within 2-5 years of issuance, pays interest over time (usually semi-
annually) and then pays the entire principal back when the bond matures. Most municipal
bonds are callable and most states allow bonds to be called and refunded provided that the
duration is not extended. Municipal bonds tend to be of fairly long duration. In January 2011,
the average maturity of municipal bonds was 15.6 years, while the average maturity of corporate



                                                18
bonds was 11.2 years.20 Also in contrast to corporate bonds, one municipal bonds issuance often
contains several maturities (these are called serial maturities). In addition, there are sinking
funds associated with non-serial bonds where the issuer makes several payments into a sinking
fund so that the entire principal does not need to be funded at one point.21
       In order to estimate our model, our first need is to measure the flow variable γst for current
and capital spending. For this purpose, we use data from the Annual Survey of State Government
Finances. This data has been collected for all states by the Census Bureau since 1915 with the
omission of some years in the 20s and 30s. Since 1952, the survey has followed a fairly consistent
format. The data contain detailed information on government expenditures, revenues, and debt.
State government expenditures are divided into 64 different government functions, such as Air
Transportation, Corrections, and Elementary and Secondary Education. For each function, ex-
penditure data is available for numerous different purposes such as capital expenditures, current
expenditures, and intergovernmental expenditure.
       In this paper we are concerned with patterns of current and capital expenditures. According
to the survey’s classification manual, current expenditures include expenditures for employee
compensation, supplies and materials. By contrast, capital outlay includes “expenditure for
purchase or construction, by contract or government employee, construction of buildings and
other improvements; for purchase of land, equipment, and existing structures; and for payments
on capital leases.22 ” In the data, capital outlay is further divided into construction, purchase
of land and existing structures, and purchase of equipment. We also separately measure non-
highway capital spending and non-highway construction spending, since Poterba [19] argues that
highway spending is heavily influenced by federal transfers.
       We supplement this with data on state population growth and state mobility. State pop-
ulation data is available annually from the Census Bureau. It is straightforward to calculate
  20
       See [22, 23].
  21
       Our discussion here refers primarily to general obligation bonds, i.e., bonds that are guaranteed by the taxing
power of the state. These bonds fit our theory better than revenue bonds, where the debt is repaid from revenues
generated by the project; in this case, the state is essentially providing a private capital good. See Johnson and
Rubin [15].

    See [26], chapter 5.

population growth rates, nst , from this data.
       The measure of mobility delineated in the theory is the probability that a household living
in state s at t is alive and in the same state at t + 1. As mentioned earlier, we extrapolate away
from death by assuming a constant hazard of death. Data on annual state to state migration are
available from the IRS for 1975 to 2007.23 The IRS delineates a person as mobile if the address
provided on their return one year is different from the address provided on their return the
following year. We define a state’s gross emigration rate as the number of people who provided
an in-state address on last year’s tax return and who provide an address in a different state this
year, divided by the number of people who provided an in state address last year and still live
in the US. The fraction of stayers is then one minus the gross emigration rate. We base this
measure of stayers on the number of people who have stayed in state rather than the number
of tax units that have stayed in state using information on the number of personal exemptions
claimed. The IRS data does not include information on the mobility of individuals who do not
file, or those who file after late September. We choose to use this data because it measures
annual mobility as is suggested by the theory, is available since 1975 so provides us with a long
time series, and is based on large enough samples to provide accurate measures of mobility for
the smaller states.24
       We can only consistently estimate Bθ∗ , Bθ , and Bn if the preference shock captured in st
is orthogonal to population growth and immobility. As a result, we include in the regression
features of states that we believe are correlated with spending and may be also correlated with
either mobility or population growth. In particular we are concerned with proxying for state res-
ident preferences for fiscal variables that may also be related to population growth or mobility.
We choose several population attributes – average personal income, fraction of the population
with a high-school diploma, fraction urban, population density, fraction over 65, fraction under
  23
       We thank Alicia Sasser Modestino at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for sharing this data with us.
  24
       We also estimate our model based on five year migratory flows available in the Decennial Census. We
interpolate between Census Years, adjust the estimates to account for the five year window, and forecast flows
for years since the 2000 Census. We provide an estimate based on this alternative data in the appendix. The two
measures are very highly correlated.



                                                      20
25, homeownership rate,25 state size, population liberalism, and resident taste for mobility. Most
of these variables are available annually or by decade from the Census Bureau. We interpolate
between Census years for data that is not available yearly. Three measures merit further dis-
cussion – state size, population liberalism and resident taste for mobility. We measure a state’s
size in a given year as the fraction of U.S. population that lives in the state in that year. For
population liberalism, we use factor analysis; specifically, we take the first factor from five state
political variables – the percent of the popular vote for the Democratic Presidential candidate
in the previous election, the percent of the state’s Senate delegation that belongs to the Demo-
cratic Party, the percent of the state’s House delegation that belongs to the Democratic party,
the average Americans for Democratic Action (ADA; a liberal political organization) score for
the state’s Senate delegation, and the average ADA score for the state’s House delegation. The
resident taste for mobility is measured as the number of people that moved to a new house in
the same state in the five years leading up to the Census divided by the number of people that
stayed in state. We add this proxy for preferences for mobility because we believe that many
unobservable attributes of populations that would influence interstate mobility would influence
within-state mobility in a similar manner.26
       Variable means and our abbreviations for these variables are presented in Table 2. We can
see from this table that states vary substantially in per capita fiscal variables. We also note
that state current spending is about 8 times the level of state capital spending on average. Most
capital spending is for construction while smaller amounts are dedicated to land and equipment
expenditure.



4        Estimation
To assess the success and the shortcomings of the model in explaining the data, we proceed in
two steps. First, we completely parameterize the model imposing plausible values into equation
  25
       The homeownership rate is defined as the fraction of houses that are owner-occupied.
  26
       State size would be an important exception, which is why we included it as an explicit control. Results are
similar with or without introducing state size.



                                                         21
(9), and we study the dimensions in which the results diverge from the data. These parameter
values are summarized in Table 1. Second, we give the model one degree of freedom and use
estimates of Bn , Bθ , and Bθ∗ to infer the amount of debt financing allowed at the margin (x),
while holding all other parameters at their calibrated values. This gives us an alternative measure
of the aspects of the data that the model is able to capture, and those that it misses.
       Two remarks are worth noting about estimating (10):

    • Estimates of the individual coefficients in the sums will be imprecise, due to the high
         autocorrelation and the resulting collinearity. However, we are interested in sums of these
         coefficients, and those will still be precisely estimated.

    • Although in theory the formulas (11), (12), and (13) work for any J ≥ k + 1, since all terms
         in the sum should be zero for j > k + 1, the exponential term ρ−j implies that estimates
         would become very imprecise for large J. It is thus in practice important to choose a
         parsimonious number of lags. We work with 4 lags, which implies that we assume that
         public goods have an implementation delay of no more than 3 years.

       We start our empirical analysis with a simple regression that predicts the natural log of per
capita fiscal variables based on contemporaneous population growth, mobility, and year dummies
alone.27 We cluster the standard errors by state. The results are presented in Table 3. Two clear
facts emerge from this table:28

    • Population growth is very weakly related to state-level spending; and

    • the higher the fraction of stayers in a state (i.e., the smaller the gross emigration rate), the
         smaller is spending: a one standard deviation increase in the fraction of stayers increases
         log capital spending per capita by approximately 2/3 of a standard deviation.

For the purpose of reconciling the evidence with the theory, it is interesting to see that both facts
are least pronounced in the case of purchases of land and existing structures, arguably the most
  27
       In the case of purchases of land and existing structures we lose two state-year observations due to zeros.
  28
       These facts match what was found by Poterba [19] in his cross-sectional analysis of state-level spending in
1962; see his Table 1.

                                                         22
durable category of state spending. For this variable, a positive (but statistically insignificant)
association emerges with population growth, and the negative association with the fraction of
stayers is smallest and not statistically significant.
       Our identifying restriction is that the preference shock in (9) is uncorrelated with population
growth and mobility. In our preferred regression, we introduce several controls that are meant
to capture elements of the preference shock that may be correlated with demographics.
       In Table 4, we run the same regression, but including all of our baseline controls. The inclusion
of controls only modestly affects the coefficient on the fraction of stayers. For population growth,
coefficients move from being weakly negative to weakly positive, but still much smaller than what
is needed to keep constant the amount of capital per capita (which would be (1 − δ)/δ). Our
main conclusions are thus largely unchanged. It is particularly noteworthy that the correlation
between emigration and state-level spending is not due to a general inclination to mobility by
the residents of a state: our regressions show that more internal migration within a state is
associated with less spending. Aside from internal mobility, we find that states with richer
populations spend more on capital goods. We also find that states with younger populations
spend more on capital projects. This may be explained by the large role of states in the purchase
and construction of school buildings. Our political variable shows that capital spending does not
appear to be a partisan issue, whereas more liberal states have higher current expenses. Finally,
there is some evidence that urbanization is associated with less state-level spending.
       In Table 5, we present results from the regression that best matches the theory. We assume
that public investment takes at most 3 years from the moment it is approved, which calls for
using the contemporaneous value and 4 lags of population growth and mobility,29 and calls
for lagging controls by 3 years.30 The table displays both discounted and undiscounted sums
  29
       The time dimension in our panel regression spans 28 years, which should be long enough to avoid the short-
sample bias in estimating dynamic responses. In any case, our main interest is in the sum of the coefficients and
not in identifying the precise lag correlation of spending with population growth and mobility.
  30
     In equation (9), the most recent preference shock that should matter is given by Et−k φst , i.e., it is based on
information k years in the past. For goods for which k < 3, the 3-year lag of the control variable can be viewed
as an instrument for the k-year lag. In practice, all of our controls are very autocorrelated, and the number of
lags in the regression makes little difference.


                                                         23
of the coefficients on population growth and the fractions of stayers: these sums confirm the
weak connection between population growth and capital spending, and the negative relationship
between stayers and capital spending.
       The tables in the appendix show that our results are robust along several dimensions. First,
we combined state and local spending to check that our results are not driven by differences
across states in the level of government that provides services. Our coefficients of interest remain
very similar, while there are changes in the coefficients for some of the controls. In particular, we
find that internal migration and urbanization are no longer statistically significant predictors of
spending. Second, in his study of U.S. counties, Rappaport [20] argues that there are endogenous
population movements towards small-government areas. His theory suggests that net migration
responds to government size. To ensure that our results are not driven by reverse causality, we
include a measure of net migration. This added variable has little effect on the large negative
coefficients for stayers, the relevant measure for our model, which is equal to one minus gross
migration.31 Including net migration in our regressions also does not significantly alter our
conclusions about the relationship of capital spending with population growth. Net migration
itself is weakly related to capital spending. Our data support Rappaport’s theory in that we
find a significant negative coefficient on net migration in the current spending regression. Third,
we confirmed that our results are robust to including the measure of political competition from
Besley, Persson, and Sturm [11],32 since they find that it is a predictor of the mix of spending by
states. Finally, we look at the relationship between population growth, mobility, and spending
within states over time by including state fixed effects. This modestly attenuates the effect of
mobility and increases the predictive power of population growth, but it does not substantively
alter our conclusions.
       To see how the results in Table 5 square with the model, we need estimates of ρn and ρθ . For
  31
       The correlation between stayers and net migration in our sample is low and negative: states where population
is churning in and out have a weak tendency to attract more residents.

       Table 6 uses the results from Table 5 to compute estimates of Bn , Bθ , and Bθ∗ , and compares
them with the values predicted by the calibrated model, if we assume that 100% of capital
spending is financed with debt at the margin, and none of current spending (the “golden rule”).
For general capital, we use the baseline calibration of Table 1; for its subcategories, we use
different values of δ: δ = 0.02 for purchases of land and existing structures, δ = 0.15 for
equipment, and δ = 0.05 for construction. In the case of current expenses, we set δ = 1 (full
depreciation). The model prediction depends on the estimates of the autocorrelation coefficients;
we incorporate this uncertainty by presenting a range based on the 95% confidence interval.33
       Looking at mobility first, the model calibration implies that 100% borrowing is more than
what is needed to restore appropriate incentives for total capital expenditure, and hence that
the fraction of stayers in the state should have a negative effect on capital provision (by bringing
the economy closer to Ricardian equivalence and thus curtailing overspending). As is noted in
Inman [14] and Poterba [19], states with high mobility can use debt issuance to transfer the
funding of capital projects to future residents and therefore may demand more spending. While
current residents get some of the benefits of the capital spending now, future residents pay. The
estimate of Bθ∗ from the data is indeed negative, supporting the qualitative conclusion of the
  33
       In the case of the model, we obtain the implied range evaluating the expressions for each value of ρn and ρθ
in their 95% confidence interval, and taking the maximum and minimum of the result. With one exception (land
and population growth), our coefficients are monotone in ρn or ρθ , so the maximum and minimum are attained
at the extremes of the confidence interval. For the standard deviation of our estimated coefficients, we combine
uncertainty about the autocorrelation and about each underlying parameter in the sums (11), (12), and (13)
using the delta method.

model, but its magnitude is too big, even allowing a high elasticity of demand for the public
good. In the data, mobility is even more important than our model would suggest. This is even
more true for the discounted sum Bθ , which according to theory should be slanted towards 0,
while it is not in the data. If we exclude highway spending, where federal transfers play a major
role, the estimated effect of mobility is still high, but now the confidence interval for our estimates
has significant overlap with the range from the theory. Columns (3) through (6) break down
total capital spending into its components. They highlight that our miss occurs in construction
expenditures: we would expect small coefficients from the theory, since these are fairly durable
expenses and overprovision should be small, but the estimates from the data are actually biggest.
The theory captures well the role of purchases of land and existing structures: for these very
durable expenses, even 100% borrowing is not sufficient according to our calibration, and a higher
fraction of stayers (in its level effect captured by Bθ∗ ) should increase spending. This is the only
component for which the data show no significant negative relationship with the fraction of
stayers. In the case of current expenses, strict adherence to the golden rule makes mobility and
spending independent in the model. Our estimates suggest instead a negative and significant
relationship. As we will show below, these coefficients can be justified by the theory if states are
able to finance some of their current expenditures with debt, so we regard this miss as evidence
that states have some leeway to evade the strictures of the golden rule.
   The model predictions about population growth are weaker, because of the offsetting level
and time-trend effects. The model predicts small, but positive coefficients, reflecting the need
for additional investment when population is growing. The data show an insignificant negative
relationship, and there is a large overlap between the range dictated by theory and the confidence
intervals of the estimates. One notable exception is for the most durable category of purchases
of land and existing structures. Here, the theory suggests a very large and positive coefficient.
Since these are very durable expenses, the flow spending needed to keep up with depreciation is
small relative to the stock, and keeping a constant level per capita when population grows faster
requires a much bigger percentage increase in investment. On top of this, the theory predicts
underspending in this category of purchases, since more than 100% debt would be needed (or



                                                  26
a longer maturity of debt). The time-trend effect (which dominates the level effect) boosts this
coefficient further. We do observe evidence of a positive relationship in the data, although it is
imprecisely estimated and it is not as strong as the prediction of the theory.
       In the previous analysis no parameter of the model was allowed to vary based on our empirical
findings. We next give the model one degree of freedom by inferring values of x from our regression
results, while keeping all other parameters fixed. Specifically, we look for the values of x that
can match the regression coefficients to those implied by the model. We first present results from
matching each of Bn , Bθ , and Bθ∗ independently. We then obtain a GMM estimate based on the
3 moments, and test the two overidentifying restrictions.
       Table 7 presents our results.34
       As can be seen from equations (11) and (12), when autocorrelation is close to 1 − δ the
coefficients Bn and Bθ are not very sensitive to the fraction of debt financing x. Since our
estimates are based on inverting this relationship, in this case the implied value of x is extremely
sensitive to autocorrelation, and it cannot be reliably inferred, resulting in standard errors so
large that no meaningful conclusion can be drawn. For inference based on Bn , this is particularly
an issue for equipment expenses (since ρn ≈ 0.88 and δ = 0.15); for Bθ , this affects total
expenditures, with or without highways (ρθ ≈ 0.96 and δ = 0.06) and especially construction
(δ = 0.05).
       For the cases in which reliable estimates can be derived from a single moment condition, the
table shows once again that the response of capital spending to population growth and mobility
(columns 1 through 5) is stronger in the data than we would expect in the model. In most cases, it
would take more than 100% debt financing of capital expenses to justify the response we observe
in the data. Using all 3 moments jointly results in estimates that are generally closer to 100%
debt financing;35 we can reject x = 1 for equipment and land, and marginally for construction.
  34
       In computing the standard deviation, we assume independence of the errors from the regressions used to
estimate the autoregression coefficients from those of the regressions that estimate the response of government
spending to our variables of interest.
  35
     It may at first be surprising that the estimate based on the 3 moments jointly is not a convex combination of
the estimates based on the individual moments. This is a natural consequence of the fact that the three moment
conditions are not independent. For two positively correlated random variables, if we observe one to be below its


                                                       27
Except for land expenditures,36 our tightly parameterized model is still statistically rejected by
the data, but the magnitude of the P-values suggests that it would not take a major perturbation
to be able to reconcile the response of spending to population growth and mobility.
    Column 7 presents the results for current expenditures. The values of x that are consistent
with the coefficients on mobility are positive and statistically significant, and the same happens
for the GMM estimate. This conforms well with the idea that the golden rule is not completely
successful at preventing states from borrowing to pay for these expenses, and that some leeway
remains.



5     Conclusion
We begin with an explicit political economy model where population growth and mobility lead
to departures from Ricardian equivalence. In our model, population dynamics cause voters to
discount the future more heavily than efficiency would dictate. We derive a testable prediction
that, in the presence of high degrees of debt financing, we should observe a positive relationship
between capital spending and mobility for rapidly depreciating capital goods and a negative
relationship for slowly depreciating assets. Our results are supportive of this prediction, but
we find that greater mobility is associated with higher capital spending to a somewhat greater
degree than can be explained by the theory.
    Our results suggest two avenues of future research. First, if mobility and capital spending are
related in the way we highlight in the paper, individual-level expectations of mobility should be
predictive of individual voting behavior; this could be tested with more disaggregated political
data, particularly for debt referenda.
    Second, our evidence suggests that some of the costs of current state expenditures are shifted
to future residents despite restrictions on the issuance of debt for current expenditure. How
states do so in practice is an interesting question. One area of current expenditure that deserves
unconditional mean, we expect the second one to also be below its unconditional mean.
  36
     Interestingly, land, along with current expenditures, is the only case for which all estimates from individual
moments are fairly reliable.



                                                        28
further scrutiny is the treatment of pension obligations. As is noted by Inman [14], while current
residents benefit from the services provided by current workers, if pensions and other benefits
are underfunded, future residents will bear some of the cost. Current residents therefore have an
incentive to underfund pensions. Exploring the theoretical and empirical relationship between
population dynamics and pension funding could be analyzed with a similar type of model.

A         Efficient Allocations
Since households have linear preferences in private consumption, we are in a transferable utility
environment, and the Pareto frontier can be derived by maximizing the sum of the utilities of
all the households. This maximization will uniquely determine aggregate private consumption,
but not its distribution across people: the Pareto frontier is traced by varying this distribution.
       Letting Ct be average per capita consumption in period t and Nst the number of residents of
state s in period t, a Pareto-efficient allocation solves:
                                             (∞                                  )
                                                                          1−σ 

The expectation in (17) is taken with respect to the population count in each state (governed by
the stochastic process for population growth) and the preference shock.
       The first-order conditions for this problem yield

B         Definition of an Equilibrium
This definition is similar to the one in Bassetto with Sargent [7]. All the notation that is not
explicitly defined here is the same as in our main text.
       A tax-debt policy are bounded sequences {{Tst , Bst }s∈U.S.A. }∞
                                                                      t=0 . A price system is a sequence

{rt }∞
     t=0 .

       We consider the problem of a household that starts at time t, taking as given the price system
and the tax policy from t on:37
                                                      "   ∞
                                                                                           #
                                                          X                        G1−σ
                                                                                    sj j
                                        max∞ Et                 β j−t cj + φsj j                              (19)
                                     {(cj ,aj )}j=t
                                                          j=t
                                                                                   1−σ
  37
       As mentioned in the text, for simplicity we abstract from death, so the household has an infinite life span.
Because of population growth, new households do enter into the economy every period.

                                                                46
subject to the flow budget constraint

                                        cj + aj + Tsj j ≤ (1 + rj )aj−1 + y,                                     (20)

where aj are a households’ assets at the end of period j, and sj is the state where the household
resides in period j. In equation (19), the expectation is over two sources of uncertainty. First,
an individual household is uncertain about sj (except for the initial period). We assume that
location follows a Markov process, where the probability distribution over the state of residence
next period only depends on the state of residence in the current period; this distribution is
assumed to be common to all households. A full description of this uncertainty would require
the entire 50 × 50 (time-varying) transition matrix. However, for the Markov equilibria that we
will consider it is sufficient to keep track of the probability of leaving a given state s conditional
on residing there in period j, which is 1 − θsj and is assumed to follow a AR(1) process as
described in the main text. The second source of uncertainty is the preference shock on the
public good, φsj j . We assume that this shock is bounded and that it is common to all households
residing in the same state. Since our empirical analysis clusters standard errors at the state level,
no further assumption is needed on its distribution.
       To prevent Ponzi schemes, a household must also face a lower bound on assets; we assume
that aj is uniformly bounded from below.38
       The household problem has a solution only if rj = (1 − β)/β. When this interest rate
prevails, a household is indifferent about all consumption and asset profiles that meet its budget
constraint; it is thus not necessary to keep track of individual consumption and saving decisions
across time and for different realizations of the shocks, and households will be willing to absorb
any amount of bonds supplied by the states. In this case, a household’s welfare is

       We define a competitive equilibrium from time t as a real allocation {Cj , {γsj , Gsj }s∈U.S.A. }∞
                                                                                                        j=t ,

such that:
  38
       aj is a random variable adapted to the history of the households’ residence states and to the aggregate shocks.

                                                           47
  (i) rj = (1 − β)/β ∀j ≥ t, ensuring that the households’ problem has a solution;

 (ii) at any time j, the allocation satisfies the feasibility conditions (2) and (18);

 (iii) the state government budget constraints and debt limits (3) and (4) hold for all states and
         in every period.

       Next we define a political-economic equilibrium in which residents of a state collectively
choose public spending and investment each period. To evaluate those choices, households must
form expectations about the evolution of the economy. A history of the economy is a sequence
ht ≡ {{(Gs,j−1 , φsj , θsj , nsj )}s∈U.S.A. }tj=0 , for any t ≥ 0, where {Gs −1 }s∈U.S.A. is an exogenous
initial condition.39 We define a political-economic equilibrium in terms of a mapping Ψ defined
as follows:

    • To each history ht , Ψ associated a time-t provision of public capital {Gst (ht )}s∈U.S.A. ;

    • to each history ht and capital level {Gst }s∈U.S.A. , which need not coincide with {Gst (ht )}s∈U.S.A. ,
         the mapping Ψ associates an allocation (C(ht , {Gst }s∈U.S.A. ), {γs (ht , {Gst }s∈U.S.A. )}s∈U.S.A. ),
         and a time-t tax-debt policy ({Bs (ht , {Gst }s∈U.S.A. ), Ts (ht , {Gst }s∈U.S.A. )}s∈U.S.A. ).

       Given any history hj , each mapping Ψ recursively generates a history from hj , along with
the exogenous evolution of the shocks:

                                ht ≡ (ht−1 , {(Gs t−1 (ht−1 ), φst , θst , nst )}s∈U.S.A. ).

From any initial condition hj , j ≥ 0, the sequence of histories recursively generated as above in-
duce an allocation and a tax/debt policy from the initial conditions {(Gs j−1 , φsj , θsj , nsj )}s∈U.S.A. ,
which are part of hj , and {Bs (hj−1 , {Gs j−1 }s∈U.S.A. )}s∈U.S.A. .40
       A mapping Ψ̃ ≡ ({G̃, C̃, γ̃, B̃, T̃ ) is a political-economic equilibrium when it has the following
properties.
  39
       Although other variables could be introduced as part of the history, it can be shown that their presence would
be redundant with the definition of an equilibrium below.
  40 j−1
    h    is the predecessor of the history hj . When we consider an initial history h0 , {Bs (h−1 )}s∈U.S.A. is an
initial level that is exogenously given.

                                                            48
(i) (Competitive equilibrium) Given any history hj , including the null history, the real alloca-
    tions and the tax/debt policy induced by Ψ̃ form a competitive equilibrium, together with
    the constant interest rate (1 − β)/β.

(ii) (Self-interested voting) Given any history hj , j ≥ 0, G̃s (hj−1 ) is the policy preferred by
    residents of the state s at time j, assuming that in the future the economy will follow the
    path implied by Ψ̃, and taking as given the contemporaneous political choice of residents
    of other states. Using (21), this requires that the following inequality holds for all values
    of G and all states S:
                       G1−σ

    where the following definitions hold:

       • Ĝs (hj ) = G̃s (hj ) ∀s 6= S,       ĜS (hj ) = G. In words, this is the public good provision
           in period j when state S deviates.

       •
                               ĥj+1 = (hj , {(Ĝs (hj ), φs j+1 , θs j+1 , ns j+1 )}s∈U.S.A. ),

                     ĥj+t = (hj+t−1 , {(G̃s (ĥj+t−1 ), φs j+t , θs j+t , ns j+t )}s∈U.S.A. ),    t>1:

           these are the histories induced by Ψ after a deviation by state S at history hj .

       •
                               h̃j+1 = (hj , {(G̃s (hj ), φs j+1 , θs j+1 , ns j+1 )}s∈U.S.A. ),

                     h̃j+t = (hj+t−1 , {(G̃s (hj+t−1 ), φs j+t , θs j+t , ns j+t )}s∈U.S.A. ),     t>1:

           these are the histories induced by Ψ if no deviations occur.


                                                       49
       In equation (22), sj+t is a random variable that is determined by the exogenous stochastic
       process for mobility, conditional on sj = S. Notice that all residents of the state face
       the same mobility process, and hence they share the same preferences over public good
       provision.

 (iii) (Budget balance) Given any history hj , any realization of shocks and political decisions,
       and any state S, taxes are set as follows:
                                           1−β
               j
                                      α+    β
        T̃S (h , {Gsj }s∈U.S.A. ) =              B̃S (hj−1 , {Gs j−1 }s∈U.S.A. ) + (1 − x)[GSj − (1 − δ)GS j−1 ],
                                      1 + nsj
                                                                                                             (23)
       where Gs j−1 is the appropriate element of the history hj .

    Requirement (i) states that no matter what happened in the past, Ψ̃ prescribes a path that is a
competitive equilibrium. Requirement (ii) states that at each time j, residents of each state prefer
not to deviate from the equilibrium path prescribed by Ψ̃, taking into account how a deviation
effects contemporaneous utility and also how it affects the future by altering subsequent histories.
Requirement (iii) embodies the limit on the ability to borrow to pay for public spending, and
the repayment schedule on existing debt.
    The definition above allows for arbitrary dependence on histories, including equilibria in
which a deviation by a state triggers responses in other states.
    We focus on Markov equilibria, in which public good provision Gst is independent of the past
and also of the choices and shocks of all other states; Gst is only affected by the contemporaneous
realizations φst , θst , nst .

Proposition 1 A Markov equilibrium (defined above) exists and is unique.

    Proof. The proof is by construction. In the main text, we showed that, if the future provision
of public goods only depends on future realizations of the shocks, then residents will choose Gst
according to equation (6). This choice is unique, and it only depends on the contemporaneous
shocks, verifying the Markov nature of the equilibrium.

C        Derivation of Equation (9)
Suppose that investment is decided k years ahead of time. Let GTOT
                                                               st  be the total stock of public
capital in state s and period t (i.e., GTOT
                                        st  ≡ Gst Nst , where Nst is the population in state s at
time t. We conjecture (and verify) an equilibrium in which GTOT
                                                            st  is independent of the past.
      To solve for the equilibrium, it is useful to rewrite (2), (3), and (4) in total terms, rather than
as per capita quantities:41
                                        GTOT
                                         st  = (1 − δ)GTOT      TOT

                                    TOT
                                   Bst  = (1 + r)BsTOT     TOT
                                                    t−1 + γst  − TstTOT ,                             (25)

and
                                    TstTOT ≥ (1 − x)γst
                                                     TOT
                                                         + (α + r)BsTOT
                                                                     t−1 .                            (26)

      Using the equations above, we can derive the consequences that the voters expect from a
marginal increase in GTOT
                      st  enacted by a vote in period t − k:

    • Marginal benefit of investment in period t:

                                                φst (GTOT
                                                      st  )−σ (Nst )σ−1 ;


    • Increase in total taxes in period t: 1 − x;

    • Decrease in total investment in period t + 1: 1 − δ (due to the conjecture about the nature
        of the equilibrium);

    • Change in total taxes in period t + 1:

                                              (α + r)x − (1 − δ)(1 − x);


    • Change in total taxes in subsequent periods t + j, j > 1:

                                             (α + r)(1 − α)j−2 (δ − α)x.

      Since we already know that the interest rate is constant, we dropped its time subscript here.



                                                        51
   These costs and benefits are exactly the same, independently of the planning horizon; what
changes is the information available to voters when they compute their expected value.
   It is straightforward to see that the probability of moving between t − k and t is irrelevant
from the voters’ perspective: the outcome of the vote will only affect them if they are still in state
at time t, so their vote will maximize utility conditional on this realization. Their first-order
condition will thus be:

Equation (27) takes into account that an individual will pay taxes on a per capita basis.
   As in the main text, we linearize this expression around nst = 0 and θst = 1, and assume an
AR(1) process for nst and θs t+k .

D         Robustness Experiments
The tables that follow show how our results survive to a number of robustness checks.

    • Table 8 uses a different measure of stayers, based on Census data. When we use the Census
         Migration measure, we are able to expand our sample to the years 1959-2007 for the con-
         tiguous states and to 1963-2007 for Alaska and Hawaii.42 The Census asked for information
         on current state of residence and state of residence five years prior. We define movers for
         a given year as one-fifth of the fraction of the population living in a state five years prior
         to the Census and living in a different state in the Census year. We interpolate between
         the years five years prior to consecutive Censuses. For the years following 1995 (data for
         1995 is measured in the 2000 Census), we forecast migration based on state fixed effects,
         state specific time trends, and demographic variables (educational attainment, homeowner-
         ship, urbanization, population, income, poverty rates, and population age structure). The
         correlation between the IRS and Census Mobility measures is .95 through 1995 and .85
         after 1995. This regression confirms our key facts: a weak relationship between population
         growth and spending for all variables except for purchases of land and existing structures,
         and a significant negative relationship between the fraction of stayers and spending (again,
         except for land).

    • We repeat our exercise excluding Alaska and Hawaii (Table 9). While Hawaii is not partic-
         ularly different from other states, Alaska is a large outlier owing to its particular economy
         and geography. Our finding on the relationship between mobility, population growth, and
         capital spending are robust to restricting the sample to the contiguous 48 states. The
         relationship between the fraction of stayers and spending remains negative and signifi-
         cant, albeit somewhat smaller and actually closer to the values predicted by the theoretical
         model.

    • Not all states split responsibilities in the same way between the state and local governments.
  42
       The Alaska and Hawaii data is limited due to the absence of political variables as well as information on
educational attainment in the years leading up to and including 1959, when these states joined the union.


                                                        53
         To check that our results are not driven by systematic variation in this split, Table 10
         repeats our exercise combining state and local spending.43 We do not have separate data
         on purchases of land and structures and equipment at the local level, so we are forced to
         lump the two. When we combine state and local expenditures, capital spending is more
         responsive to population growth, closer to what our theoretical model would predict. The
         coefficient on the fraction of stayers drops, but it remains negative and significant (except
         for the combined land/equipment category); this coefficient too gets closer to the model
         predictions. One other change worth of note is that mobility within the state (INTMIG)
         ceases to be a significant predictor of spending.

    • Table 11 includes net domestic migration and its lags as a separate regressor.44 In our
         model, net migration plays no independent role. However, Rappaport [20] proposes a
         theory where government spending drives net migration, and in this case our results could
         be affected by reverse causation. As we can see from the table, the inclusion of net migration
         has very little effect on our estimates for the coefficients on the fraction of stayers. This
         is not surprising, because net and gross migration are very weakly correlated: in our
         sample, the correlation between stayers and net migration is -0.18. Net migration is more
         closely linked to population growth. Including net migration does have some effect on
         the coefficients for population growth, but the changes show no systematic pattern and
         do not alter our main conclusions. In line with Rappaport’s findings at the local level,
         net migration itself is negatively related to current spending, while no clear relationship
         emerges for capital spending.

    • Besley, Persson, and Sturm [11] argue that political competition is an important determi-
         nant of the mix of state spending. To check that our results are not driven by correlation
         with this omitted variable, we include the measure (labeled POLCOMP) as an additional
  43
       The Census Bureau did not report data on local spending for 2001 and 2003, so we dropped those two years
from the sample.
   44
      Our variable is defined as the ratio of net new comers in a given year from the IRS data to the total population
of the state in the previous year.



                                                         54
         control in Table 12. Data limitations restrict our sample to 1980-2004.45 Our conclusions
         are largely unaffected. The main change is a reduction (in absolute value) in the coefficients
         of stayers on non-highway total spending and construction, to values closer to what our
         theoretical model would predict; the coefficient on purchases of land and existing structures
         increases, but remains imprecisely estimated. These changes are due to the different sam-
         ple period; POLCOMP has very little effect on our coefficients of interest. Our regression
         indirectly confirms Besley, Persson, and Sturm’s findings about POLCOMP: our point es-
         timates indicate that more political competition has a bigger (negative) proportional effect
         on current spending than on capital spending, thus raising the share of spending devoted
         to capital. However, these estimates are not statistically significant given our different
         controls and identification strategy.

    • Finally, we check whether our results survive if we restrict ourselves to within-state variation
         by including state fixed effects; this is done in Table 13. Our coefficients on stayers are
         remarkably robust to this big change in our identification strategy. In contrast, within a
         state, population growth seems to have a more positive effect on capital spending than
         across states, with coefficients closer to what would be predicted by the theoretical model.




  45
       We have POLCOMP up to 2001; since all of our controls are lagged 3 years, in accordance with the procedure
for dealing with implementation lags, this implies that 2004 is the last year of usable data for our spending
variables.
