                                            ABSTRACT

We show that extremely poor, war-affected women in northern Uganda have high returns to a package
of $150 cash, five days of business skills training, and ongoing supervision. 16 months after grants,
participants doubled their microenterprise ownership and incomes, mainly from petty trading. We
also show these ultrapoor have too little social capital, but that group bonds, informal insurance, and
cooperative activities could be induced and had positive returns. When the control group received
cash and training 20 months later, we varied supervision, which represented half of the program costs.
A year later, supervision increased business survival but not consumption.

I       Introduction
The World Bank, the United Nations (UN), and the United States government have made
the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030 a central development goal.1 Since the world’s
poor often live in economies with few firms, anti-poverty programs often try to foster self-
employment. This includes farm enterprises such as raising livestock for sale, and nonfarm
enterprises such as trading or retail. But can the extreme poor be expected to start and
sustain such microenterprises? And what constraints hold them back?
     Two in five of the world’s extreme poor are projected to live in fragile and conflict-affected
states by 2030, yet rigorous evidence on what works in these settings is sparse.2 To help
fill this gap, this paper studies a relatively common approach to relieving extreme poverty,
transfers of human and physical capital, but to a post-war population: the most marginalized
people living in small villages in northern Uganda, following a 20-year war.
     A humanitarian organization, the Association of Volunteers in International Service
(AVSI), identified 1800 poor people, mostly women, in 120 war-affected villages, and tried to
help them start very small but sustainable retail and trading enterprises. AVSI’s Women’s
Income Generating Support (WINGS) program provided people grants of $150 (about $375
in purchasing power parity, or PPP, terms), along with five days of business skills training
and planning, plus ongoing supervision to help implement the plan. The grant was 30 times
larger than the beneficiaries’ baseline monthly earnings.
     An abundance of evidence argues that the average poor person has high returns to capital
and is held back in part by poor access to credit and insurance, and that capital transfers
and insurance products help grow microenterprises and incomes.3 Most of this evidence,
however, comes from people who already have businesses or were selected for their business
aptitude.4 It’s not clear if it applies to the most marginalized and “ultrapoor”—the people
with the lowest incomes, no capital, and limited social networks—especially after war.5
    1
     “Extreme poverty” refers to earning less than the $1.25 per day international poverty line. See Burt,
Hughes and Milante (2014) for a discussion of the goals.
   2
     See Burt, Hughes and Milante (2014) for population projections. For reviews of the evidence see
Blattman and Miguel (2010); Puri et al. (2014).
   3
     For example, see Udry and Anagol (2006); de Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff (2008); Banerjee and Duflo
(2011); Karlan, Knight and Udry (2012); Fafchamps et al. (2014); Blattman, Fiala and Martinez (2014).
   4
     For example, Blattman, Fiala and Martinez (2014) see high returns to a group-based cash transfer
in northern Uganda. But the program targeted young adults with much higher levels of education and
existing business plans for relatively high-skill microenterprises. That program also excluded the two most
conflict-affected districts, where WINGS was implemented.
   5
     On the one hand, returns to capital or other inputs could be greater on the extensive margin than the
intensive one. Indeed there is growing evidence that poor households use cash to start new enterprises and
earn high returns, although little of this evidence comes from the poorest of the poor (Macours, Premand and
Vakis, 2012; Gertler, Martinez and Rubio, 2012; Blattman, Fiala and Martinez, 2014; Bianchi and Bobba,
2013). Returns could also be high in a newly stable political equilibrium, as neoclassical models of growth


                                                     1
     The WINGS program has parallels to “graduation” style programs delivered to hundreds
of thousands of ultrapoor households globally. Graduation programs give a bundle of tem-
porary income support, livestock, livestock training, access to microfinance, supervision, and
life-skills education. On balance, these programs have been successful: several studies show
substantial shifts from casual labor to farm self-employment, and 10 to 40% increases in
household consumption or earnings compared to control groups, lasting at least two to four
years (Bandiera et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015). The WINGS program differed from these
other ultrapoor programs in several dimensions, however, including: the post-war setting;
fewer program components; the focus on petty business; and providing cash rather than
livestock.6 WINGS was also focused on young women.
     We evaluated WINGS by assigning the targeted people to either receive the program
immediately or a year-and-a-half later, randomizing at the village level. Given the extreme
setting, AVSI was reluctant to have a permanent control group—a common concern in hu-
manitarian settings, and one reason humanitarian evaluations are rare. Thus our design
evaluates impacts a few months before the 60 control villages entered the program.
     We also tested the role of social capital in business success: could social capital be
fostered, and would it increase the returns to grants? In poor rural villages, social networks
are a main source of business advice, cooperation, and informal finance.7 For instance, in
microcredit, growing evidence suggests that group lending is helpful not because of joint
liability, but rather because it builds social capital and promotes risk-pooling.8
     To test this, in half of the treatment villages, AVSI returned a couple of months after the
grants (after individual businesses had already been started) to encourage the participants
to form self-help groups, and offered three additional days of training in working together.
The curriculum focused on developing organizational structures, decision-making processes,
leadership, and helping them form a rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA).
     16 months after grants, the standard WINGS program (without group encouragement)
led to large changes in occupation and incomes. 39% of the control group had a nonfarm
predict (Blattman and Miguel, 2010). On the other hand, the ultrapoor could have low returns to capital,
for instance because they lack crucial inputs such as education or business experience, or because they are
vulnerable to expropriation within or outside the family.
    6
      Many in the aid community fear cash can be seized, wasted, or cause harm. They could be right.
Besides the lack of other important inputs, extreme poverty has also been associated with cognitive deficits
that impede investment and raise the risk of temptation spending (e.g. Bertrand, Mullainathan and Shafir,
2004). Among the poorest women, moreover, traditional norms could pressure them to share cash, make
it easy to expropriate them, or hinder their business growth (Field, Jayachandran and Pande, 2010; Duflo,
2012). This is the fundamental reason that AVSI designed WINGS to include training and supervision.

      See Fafchamps (1992); Foster and Rosenzweig (1995); Murgai et al. (2002).

      Feigenberg, Field and Pande (2013) show that encouraging social interaction via group meetings reduces
default on individual loans in India. Giné and Karlan (2014) also show individual liability has little impact
on default in the Philippines.


                                                     2
business, and this rose to 80% among WINGS participants. Employment rose from 15 to
24 hours per week, and cash earnings rose about PPP $1 a day. Since the average person
in the control group earned less than $1 a day, the program doubled earnings. As a result,
a conservative estimate of household consumption rose by almost a third, to roughly PPP
$1.25 per day. Annualized, this impact corresponds to a PPP $465 increase in nondurable
consumption—about a quarter of the PPP $1,946 standard program cost.
    For program participants, the gains were mainly economic. There was little evidence of
changes in physical health, mental health, financial autonomy, or domestic violence. Outside
the household, however, the program increased self-reported social support and community
participation. Participants also reported an increase in resentment and verbal abuse from
some neighbors, however, perhaps due to jealousy, or because they posed competition for
pre-existing traders.
    The group encouragement, meanwhile, increased the frequency and intensity of group
activities. We see no impact on consumption after 16 months, but program participants who
received group encouragement reported double the earnings of those that did not. Interest-
ingly, this was not because their petty trading businesses were larger, more likely to survive,
or more profitable. Rather, the evidence suggests that groups spurred informal finance as
well as labor-sharing and cooperative cash cropping. Group formation also seems to have
mitigated the resentment and abuse from neighbors.
    Ideally we could have randomly varied all program components and measured their re-
turns. This was not possible. But, following the main evaluation, we used the entry of the
control group into the program to investigate the marginal effect of the most expensive com-
ponent: supervision. The supervisory visits provided substantive advice as well as pressure
to implement the business plan, but were more than twice as costly as the grant. When the
control group received WINGS after 20 months, we randomized them individually to receive
the business training and grant plus: (i) no supervisory visits; (ii) two visits (to provide
commitment to invest); or (iii) five visits for both commitment and substantive business
advice.
    A month after grants, but before any potential visits, expecting a visit had an ambiguous
effect on business investment: those assigned to supervision increased investment by some
measures and decreased by others. A year later, the effect of supervision on incomes is also
ambiguous: non-durable consumption is marginally lower among those assigned to visits,
earnings are marginally higher, but neither effect is statistically significant. Supervision,
however, did increase business survival.
    Altogether, these results come with caveats. First, the control group knew they were
on the waitlist, and so anticipation of treatment could affect their behavior. Second, all


                                              3
measures are self-reported. Experimenter demand is a risk, but given the size of impacts
(and the absence of non-economic impacts, where we might expect experimenter demand)
the bias seems unlikely to drive our results. Third, there is mild randomization imbalance
and attrition. Treatment effects, however, are robust to corrections and to missing data
scenarios. Finally, these are 16-month impacts and given the fact that the control group
entered the program, we cannot say whether they persist.
    Nonetheless, WINGS illustrates that the poorest may be able to start and sustain small
enterprises, even in very small, fairly poor communities. Moreover, the 16-month consump-
tion impacts of WINGS are almost identical to the 1- or 2-year impacts of livestock-based
ultra-poor programs, although WINGS was about half as costly. So far the livestock pro-
grams have longer term evidence in their favor, and the sustainability of cash-centric pro-
grams to the very poorest is an open question.9 Even so, studies of cash transfers to the
non-extreme poor show sustained or growing impacts after 4 to 6 years (Blattman, Fiala and
Martinez, 2014; de Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff, 2012a).
    Cash should be much cheaper and easier to deliver than livestock or capital goods, so if
it stimulates employment as well as the accumulation of income-generating assets it could
affect how ultrapoor programs are designed and scaled. This warrants more investigation,
especially in humanitarian settings where cash is becoming more common as it can be dif-
ficult to provide in-kind capital. Also important to investigate are cost-effective forms of
supervision and training.
    Finally, the results support the view that social interactions encourage cooperation, and
that such social capital delivers economic returns. Most social capital is endogenously
formed, and it’s unusual to have experimental variation in local bonds. Echoing Feigen-
berg, Field and Pande (2013) on microcredit, we see that a program that simply encourages
group and ROSCA formation can increase social interactions, enhance social capital, increase
risk-pooling and cooperation, and perhaps even raise incomes. What’s striking is that these
profitable social bonds did not form in the absence of encouragement, and yet were provoked
by a relatively short training. It implies the poor may be social capital constrained as well
as credit constrained, and external intervention seems to help overcome barriers to collective
action.

    Livestock programs sustain gains after 2–4 years, while ultrapoor cash transfer studies have 1–2 years
of evidence so far (e.g. Haushofer and Shapiro, 2013; Macours, Premand and Vakis, 2012).

II     Setting and study participants
Uganda as a whole is a poor but stable and growing country. National income grew roughly
6.5% per year for the two decades prior to this study (Government of Uganda, 2007). A
long-running, low-level insurgency in northern Uganda, however, meant that most of the
north was left out.
    From 1987 to 2006, small bands of rebels conscripted, abused, and stole from civilians
in northern Uganda, especially Kitgum and Gulu districts. Equally devastating was the
Ugandan government’s decision to fight the insurgency by forcibly moving nearly the entire
rural population of Kitgum and Gulu—about two million people—into dozens of displace-
ment camps. The camps were often no more than a few miles from people’s rural homes,
but people generally could not access their farmland during the war. Most households lost
everything—livestock, homes, savings, and household durables—as a result.
    By 2006 the rebels were mostly defeated or pushed out of the country, and by 2007 the
government permitted displaced people to return home and rebuild. The north’s economy
began growing quickly, aided by an increase in demand from a newly peaceful Sudan. The
government started a number of large-scale development programs to help the north catch
up to the rest of the country. Even so, northern Uganda had some of the lowest standards
of living in the world. By 2007, two-thirds of households were unable to meet basic needs
and lived mainly on food aid (Government of Uganda, 2007).
    By 2009, when this study begins, most people had rebuilt their homes and had begun
farming again. Food distribution and other emergency relief had ended. Most rural villagers,
however, were still desperately impoverished.


A     Study sites and participants
AVSI identified 120 villages in the two most war-affected districts, Kitgum and Gulu. Most
villages ranged in size from 350 to 1000 people, with an average population of 699 (about
100 households). The study villages represented about a quarter of the population of the six
rural subcounties where AVSI worked.10
    AVSI held community meetings to describe the program and asked communities to nomi-
nate 20 marginalized villagers, asking that three-quarters be women aged 14 to 30. AVSI staff
   10
      AVSI actively worked in six subcounties—Odek, Lakwana and Lalogi in Gulu and Omiya Anyima,
Namokora and Orom in Kitgum. These have 252 total villages: 84 in Gulu; 168 in Kitgum. AVSI excluded
from the sample villages with fewer than 80 households. AVSI then chose program villages proportional
to parish population. whereby more populous parishes would have a higher number of program villages
(A parish is an administrative unit within the subcountry with five to ten villages). Official population
figures did not exist and estimates were based on 2008 data from AVSI and the UN. We estimate participant
households in treatment villages were less than 2% of households in the subcounty.


                                                   5
interviewed all nominees and selected 10 to 17 participants per village, excluding relatives
of leaders and the least poor.
    Table 1 describes the 120 villages and all 1800 study participants, based on a baseline
survey of participants and each community leader. 26% of villages had a weekly market,
and while on average there were three shops or kiosks selling goods, the median village had
none. Most goods were imported from the district capital and retailed by a handful of shop
owners.
    Outside of traditional occupations (e.g. subsistence agriculture and some casual labor),
main work opportunities came from petty trade and retail, cottage production (e.g. bricks,
charcoal), livestock rearing, and cash crops. These farm and nonfarm microenterprises re-
quired few new skills or education, but they were capital-intensive and had fixed costs of
entry.
    The average participant in the program was female, 27 years old, and had 2.8 years of
education. Half were married or partnered. They reported an average of 15 hours of work
a week in the past month, mainly in their own agriculture. Just 3% did any petty trade or
business.
    In general they were poor with no access to finance. Average cash earnings in the month
before the survey were UGX 8,940 ($4.47 at 2009 market exchange rates). Formal insurance
was unknown, and almost no formal lenders were present in the north at the outset of this
study in 2008. Only 9% of the sample were members of a village savings and loans group.
On average they had UGX 4,860 ($2.42) in cash savings and a nearly equal amount in
debts, usually from family and friends. Just 4% said they could get a loan of $50, which is
unsurprising because of high transaction costs and the near absence of informal or formal
lending institutions. Formal loan terms seldom extended beyond three months, moreover,
with annual interest rates of 100 to 200%. Because of high fees, real interest rates on savings
were typically negative. Given the startup costs of microenterprise, this absence of credit
and insurance was a major barrier to entry.

Effects of the war

The war affected and displaced everyone in the study sample, impoverishing all. Until
about a year before the program, everyone in the village had lived in a nearby displacement
camp for at least three years, with no access to farmland, during which their lands became
overgrown and their houses destroyed. At the time of the WINGS program, households were
reestablishing agriculture for the first time since at least 2003.
    One in five people in our sample were abducted into the armed group at some point,
usually only for a few days to carry looted goods. Long stays with the armed group were less

       Notes: For work hours and income, we report household averages in non-participant households, restricting data to adults
aged 17-40. A household is coded as a trading household if at least one household respondent says he or she regularly sold an
item a year ago, and did not obtain that item from his or her own production, for any items in a list of 35. Individual-level
covariates come from a self-reported survey of all respondents. All variables denominated in UGX and hours were top-censored

common, and only 5% of the sample became fighters or forced to marry a rebel commander.
Abduction and conscription, however, were not necessarily a source of relative poverty. An-
nan et al. (2011) used exogenous variation in conscription to identify the long term effects.
Social acceptance of former conscripts was high, and most people were psychologically re-
silient.11 These findings hold even for the longest-serving females and those who were forcibly
married or bore children. Conscription also had little effect on women’s schooling and labor
market outcomes. Women’s options outside the armed group were not much better than
inside the armed group, since most would not have been schooled or accumulated capital.
Conscripted men, however, were well behind their peers after the war, because they missed
out on opportunities to accumulate physical and human capital.
     In short, the war was so destructive that few young people emerged with any assets or
schooling. At the time of the WINGS program, they were rebuilding their livelihoods from
almost nothing.
  11
    Psychological distress is commonplace, but serious symptoms are concentrated in the minority exposed
to the most violence and with the least social support.


                                                               8
B      Comparison to non-participating villagers
In general, the program successfully targeted the villages poorest, but it’s worth noting
that almost all villagers are very poor by any measure. We do not have data on non-
participants at baseline. Twenty months after the start of the program, however, we surveyed
2,836 non-participant households in treatment and control villages (about 25 from each
village), and sought to interview two working age adults per household, in order to measure
spillovers.12 Table 2 reports summary statistics for participants and non-participants in the
control villages only, in order to compare people in the absence of direct treatment effects.
We distinguish between households that were and were not traders at baseline.
    If we look at similar-aged adults in “non-participant” households, participants have similar
cash earnings, but 23% lower consumption, .63 standard deviations fewer durable consump-
tion assets (e.g. house quality, furniture and household items), and .22 standard deviations
fewer production assets (e.g. livestock or farm tools). Participants also have about half the
education and 61% of non-participants’ work hours. About a third of non-participant house-
holds have at least one adult engaged in trading at baseline, and these tend to be wealthier
than average.


III      Intervention, experimental design, and data
The WINGS program had four components:

Basic skills training Participants received five days of business skills training, ending with
the preparation of a simple business plan. Training was designed for the illiterate and focused
on business planning, sales, marketing, record-keeping, and budgeting (see Appendix A for
the curriculum). Trainers reviewed plans with the participants and returned unsatisfactory
plans for revision. They encouraged participants to consider high cash flow activities that
would diversify their income sources, especially petty trading and retailing.

Cash Once a plan was approved, the participant received a grant of 300,000 Ugandan
shillings (UGX) or $150 at 2009 market exchange rates. The grant was framed as funds to
implement the business plan. AVSI delivered cash in two equal installments about 2 and 6
weeks after training.
  12
    Shortly before Phase 2 disbursement we created village household lists, randomly sampled 25 non-
participant households from each village (excluding the roughly 15 participant households), and sought to
interview two working age adults per household on their economic activities, plus household data on assets
and expenditures. We also collected village prices on a variety of goods. Non-response to the survey was
only 5.5%.


                                                    9
Supervision AVSI trainers traveled four to five times to the villages in the six months
after the grant to provide one-on-one advising and supervision.

Group formation About two months after grants were disbursed, AVSI also offered a
three-day “group dynamics training” that encouraged participants in the village to form self-
help groups that would exchange ideas for improving their petty business and agriculture,
organize savings and credit, and (to a lesser extent) collaborate or cooperate in activities
such as marketing their produce or buying inputs.
    The vast majority of the three days focused on providing information and skills related to
working effectively as a group, including: leader selection, group decision-making, communi-
cation and listening skills, and conflict resolution methods. It applied these skills to the same
topics that were the focus of the five-day business skills training: business planning, saving,
and record-keeping. The difference is that the group dynamics training mostly focused on
how they could adapt these skills when working as a group. The final day focused on how to
organize a savings group, including best practices and record-keeping. Other forms of busi-
ness cooperation, such as joint purchasing and collaborative marketing, were mentioned in
passing as advantages of working in groups, but these production economies of scale received
very little attention. Indeed, AVSI deliberately did not encourage participants to form firms
or cooperatives. This is one reason AVSI offered the group training some weeks after the
individual business plans, grants, and initial investment decisions.
    Groups decided on their own aims and organization, however, and at the end of the
training AVSI helped groups write a “constitution” that formalized the aims, leadership, and
decision-making structure of the group. Appendix A describes the curriculum.

    On average, WINGS cost $860 per person at market exchange rates: $150 for grants;
$125 for targeting and disbursement; $124 for business training; $82 for group dynamics
training; $348 for five supervisory visits; and $31 in other costs. This is equivalent to PPP
$2,150.


A    Phase 1 research design
In Phase 1, we randomized 60 of the 120 villages to receive the WINGS program. The other
60 were randomized to a “waitlist” group (Phase 2) to be treated at least 18 months later.
The participants in the waitlist villages were aware of this treatment status.
   Within these 60 treatment villages in Phase 1, we randomized 30 to receive the group
dynamics training and 30 to no group encouragement. Participants in the 60 control villages



                                               10
were told they would receive the intervention in about 18 to 24 months, called Phase 2.
Figure 1 illustrates the sample, design, and timing.
    We randomized by public draw, to ensure village buy-in and transparency.13 The draw
resulted in a slight imbalance in baseline covariates, reported in Table 1.14 Treatment partic-
ipants were slightly worse off, with lower durable assets, employment, literacy, savings group
memberships, participation in armed groups, and family and community support. The vil-
lages they lived in were also less likely to have a market. A test of joint significance of all
covariates has a p-value of <.001. If anything, this may lead us to understate treatment
effects. To account for possible bias, we will control for these covariates in all treatment
effects estimates and show robustness to difference in difference measures.
    To evaluate Phase 1, we attempted to survey all 1800 participants 20 months after base-
line, 16 months after the first grant (at the median). Attrition was minimal; we tracked
migrants to their current location and found 96.3% (not including three who died). At-
trition is generally not significantly correlated with treatment or baseline covariates (see
Appendix B).15


B      Phase 2 research design
In Phase 2, participants in the 60 control villages received the WINGS program.16 We
used this as an opportunity to evaluate the marginal impact of the highest-cost component,
supervision.17 The first supervisory visit or two was mainly to hold grantees accountable
for implementing their business plan. The later visits were primarily to provide advice. Of
the 904 people in Phase 2, we randomly assigned individuals to receive the cash and basic
training with one of three treatments: (1) no supervisory visits; (2) one to two supervisory
visits, focused principally on commitment to invest; or (3) all five supervisory visits, to
provide commitment but also substantive advice on business management and household
  13
      We gathered village leaders in each district. They drew village names without replacement to be assigned
to Phase 1 or 2. The authors were present for the draw to ensure its validity. We randomized group dynamics
training via computer.
   14
      See Appendix B for all 76 covariates, as well as balance tests for the group dynamics randomization. In
total, 24% of the (non-independent) covariates have p<.10 .In general, the group dynamics randomization
was balanced.
   15
      In addition to these survey data, we collected formal qualitative data to better understand program
experiences, constraints, and mechanisms. Two Ugandan research assistants interviewed 32 randomly se-
lected participants in eight villages three times during and after the program. They followed semi-scripted
questionnaires and recorded, transcribed, and translated all interviews and notes.
   16
      Program changes were minor. AVSI increased grants to 360,000 UGX to account for inflation, and
disbursed grants in a single tranche for efficiency.
   17
      30 of the 60 villages were also randomized to have spouses included in the training, and present at the
grant disbursement, described in a companion paper (Green et al., 2015a).

   To evaluate impacts, we first surveyed Phase 2 participants about a month after the
grant, shortly before the first follow-up. We intended this short-run survey to assess how
participants’ actions and investments varied with expectations of any supervision. We sur-
veyed them again about a year after the grants to study the impacts of actual supervision.
Again, attrition was low; we found 95% at the 1-month survey and 96% at the 1-year survey.


IV       Empirical strategy
We estimate intent-to-treat (ITT) effects via the OLS regression:

(1)                            Yij = θTj + δT DjT + δT̄ DjA + Xij β + εij

where Y is an outcome for participant i in village j, T is an indicator for treatment (e.g.
assignment to Phase 1 versus Phase 2), X is a vector of controls that includes a district fixed
effect and all baseline covariates, including lagged outcomes.19 Robust standard errors are
clustered by village.
    The terms DjT and DjA are weighted measures of distance from the village to other
treatment villages and all other evaluation villages. We include them to account for and
estimate potential spillovers from participants in treatment villages to those in wait-list
villages, which could otherwise bias treatment effects. The average wait-list village has
at least five treatment villages within 10km, and many villages share markets. We can
identify and control for cross-village externalities using exogenous variation in the local
density of treatment villages generated by the randomization, conditional on the density of
all evaluation villages in the sample (Miguel and Kremer, 2004).20
    There are two other threats to identification. One is anticipation of treatment. If par-
ticipants delayed investments by one to two years in expectation of a grant, this would lead
us to overstate treatment effects. Alternatively, the expectation of a future grant could
  18
     We randomized via computer at the individual level, blocking by village. The groups are relatively
balanced, with balance tests reported in Appendix B. Before Phase 2 began, 57 of the 904 participants
assigned to Phase 2 had died or left the village and were no longer eligible. In February 2011, AVSI replaced
these participants with others from the same village following the same nomination and screening procedures
described above.
  19
     See Appendix B for all baseline covariates. Also, note that baseline and endline variables denominated
in UGX or hours can have a long upper tail. Extreme values will be influential in any treatment effect, and
we therefore top-code them at the 99th percentile.
  20
     That is, DjT is a random variable conditional on DjA . Previous papers estimate distance measures as the
number of villages within a fixed radius. We use a slightly less dichotomous measure, described in Appendix
D, using road network distances. In practice these spillovers appear to be negligible and so they do not
materially change our conclusions (Appendix D).


                                                     13
act as a form of insurance and increase investment, leading us to understate impacts. For
instance, Bianchi and Bobba (2013) show that expectation of conditional cash transfers in
Mexico increase microenterprise investment by relaxing an insurance rather than a liquidity
constraint. Our design does not allow us to say what these anticipation effects might be.
    A second threat is that, since outcomes are self-reported, we will overestimate the impact
if experimenter demand leads treated subjects to overreport well-being, or if the controls
under-report outcomes in the (mistaken) belief that they could be dropped from eligibility.
We feel these biases are unlikely to drive our results for a few reasons. Most of all, as we will
see below, we observe no impact on variables such as empowerment or health, meaning that
incentives to misreport would have to be confined to economic outcomes alone. Related to
this, misreporting would have to be highly systematic within economic outcomes: income
and employment was collected through more than 100 questions across 25 activities, and
assets and expenditures were calculated from 150 questions.


V      Results
A      Impacts of the full intervention
95% of the treated made initial business plans for the buying and selling of goods, and the
remainder made plans for butchery, livestock, or other business.21 As we will see, however,
over time their investments diversified into more non-farm businesses and also livestock.
    While the capital was seen as crucial to starting their enterprises, most participants also
reported that the training, business planning, and supervision were valuable. 16 months
after the grants, 98% said that AVSI staff were important in planning their business, 77% of
people said the supervisory visits made them somewhat anxious, and 94% would recommend
the supervisory visits. Yet this advising was not too constricting: 95% said they felt free to
spend the grant as they saw fit.
    Table 3 reports impacts 16 months after grants.22 We start by focusing on the program
without group dynamics training.
    At baseline, only 3% of the sample reported any non-farm business, a category that
includes mainly petty trading and cottage production, but excludes agricultural enterprise
and livestock-related work (Table 1). These non-farm businesses grew substantially in the
  21
     96% of people assigned to treatment received the training and grant in Phase 1. The main reasons for
not receiving a grant were death or migration, in which case someone outside the study sample received the
program instead.
  22
     We focus on occupational choice, employment levels, and incomes. This focus is in line with the model
in Appendix C.

20 months after the baseline survey. In control villages, half of the participants eligible for
the program say they attempted to start some nonfarm business since baseline, and 39%
have some form of non-farm business at the endline survey—an increase of 36 percentage
points. This investment could be an anticipation effect of the future grant (since they will
enter Phase 2 a few months after the endline, reducing the risk of investments) in which case
treatment effects understate the effect of the WINGS program. Alternatively, the investment
and enterprise start-up could reflect the rise in business we would expect as people recover
from an adverse shock. In principle, the control group could delay some investment in
anticipation of the grant, though this would mean delaying for nearly two years. If so, we
overestimate the effect of the WINGS program.
    Nonetheless, there are even greater changes in treatment villages. Nearly every partici-
pant tried to start a nonfarm enterprise, and 79% have one at endline—a doubling compared
to the control group. We see a large shift in occupation choice towards nonfarm enterprise,
mainly wholesale and retail trade, kiosks, and shops, but also including some services.
    As a result, nonfarm hours of work in the treatment group double compared to controls,
rising from about 5 to 11 per week. But there is no crowding out of other activities, as the
participants were generally underemployed beforehand. Farm hours actually rise compared
to controls, from about 9.5 hours per week in the control group to about 13 with treatment.
Most of this increase comes from increased hours caring for livestock, as ownership of cattle,
sheep, goats and pigs more than doubles.
    We have three measures of income. The first is cash earnings in the past month, in 2009
UGX. Cash earnings are noisy, subject to seasonality, and will understate income by omitting
home production. Thus we also emphasize two measures of permanent income. One is an
index of 33 durable assets for consumption purposes (including housing quality, furniture,
and household items), standardized to have mean zero across all survey rounds, and hence
measures asset changes over time. This is commonly used as a proxy for consumption (Filmer
and Scott, 2008). Unfortunately we do not have asset values.
    The other measure is estimated total household consumption of 57 goods in the past
month, including food, small household items, communications, transport, and so forth.23
This is a partial list of goods, and may understate true consumption, especially because we
do not have durable asset prices and cannot impute consumption of durables. Of course it is
possible that the consumption measure overstates the value of home-produced items because
of quality differences. We also consider a family index of all three measures.
  23
     This abbreviated approach follows Beegle et al. (2012). Some items (such as food) are asked with a
three-day recall period, some items (such as communications are transport are asked with a one or two week
period, and larger non-durable spending (such as festivals, etc) are asked with a recall of several months.
All items are then adjusted to monthly totals and added.


                                                    16
    The baseline was run at a time of intensive planting and weeding, shortly before the lean
season began. The Phase 1 endline was run at a time of planting and harvesting at the
outset of a dry season, during which dry season crops are produced and nonfarm activities
such as brick-making are common. Major activities include the sale of crops and animals for
festivals and payment of school tuition fees. We see incomes rise from baseline to endline
partly because of this seasonality, but also because the 20 months from baseline to endline
were a time of increasing incomes and productivity.
    Durable assets in control villages rose .75 standard deviations since baseline. Their
cash earnings rose by two thirds, from UGX 8,940 per month (about $4.50 at 2009 market
exchange rates) to UGX 15,530 ($7.72), while hours of work stayed steady. We do not have
non-durable consumption data at baseline.
    The WINGS program leads to large increases in all three income measures, by .46 stan-
dard deviations overall. This includes a 66% increase in monthly cash earnings relative to
the control group, though this is just UGX 10,315 ($5.16) in absolute terms. Durable con-
sumption assets rise by .32 standard deviations. Non-durable consumption rises 29% relative
to the control group, UGX 31,019 per month, or about $15.50 at market exchange rates.24
Note this is a total household level measure of consumption, and there are 6.9 members in
the average household.
    This consumption treatment effect is three times the earnings treatment effect, which
could either reflect a number of factors besides measurement error: low seasonal earnings;
earnings that are reinvested in other household members’ enterprises or home-produced
forms of consumption (e.g. products from livestock); or the consumption of some of the
saved grant.
    Because no income measure is perfect, this introduces uncertainty into the true effect on
poverty. But if we use $5.16 per month as a lower bound and $15.50 as an upper one (about
$13 and $39 in PPP terms) this is indisputably a large impact on income in absolute and
relative terms.
    We also have an index of 19 production-related durables, mainly livestock, farm equip-
ment, and vocational tools (e.g. sewing machines). These are not included in the con-
sumption durables. These investments rise .4 standard deviations, primarily from livestock
purchases—.27 more cattle, 2 more fowl, and 2 more other animals such as goats, sheep, or
pigs (Appendix D). Hence profits are being reinvested in productive assets.
    Food security improves slightly as a result of this increase in incomes and enterprise.
Times going hungry in the past week fall from .2 to .1, and the number of meals per day
rises from 1.76 to 1.82. Since the endline was not run in the lean season, the effects may be
 24
      We cannot reject equality of treatment effects by gender (not shown).


                                                     17
muted. The bulk of earnings seems to go into assets, savings, and non-food consumption.
For instance, savings more than tripled, increasing UGX 107,344 ($54).
    Two concerns are bias arising from baseline imbalance and systematic attrition. The re-
sults, however, are robust to exclusions of the baseline covariates, a differences-in-differences
ITT estimate controlling for other baseline covariates, and also relatively extreme attrition
bounds (see Appendix D).

Comparison to non-participants

We can also see how WINGS affects the position of program participants in the community
by comparing them to non-participants in control villages. Figure 2 depicts the distribution
of the standardized income index for (i) participants in treatment villages, (ii) participants in
control villages (i.e. those nominated for the program), and (iii) adults from non-participant
households in the control villages, divided into households that did and did not engage
in petty trading at baseline. Comparing distributions, we see that treatment brings the
ultrapoor nearly past the income levels of non-trading households, but not past the income
levels of traders. In control villages, means are -.36 among participants, -.06 among non-
trading non-participants, and .59 among trading non-participants. Participants in treatment
villages have a mean of .02.

Within-village spillovers

About 10% of village households received WINGS, meaning WINGS provided a large cash
influx into the village. Most participants entered petty trading, and so we might wonder
about the effect of new entrants on prices or pre-existing traders in treatment villages (es-
pecially given that the median village has no shops).25 Comparing treatment and control
villages, prices of imported and produced/exported goods both fell a slight amount (.05 and
  25
    If the local retail market is not perfectly competitive (e.g. due to liquidity constraints serving as entry
barrier), a program that promotes petty trading should drive down the price of imported goods by increasing
competition. Cunha, De Giorgi and Jayachandran (2011) find some evidence that imperfect competition
partly explains the price effects of transfers in rural Mexico. This would benefit consumers, but potentially
decrease the profits of existing retail sellers, leading them to shift occupations and potentially lose income.
Also, as in Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2012), new entrepreneurs could supply less labor to the market, more
labor to their own business, and may even demand labor from the market instead. This will push up market
wages. Given that most people in northern Ugandan villages are not fully employed, most enterprises are
owner-operated, and there is a limited market for casual labor, we did not expect to see a significant change
in wages. At the same time, to the extent that higher earnings increases participants’ consumption, it
could create a countervailing effect on prices, diminishing any decline. Studies of Mexican conditional cash
transfer programs find that the transfers increase consumption of both cash recipients and program-ineligible
households (Hoddinott and Skoufias, 2004; Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009). Higher demand can increase
prices as a result, especially in more remote locales (Cunha, De Giorgi and Jayachandran, 2011).

.09 standard deviations, not statistically significant), potentially because increased trade de-
creased the market power of existing traders and brought prices closer to the competitive
equilibrium. We present these results in detail in Appendix 5.
     We can also compare non-participants in treatment villages to non-participants in control
villages (with the caveat that within villages participants were not randomly selected). Over-
all, despite the size of the program, there are limited spillovers to markets or non-participant
households. We see no effect on the incomes or occupational choice of non-participant house-
holds, although if we look only at pre-existing traders we see a slight shift from petty trading
to casual and agricultural work, with incomes holding more or less steady.


B    Impacts of group formation
Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 report the impacts of receiving the group encouragement. There
is no evidence of an impact on business start-up, occupational choice, and levels of work.
By one measure, though, group formation increased incomes. With group formation and
training, the earnings treatment effect is more than double the size of the WINGS program
without the group intervention. Durable assets and non-durable consumption, however, are
not much higher. Overall, because of the earnings impact, The income index is .15 standard
deviations greater, but significant only at the 10% level.
    We thus treat the earnings effect with caution. The magnitude is large enough, however,
that it’s worth exploring potential reasons. The evidence suggests that informal insurance
and cooperative activities (especially farming) play a role.
    Table 4 reports ITT estimates for various group interactions. Two thirds of the control
group are members in a community group of some kind, from water and school committees
to savings and farming groups. Being in a treatment village without group encouragement
increases group membership by 12.8 percentage points, and the group formation treatment
nearly doubles this effect. The people in group formation villages go from being in 1.7 groups
to 2.9.
    Treatment without group encouragement increases the frequency of meeting with a
group. People in control villages meet with their “most important group” (not necessar-
ily the WINGS-identified group) 1.4 times a month. This rises to about 1.8 times a month
with the standard WINGS program, and to 2.4 times with the group dynamics training.
Meetings are principally for savings-related activities or communal farming, and seldom for
petty business-related activities.
    The group is more likely to save together and lend to one another—in effect providing
a form of informal insurance. The group dynamics training leads to an increase in loans to

and from other households, but no significant change in transfers (which do not have to be
repaid). Total debts rise as a result of group dynamics to almost double the control level of
debts.
    Communal farming is one of the most commonplace forms of economic cooperation—
people pool their labor and either assist each other on one another’s plots, or farm a new
plot collectively for cash or own consumption. Control villagers meet 1.3 times a month for
farming, and this rises by almost two thirds with WINGS and group dynamics training. We
do not have a measure of total cooperative farming hours, but note that with WINGS alone,
earnings from the last harvest falls by UGX 33,294 (about $18) compared to the control
group, perhaps because petty trading crowds out these activities. But there is no decrease
in the group dynamics trained villages.


C      Health, social relations, and empowerment
Health Table 5 reports non-economic program impacts. There is little change in an index
of physical health measures.26 But of the three people who died between baseline and endline,
all were control group members. This translates to a .5% decrease in mortality, significant
at the 10% level.27

Social and community participation and status Increased income and employment
is associated with greater social support, community participation, but also community
hostility, according to several index measures.28 We see little change in an index of three
questions on the quality of family relationships, but we see a .2 standard deviation increase
in seven forms of social support received in the past month (such as someone comforting you
when you are feeling sad); and a .16 standard deviation increase in five forms of community
participation (such as speaking out at community meetings or being a community leader).
    But program participants (at least those who did not receive the group dynamics train-
ing) were more likely to report disputes with neighbors or verbal abuse from others. Our
qualitative interviews, however, suggest they were targets of jealously or resentment from
a small number of other households in the village, rather than the village at large. Group
formation and training may have insulated marginalized women from such abuse.
  26
      It is a standardized index of days ill, a subjective “overall” health question, and three activities of daily
living (walking a distance, carrying a heavy load, and working on a farm). See Appendix D for component
treatment effects.
   27
      Also, as shown by Green et al. (2015b), there is also no change in mental health, as measured by an
index of 35 symptoms of depression and distress.

      Means and treatment effects for individual components are available in Appendix D.

Empowerment Finally, we see little evidence that enhanced business activity and incomes
increased reports of empowerment. We ask all subjects about their autonomy in household
financial decisions, such as whether they can decide how to spend their pocket money, use
their earnings to buy clothes without permission, or have a say in the purchase of large
assets in the household.29 This autonomy measure increases by .08 standard deviations (not
statistically significant).30 We also asked women with a partner at endline about aspects
of their relationship.31 There is almost no change in self-reported physical and emotional
abuse by the partner.32 And, if anything, women actually report an increase in the degree of
control their spouse asserts over their finances and freedoms of movement and association.
The husband increased tendencies to control contact outside the home and also demands or
seizes some of the women’s newfound earnings (see Appendix D). At the same time, women
report a .18 standard deviation increase in the quality of the relationship, feeling more free
to express their opinions and reporting a healthier relationship. Overall, these results paint a
picture of husbands who encourage but then control their wife’s business earnings, in return
for weak increases in purchasing autonomy.


D      Impacts of supervision
In Phase 2, when control villages received the program, we surveyed participants about grant
use and future expectations a month after they received it (a few weeks before the first follow-
up visits), and again a year later. Table 6 reports 1-month treatment effects of expecting any
follow-up, and Table 7 reports 12-month treatment effects of 2 visits (supervision without
advice) and 5 visits (supervision with extended advice).

One-month impacts People appear to have believed their treatment assignment: only
10% of the “no follow up” group said they expected a visit whereas 98% of those assigned to

     For women alone the result is significant at the 10% level.
  31
     Treated women were more likely to answer these questions because they were slightly more likely to be
married at endline, principally because of new marriages rather than any change in divorce rates. This could
introduce positive or negative selection from “marginal marriages”. We are interested in spousal abuse and
relations as an outcome, and so the current results including selection are relevant. Alternatively, we could
confine our analysis to the subset of women reporting partners at baseline. These results are not shown, but
in general abuse and marital control are lower (though not significantly so) implying the marginal marriages
are slightly better quality on average than baseline ones.
  32
     See Green et al. (2015a) for a more detailed study of intimate partner violence in this setting. Note,
however, that abuse is reported by fewer than a quarter of women, and so is probably under-reported. Even
so, the effect of treatment is close to zero and so even significant underreporting is unlikely to affect the
basic conclusion, so long as it is not significantly correlated with treatment.

any follow-ups did.33 As in Phase 1, participants also expressed independence and control
over the funds. For instance, 94% of the no supervision group said they felt free to spend
the grant how they wished, and 80% said they could deviate from the business plan. An
index of 7 such measures of autonomy fell by .17 standard deviations with supervision. With
or without supervision, however, there is little evidence of diversion of the grant or social
pressure to share it.34
    Expecting supervision has a modest impact on investment, at least by some measures.
First, we asked participants to categorize how they spent the grant. Second, we sum all
investment-related expenses in the last month from an expenditure module. Using the grant
allocation measure, people have saved or not spent 54% of the grant and reported almost no
spending on celebrations and gifts, whether they expected supervision or not. But those ex-
pecting a visit increased their share of the grant spent on business investment by 5 percentage
points, reducing the share spent on durables (e.g. homes or livestock).
  33
     AVSI followed through on this assignment: none of the “no follow-up” people were visited, and 91% of
those assigned to two or five follow ups reported receiving the correct amount.
  34
     We asked participants how much of the grant they had to give to household members and other com-
munity members. In total this was typically less than 1% of the grant, and expecting follow-up had little
impact on the amount.


                                                           25
    By the expenditure survey, however, follow-up has little effect on the amount reported
spent on business items. One reason could be that money is fungible, and while expenditures
in the days following the grant might have fallen more heavily on durables the participants
may have made up the investment shortfall by spending other earned income on the relevant
materials for their business.

One-year impacts Table 7 reports the impacts of supervision a year after grants. We
conducted the survey during a time of wet season planting and the beginning of the main
harvest, at the closing of a lean season.
    Two supervisory visits increase the likelihood someone is operating a business by 11
percentage points (19%), and hours of nonfarm work per week by 2.2 hours (43%). The
three further visits lead to slight, not statistically significant increases.
    Incomes are .024 standard deviations higher as a result of the two visits, and .037 standard
deviations higher from five visits. Neither result is statistically significant.35 Compared to
those with no visits, those with two visits have nearly a quarter higher cash earnings. Overall,
cash earnings are low because of the season. This is one reason we focus on measures of
permanent income, including durable assets and non-durable consumption, where we see no
significant increase with supervision.
    We also tested whether supervision has greater impact on the most present-biased or least
autonomous individuals. We measured future orientation using incentivized games and self-
reported survey questions. We also use a composite measure of three self-reported financial
autonomy questions. We interact these baseline measures with treatment in Appendix D.
The future orientation level and interaction have the expected sign (i.e. more investment
and earnings) though the autonomy measure does not. None are statistically significant, but
the coefficients on treatment–which represents the effect of treatment on the present-biased
and less autonomous–are larger and more statistically significant than in Table 7.


E      Rate of return on the program
We lack the long term data to do a full cost-effectiveness analysis, but in Table 8 we imagine
the simple case where the increase in income is permanent, and calculate a simple internal
rate of return (IRR) given program costs. Our preferred measure is our estimate of non-
durable consumption. We also report IRR calculations for the lower earnings treatment
effect, although earnings probably understate returns because it ignores other household
  35
    Given sample size, we estimated we would require income increases of .15 or greater to have 80%
statistical power.

members, non-cash earnings, and the proportion of the grant that went into savings or
durable assets.
    The full WINGS program has an internal rate of return of roughly 24% using total
household non-durable consumption. Since we used an abbreviated consumption measure,
this is probably an underestimate of the true effect. This consumption-based return is
similar with or without group encouragement, since the impact and cost rise more or less
proportionally.36 If we use the social discount rate of 5% commonly used by the World Bank
and IMF, the present value of the consumption treatment effect is nearly five times the cost
of the program.
    By way of comparison, the six livestock-based graduation programs evaluated by Banerjee
et al. (2015) had IRRs ranging from 2% to 24% two years after the program, with an average
IRR of 8%. Total consumption benefits were about 2.3 times as great as total costs of that
program. The graduation programs have an additional year of data, however, and so we can
be more confident in the sustainability of its gains.
    Finally, despite the fact that supervisory visits represent about half of program costs, we
cannot reject a negative or zero return. The sign of the IRR for supervisory visits is ambigu-
ous, however, because the treatment effects of supervision on earnings and consumption run
in different directions, and were in neither case statistically significant. The IRR is negative
for the preferred consumption measure. It’s possible, however, that supervision pays off in
the longer term since business survival rates are higher.


VI      Discussion and conclusions
These results show that a package of $150 cash ($375 in PPP terms), five days of business
training, and ongoing supervision led to a doubling of new non-farm enterprises and a sig-
nificant rise in incomes among extremely poor and conflict-affected villagers, most of whom
were women who had never operated such an enterprise before.
    Second, the results show that simply encouraging people to form self-help groups—
centered around communal savings, lending, and work—was enough to boost incomes. By
some measures (such as consumption) this benefit was proportional to the cost. By other
measures (monthly earnings) the benefit was more than proportional. Either way, it suggests
that the poorest were not simply constrained by a lack of capital, credit, and insurance. Social
interactions among the marginalized were simple to encourage and this stimulated valuable
labor- and risk-sharing.
  36
    If we use the earnings treatment effects, the IRRs are lower but still large and positive: 8% without
group encouragement and 16% with it.

    Finally, by some measures, supervising how participants spent the grant strengthened
their incentives and commitment to invest. We see no evidence that supervision increased
long-run performance, however, since the impact on income by some measures (such as
consumption) was negative, and by other measures (earnings) was positive, but in neither
case was it statistically significant after one year. We were not able to test the effects of a
grant with or without supervision against a pure control group in Phase 1 of the study, which
is an unfortunate limitation. We also only have one-year data on the impacts of supervision.
Nonetheless, given that supervision costs 2–3 times as much as the grant itself, the impacts
are surprisingly ambiguous.
    The returns to streamlining programs such as WINGS are potentially large, potentially
allowing more marginalized people to benefit for the same level of aid spending. For instance,
targeting and disbursement were nearly as costly as the grant itself, yet participants were not
much different than non-participants in the village who were not already traders. Moreover,
mobile banking technologies are cheaper and becoming available in the region. Finally,
the last three to five visits cost more than the grant itself, but the returns to additional
supervision appear to be diminishing at best.
    Reducing these costs could have high returns. For instance, a hypothetical program
that delivered similar impacts for half to two-thirds the cost could have a 35–55% internal
rate of return.37 It’s impossible to say what would happen to program impacts from such
cost-cutting, but given the estimates in Table 8 it is difficult to imagine that impacts would
fall proportionately to costs. Given the growing amount of cash-based programming in
humanitarian and development settings, this proposition demands testing.


A      Comparisons to other ultrapoor programs
It’s difficult to compare this program to the alternatives without randomized, head-to-head
comparisons, but the impacts of WINGS compare favorably to evidence on transfers of
livestock and unconditional cash, at least within the timeframe we can evaluate with our
design.

“Graduated” ultra-poor programs provide in-kind capital, such as livestock, along with
training and other services, such as temporary income support. The fact that the WINGS
participants invested much of their microenterprise profits in livestock suggests that animals
are important investments and stores of value. Yet the fact that the poorest chose to make
  37
    For instance, if targeting and disbursement costs could be limited to 10% of the cost of grants (a cost
reached in the Kenya GiveDirectly experiment, as discussed by Haushofer and Shapiro (2013)) and if there
were merely 1–2 supervisory visits, the average program cost would be half of the current amount.


                                                    30
these investments on their own, plus the relatively high returns to petty business, also suggest
that the ultrapoor can make forward-looking, profitable investment choices with some basic
assistance.
    Graduated programs have more and longer-term evidence in their favor than cash-based
programs, however, with studies showing 10 to 40% increases in consumption or earnings
over two to four years (Banerjee et al., 2010; Bandiera et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015).
The 16-month impacts of WINGS are comparable to the upper end of this range using an
abbreviated consumption measure. We cannot say if the WINGS impacts persist, but several
cash transfer studies with non-extreme poor demonstrate steady or increasing 4 to 6 year
impacts (Blattman, Fiala and Martinez, 2014; de Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff, 2012a).38

Unconditional cash transfers lie at the other extreme. This is the approach taken by
GiveDirectly in Kenya. Results from a randomized control trial of grants of one-time transfers
of $400 and $1500 (in PPP terms) show high returns to investment in household durables
after an average of about seven months, and large short-term increases in consumption
(Haushofer and Shapiro, 2013). It remains to be seen if these returns persisted, as there is
some indication they decline over the seven months.


B      Mechanism
Why might WINGS have had such large impacts on income? To generate investment and
high returns, programs such as WINGS must help overcome some constraint. Otherwise the
ultrapoor in our sample would already be operating at their efficient scale, and a cash influx
would not be invested in such a way as to generate high returns.39 Four of the most common
constraints in the literature are: lack of credit, imperfect insurance, low business knowledge
(or skill) levels, and present bias. Most anti-poverty interventions implicitly or explicitly
target one or more of these.
    While all these constraints undoubtedly play a role, the circumstantial evidence points
to the importance of cash and group encouragement relieving a credit constraint. First,
credit constraints in northern Uganda were extreme. As we noted in Section II, participants’
ability to borrow before the program was almost non-existent. Just 4% of our sample said
they could get a loan of $50, and those loans were short term and typically carried interest
rates in excess of the business returns we observe. The cash relieved this constraint directly,
  38
      Note that, like WINGS, none of these cases are truly unconditional cash transfers, as most cash transfers
are labelled or involve some selection, such as preparation of a business plan.
   39
      See Appendix C for a formal model of occupational choice under various constraints, and a proof of the
efficient scale argument.



                                                      31
obviously, but group formation also had significant effects on the formation of ROSCAs and
the incidence of borrowing. Group formation may also have increased informal insurance
(though since the main effect of group formation was on inter-household loans rather than
transfers, insurance is difficult to separate from increased access to credit).40
    The success of the group encouragement program component is intriguing. The impacts
on income are ambiguous but the effects on behavior are not. It illustrates that social capital
of various forms was important and may not always form without third-party encouragement.
Our design probably understates the importance of group encouragement, moreover, since
some of the success of the core intervention, without formal group encouragement, was
surely due in part to the group encouragement implicit in the group-based training and
other elements of the program design. There are close parallels to findings by Feigenberg,
Field and Pande (2013), who show that encouraging social interaction via group meetings
reduced default on individual loans in India. It seems that encouraging group and ROSCA
formation can increase social interactions, enhance social capital, increase risk-pooling and
cooperation, and raise incomes.
    Finally, the training and follow-up provided business advice and information. Most of the
people in our sample had little experience in microenterprises in general or petty trading in
particular. Moreover, the positive effect of two initial supervisory visits (by some measures, at
least) is consistent with the hypothesis that at least a subset of people are time-inconsistent.
Thus skills training and supervision cannot be separated from the effects of credit constraints
and low social capital. Even so, the training and supervision cost four times as much to
deliver as the grant, and six times as much as the group dynamics training. Also, a review
of more than a dozen evaluations of business skills training fails to find that it passes a
cost benefit test, at least on its own (McKenzie and Woodruff, 2012). Given the prevalence
of training and supervision components in other programs, and their obvious cost, a clear
experimental test of their efficacy with cash (or other capital transfers) is important.
  40
     It’s unlikely that a single cash transfer relieved the insurance constraint. Bianchi and Bobba (2013) show
that knowledge of future cash transfers can increase current entrepreneurship because future transfers insure
against risky enterprise income. In the program they study, however, households knew they would receive
regular transfers over several years, whereas in our case people receive a grant only once and in the very
near future. Furthermore, relieving an insurance constraint is only consistent with high returns to capital
if the petty business is significantly more risky than traditional occupations. We asked respondents about
expected variance in incomes, and found that even though treated people expect more volatile incomes in
the future, their lowest expected income after the program is twice as high as in the control group. We asked
people to estimate their highest, median, and lowest incomes in the coming year. The difference between
highest and lowest expectation increases by two thirds but their lower bound doubles (Appendix Table D.2).
Qualitatively, our interviews also suggested that subsistence farming is perceived to be as or more risky than
petty trade, if only because petty trade has higher cash flow and plentiful local markets.




                                                      32
C      Generalizability
How generalizable are these results? The post-conflict context in which WINGS was imple-
mented could mean that returns to capital are higher than elsewhere: low levels of initial
competition, scarce capital, and low financial development, all within a national economy
that is growing as it adjusts to a politically stable equilibrium.41 On the other hand, we
observe similar impacts in non-conflicted regions, whether from the graduation program
evaluations mentioned above, or microenterprise programs elsewhere in Uganda.42
    In the event that post-conflict arenas do offer higher returns, however, there is unfor-
tunately no shortage of refugees, displaced persons, disaster victims, and conflict-affected
populations. Our results suggest that cash-centric ultrapoor programs could reduce extreme
poverty in such settings, in addition to the stable contexts where they are more familiar.
This is useful to know, since with logistical and funding challenges, the UN and other donors
are turning to cash as a main form of support for complex emergencies and humanitarian
settings, such as cash support to the millions of Syrian refugees across the Middle East.
    The matter is unsettled. Given the potential scalability and cost-effectiveness of cash,
and the huge number of extreme poor, what is needed most is a multi-country trial, ideally
one that evaluates the returns to additional components (such as training) and pits cash
transfers head-to-head with other asset transfer strategies.

A      Training programs: Aims and curricula
A.1      Business skills training
The stated objectives of the business skills training were to increase basic knowledge and
skills of business management, to develop confidence in enterprise initiation and management,
to help participants assess their own capabilities and motivation in entrepreneurial careers,
and to strengthen and develop business skills. The training was adapted from the CARE-
Uganda Ecodev projects training manual which is based on CARE Bangladesh’s Small
Economic Activity Development Sector and Rural Maintenance Program. The program
manual is available at http://chrisblattman.com/documents/policy/WINGS.
Business.Skills.Training.Manual.pdf.
    Training and subsequent follow-up visits were led by AVSI resident field officers (RFOs),
full time professional staff of the NGO. RFOs typically had tertiary education in social
work, the slight majority were men, and most had at least a few years of experience on
similar interventions. AVSI trained them in providing business support as well as psycho-
logical and social support. They were based in field offices at the sub-county level. Prior
to administering the training, each RFO had participated in a two-week course led by an
external facilitator. RFOs were trained using the Participatory Rural Approach Manual and
the Community Resilience and Dialogue (CRD) Manual, aimed for literate and non-literate
persons, respectively. Training time was divided equally between each training manual.
    During this business skills training, participants were asked to address five key questions:
a) Can I operate this IGA? b) Will people buy my products? c) Is the IGA profitable? d) How
much money do I need to start and operate the IGA? e) Will the income from the IGA when
added to other family income, be enough to pay household incomes? These key questions
were practically presented to participants through lectures, small group discussion, group
games, storytelling, dramatizations and role-playing by participants, large group sharing of
experiences, and drawings. Participants were also constantly asked to recite the five key
questions that they have to ask themselves as they think about starting their businesses.
After the training, participants were given two weeks to develop a business plan, at which
point AVSI staff would return to review plans individually.
    The curriculum outline was as follows:
    1. Business identification strategy and start-up process

       (a) Business identification games

                                               i
   (b) Characteristics of an entrepreneur or good business person
    (c) Steps to become a businessperson
   (d) Business experience sharing

2. Business management

   (a) Constraints on business growth and performance
   (b) Advantages and disadvantages of being in business
    (c) Importance of monitoring activities and progress, avoiding delays and taking
        timely corrective actions
   (d) Sales and sales promotion
    (e) Choosing location and prices

3. Whether to sell on cash or credit

   (a) What are credit sales?
   (b) Advantages and disadvantages of credit

4. Financial management

   (a) Reasons for saving
   (b) Structure of a group savings system
    (c) Reasons for a credit system

                                           ii
      (d) Structure of a group credit system

A copy of the training manual is available from AVSI USA on request (http://www.
avsi-usa.org/).


A.2     Group dynamics training
AVSI did not typically encourage women to form support groups. Prior to the study, however,
our qualitative work suggested that receiving training and grants could strengthen bonds
among the beneficiaries in a village and induce them to cooperate, share ideas, and informally
save together or insure one another.
    The group dynamics training took place over three days, several weeks or months after
grant disbursement. The program manual is available at http://chrisblattman.com/
documents/policy/WINGS.Group.Dynamic.Training.Manual.pdf.
    AVSI intended for group members to exchange business ideas (including in agriculture),
to organize savings and credit, and to collaborate or cooperate in economic activities such
as marketing their produce or buying their inputs. The stated importance of groups, for
instance, emphasized on the first day of training, included the following:

   • Farmers learn from each other

   • Farmers can market their produce and buy inputs together

   • Groups ease organizing demonstrations

   • Groups help to organize saving and credit for farmers

   • Groups simplify interpersonal communication among members

   • Groups are powerful in changing behaviors, attitude and values

   • Groups can be used for decision making, negotiation and bargaining

   • Groups are a door for new innovation

The stated goals of the training present AVSI’s mechanism to do so:

   • To enable members acquire basic skills in leadership and management of a group

   • To instill the spirit of good communication habit essential for building cooperation,
     unity and trust in a group

   • To enable members value and respect decision made collectively

                                              iii
   • To enable members to understand the importance of record keeping and identify types
     of record to keep in a group.

The curriculum had several key components and messages:

  1. Introduction to the Advantages and importance of groups. As outlined
     above.

  2. Leadership styles. Different types of leadership were illustrated to the members
     in order to make them understand the importance of an inclusive approach to group
     decision-making. For example, participants were asked to role play the parts of a
     dictator, passive and democratic.

  3. Communication and listening. AVSI field workers stressed the importance of
     clear, open, and inclusive communication with regard to group activities. For example,
     participants were asked to take parts in dramatizations that illustrate bad and good
     communication skills and present their observations. They also practice listening skills.

  4. Decision making process. The objective of this topic was to help the member to
     choose how decisions relevant for the group would be taken to then be reflected in a
     group Constitution. Again, the training underlined the importance of group inclusion.
     Here participants were asked to identify any topic of interest, discuss as a group and
     arrive at a conclusion and present results. They also learn mechanisms to resolve
     interpersonal conflicts.

  5. Roles and Responsibilities. Group members participated in activities designed to
     demonstrate the different roles that group members can take on, their responsibilities
     and unhelpful behavior in groups. For example, this was done through animal codes
     where facilitators presented pictures of 19 different animals such as elephant, monkeys,
     owl, tortoise etc. Each of these animals were attached to a given behavioral pattern
     and participants were expected to discuss the reality of such behavior in a group.
     The training stressed the importance of saving and suggested that groups collectively
     maintain a group savings account to make investments.

  6. Record keeping. Basic record keeping techniques were illustrated to the participants
     as well as the importance of maintaining some level of record keeping. For example the
     facilitators illustrated the use of a ledger book for keeping records of monthly income
     and expenditure. Facilitators also presented different types of books that can be used
     in business such as a cash book, bank book and a purchase book, sales day book, the


                                             iv
      suppliers account record book, the customer account record book, a receipt book and
      an expense account book.

    7. Constitution. Field workers also facilitated the creation of a group constitution in
       which participants agreed to a set their expectations for group activities and adopted
       rules governing how members interacted and supported one another. The purpose of
       the constitution was to reinforce the group goals and expectations agreed upon on the
       initial three-day training course. After the course, a copy of the constitution remained
       in the village with the group members.

AVSI also provided stationery packages to the group members for purposes of record keeping.
After the course, AVSI staff members administered follow-up meetings every two months to
monitor group formation and progress. The purpose of these follow-ups was for AVSI staff
to track group formation progress as well as for the staff to interact with the groups and
offer advice and guidance.

        Notes: Columns 7 and 8 report the treatment-control difference in response rates, calculated via OLS regression
   controlling for baseline district, using robust standard errors clustered by village. There were 1800 study subjects in
   Phase 1. Baseline data in Phase 2 includes the 847 original sample members from 2009, plus 2011 data on the 57 new
   respondents who replaced those who died or left the village.



Table B.2 reports response rates by survey and round. Missing data and attrition are low.
For instance:

                                                                  ix
   • All 1800 participants completed the baseline survey. A very small number of respon-
     dents did not answer some questions. For the purpose of treatment effects analysis,
     we impute missing baseline data with the sample median in order to avoid losing the
     observation.

   • Attrition at the Phase 1 endline was low (3.7%) and uncorrelated with assignment to
     treatment.

   • The Phase 2 baseline represents a baseline of the 57 replacements (for the Phase 2
     subjects who died or migrated away since the Phase 1 baseline) and the data collected
     at Phase 1 endline for all those assigned to Phase 2 who were interviewed and not
     replaced. We are missing 2.4% of this Phase 2 baseline data because 7 of the 57
     replacements could not be surveyed, and because a small number of people were not
     found at the Phase 2 endline but were still eligible for the program. We impute missing
     Phase 2 baseline data with the Phase 1 baseline value if available and the sample median
     if not.

   • Attrition at the Phase 2 1-month endline is 5.1% and at the 1-year endline is 4%.
     There is no significant correlation with treatment (assignment to any follow-ups).

Table B.3 reports the correlates of attrition in Phases 1 and 2, regressing an indicator for
being found on selected baseline covariates. We pool Phases 1 and 2, clustering standard
errors at the individual level, because: (a) the determinants of attrition are likely to be
similar in each round, and (b) there are so few attritors (less than 40 per round) that there
are almost as many plausible independent variables as unfound members of the sample. From
Columns 1 and 2 illustrate that there is no significant correlation with treatment assignment.
There is some correlation with covariates, namely age, schooling, and current enrollment.
All covariates are jointly significant in explaining attrition, but all covariates explains just 3
percent of the variation.

C       Ramsey model of occupational choice and investment
        with heterogeneous agents
Our central questions are under what conditions, and why, do we expect the poorest to
start new, profitable enterprises as a result of business training and a grant, with or without
supervision and advice?
    To interpret the interventions and understand potential mechanisms, we consider a model
where people choose how many (if any) hours to work in each of two occupational sectors:
traditional labor-intensive work (e.g. subsistence agriculture and casual labor) and capital-
intensive small enterprise (both farm and non-farm).1
    1
    The model is rooted in models of investment and occupation choice by Udry (2010); Fafchamps et al.
(2014); Blattman et al. (2014), and has parallels to models by Kaboski and Townsend (2011). We thank
Xing Xia for research assistance in developing this model.


                                                           xi
    The model is rooted in the basic idea that, to expect investment and high returns,
programs such as WINGS must help overcome some constraint. We see four main candi-
dates: lack of credit, imperfect insurance, low business knowledge (skill) levels, and time-
inconsistency (present bias). In order to make predictions, we match these possible con-
straints with the various components of the WINGS program.
    The cash windfall in WINGS was mainly designed to alleviate credit constraints, which
according to the model could have a first-order effect on outcomes in the sense of produc-
ing sustained high returns. Cash could also alleviate an insurance constraint, though we
discussed in the main paper why this is unlikely in this context.
    Both the business skills training and the extended supervision could relax knowledge
constraints. Given our cross-cutting design, we cannot disentangle the effect of cash on
credit constraints from the effect of business skills training on knowledge, or the disciplining
effects of supervision.
    The initial accountability element of the follow-ups (i.e. belief that one would be mon-
itored) could help to address time-inconsistency (along with other potential rivers of poor
decision-making, such as attention). However, as the model below shows, using a commit-
ment device to address present bias alone cannot produce high returns. There must also
be another constraint such as imperfect credit markets. If we see an effect of the initial
supervisory visits on business size and profitability, then this implies that time-consistency
likely exists in this population and that it affects consumption and saving levels, but not
that it affects occupational choice and investment returns.
    Finally, the group formation intervention was designed to impact social capital more
generally. In the model this potentially corresponds to both credit constraints (via semi-
formal savings & loan groups) and knowledge constraints (via diffusion of ideas).


C.1     Setup
Consider an individual who can spend time working in one of two sectors: enterprise or
traditional labor. Production functions for enterprise and traditional labor are f E (k, lE , θ)
and f T (lT , ω), where k is accumulated physical and human capital used in enterprise, lE is
hours spent on enterprise, lT is hours on traditional labor, and θ is individual specific talent
in enterprise, and ω is individual specific talent in traditional labor. Working in enterprise
requires a minimum capital stock k ≥ 0, while traditional labor has no capital requirement.
We assume positive but diminishing marginal returns to inputs, fkE > 0 > fkk  E
                                                                                , flE > 0 > fllE ;
inputs are complements, fklE > 0; and the returns to inputs are increasing in ability, fkθ
                                                                                         E
                                                                                            > 0,

flθE > 0 and flω
               T
                 > 0.2 Also, note that lt = ltE + ltT ∈ [0, 1].
     The individual thus faces the problem:
                                                         X
                                 max                            δ t u(ct , lt )
                       ct >0,lt ≥0,kt+1 ≥0,at+1
                                                          t=0
                   s.t. ct + at+1 + kt+1 = (1 + rt )at + kt + f E (kt , ltE , θ) + f T (ltT , ω)
                                                  lt = ltE + ltT ≤ 1
                                              k0 = 0
                                              a0         given

where at is any financial assets other than capital invested in enterprise and rt is the returns
to these alternative financial assets at time t. Without loss of generality, we assume k0 = 0
and all initial wealth is in the financial asset, a0 . To make analysis simple, we fix rt =
r > 0. Finally, to fully characterize the equilibrium we add a transversality condition:
lim δ t u0c (ct , lt )at = 0.
t→∞
     This benchmark case considers perfect financial markets and consistent time preferences.
In this case, individuals will allocate assets between the enterprise and savings until the
returns of capital are equal, and will allocate their time across sectors until the marginal
disutility is equal. The solution to the problem is characterized as time-paths of quantities
                               t=0 that satisfy the following set of conditions given k0 = 0 and a0 > 0:

    Conditions 1 and 4 imply that whenever investment in enterprise is positive the individual
                                            0
always produces at efficient scale, i.e. fkE (kt+1 , lt+1

interior solutions only throughout.

Who runs an enterprise? For k > 0, there will be low θ types who cannot reach efficient
scale because their returns to capital are lower than r. We can define a minimum ability
                                                     0
before enterprise is feasible, θ = θ(r, k) for fkE (k, 1, θ) = r.3 Note that θ does not depend
on a0 .
     As θ rises above θ, the returns to capital and labor increase in enterprise, and enterprise
becomes a better alternative than saving all assets in at . This does not guarantee that
the individual will invest, since time could be allocated instead to traditional labor. Not
surprisingly, those with high values of ω and low values of θ will only engage in traditional
labor. Specifically, there will be a second threshold, θ̃, above which individuals will invest in
enterprise if θ > θ is also satisfied. θ̃ is a function of the relative marginal products of labor.
The marginal product of labor in enterprise, M P LE (r, θ), is decreasing in r and increasing
in θ.4 In the traditional sector, M P LT (ω, a0 , r) is determined by the equilibrium level of
lT , and is increasing in ω, ao and r.5 For high enough ω, M P LT (ω, a0 , r) ≥ M P LE (r, θ),
and these individuals will engage only in traditional labor and save all their assets in at .
M P LT (ω, a0 , r) = M P LE (r, θ) defines a threshold level of θ̃ = θ̃(ω, r, ao ) where θ > θ̃ if and
only if M P LT (ω, a0 , r) < M P LE (r, θ). θ̃(ω, r, a0 ) is increasing in all three arguments r, ω
and ao . However, the effect of ao on θ̃ will be negligible and so we simplify to θ̃(ω, r).
     Finally, in the steady state6 , occupational choice is determined by the threshold θ∗ =
   3
   Since hours working in the enterprise are upward bounded by 1 while capital invested in skilled trade
must be higher than k, for any individual that invests in the enterprise, lkE must be higher than k. Then
                                          0                   0                                                  0
for any θ < θ, k ≥ k, and ls < 1, fkE (k, lE , θ) < fkE (k, 1, θ) = r. The inequality arises because fkE is
decreasing in k but increasing in lE and θ. Therefore, for individuals with θ < θ, their returns to capital in
enterprise is below r regardless of the level of lE and k. Note that θ is an increasing function of k, r and
other parameters in the production function f E .
                                                                  0
   4
    If there is positive investment in enterprise, condition fkE (k, lE , θ) = r pins down the level of lkE (this is
because we assumed f E is homogenous of degree one in (k, lE )). lkE then pins down the marginal product
                                                                      0

of labor on the right hand side of condition 3: − u0l (ctt ,ltt ) = flE (kt , lt , θ).
                                                      c
    5
      If an individual does not invest in enterprise and only engages in traditional labor, conditions 1,3,5 and
6 will pin down a level of lT .
    6
      Note that we cannot have growth on the steady state because total hours available to the individual is 1,
and we assume there is no exogenous growth in productivity or individual ability. Therefore, we characterize
a steady state where ct , kt , lt and at are all constant. From optimal condition 1, we can see that, without
any restraints on savings or borrowing, the existence of a steady state requires δ(1 + r) = 1, otherwise we
cannot keep consumption constant. Notice that this is because we assumed there is free lending and free
                                                                                     1
borrowing, both at the same rate r. Patient individuals whose δ > 1+r                  would over save and accumulate
                                                                         1
infinite wealth when t → ∞; impatient individuals whose δ < 1+r would borrow too much today and their

θ∗ (r, k, ω) = max{θ(r, k), θ̃(ω, r)}. Low ability individuals whose θ < θ∗ (r, k, ω) will set
k = 0 and lE = 0. c and lT will be determined by ao , r and w. High ability individuals
                                                                                            0
whose θ ≥ θ∗ will invest in enterprise and set k ∗ > 0 and lE∗ > 0 such that fkE (k ∗ , lE∗ , θ) = r
                         0                     0
         u0 (c∗ ,l∗ )
and − u0l (c∗ ,l∗ ) = flE (k ∗ , lE∗ , θ) = flT (lT ∗ , ω). Their returns to capital will be r regardless of
          c
                                            ∗
their level of wealth. The ratio lkE∗ will be determined by θ and r, while hours in traditional
labor lT ∗ will be determined by w and r. Initial wealth ao will have a small effect on the
level of k ∗ , lE∗ , c and a. Without any constraints, all individuals will immediately jump to
these efficient steady state levels of production and consumption at time t = 1.
     In our comparative statics below we focus mainly on the cash component of our cross-
cutting research design. But the model is also informative about the other components
(training, group formation, and supervision). The simplest way to think of basic business
skills training is in increasing θ, perhaps most of all among low types. This will raise the
number of people above the minimum ability threshold, and potentially raise the returns
to capital for people already above that threshold. Thus if people received training alone,
we would expect to see increased entry into enterprise and greater enterprise earnings. This
is the case with or without a windfall. Group formation may increase productivity (θ)
either through shared ideas or possibly through some forms of cooperation (e.g. economies
of scale in sourcing wholesale goods or selling in the same place), bring down the costs of
borrowing r (e.g. by forming loans&savings groups, which usually provide cheaper finance
than conventional money lenders), or reduce credit constraints (a) and uncertainty (e.g.
about own ability,δθ , introduced in section C.2 below) as the group pools resources and
idiosyncratic risk. The accountability portion of the supervision component (designed to
provide commitment to invest) is supposed to affect discount factor δ, whereas the additional
supervisory visits (provision of substantive advice) enhance productivity (θ).

Impact of a windfall. With perfect financial markets, an unrestricted windfall will have
no effect on entry into enterprise and little effect on earnings because it does not change θ,
ω or r. The individual will immediately jump to a new steady state with higher level of
savings a and consumption c, and will slightly reduce investment k and hours in enterprise
lE because of greater wealth.
   Suppose instead the windfall is granted in the form of in-kind transfers or restricted
funding and there is some minimal “flypaper effect” such that capital stocks are “sticky” and
cannot be divested immediately. This “restricted windfall” will force individuals to produce
assets would approach negative infinity as t → ∞. In both of these cases, the transversality condition would
be violated. While this condition δ(1 + r) = 1 seems restrictive, we could argue that in reality, there will
bounds for borrowing and savings. As long as there is lending and borrowing within some bounds at the
rate r, our results would hold. We do not need δ(1 + r) = 1 for our comparative analysis.

above their efficient scale, fkE (k, l, θ) < r. c will increase as output increases in the enterprise.
lT will decrease and lE could go either direction, depending on parameter values. Over time,
if it is possible to shift capital to a, individuals will divest until the returns in enterprise
drops back to r.


C.2     Cash windfalls in imperfect financial markets
Credit constraint at ≥ 0

For simplicity, we consider an extreme credit constraint, at ≥ 0. The intuition and com-
parative statics are similar for other less restrictive credit constraints. The credit constraint
affects optimality conditions 1, which becomes:


                         u0c (ct , lt )
(7)                                     ≥ δ(1 + r) with equality if at+1 > 0
                     u0c (ct+1 , lt+1 )

Initially wealthy entrepreneurs tend to operate at efficient scale, with marginal returns equal
to r. The less wealthy, more impatient and higher ability do not have savings, will satisfy 7
with equality, and will invest below efficient scale with marginal returns are higher than r.
     Credit constraints also change the steady state level of investments, returns to invest-
ments, and threshold θ∗ . Define ρ = 1−δ    δ
                                              , where a high level of ρ indicates impatience.
                                    0
Define k and l
          ∗∗       E∗∗
                       such that fk (k , l , θ) = ρ. For impatient individuals whose ρ > r,
                                  s   ∗∗ E∗∗

the steady state level of capital and hours in the enterprise would be k ∗∗ < k ∗ and lE∗∗ , and
their returns to capital will be ρ. These individuals are investing below the efficient scale.
For those whose ρ < r, the steady state level of returns will still be r and investments will
still be k ∗ as before. To sum up, the steady state returns to capital will be max{r, ρ}. For
simplicity we will still refer to the threshold as θ∗ , while here θ∗ = θ∗ (r, k, ω, ρ) and θ∗ is
increasing in ρ whenever ρ > r. This means that with a credit constraint, more impatient
individuals will find enterprise undesirable than in the benchmark case.
     Not surprisingly, with a credit constraint, not all whose θ > θ∗ will immediately engage
in enterprise. Specifically, if there is a credit constraint, at ≥ 0, then compared to the
benchmark case with no constraints at all then occupational choice and investment will vary
by type and initial wealth in the following manner:

   1. Low ability individuals, θ < θ∗ . A credit constraint will not change occupational
      choice, consumption or labor supply as they would not invest in the enterprise even if
      they are allowed to borrow.



                                                 xvi
   2. High ability and High wealth, θ ≥ θ∗ and a0 ≥ k ∗∗ . A credit constraint will
      not change occupational choice. However, investment levels and returns will depend
      on time preferences:

       (a) Patient types (ρ < r) will invest k ∗ , with marginal returns r.
       (b) Impatient types (ρ > r) will invest k ∗∗ < k ∗ , with marginal returns ρ.

   3. High ability and below steady state wealth (θ ≥ θ∗ and k ≤ a0 ≤ k ∗∗ ).
      A credit constraint will reduce initial investment in enterprise only. They will start
      with an enterprise below efficient scale and over time will accumulate enough capital
      to reach the steady state level of investment.

   4. High ability and below minimum scale wealth (θ ≥ θ∗ and a0 ≤ k). A credit
      constraint will change initial occupational choice, but whether this effect is long-term
      or not depends on a0 , δ and abilities in each sector:

       (a) if a0 is close to k or ω is very high, and δ is close to one, the individual would
           be able to save in the initial periods and eventually accumulate enough wealth
           to invest in enterprise. In this case, the credit constraint only temporarily alters
           the individual’s occupational choice. Individuals will not invest in enterprise until
           at+1 is above k, after which they start investing in enterprise and reach the steady
           state level of investment over time.
       (b) if a0 is far below k or ω is very low, and δ is close to zero, the individual would
           remain in traditional labor forever. In this case, the credit constraint has a per-
           manent effect on the individual’s occupational choice.

Impact of a windfall. We first consider an unrestricted cash windfall. In cases 1 and
2(a), individuals are in their optimal steady state, and the windfall will increase consumption
and savings and slightly reduce labor supplied, but will not affect entry into enterprise or
earnings. In case 2(b), individuals will increase investments in enterprise temporarily above
k ∗∗ and increase total earnings but reduce marginal returns to capital to a level below ρ, but
not lower than r; over time they will reduce capital in the enterprise until capital returns
in the enterprise rise up to ρ again. Consumption will rise in the long run, but savings will
be zero in the long run. In case 3, the windfall will immediately increase their investments
in enterprise and earnings, and they will continue to increase capital and earnings over time
until they reach k ∗ . Likewise, in case 4, individuals will start and sustain an enterprise if the
windfall is enough to cover the capital requirement k. For those with extremely low level

                                               xvii
of initial wealth a0 < k − M , the windfall will not immediately affect their involvement in
enterprises, but it does increase the chances of their engaging in enterprise in the long run.
Whether they will eventually engage in the enterprise will again depend on their patience
and productivity in traditional labor.
    Next we consider a restricted windfall with some flypaper effect. In cases 1 and 2,
individuals are in their optimal steady state and the results are the same as in the case of
perfect financial markets: they will be forced to invest above efficient scale in the short run,
earnings will increase, but returns will be low. In the long-run, they will divest and go back
to the their steady state level of production, merely saving and consuming divested funds.
In cases 3 and 4, individuals are below steady state and the impact will be similar to the
case of the unrestricted windfall.

Savings constraint at ≤ 0

Now we consider the case of a savings constraint where individuals do not have any alternative
means to invest other than enterprise. They are, however, still allowed to borrow at rate r.
Condition 1 now becomes


                            u0c (ct , lt )
(8)                                        ≤ δ(1 + r) with equality if at+1 < 0.
                        u0c (ct+1 , lt+1 )


     Savings constraints can lead to investment above the efficient scale. For those with debts
at+1 < 0 (the impatient and poor ones), the first order conditions require their returns to
capital to be the same as r; however, for those without debts at+1 = 0 (the patient and
savings constrained ones), these conditions mean marginal returns are lower than r.
     Among those who do invest in the enterprise, for the patient individuals whose ρ < r, the
steady state level of capital and hours are k ∗∗ and lE∗∗ , and their returns will be ρ. Notice
k ∗∗ /lE∗∗ > k ∗ /lE∗ . For those impatient ones whose ρ > r, steady state returns are still r and
investments are still k ∗ as before. Thus the steady state returns to capital are min{r, ρ}.
Because individuals are still allowed to borrow, any individual with θ ≥ θ∗ would invest in
enterprise, though this θ∗ is lower than in the benchmark and credit constraint cases for
patient individuals whose ρ < r.7 Thus, under a savings constraint, more people run an
   7
    Savings constraints will lower the threshold level of θ∗ for those whose ρ < r. This is because now we
would need to define θ∗ based on the new level of returns to capital min{r, ρ} instead of r. For simplicity
of discussion, we will still refer to the threshold as θ∗ , while here θ∗ = θ∗ (r, k, ω, ρ) and θ∗ is increasing in ρ
whenever ρ < r. This means that with a credit constraint, more individuals will be engaging in enterprise
than in the benchmark case.



                                                       xviii
enterprise at any t > 0, before and after everyone reaches their steady state. However, the
average rate of returns among entrepreneurs will be lower than r.

Impact of a windfall. An unrestricted windfall will not change any individual’s decision
to engage in enterprise, since all those with θ ≥ θ∗ will be already engage in enterprise at the
outset. However, in the short run, since individuals cannot save, the windfall will increase
consumption and capital stocks, and thus further reduce the marginal returns to capital in
the enterprise below min{r, ρ}. In the long run, however, capital and consumption will drop
back to the steady state level and rate of returns will rise back to min{r, ρ}.
    A restricted cash transfer with a flypaper effect will immediately increase capital stocks
and lower the rate of return while having no immediate impact on consumption. Over time,
the individual will consume these transfers until consumption and capital stock falls back to
the steady state level. The average impact on earnings will not be as high as under a credit
constraint.

Savings and credit constraints at = 0

Finally we consider the effect of a savings constraint on top of a credit constraint. For those
                                                                    0
who do invest in the enterprise, their rate of return will be fkE (k, lE , θ) = 1−δδ
                                                                                       = ρ. This
means the less patient will be investing below the efficient scale while the more patient will be
investing above the efficient scale. This also changes the threshold level θ∗ for all individuals.
                                       0
We would need to define θ∗ using fkE (k, lE , θ) = ρ instead of r. For impatient ones whose
ρ > r, θ∗ would be higher than in the benchmark case; while for patient ones whose r > ρ,
θ∗ would be lower than in the benchmark case. This means, compared to the benchmark
case, there will be more patient individuals and less impatient ones investing in enterprise.
Individuals with θ < θ∗ (case 1 above) will be engaging in traditional labor only, as are those
with high ability and below minimum scale wealth (case 4(a) and (b)).
    Cash windfalls, restricted or unrestricted, will be invested in all cases.8 Those at or
near their optimal steady state level of capital (including no enterprise) will have an average
return below min{r, ρ}, and those below their steady state will have average returns higher
than this level.
  8
   The sole exception is the very poor with initial wealth a0 < k − M . They will no longer pass a point
where they have incentives to save in order to accumulate k. This is a moot point if M > k.

C.3      Introducing uncertainty and imperfect insurance
Next we consider the case of risky enterprise and risky traditional labor but a riskless financial
alternative. It is possible to model risk in several ways. To incorporate uncertainty, we
illustrate the case where the productivity measures θt and ωt are uncertain and vary over
time.
    Specifically, we assume that realizations of ability are normally distributed around ex-
pected productivities θ̄ and ω̄ , θt ∼ N (θ̄, δθ ) and ωt ∼ N (ω̄, δω ). Hours in enterprise and
traditional labor are determined after the realization of θt and ωt . Investment decisions kt
and at , however, are made in time t − 1, before the realization of productivity θt and ωt .
We can view the individual as having a stochastic income stream delivered by the stochastic
wage from traditional labor. At the same time, the individual                    has the      option of investing
                                                                                             0

his asset in either the risky enterprise with expected return Et 1 + fk (kt+1 , lt+1 , θ) or the

if the returns to enterprise and traditional labor are positively correlated, then the riskless
asset will deliver higher expected utility than the risky enterprise, and the individual will
invest below the efficient scale in the enterprise as long as he is risk averse. In this case,
the more risk averse the individual is, the less he invests in risky enterprise, and the higher
the returns to the enterprise. Similarly, the higher the variability of θ or w, the less the
individual invests in risky enterprise,
    If instead, θt+1 and ωt+1 are negatively correlated, i.e. the returns to enterprise and
traditional labor are negatively correlated, then the enterprise and traditional labor are a
good hedge against each other. The individual will invest more in the enterprise, or even
                                                                       0

r, or even lower than r if the variability of ω is high.
    Here the optimal level of investment is a function of interest rate r, the mean and variance
of productivity θ̄, δθ , ω̄, δω , the correlation between θ and ω, patience δ and the degree of
risk aversion. The optimal choice of whether to invest in enterprise or not then depends on
all these parameters, as well as the minimum scale of production k.

Impact of a windfall. We ask the same question as before: Under what conditions will
the cash windfall have a sustained effect on individuals’ investment in enterprise and/or
returns to investment in enterprise?
    Even absent a credit constraint a windfall may induce some individuals to enter into
enterprise, and change investment levels for those who do invest in enterprise, simply through
the wealth effect. If utility displays constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) wealth would not
have any effect on the optimal level of investment, and no effect on entry into enterprise. If,
however, utility displays constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) then a windfall increases the
level of wealth, which then increases the optimal level of investment in the risky enterprise.
    Note that there will be individuals with either very low initial wealth, or very high risk
aversion, who would not invest in the risky enterprise (because of k) but would do so after
receiving the cash windfall. Unless the amount of the windfall is very large (relative of the
minimum scale k) or the individual is very risk averse, we would not expect the windfall to
have a large long-run average effect on investment across many individuals.
    So long as both sectors are risky, for a windfall to result in high levels of investment
and high returns, there must be some other form of imperfection on top of an environment
with risk. Again, a credit constraint is a likely candidate in the setting described. This


                                                  xxi
conclusion rests on the assumption that there are roughly similar levels of uncertainty in the
two sectors. We turn to that assumption next.

Relative uncertainty. Intuitively, the relative volatility of traditional trade and enterprise
matter for investments in enterprise. More importantly, the impact of their relative volatility
depends on initial wealth, the degree of risk aversion, as well as the correlation between
enterprise and traditional labor.
     In general terms, if either enterprise or traditional labor is relatively safe (i.e. either σθ
or σω is low), then investment in enterprise k falls as σθ /σω increases; and the more risk
averse the individual is, the steeper the slope of the fall is. If σθ is low while σω is high,
the individual will very likely engage in the enterprise, as long as she is not bounded by a
credit constraint. If σθ is high while σω is low, the individual will likely not engage in the
enterprise. In both cases, a windfall will have little impact on investments and earnings.
     If, however, productivity in traditional labor and enterprise are both very volatile (σθ and
σω both high), then the relationship between k and σθ /σω would also depend on initial wealth
a0 , the degree of risk aversion, as well as the correlation between θ and ω. First, consider the
case where traditional labor and enterprise are uncorrelated or positively correlated. Holding
everything else constant, if an individual has very low (or negative) initial wealth, then given
a highly volatile income stream from traditional labor, the safety asset would be much more
appealing to her than the enterprise even if the enterprise is less volatile than traditional
labor. In this case, the individual may not enter into enterprise even if she faces no credit
constraint – she might fear that she would never be able to repay the debt with her earnings.
The same happens if the individual is very risk averse – she would not enter the enterprise
and instead use the safety asset to smooth consumption over time. In both of these cases,
a large windfall might pull the individual out of these situations and allow her to invest in
the enterprise. However, if the returns from traditional labor and enterprise are negatively
correlated, then again k increases as σθ /σω falls, and the individual will likely invest in the
enterprise as long as she is not bounded by a credit constraint. In this case, a windfall will
have a long term effect on those with high levels of risk aversion and low levels of initial
wealth . Again, this is because a windfall increases wealth and lead the risk averse to invest
more in risky assets – the enterprise.

C.4     Introducing time-inconsistency
We introduce quasi-hyperbolic (β, δ) preferences to see what predictions they hold for in-
vestment and earnings. The problem becomes:
                                                                   ∞
                                                                   X
                           max                   u(ct , lt ) + β           δ s u(cs , ls )
                   ct >0,lt ≥0,kt+1 ≥0,at+1
                                                                   s=t+1
            s.t.     ct + at+1 + kt+1 = Wt
                                         lt = ltE + ltT ≤ 1
                                       Wt ≡ (1 + rt )at + kt + f E (kt , ltE , θ) + f T (ltT , ω)

We consider the case of a “naive” type, or “naif”, who makes investment decisions under the
false belief that future selves will act in the interest of the current self, and a “sophisticate”
who knows exactly what her future selves’ preferences will be.

Perfect financial markets

Optimal conditions 1 and 4 will now change into the general Euler equation for hyperbolic
preferences:

                           u0c (ct , lt )    ∂ct+1           ∂ct+1

                        uc (ct+1 , lt+1 )    ∂Wt+1           ∂Wt+1

and

            u0c (ct , lt )      ∂ct+1           ∂ct+1                0

                                                                   k (kt+1 , lt+1 , θ))      if kt+1 > 0
        u0c (cPt+1 , lt+1 )     ∂Wt+1           ∂Wt+1

These resemble the Euler equations 1 and 4 under exponential discounting, except that the
discount factor δ is replaced by the effective discount factor ∂W
                                                                ∂ct+1
                                                                   t+1
                                                                               ∂ct+1
                                                                       βδ+(1− ∂W  t+1
                                                                                      )δ, a weighted
average of the short-run and long-run discount factors βδ and δ where the weights are the
next period marginal propensity to consume out of total wealth. Here W t denotes total
wealth at time t. cPt+1 denotes the individual’s predicted future decision about ct+1 at time
t.
    The differences between the naif and the sophisticate lie in the predicted consumption
ct+1 and the marginal propensity to consume ∂W
 P                                                  ∂ct+1

                                                           . Sophisticates are aware of the time-
inconsistency problem and will correctly anticipate future consumption. For them, cPt+1 =
ct+1 . Naifs, however, mistakenly believe that future selves will act as if their discount factor
remains unchanged at all future dates. For them cPt+1 < ct+1 . Time-inconsistency will affect
both consumption and savings.

                                                      xxiii
    Time-inconsistency should not affect the optimal use of a cash windfall. For those with
θ ≥ θ∗ , they will still invest until the returns to capital are equal between the enterprise
                                           0
and alternative financial options, or fkE (k, lE , θ) = r. Note that consumption, hours and
savings will all be different under time-inconsistency compared to our benchmark case with-
out time-inconsistency. Thus threshold value of θ∗ is different than in the benchmark case.
However, the effect of a windfall will be similar to that in the benchmark case without
time-inconsistency. This is because absent of any credit market imperfections, everyone will
already be at their efficient scale.

Time-inconsistency with credit constraints

For a windfall to be invested and produce high average returns, some other constraint must
be present. Similar to the case without time-inconsistency, credit constraints will suffice. To
see this, we turn to the Euler equations again. Those who are credit constrained will put
every additional dollar they get into consumption (not savings), because they are present-
biased. Therefore ∂W
                   ∂ct+1
                      t+1
                          = 1 and the Euler equations become

                         u0c (ct , lt )             0

                       0    P
                                        = βδ(1 + fkE (kt+1 , lt+1
                                                              E
                                                                  , θ))   if kt+1 > 0
                      uc (ct+1 , lt+1 )

for those who are bounded by the credit constraint, i.e. at+1 = 0.
     With time inconsistency, all credit constrained individuals will invest less than if they
were time-consistent. To see this, define τ such that 1+τ               1
                                                                           = βδ, i.e. τ = βδ 1
                                                                                               − 1. Since
the sophisticates can correctly anticipate their future consumptions, in their steady state
                                                                             0
cPt+1 = ct+1 = ct , and the marginal rate of return will be fkE (ksophisticate , lE , θ) = τ . Naifs
will naively expect themselves to have more self-control tomorrow, and expect cPt+1 < ct . For
                                         0
         u0c (ct ,lt )
them u0 (c P ,l
                   t+1 )
                         < 1 and ρ < f E
                                       k   (knaive , lE , θ) < τ . Therefore, for those who are credit con-
        c   t+1
                                                                                   0
strained (at+1 = 0), their steady state level of investment satisfies ρ < fkE (knaive , lE , θ) < τ =
   0
fkE (ksophisticate , lE , θ). They also work less and consume a larger portion of their income.
     Somewhat counter-intuitively, given the levels of β and δ, the sophisticates invest even
less than the naifs. This is because the naifs believe (incorrectly) that they will consume
less tomorrow and eventually grow to k = k ∗∗ just like a time-consistent type. Thus they
think their average future marginal utility of consumption is low (i.e. high consumption)
and therefore are willing to consume less than the sophisticates. In practice, however, we
might expect β and δ to be positively correlated, or sophisticates to have both higher β and
δ than naifs. In this case, sophisticates would invest more than naifs.




                                                    xxiv
Impact of a windfall. The impact of a cash windfall is similar to the case with time-
consistent preferences. Credit constraints (but not savings constraints) are needed in this
simple model to expect investment and high returns. High investment and returns, moreover,
will only be seen where people start below their steady state. The steady state levels of
capital to which the time-inconsistent will move, however, are lower than the case without
time inconsistency. Thus the average returns will be lower than the benchmark case, but
still greater than r.
     Recall, however, that in the time consistent case the average impact was expected to
increase in patience (at least amongst those below their optimal steady state capital). With
time inconsistency, holding patience constant, we expect the impacts to be larger among
the more time-inconsistent. In practice, however, this comparative static will be difficult to
identify, partly because β and δ may be correlated and partly because they may be difficult
to measure separately.
     More importantly, restricted windfalls with a flypaper effect have the potential to increase
investment levels to k ∗ , at least temporarily. Eventually as long as they can divert, both types
will return to their steady state level of investment. However, if there is a commitment device,
for example an in-kind transfer that cannot be diverted over time, then the sophisticates will
more likely be the ones who apply for and use this in-kind transfer. Such a transfer will
not only help some constrained individuals to enter into enterprise or get closer to their
steady state level of investment, it will also change the steady state level of investment for
the sophisticates from ksophisticate to k ∗∗ . A naive type, on the other hand, would not want
to tie their hands to such a transfer; they would prefer a transfer that can be diverted over
time. Intuitively, time inconsistency makes the sophisticates act like a person with very low
discount rate βδ every period, when in fact their real discount rate for the far future is δ.
So a windfall that also act as a commitment device could push them into a new equilibrium
that it wouldn’t do for someone who was time-consistent but merely impatient.


D     Additional treatment effects analysis
D.1     Accounting for spillovers
Here we provide more detail on the distance measures used to estimate the ITT via the OLS
regression in equation ??. For each town, we calculate the exposure to spillovers from all
treatment towns within k kilometers of the town, via the following equation:

                                                 X                        δj,j ∗
                                DjT =                               1−β
                                        j:δj,j ∗ ≤k,j6=j ∗ ,Tj =1
                                                                           k

                                                    xxv
    where δj,j ∗ is the road distance between town j and town j ∗ , and Tj is an indicator equal
to 1 if town j is assigned to treatment. β can take values in [0, 1]. When β = 0, DjT is
simply a count of treatment villages within a k kilometer radius. This is the approach taken
by Miguel and Kremer (2004). When β = 1, DjT is a sum of one minus the distance to each
                                        δ ∗
village, normalized by k, so that 1 − j,jk is close to 0 for far away villages and close to 1 for
nearby villages. We choose β = 0.5 and k = 4, but our results are generally the same for
any β and 2 < k < 8.
    Equation ?? also controls for a weighted distance to all evaluation villages. We use a
simulated rather than actual measure. Specifically, we simulate 100 random assignments

average over all 100 random assignments to obtain an estimate of the expected exposure to
treatment spillovers for town j. More specifically,

where T̂jl is equal to 1 if town j is assigned to treatment in simulated assignment l. Using an
actual distance measure provides broadly similar results, since it and DjA are nearly collinear.
   Note that the majority of tertiary roads in Uganda have not been mapped. Therefore, we
used high-resolution satellite imagery in the OpenStreetMap platform to trace all tertiary
roads and footpaths connecting villages. We then exported this road network to ArcGIS 10.0
and used the Origin-Destination Matrix tool in the Network Analyst extension to calculate
road network distances.


D.2     Robustness and sensitivity analysis
Two concerns are potential bias arising from baseline imbalance and systematic attrition
from unfound migrants. Table 7 tests the sensitivity of our Phase 1 impacts. Column 1
reports the ITT from Table 3 for major outcomes. Results are robust to exclusions of the
distance measures that account for spillovers (Column 2), for removing baseline covariates
(Column 3), and (where we have comparable baseline data) to a differences-in-differences
ITT estimate controlling for other baseline covariates (Column 4). In general, the impacts
are similar.
    We also bound treatment effects for attrition bias. We consider an extreme bound,
one that imputes the 10th percentile of treatment group outcomes for unfound treatment
members and the 90th percentile for unfound controls (Column 6). Results are robust to

    In general, spillovers to non-participants were modest. We find no evidence of large
or statistically significant spillovers to non-trading households. The effect on incomes is
roughly zero on average. Prices of imported and produced/exported goods both fell a slight
amount (.09 and .07 standard deviations, not statistically significant), potentially because
increased trade decreased the market power of existing traders and brought prices closer to
the competitive equilibrium. Thus the effect on real incomes was somewhat ambiguous (we
do not have individual production data).

                                                          xxxiii
    We do, however, see an occupational shift among pre-existing traders in the treatment
villages. They were 8 percentage points less likely to be engaged in petty trading but only
had one fewer work hour per week than before. Their non-agricultural hours of work were
almost unchanged, as they switch to casual labor and other work. Yet preexisting traders
saw no significant decrease in incomes as a result.

Cross-village spillovers

Columns (2) and (7) in Table D.5 capture spillover across villages. Overall, we find no
evidence of large cross-village spillovers (for traders, there is a statistically significant increase
in hours worked and income, but the left bound of the 95% confidence interval is always very
close to zero).


D.6      Heterogeneity in impacts of supervision
Our theory and the program design suggests that follow-up should have the greatest impact
on the most present-biased or least autonomous individuals. To test this, we generate a
measure of pre-program future orientation using both incentivized games and self-reported
survey questions and interact it with treatment in Table D.6.9 We also use a composite
measure of three self-reported financial autonomy questions at baseline (described further
below) and interact this with treatment as well.
     The future orientation measure generally has the expected sign (i.e. more investment
and earnings) though the autonomy measure does not. These are difficult traits to measure
and so the size and significance may reflect measurement error, but nonetheless we do not
see strong evidence of present bias impeding investment. Likewise, the interactions with
treatment are in the expected direction, but they are not statistically significant. The co-
efficients on treatment–which represents the effect of treatment on the present-biased and
less autonomous–are now larger and more statistically significant than before, in accordance
with the prediction. Without significant interactions, however, this is no more than weak
evidence for a heterogeneous effect.
   9
    Our measure of future orientation is a weighted average of eight baseline survey questions on self-reported
patience and impulsiveness and indicators for play within incentivized games, where respondents were offered
choices between payment of small sums now versus in two weeks, and in two versus four weeks. The indicators
include ones for choosing future versus present rewards, an indicator for future bias (less likely to choose the
future in the two versus four weeks choice) and for present bias (more likely to choose the future in the two
versus four weeks choice). To generate weights, we regress the endline income index on all time preference
measures for the control group alone, and use the estimated coefficients to generate a predicted patience
level for the full sample. We omit observations where we do not have a time preference measure.

      Notes: Coefficients and standard errors come from an OLS regression of each dependent variable on an indicator
  assignment to any follow-up treatment, an index measure of future orientation taken from baseline, and an interaction
  between these two indicators. Other baseline covariates and strata fixed effects were included in each regression and are
  omitted from this table. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
