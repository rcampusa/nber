        This paper studies the
                                 efficient agreements about the dependence of
 workers' earnings on employment when the employment
                                                     level is controlled
 by firms. The firms'
                           superior information about Profitability conditions
 is   responsible for this form of
                                     contract governance Under plausible
assumptions, such agreements will
                                      cause employment to diverge from effi-.
ciency as a byproduct of their
                                   attempt to mitigate risk. It     is shown
that,   if leisure is a normal
                                 good and firms are risk

                                                  unemployment as a rational
byproduct of risk sharing

       Most labor
                     agreements specify the

 and level of

labor contracts that
                       are optimal in a model where the firm
will choose the

                                               ascertains some relevant
random parameters


      The results can be
                           roughly characterized
                                                    as follows, subject of course
to assumptions whose innocence and
                                     Plausibility we will later espouse:

       labor is always less than workers'

 with solutions to related
                             problems, we will ascertain some of the qualitative
 implications of informational
                                 asymmetry and differential attitudes towards
 risk. Specifically we ask whether and to what extent
                                                         profits, employment

     Before Proceeding further let us look at three simpler versions

problem that will be useful as benchmarks.


     First, consider the maximization of
                                                    (2.4) subject to (2.5), but where

                                            This corresponds to that part of the im-
plicit contracts literature in which the realization of
                                                        uncertainties can
be verified by both
                    parties and therefore can be used
                                                      explicitly to condi-
tion the outcomes

        In   this case the solution can be characterized by the two equations



(2.7)               -Ogt(U))     u(r(e),(O))
                                 ur(r(O) ,(E3))

The former is the condition for productive

disutility of that unit. The latter equation is the condition for efficiency

in risk—bearing (BorchTs equation

 (2.9)               u(r,) =   v(r   -



                                               describing the marginal disutility of labor
where h is an increasing function

 and v is an arbitrary increasing concave

                                                                 under (2.9) in the case

    (2.10)            r      —   h(i)   = u


           It is easy to see why the firm's solution to its
                                                                     problem automatically
   satisfies (2.8). Regardless of the choice of 1, (2.10)
                                                          guarantees that (2.8)
   will hold because the
                             argunen.t of v(.) is fixed.

           The fi's choices in each state will also automatically
                                                                            satisfy the
  productive efficiency condition.            For this particular
                                                                    utility function, con-
  dition (2.7) becomes


  (2.11)            eg'()        h'(z)


  In each state the fi
                             chooses the point of r() such that the marginal cost
  of hiring labor is just equal to the marginal revenue
                                                                    product. Thus

  (2.12)            Og'(l)


 And from (2.10), since u is constant along the
                                                contract, we have

 (2.13)             r'()     h'(i)


 Combining (2.12) and (2.13), we see that the profit—maximizing
                                                                           choice is
 invariably the Productively efficient choice.

      This sane argument can be shown
                                              graphically. Graphs (la) and (lb) show
the firm's isoprofit
                          curves for two different values of
                                                                    S and specify a par-
ticular contract r(). Profits increase to the southeast.
                                                                        Points A, A' are
the Profit—maximizing
                           points, satisfying condition (2.12).        For a profit
maximizing firm to choose the
                                     Productively efficient points this requires
that the slope of the

                    In other words, u should be

must be of the form (2.9). Our final example is a simple instance

      Suppose the worker's utility function is additively separable


 (2.14)
                 u(r,) = m(r) —     n()

with m(.) concave and n(.) convex.        Now condition (2.8) becomes

                                     they show that a contract administered

 functions are of the form (2.9).

  In other words, in this case the optimal
                                                 contract would involve
                                                                          paying the
  worker a fixed amount in
                           all states of the world. The labor
                                                              required should
  vary smoothly according to


  (2.16)          K/n'(i)     6g'()

 which is the version of
                            condition (2.7) for this
                                                  particular utility function.
 It is easy to see that this contract could
                                            not be enforced under
                                                                  differentjai

                             contract does not provide for
                                                              any variation in
 salary with respect to
                          working time, the firn would
                                                          always require the max—
 inial amount of labor.


      In subsequent sections of the paper we will
                                                       examine the general solution
to the problem when
                      (2.9) does not hold and
                                                 when in particular the income
elasticity of leisure demanded
                                 is Positive rather than zero. As this third
example indicates in such
                             problems (2.7) and (2.8),
                                                      the risk—sharing and
productive efficiency conditions, will be in conflict.

4. Intuition and Comparison with Other Results

     The discussion above has been quite abstract, yet the intuition behind

the overemployment result is actually very clear.   The diagram below repre-

sents the utility function of workers, increasing to the northwest.




                                                    2
The curve u is an indifference curve, and u is a constant marginal utility of

income locus. When leisure is a normal good U must have a smaller slope

(algebraically) than u. Moving northeastward along u, the marginal utility

of income declines.

     If u were implemented as the contract we would always have productive

 efficiency but U would not be constant. The first—best contract would lie

 along u, but if we left it to a profit_maximizing firm to implement ur as

 a contract we would have efficiency in risk bearing, but not in production.
                                                              equal to the slope
 The firm would profit maximize by setting marginal product

 of the contract not of the indifference curve. Because of the relationship

 between these two slopes, the level of employment is too high under the U

 contract.

      compare the optimal contract c with
                                             any constant utility contract whose path
      it crosses:

     Let A and B be the locus of
                                   points (r,) such that            a and b respectively.

 As long as leisure is
                            a normal good these curves move leftward with increases
 in Utility. We know from
                                 the transversaljty conditions that under contract c
 the endpoints are on these loci. Similarly, in
                                                       a constant utility
                                                                            contract,
 since productive efficiency
                                   is achieved at all times, the firm's choices at
 0      a and 0 = b also lie on these locj.
                                                Thus when leisure is a normal good,
the spread between 1(b)
                               and 1(a) is greater in the
                                                            optimal contract than in
the constant utility contract.


     When income is a normal good (so that A and B move
                                                        upward with increases
in u, as they do in the
                        diagram), then a similar
                                                 argument demonstrates that

        *
       If f" is always
                       negative, then the_slope of the optimal contract at
any point lies between the
                           slopes of the u curve and of the u curve through
that point.

which are controlled by the
                            schedule are different: In the tax system the
schedule specifies net income not as a function of hours worked
                                                                     ,   but   as a

tax problem sensitive not to the
                                    income elasticity of leisure, but to the
price elasticity of leisure. Indeed if we considered the
