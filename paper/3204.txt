   THE LONG-RUN BEHAVIOR OF VELOCITY:   THE INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH REVISITED


                                   ABSTRACT

     In this paper we provide evidence using annual data for the period

1880 to 1986 that institutional variables are significant determinants of

velocity in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Norway.

This evidence supplements our earlier findings (Bordo and Jonung, Cambridge

University Press, 1987) for annual data ending in the early 1970's.     We

present eVidence that several proxies for institutional change in the

financial sector are significant determinants of the long-run velocity

function; that for the majority of countries the long-run velocity function

incorporating institutional determinants has not undergone significant

change over the last 10 to 15 years; and that out of sample forecasts over

the last 10 to 15 years based on our institutional hypothesis are superior

to those based on a benchmark long-run velocity function for a number of

countries.   these results suggests that failure to account for

institutional change in the financial sector such as may be captured by our

proxy variables may well be one factor behind the recently documented

instability and decline in predictive power of short-run velocity models

incorporating dynamic adjustment and higher frequency data.
