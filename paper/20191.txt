Studies of inequality often ignore resource allocation within the household. In doing so they miss
an important element of the distribution of welfare that can vary dramatically depending on overall
environmental and economic factors. Thus, measures of inequality that ignore intra household
allocations are both incomplete and misleading. We discuss determinants of intrahousehold allocation
of resources and welfare. We show how the sharing rule, which characterizes the within household
allocations, can be identified from data on household consumption and labor supply. We also argue
that a measure based on estimates of the sharing rule is is inadequate as an approach that seeks to
understand how welfare is distributed in the population because it ignores public goods and the
allocation of time to market work, leisure and household production. We discuss a money metric
alternative, that fully characterizes the utility level reached by the agent. We then review the current
literature on the estimation of the sharing rule based on a number of approaches, including the use
of distribution factors as well as preference restrictions.

1     Introduction

1.1    Inequality between individuals

Consider an economy with identical couples, each of which has a total income

of 100. Individuals privately consume a unique, perfectly divisible commodity;

there exist neither externalities nor economies of scale, so that, in each couple,

the sum of individual consumptions equals the couple’s total income. Inequality,

as measured in a standard way, is nil. Assume, now, that some of these couples

divorce, and that after divorce husbands each receive an income of 75, while

each wife gets 25. The new income distribution, again by standard criteria, is

now unequal; in particular, the presence of lower income singles (the divorced

wives) increases both inequality and poverty.

    From a deeper perspective, however, the conclusion just stated is far from

granted. It entirely relies on an implicit assumption – namely, that the pre-

divorce distribution of income within households was equal. Most of the time,

such an assumption has little or no empirical justification; and from a theo-

retical viewpoint, it is actually quite unlikely to hold – few serious models of

household behavior would predict an equal distribution of income while mar-

ried if the post-divorce allocation is highly skewed. Still, it is crucial. Assume,

for the sake of the argument, that the distribution of resources within married

couples simply mimics what it would be in case of divorce (he gets 75, she gets

25) – not an unreasonable assumption, given that in our (admittedly simplistic)

structure this is the only individually rational allocation. Then the claim that

inequality increased after the wave of divorces is simply wrong. Inequality, at

least across individuals, has not changed; each agent has exactly the same in-

come, consumption and welfare than before. And the surge in measured poverty

is just as spurious. There are exactly as many poor women after than there

were before; it is just that, in the pre-divorce situation, the standard measures


                                        2
missed them.

    The previous example, extreme as it may be, illustrates a basic point that

the present paper will try to emphasize – namely, that any attempt at measuring

inequality (or its evolution over time) that ignores allocation of resources within

the family is unreliable at best, and deeply flawed at worst, especially when the

basic demographics regarding family composition evolve over the period under

consideration. This point had already been emphasized in the literature; for

instance, Haddad and Kanbur (1990) have showed, on Philippine data, that

standard measures of inequality in calorie adequacy would be understated by

30 to 40 percent if intrahousehold inequality was ignored. As a more recent

illustration, consider the graph below (Figure 1) due to Lise and Seitz (2011),

that plots the evolution of inequality across households, within households and

across individuals in the UK over the last decades, as estimated from a collective

model of labor supply. The main conclusion is that the standard approach, based

on adult equivalence scales, underestimates the initial level of cross-sectional

consumption inequality by 50%. Moreover, it gives a deeply flawed picture of

the evolution of inequality over the last decades. While the usual story - a

large surge in inequality between 1970 and 2000 - applies to inequality across

household, it is compensated by a considerable reduction of intra-household

inequality - so that total inequality (across individuals) remains more or less

constant over the period.1




    1 This conclusion must be qualified in view of the population under consideration. Indeed,

the sample excludes all households with children, all persons aged under 22 or over 65, all
persons who were self-employed, and the top1 per cent of the earnings distribution (which
is, in any case, not well covered by the Family Expenditure Survey).; so the conclusions are
only valid for that particular, subpopulation. Still, it is suggestive of the general claim that
ignoring intra-household allocation may severely bias our views regarding inequality.

   All this strongly suggests, at the very least, that much more attention should

be paid to intrahousehold inequality, from both a theoretical and an empirical

viewpoint. Analyzing intrahousehold inequality, however, raises a host of spe-

cific problems. Some are of a conceptual nature. A large fraction of household

expenditures relate to public commodities - i.e., goods that are jointly con-

sumed by the household, without exclusion restrictions; moreover, in many cases

these public commodities are internally produced within the household. Spouses

may have different preferences regarding public goods; therefore, the fraction of

household expenditures devoted to public consumption has a potentially impor-

tant impact on intrahousehold inequality, that cannot be disregarded. Similar

questions arise for intrahousehold production, with the additional twist that

time spent by each spouse should also be taken into account. How should such

public productions and consumptions be taken into account in our inequality

measures? While the impact of public goods on inequality is by no means a


                                       4
new problem, it is particularly stringent in our context, if only because public

goods and domestic production are among the main (economic) reasons for the

existence of the household.

   As we shall see, these conceptual issues affect the standard notion of inequal-

ity in two ways. Besides shedding a new light on its measurement, they also

revive some old discussions about its foundations. In particular, the role of pub-

lic goods raises questions about which type on inequality should we concentrate

on: income? (private) consumption? utility? The problem is far from innocu-

ous: in the presence of public goods, it is relatively easy to generate examples

in which a change in prices and incomes results in a decrease in a person’s pri-

vate consumption and an increase in the spouse’s, whereas utilities evolve in

the opposite way (welfare declines for the person whose private consumption

increases and conversely). In such a context, the impact of the change on intra-

household inequality is not clearly defined – it all depends on what exactly we

are interested in.

   Empirical problems are equally challenging. As always in economics, prefer-

ences are not directly observed, and have to be recovered from observable data

(demand, labor supply). But, in addition, the allocation of resources within

the household cannot (in general) be directly observed; it has to be recovered

from the household’s (aggregate) behavior. It follows that when deciding which

aspect of inequality should be considered, one cannot abstract from identifi-

cation issues: there is little interest in concentrating on a notion that is not

identifiable in practice. An interesting paradox, in this respect, is provided by a

standard result of household economics – namely, that in some circumstances,

a continuum of different models generate the same observable behavior (so they

are observationally indistinguishable). In some cases, these models correspond

to different intrahousehold allocations of resources, but to the same allocation



                                        5
of utility (in the language of the theory, the indeterminacy is welfare-irrelevant).

In other words, the main justification for concentrating on inequality in income

or consumption rather than in utility – namely, the fact that the former are

observed, but not the latter – is sometimes partially reversed.

   These questions obviously arise whenever inequality is assessed on a utilitar-

ian basis. However, even an alternative approach in term of capabilities could

hardly disregard them. Issues related to individual preferences for public goods

would be less problematic in that case; what matters, from a capabilities per-

spective, is more an individual’s potential access to the public goods than the

utility the individual actually derives from their consumption. But the difficul-

ties in recovering individual private consumptions (especially when it comes to

nutrition or other fundamental needs) would become all the more crucial. All

in all, the problems raised by intrahousehold allocation should be central to any

analysis of inequality, even though specific aspects may be more damaging for

some approaches than for others.

   What recent developments in the literature clearly indicate, however, is that

while these problems are serious, they are by no means insuperable. Although

intra-household allocation is not (fully) observable, it can be recovered using

specific, identifying assumptions that will be discussed later; that is the path

borrowed by Lise and Seitz, but also by Chiappori, Fortin and Lacroix (2002),

Dunbar, Lewbel and Pendakur (2013), Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel (2013)

and many others in the literature. Clear progress has been made on this front

over the last decades. One goal of the present chapter is to briefly review these

advances.

   A first step is to adopt an explicit model of household decision making that

clarifies the notion of inequality within the household. Obviously, such models

must explicitly recognize that household members each have their own pref-



                                         6
erences - if only because omitting individuals does not seem a promising way

of analyzing inequality between them. An additional requirement is empirical

tractability. To be usable, a model of household behavior should fulfill a double

requirement: testability (i.e., it should generate a set of empirically testable

restrictions that fully characterize the model, in the sense that any given be-

havior is compatible with the model if and only if these conditions are satisfied)

and identifiability (it should be feasible, possibly under additional assumption,

to recover the structure of the model – in our case, individual preferences and

the decision process – from the sole observation of household behavior). Lastly,

the model should provide (or be compatible with) an ‘upstream’ theory of the

generation of intrahousehold inequality; i.e., we need to explain, and ideally

predict, how the intrahousehold distribution of resources - and ultimately of

power - responds to changes in the household’s socio-economic environment.

    Most of the recent advances use one particular class of models, based on the

collective approach.2 While other (non-unitary) perspectives have been adopted

in the literature, none of the alternatives has (so far) convincingly addressed the

double requirement of testability and identifiability just evoked.


1.2     Modeling household decision making: the collective
        model

The basic axiom of the collective approach is Pareto efficiency: whatever deci-

sion the household is making, no alternative choice would have been prefered

by all members. While this assumption is undoubtedly restrictive, its scope

remains quite large. It encompasses as particular cases many models that have

been proposed in the literature, including:

    • ‘unitary’ models, which posit that the household behaves like a single
   2 For a more detailed presentation, the reader is refered to Browning, Chiappori and Weiss

(2013)


                                             7
     decision maker; this includes simple dictatorship (possibly by a ‘benevolent

     patriarch’, as in Becker, 1974) to the existence of some household welfare

     function (as in Samuelson 1956),

   • models based on cooperative game theory, and particularly bargaining

     theory (at least in a context of symmetric information), as pioneered by

     Manser and Brown (1980) and McElroy and Horney (1981),

   • model based on market equilibrium, as analyzed by Grossbard-Shechtman

     (1993), Gersbach and Haller (2001), Edlund, and Korn (2002) and others.

   • more specific models, such as Lundberg and Pollak’s ‘separate spheres’

     (1993) framework.


   On the other hand, the collective framework excludes models based on non

cooperative game theory (at least in the presence of public good), such as those

considered by Ulph (2006), Browning, Chiappori and Lechene (2009), Lechene

and Preston (2011) and many others, as well as models of inefficient bargaining

a la Basu (2006).

   The efficiency assumption is standard in many economic contexts, and has

often been applied to household behavior. Still, it needs careful justification.

Within a static context, this assumption amounts to the requirement that mar-

ried partners will find a way to take advantage of opportunities that make both

of them better off. Because of proximity and durability of the relation, both

partners are in general aware of the preferences and actions of each other. They

can act cooperatively by reaching some binding agreement. Enforcement of such

agreements can be achieved through mutual care and trust, by social norms and

by formal legal contracts. Alternatively, the agreement can be supported by re-

peated interactions, including the possibility of punishment. A large literature

in game theory, based on several ‘folk theorems’, suggests that in such situa-


                                        8
tions, efficiency should prevail.3 At the very least, efficiency can be considered

as a natural benchmark.

    Another potential issue with a collective approach to inequality issues is of

a more conceptual nature. By definition, the collective approach is axiomatic;

it assumes specific properties of the outcome (efficiency), and leaves aside the

specific process by which this outcome has been generated. It has sometimes

been argued that one should judge differently situations that generate the same

allocations (and the same utility levels) but which are reached by different pro-

cesses. In that case, the collective approach has to be further specialized - and

this may be (and has been) done in several directions.4

    Finally, an obvious but crucial advantage of the collective model is that it

has been by now fully characterized. We have a set of necessary and sufficient

conditions for a demand function to stem from a collective framework (Chiap-

pori, Ekeland 2006); and exclusion restrictions have been derived under which

individual preferences and the decision process (as summarized by the Pareto

weights) can be recovered from the sole observation of household behavior ((Chi-

appori, Ekeland 2009a,b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only model

of the household for which similar results have been derived.5



    The next section describes the basic model. We then discuss the conceptual

issues linked with intrahousehold inequality, first in the case where all commodi-

ties are privately consumed, then in the presence of public goods, finally for the

case of domestic production. Finally, we discuss issues related to identification.
   3 Note,  however, that folks theorems essentially apply to infinitely repeated interactions.
   4 See Browning, Chiappori and Weiss (2014).
   5 Browning, Chiappori and Lechene (2009) and Lechene and Preston (2011) provide a set

of necessary conditions for non cooperative models. However, whether these conditions are
sufficient is not known; moreover, no general identification result has been derived so far.

2    The collective model: concepts, definitions,

     axioms

In what follows, we consider a K-person household that can consume several

commodities; these may include standard consumption goods and services, but

also leisure, future or contingent goods, etc. Formally, N of these commodities

are publicly consumed within the household. The market purchase of public

good j is denoted Qj ; the N -vector of public goods is given by Q. Similarly,

private goods are denoted qi with the n-vector q. Each private goods bought

is divided between the members so that member a (a = 1, ..., K) receives qia of

good i, with a qia = qi . The vector of private goods that a receives is q a , with
             P

P a                                                  1      K
                                                              
   a q = q. An allocation is a N + Kn-vector Q, q , ..., q      . The associated

market prices are given by the N -vector P and the n-vector p for public and

private goods respectively.

    We assume that each married person has her or his own preferences over

the allocation of family resources. The most general version of the model would
                                                    
consider utilities of the form U a Q, q 1 , ..., q K , implying that a is concerned

directly with all members’ consumptions. Here, however, tractability requires

additional structure. In what follows, we therefore assume that preferences are

of the caring type. That is, each individual a has a felicity function ua (Q, q a );

and a’s utlity takes the form:


             U a Q, q 1 , ..., q K = W a u1 Q, q 1 , ..., uK Q, q K ,
                                                                 
                                                                                (1)


where W a (., .) is a monotone increasing function. The weak separability of

these ‘social’ preferences represents an important moral principle; a is indifferent
                         
between bundles q b , Q that b consumes whenever b is indifferent. In this sense

caring is distinguished from paternalism. Caring rules out direct externalities


                                        10
between members because a’s evaluation of her private consumption q a does not

depend directly on the private goods that b consumes.

    Lastly, a particular but widely used version of caring is egotistic preferences,

whereby members only care about their own (private and public) consumption;

then individual preferences can be represented by felicities (i.e., utilities of the

form ua (Q, q a )).6 Note that such egotistic preferences for consumption do not

exclude non economic aspects, such as love, companionship or others. That is, a

person’s utility may be affected by the presence of other persons, but not by their

consumption. Technically, the ‘true’ preferences are of the form F a (ua (Q, q a )),

where F a may depend on marital status and on the spouse’s characteristics.

Note that the F a s will typically play a crucial role in the decision to marry and

in the choice of a partner. However, it is irrelevant for the characterization of

married individuals’ preferences over consumption bundles.

    Efficiency has a simple translation - namely, the household behaves as if it

was maximizing a weighted sum of utilities of its members. Technically, the

program is thus (assuming egotistic preferences):

                                                   X
                                   max                 µa ua (Q, q a )                      (P)
                               (Q,q 1 ,...,q K )
                                                   a


under the budget constraint:

                X              X
                                   pj qj1 + ... + qjK = y 1 + ... + y K = y
                                                     
                     Pi Qi +
                 i             j


where y a denotes a’s (non labor) income. Here, µa is the Pareto weight of
                                                          P a
member a; one may, for instance, adopt the normalization    a µ = 1. In

the particular case where µa is constant, the program above describes a uni-

tary model, since household behavior is described by the maximization of some
   6 Throughout the chapter, we assume, for convenience, that utility functions ua (.), a = 1, K

are continuously differentiable and strictly quasi-concave.



                                                   11
(price independent) utility. In general, however, µa may vary with prices and

individual incomes; the maximand in (P) is therefore price-dependent, and we

are not in a unitary framework in general.

   This program can readily be extended to caring preferences - one must simply
                                                       
replace ua (Q, q a ) with W a u1 Q, q 1 , ..., uK Q, q K in (P). In what follows,

however, (P) plays a very special role, because any allocation that is efficient

for caring preferences must be efficient for the underlying, egotistic felicities, as

stated by the following result:

Proposition 1 Assume that some allocation is Pareto-efficient for the caring
                                                                   
utilities W 1 , ..., W K . Then it solves (P) for some µ1 , ..., µK .

Proof. Assume not, then there exists an alternative allocation that gives a

larger value to ua for all a = 1, ..., K. But then that allocation also gives a

higher value to all W a s, a contradiction.

   The converse is not true, because a very unequal solution to (P) may fail

to be Pareto efficient for caring preferences: transferring resources from well

endowed but caring individuals to the poorly endowed ones may be Pareto

improving. Still, any property of the solutions to a program of the form (P)

must be satisfied by any Pareto-efficient allocation with caring preferences.

   A major advantage of the formulation (P) is that the Pareto weight has a

natural interpretation in terms of respective decision powers. The notion of

‘power’ in households may be difficult to define formally, even in a simplified

framework like ours. Still, it seems natural to expect that when two people

bargain, a person’s gain increases with the person’s power. This somewhat

hazy notion is captured very effectively by the Pareto weights. Clearly, if µa in

(P) is zero then a has no say on the final allocation, while if µa is large then a

effectively gets her way. A key property of (P) is precisely that increasing µ will

result in a move along the Pareto set, in the direction of higher utility for a. If

                                         12
we restrict ourselves to economic considerations, we may thus consider that the

Pareto weight µa ‘reflects’ a’s power, in the sense that a larger µa corresponds

to more power (and better outcomes) being enjoyed by a.
                                                         
   If Q̄ (p, P, y) , q̄ 1 (p, P, y) , ..., q̄ K (p, P, y) denotes the solution to (P), we

define the collective indirect utlity of a as the utility reached by a at the end of

the decision process; formally:


                     V a (p, P, y) = ua Q̄ (p, P, y) , q̄ a (p, P, y)
                                                                     



Note that, unlike the unitary setting, in the collective framework a member’s

collective indirect utility depends not only on the member’s preferences but also

on the decision process (hence the adjective ‘collective’). This notion is crucial

for welfare analysis, as we shall see below.

   Finally, an important concept is the notion of distribution factors. A distri-

bution factor is any variable that (i) does not affect preferences or the budget

constraint, but (ii) may influence the decision process, therefore the Pareto

weights. Think, for instance, of a bargaining model in which the agents’ respec-

tive threat points may vary. A change in the threat point of one member will

typically influence the outcome of the bargaining process, even if the household’s

budget constraint is unaffected. In particular, several tests of household behav-

ior consider the income pooling property. The basic intuition is straightforward:

in a unitary framework, whereby households behave like single decision makers

(and maximize a unique, income-independent utility), only total household in-

come should matter. Individual contributions to total income have no influence

on behavior: they are pooled in the right hand side of the household’s budget

constraint. For instance, paying a benefit to the wife rather than the husband

cannot possibly impact the household’s demand. As we shall see later, this

property has been repeatedly rejected by the data. The most natural interpre-

tation for such rejections (although not the only one) is that individual incomes

may impact the decision process (in addition to their aggregate contribution
                                                         
to the budget constraint). Technically, if y 1 , ..., y K is the vector of individ-

ual incomes and y = a y a , while total income y is not a distribution factor
                     P

(it enters the budget constraints), the (K − 1) ratios y 1 /y, ..., y K−1 /y are.7 Of

course, such a setting by no means imply that each individual consumes exactly

his or her income. On the contrary, empirical evidence strongly suggests that

transfers between family members are paramount. Whether these transfers are

progressive or regressive - i.e., whether they increase or decrease intra household

inequality - is in the end an empirical question; whether it can be answered ul-

timately depends on the extend to which these transfers can be either observed

or identified, an issue to which the end of this survey is dedicated.

    In what follows, the vector of distribution factors will be denoted z =

(z1 , ..., zS ); Pareto weights and collective indirect utilities, therefore, have the

general form µa (p, P, y, z) and V a (p, P, y, z).

      model

3.1       Private goods only: the sharing rule

We first consider a special case in which all commodities are privately consumed.

Then the household can be considered as a small economy without externalities

or private goods. From the second welfare theorem, any Pareto efficient alloca-

tion can be decentralized by adequate transfers; formally, we have the following

result:
    7 In practice, distribution factors must be uncorrelated with preferences, which, in the case

of individual incomes, can generate subtle exogeneity problems. See Browning, Chiappori and
Weiss (2014) for a detailed discussion.

y, an allocation that solves (D) for all a is Pareto-efficient.


   In words: in a private goods setting, any efficient decision can be described

as (or as if) a two-stage process. In the first stage, agents jointly decide on

the allocation of household aggregate income y between agents (and agent a

gets ρa ); in stage two, agents freely spend the share they have received. The

decision process (bargaining, for instance) takes place in the first stage; its
                                              
outcome is given by the functions ρ1 , ..., ρK , which are called the sharing

rule of the household. From a welfare perspective, there exists a one-to-one,

increasing correspondence between Pareto weights and the sharing rule, at least

when the Pareto set is strictly convex: when prices and incomes are constant,

increasing the weight of one individual (keeping the other weights unchanged)

always results in a larger share for that individual and conversely. Finally, the

collective, indirect utility takes a simple form; namely:


                            V a (p, y) = v a (p, ρa (p, y))


where v a is the standard, indirect utility of agent a. We therefore have the

following result:

Proposition 3 When all commodities are privately consumed, then for any

given price vector there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the sharing

rule and the indirect utility


   In particular, a member’s collective indirect utility can be directly computed

from the knowledge of that person’s preferences and sharing rule; given the

preferences, the sharing rule is a sufficient statistic for the entire decision process.

   Regarding the issue of intrahousehold inequality, the key remark is that the

sharing rule contains all the information required: since all agents face the same

prices, the sharing rule fully summarizes intrahousehold allocation of resources.

As such, it is directly relevant for intrahousehold inequality. Specifically, let

I (y1 , ..., yn ) be some inequality index (as a function of individual incomes).

Then the intrahousehold index of inequality is:


                        II (p, y) = I ρ1 (p, y) , ..., ρK (p, y)
                                                                   



3.2    Public and private commodities

Convenient as the previous notion may be, it still relies on a strong assumption -

namely that all commodities are privately consumed. Relaxing this assumption

is obviously necessary, if only because the existence of public consumption is

one of the motives of household formation.

   Different notions have been considered in the literature. The notion of con-

ditional sharing rule (CSR), initially introduced by Blundell, Chiappori and

Meghir (2005), refers to a two-stage process, whereby in stage one the house-

hold decides the consumption of public goods and the distribution of remaining

income between members, while in stage two members all spend their alloted

amount on private consumptions so as to maximize individual utility conditional

on the level of public consumption decided in stage 1. As before, any efficient


                                           16
decision can be represented as stemming from a two stage process of that type.

The converse, however, is not true: for any given level of public consumptions,

almost all conditional sharing rules lead to inefficient allocations. Moreover,

the monotonic relationship between sharing rule and Pareto weights is lost. In

particular, increasing a’s weight does not necessarily result in a larger value for

a’s conditional sharing rule; the intuition being that more weight to one agent

may result in a different allocation of public expenditures, which may or may

not result in an increase in the agent’s private consumption. Lastly, and more

importantly for our purpose, the conditional sharing rule may give a biased

estimate of intrahousehold inequality, because it simply disregards public con-

sumption. That this pattern could be problematic is easy to see. Assume that

one spouse (say the wife) cares a lot for a public good, while her husband cares

very little. If the structure of household demand entails a significant fraction of

expenditures being devoted to that public good, one can expect this pattern to

have an impact on any inequality measure within the household. Disregarding

public consumption altogether is therefore not an adequate approach.

   A second approach relies on an old result in public economics, stating that in

the presence of public goods, any efficient allocation can be decentralized using

personal (or Lindahl) prices for the public good. This result establishes a nice

duality between private and public goods: for the former, agents face identical

prices and purchase different quantities (the sum of which is the household’s

aggregate demand), whereas for the latter the quantity is the same for all but

prices are individual-specific (and add up to market prices).8 Again, the house-

hold behaves as if it was using a two stage process. In stage one, the household

chooses a vector of individual prices for the public goods and an allocation of

total income between members; in stage two members all spend their income

instance Donni (2009), and Cherchye et al (2007) for a revealed preferences perspective.

with a ρ∗a = y, defines a generalized sharing rule (GSR).
    P

    From an inequality perspective, this notion raises interesting issues. One

could choose to adopt ρ∗ as a description of intrahousehold inequality; indeed,

agents now maximize utility under a budget constraint in which ρ∗ describes

available income. In particular, ρ∗ is a much better indicator of the distribution

of resources than the conditional sharing rule ρ̃, because it takes into account

both private and public consumptions.

    However, the welfare of agent a is not fully described by ρ∗a ; one also needs

to know the vector P a of a’s personal prices. Technically, the collective indirect

utility of a is:

                    V a (p, P, y, z) = v a (p, P a , ρ∗a (p, P, y, z))


which depends on both ρ∗a and P a . This implies that the sole knowledge of

the GSR is not sufficient to recover the welfare level reached by a given agent,

even if her preferences are known; indeed, one laso need to know the prices,

which depend on all preferences. In particular, we believe that the level of

inequality within the household cannot be analyzed from the sole knowledge

of the generalized sharing rule. Agents now face different personal prices, and



                                              18
this should be taken into account. Of course, this conclusion was expected; it

simply reflects a basic but crucial insight - namely that if agents ‘care differently’

about the public goods (as indicated by personal prices, which reflect individual

marginal willingnesses to pay), then variations in the quantity of these public

goods have an impact on intrahousehold inequality.

   Finally, Chiappori and Meghir (2014) have recently proposed the concept

of Money Metric Welfare Index (MMWI). Formally, the MMWI of agent a,

ma (p, P, y, z), is defined by:


                        v a (p, P, ma (p, P, y, z)) = V a (p, P, y, z)


Equivalently, if ca denotes the expenditure function of agent a,then:


                        ma (p, P, y, z) = ca (p, P, V a (p, P, y, z))


   In words, ma is the monetary amount that agent a would need to reach

the utility level V a (p, P, y), if she was to pay the full price of each public good

(i.e., if she faced the price vector P instead of the personalized prices P a ).

The basic intuition is simple enough. The index is defined as the monetary

amount that would be needed to reach the same utiity level, at some reference

prices; a natural benchmark is to use the current market price for all goods,

private and public. In particular, there exists a direct relationship between the

MMWI and the standard notion of equivalent income,9 although to the best of

our knowledge, equivalent income has exclusively been applied so far to private

goods. Both approaches rely on the notion that referring to a common price

vector can facilitate interpersonal comparisons of welfare.

   Unlike the GSR, the Money Metric Welfare Index fully characterizes the

utility level reached by the agent. That is, knowing an agent’s preferences,

there is a one-to-one relationship between her utility and her MMWI, and this

relationship does not depend on the partner’s characteristics. In the pure private

goods case, the MMWI coincides with the sharing rule; it generalizes this notion

to a general setting without losing its main advantage, namely the one-to-one

relationship with welfare. Finally, it can readily be extended to allow for labor

supply and domestic production; the reader is referred to Chiappori and Meghir

(2014) for a detailed presentation.


3.3    An example

The previous concepts can be illustrated on a very simple example, borrowed

from Chiappori and Meghir (2014). Assume two agents a and b, two commodi-

ties - one private q, one public Q - and Cobb-Douglas preferences:

                                   1             α
                         ua   =       log q a +     log Q

                         ub   =       log q b +     log Q
                                  1+β           1+β

corresponding to the indirect utilities:

                                 α                         α
            va   =      log y −     log P − log (1 + α) +     log α

                                                                                                      

                         µβ (1 + α)                  1+µ                    µβ (1 + α)


   Assume, now, that µ = 1 but agents have different preferences for the public

good. For instance, α = 2 while β = .5, implying that the wife (husband) puts

two third of the weight on the public (private) consumption. In this setting, we

can analyze intrahousehold inequality using three possible indicators.

  1. If we concentrate on private consumption (or equivalently on the condi-

     tional sharing rule), we find that

                                           1                1
                                   ρ̃a =     y,     ρ̃b =     y
                                           6                3

     and we conclude that member b is much better off than a.

  2. This conclusion is clearly unsatisfactory, because it disregards the fact

     that half the budget is spent on the public good, which benefits a more

     than b. Indeed, the GSR is

                                                  y
                                      ρ∗a =         = ρ∗b
                                                  2

     and we conclude that for this indicator, the household is perfectly equal:

     the benefits of public expenditures exactly compensate differences in pri-

     vate consumptions.

  3. The later conclusion is however too optimistic, since it omits the fact that
                                                                                         2
     a ‘pays’ twice as much for the public good than b does (here, P a =                 3P
                    1
     while P b =    3 P ).   Taking this last aspect into account, the respective

                                           22
      MMWIs are:

                                     ma = .655y,       mb = .72y


      Again, b is better off than a (although by much less than with the first

      measure). In addition, one may note that


                                         ma + mb = 1. 375y


      Individual MMWIs add up to more than total income, reflecting the gain

      generated by the publicness of one commodity.


3.4       Domestic production

Finally, the previous analysis can readily be extended to domestic production.

Here, we only consider the case where all commodities are privately consumed;

for a more general presentation along similar lines, the reader is referred to

Chiappori and Meghir (2014). The household production technology is thus

described by a production function that gives the possible vector of outputs

q = f (x, τ ) that can be produced given a vector of market purchases x and the

time τ = (τ a , a = 1, K) spent in household production by each of the members.

   We first disregard the time spent by each member on domestic production.

This setting is thus identical to the general model of household production of

Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel (2003).10 Pareto efficiency translates into the

program:


                                            X
                                      max       µa ua (q a )
 10 For   empirical applications, these authors use a linear technology a la Barten.

   As before, this program can be decentralized, although decentralization now

requires specific (shadow) prices for the produced goods. Specifically, let ηi , λ

be the respective Lagrange multipliers of the production constraints in (2), and

define
                                                             ηi

Let ((q a∗ ) , a = 1, ..., K, x∗ ) denote the solutions, and define the sharing rule by


                                            ρa = π 0 q a∗




   Then the program is equivalent to a two stage process, in which q a∗ solves


                                            max ua (q a )


under the budget constraint

                                               π 0 q a = ρa




                                                        24
and x∗ solves the profit maximization problem:

                                max           πi fi xi −  pj xij

or equivalently the cost minimization one:


                                               min p0 x

                                                     X
                                         f (x) =             q a∗
                                                         a

In that case, again, individual welfare is adequately measured by the sharing

rule.

   Extending this model to domestic labor supply is straightforward. The

Pareto program is now:
                                             X

   In practice, several variants of this basic framework can be considered, de-

pending on whether the internally produced goods are marketable, and whether

(market) labor supplies are at an interior or a corner solution. These technical

issues are not without importance. For instance, a standard issue in family eco-

nomics is whether a change in the respective powers of the various members has

an impact on the intrahousehold allocation of domestic work. In the model just

described, if the produced commodities are marketable and all individuals work

on the market, then the πs and the ws must coincide with market prices and

wages; they are therefore exogenous, and individual, domestic labor supplies are

fully defined by the program (3.4), which does not depend on Pareto weights.

We conclude that, in that case, powers have no impact on domestic work, which

is fully determined by efficiency considerations. Clearly, this argument must be



                                                  26
modified when either the πs or the ws are endogenous (as will be the case if,

respectively, the commodity is not marketable or a person does not participate

to the labor market); the reader is referred to Browning, Chiappori and Weiss

(2014) for a precise discussion, as well as to the Chapter on Gender Inequality

in this Handbook.



4     The determinants of intrahousehold allocation

The second task assigned to theory is to explain the allocation of powers, hence

of resources, within the household. As such, it must address issues related to

household formation and dissolution, as well as the interaction between the

household and its environment - i.e., which external factors may impact the

intrahousehold decision process. In what follows, we concentrate on two types

of approaches, respectively based on cooperative bargaining and matching or

search theory. In a sense, this distinction reflects the classic dichotomy between

partial and general equilibrium. Bargaining models analyze, for a given house-

hold, how the particular situation of each member may affect the household

decision; much emphasis is put on individual ‘threat points’, generally consid-

ered as exogenous. Matching and search models, on the other hand, describe a

global equilibrium on the ‘market for marriage’ as a whole; while the decision

process may in some cases entail bargaining (in search models, or in matching

with a finite set of agents), the crucial distinction is that the threat points are

now endogenous - their determination is part of the equilibrium conditions.


4.1    Bargaining models

Any bargaining model requires a specific setting: in addition to the framework

described above (K agents, with specific utility functions), one has to define a

threat point T a for each individual a. Intuitively, a person’s threat point de-


                                        27
scribes the utility level this person could reach in the absence of an agreement

with the partner. Typically, bargaining models assume that the outcome of the

decision process is Pareto efficient and individually rational, in the sense that

individuals never receive less than their threat point. Bargaining theory is used

to determine how the threat points influence the location of the chosen point
                                                                
on the Pareto frontier. Clearly, if the point T = T 1 , ..., T K is outside of the

Pareto set, then no agreement can be reached, since at least one member would

lose by agreeing. However, if T belongs to the interior of the Pareto set so that

all agents can gain from the relationship, the model picks a particular point on

the Pareto utility frontier. Note that the crucial role played by threat points

- a common feature of all bargaining models - has a very natural interpreta-

tion in terms of distribution factors. Indeed, any variable that is relevant for

threat points only is a potential distribution factor. For instance, the nature

of divorce settlements, the generosity of single parent benefits or the probabil-

ity of re-marriage do not directly change a household’s budget constraint (as

long as it does not dissolve), but may affect the respective threat points of

individuals within it. Then bargaining theory implies that they will influence

the intrahousehold distribution of power in households and, ultimately, house-

hold behavior. Equivalently, one could say that these variables are distribution

factors that affect the Pareto weights.

   In practice, models based on bargaining must make a number of basic

choices. One is the bargaining concept to be used. While most frameworks

refer to Nash bargaining, some works either adopt Kalai-Smorodinski or refer

to a non cooperative bargaining model. Second, one must choose a relevant

threat point. This part is crucial; indeed, a result due to Chiappori, Donni

and Komunjer (2010) states that any Pareto efficient allocation can be derived

as the Nash bargaining solution for an ad hoc definition of the threat points.



                                          28
Hence any additional information provided by the bargaining concepts (besides

the sole efficiency assumption) must come from specific hypotheses on the threat

points - that is, on what is meant by the sentence: ‘no agreement is reached’.

Several ideas have been used in the literature. One is to refer to divorce as

the ‘no agreement’ situation. Then the threat point is defined as the maximum

utility a person could reach after divorce. Such an idea seems well adapted when

one is interested, say, in the effects of laws governing divorce on intrahousehold

allocation. It is probably less natural when minor decisions are at stake: choos-

ing who will walk the dog is unlikely to involve threats of divorce.11 Another

interesting illustration would be public policies such as single parent, or the

guaranteed employment programs that exist in some Indian states; Kanbur and

Haddad (1992) convincingly argued that the main impact of the program was

to change the opportunities available to the wife outside marriage.

    A second idea relies on the presence of public goods and the fact that non-

cooperative behavior typically leads to inefficient outcomes. The idea, then, is

to take the non-cooperative outcome as the threat point: in the absence of an

agreement, both members provide the public good(s) egotistically, not taking

into account the impact of their decision on the other member’s welfare. This

version captures the idea that the person who would suffer more from this lack

of cooperation (the person who has the higher valuation for the public good)

is likely to be more willing to compromise in order to reach an agreement. A

variant, proposed by Lundberg and Pollak (1993), is based on the notion of

’separate spheres’. The idea is that each partner is assigned a set of public

goods to which they alone can contribute; this is their ‘sphere’ of responsibility

or expertise. These spheres are determined by social norms. Then the threats

consist of continued marriage in which the partners act non-cooperatively and
  11 Anadditional difficulty is empirical. The estimation of utility in case of divorce is delicate,
since most data sets allow us to estimate (at best) an ordinal representation of preferences,
whereas Nash bargaining requires a cardinal representation. See Chiappori (1991)



                                                29
each chooses independently the level of public goods under their domain.

   Finally, it must be reminded that assumptions on threat points tend to be

strong, not grounded on strong theoretical arguments, and often not indepen-

dently testable. This suggests that models based on bargaining should be used

parsimoniously and with care.


4.2    Equilibrium models

Alternatively, one can consider the ‘market for marriage’ as a whole from a gen-

eral perspective. Two types of models can be found in the literature, that make

opposite assumptions on the role of frictions in the matching game. Specifi-

cally, models based on matching (with transferable or imperfectly transferable

utility, TU and ITU respectively) assume away frictions and consider perfectly

smooth markets, while models based on search emphasize the importance of

frictions in the emergence of marital patterns. In what follows, and for the sake

of brevity, we concentrate on matching models; while search-based approaches

use a different technology, their scope and outcomes are largely similar for what

we are concerned with here. Moreover, we shall only discuss models based on

transferable utility (TU). The non transferable utility (NTU) framework, which

assumes away any transfer between members, is not relevant here; and although

more general approaches, based on imperfectly transferable utility (ITU), have

recently been developed (see Chiappori, 2012), the distinction between TU and

ITU can basically be disregarded for our current purpose.

   Consider two populations (men and women); each individual is defined by

a vector of characteristics, denoted x ∈ X for women and y ∈ Y for men;

each set is endowed with a finite measure, denoted µX and µY respectively.

When matched, Mrs. x and Mr. y jointly generate a surplus s (x, y), which

can be derived from a more structural framework (e.g., a collective model). A



                                       30
matching is defined by (i) a measure µ on the set X × Y , the marginals of

which coincide with µX and µY , and (ii) two functions u (x) and v (y) such

that u (x) + v (y) = s (x, y) on the support of µ. Intuitively, the measure µ

defines who marries whom, while the functions determines how the surplus is

divided within couples who are matched with positive probability - she gets

u (x), he gets v (y). A matching is stable if (i) no married person would prefer

being single, and (ii) no pair of currently unmarried persons would both prefer

forming a new couple. Technically, this is equivalent to:


                      u (x) + v (y) ≥ s (x, y) for all (x, y)


   The functions u (x) and v (y) are crucial, since they fully determine the

intrahousehold inequality. The key feature of matching models is that these

functions are endogenous. They are determined (or constrained) as part of the

equilibrium, and depend on the whole matching game structure; in particular,

the allocation within any given couple depends on the entire distribution of

characteristics in the two populations. In that sense, the model does provide an

endogenous determination of intrahousehold inequality. Note, however, that in

this abstract presentation, their exact interpretation is undetermined; depending

on the framework, u (x) can be a monetary amount, the consumption of some

commodity, or the utility generated by the consumption of bundles of private

and public commodities. For instance, the simple framework used by Chiappori

and Weiss (2007) consider an economy with two commodities, one private and

one public within the household, and agents with Cobb-Douglas preferences

ua = q a Q; x and y are one-dimensional and denote male and female income. In

this TU framework, any efficient allocation maximizes the sum of utilities; i.e.,




                                        31
a (x, y) couple solves


                             q 1 + q 2 Q under q 1 + q 2 + Q = x + y

and the surplus s (x, y) is the value of this program, namely (x + y) /4. Here,

u (x) and v (y) are utilities, although there exists a one-to-one correspondance

between utilities and transfers (since Q = (x + y) /2, we have that q 1 = 2u (x) / (x + y) , q 2 =

2v (y) / (x + y)).

   From a mathematical point of view, a basic result states that if a matching

is stable, then the corresponding measure maximizes total surplus over the set

of measures whose the marginals coincide with µX and µY . That is, the measure

µ must solve:
                                       Z
                                 max         s (x, y) dµ (x, y)                  (2)
                                  µ    X×Y

under the marginal conditions. This maximization problem is linear in its un-

known µ. Therefore, it admits a dual, which can be written as:

                             Z                      Z
                       min        u (x) dµX (x) +        v (y) dµY (y)
                       u,v    X                      Y


under the constraints


                             u (x) + v (y) ≥ s (x, y) ∀ (x, y)                   (3)


Here, functions u and v are the dual variables of the program. But, crucially,

they can be interpreted as describing the utility reached by each individual

at the optimal matching; in particular, they define the allocation of surplus

between (matched) spouses. Note that conditions (3) of the dual program are

exactly the stability conditions (4.2).

   From standard, duality results, a solution to the dual exists if and only if


                                              32
the primal has a solution, and the values are then the same. It follows that

the existence of a stable match - i.e., of functions uand v satisfying (4.2) -

boils down to the existence of a solution to the linear maximization problem

(2). This allows to establish existence under very general conditions; see for

instance Chiappori, McCann and Nesheim (2010).

    Regarding uniqueness, if the sets X and Y are finite, then the us and vs

are not pinned down, although the equilibrium conditions generate constraints.

However, with continuous, atomless populations, the functions are in general

fully determined by the equilibrium conditions. The intuition is straightfor-

ward: in the continuous case, each individual has almost perfect substitutes,

and (local) competition determines exactly the surplus sharing that must exist

at equilibrium. Finally, stochastic versions of these models can be considered,

in which some of the individual characteristics are unobserved (to the econome-

trician); see for instance the recent survey by Chiappori and Salanié (2013).



5     Identification

While the conceptual tools just presented help clarifying some of the issues

involved, their empirical content must be very carefully considered. As said

before, there is no point putting much emphasis on a concept that cannot pos-

sibly be identified from existing data. This section summarizes the main results

obtained on this issue over the last two decades; for a detailed presentation, the

reader is referred to Chiappori and Ekeland (2009).

    We divide the presentation into three subsection. One considers the ‘pure’

identification problem. Assume that the entire demand function of a household

can be observed; what can be recovered from such data (and such data only)?

Next, we introduce additional identifying assumptions; broadly speaking, these

postulate a relationship between an individual’s preferences as a single and as


                                       33
part of a household; in other words, we admit that some information about

spouses’ utilities can be derived from the observation of the behavior of sin-

gle persons. Lastly, we introduce a general, market-wide perspective, and ask

whether (and how) equilibrium conditions on the marriage market can help

identifying the intrahousehold allocation process.


5.1     ‘Pure’ identification in the collective model

Identification issues in the collective model have been extensively studied during

the recent years; the interested reader is refered to Chiappori and Ekeland

(2009a, b) for an exhaustive presentation. In what follows, we briefly summarize

some key findings.

   We start with the basic framework described above, assuming egotistic pref-

erences of the type ua (Q, q a ); also, for the sake of brevity, we assume only two

persons (‘spouses’) in the household, although the generalization to any number

is straightforward. In what follows, we assume that we observe the household’s

‘aggregate’ demand, i.e. the vector (q, Q) ∈ Rn+N (where qi =
                                                                   P a
                                                                     a qi , i =

1, ..., n) as a function of prices (p, P ) and total income y, plus possibly a vector

of distribution factors z. Remember that the collective indirect utility of agent

a is defined as the utility level a will reach at the end of the decision process,

as a function of (p, P, y, z).


5.1.1   Main identification result

Assume, first, that we observe the demand function of some household. This

demand is aggregated at the household level; i.e., what we observe is the house-

hold’s total demand for any private commodity, together with its demand for

public goods. However, in general, we are not able to observe the internal alloca-

tion of the private goods between household member. When is this information



                                         34
sufficient to recover the underlying structure - i.e., preferences and the decision

process (as summarized by the Pareto weights)?

   A first answer is provided by a result due to Chiappori and Ekeland (2009a).

It states that, generically, all what is needed is one exclusion restriction per

agent; i.e., for any agent a, there should be some commodity that a does not

consume (and which does not enter a’s egoistic utility). Then the local knowl-

edge of the household demand allows to exactly (locally) identify each agent’s

collective indirect utility, irrespective of the number of private and public goods.

Formally:


Theorem 4 (Chiappori, Ekeland 2009) Assume N + n ≥ 4. Consider a point
            
 p̄, P̄ , ȳ such that the conditional sharing rule satisfies the condition

                            ∂ρa           
                                p̄, Q̄, ȳ 6= 0, a = 1, 2
                            ∂y

                        
where Q̄ = Q p̄, P̄ , ȳ . Assume that for each member, there exists at least

one good not consumed by this member (but consumed by the other). Then
                                                            
generically there exists an open neighborhood of p̄, P̄ , ȳ on which the indirect

collective utility of each member is exactly (ordinally) identifiable from house-

hold demand. For any cardinalization of indirect collective utilities, the Pareto

weights are exactly identifiable.

Proof. For a precise proof, see Chiappori and Ekeland 2009a. The underlying

intuition is that if commodity i is not consumed by agent y, then any impact of

its price on that agent’s behavior can only operate through the decision process,

i.e. the Pareto weights. The resulting conditions, which are reminiscent of

separability restrictions in standard consumer theory, are sufficient in general

to fully recover the (ordinal) indirect collective utility of each member, as well

as, for any choice of cardinalization, the corresponding Pareto weights.



                                         35
   The specific nature of the identification result can be simply illustrated on a

Cobb-Douglas example, described below. Before considering it, a few remarks

are in order. First, the identification result stated in Theorem 4 is only local.

This is important because additional constraints of a global nature (such as

non negativity restrictions on consumption), which are not considered in this

result, typically provide additional identification power; a precise illustration

will be given below. Second, the result does not require distribution factors.

Again, the later would allow a stronger identification result. Indeed, Chiappori

and Ekeland show that in the presence of distribution factors, the exclusivity

requirement can be relaxed; one only need either one excluded good (instead of

two) or an assignable commodity.12 Third, identification requires the observa-

tion of the household demand as a function of prices and income; in particular,

price variations are crucial. While this fact is not surprising - even in standard

consumer theory, preferences cannot be recovered from demand without price

variations - it has important empirical applications, since data entailing signif-

icant (and credibly exogenous) price variations are not easy to find. However,

recent approaches relax this requirement by imposing additional structure on

the decision process; they will be discussed below.

   Fourth, the identification result above is only generic: it may fail to hold

in particular cases, although such cases are not robust to ‘small variations’.

Quite interestingly, one of the situations in which identification does not obtain

is the unitary model. To see why, consider program (P) above, and assume

that the Pareto weights µa are all constant. For one thing, we are in a unitary

context: the household maximizes the sum a µa ua (Q, q a ), which is a price-
                                             P

and income-independent utility. More importantly, Hicks’s aggregation theorem

applies. If we define U by
 12 A
    good is assignable when it is consumed by both members, and the consumption of each
member is independently observed.




                                          36
                                                  X
                          U (Q, q) = Pmax
                                        a
                                                      µa ua (Q, q a )      (UHicks)
                                       a   q =q
                                                  a

then the household maximizes U under the budget constraint. By standard

integration, U can be recovered from the household demand. However, this

is not sufficient to identify individual preferences: there exists a continuum

of different sets of individual utilities that generate the same U by (UHicks).

The paradox, here, is that the unitary model, which used to be the dominant

framework for empirical works on household behavior, belongs to the small

(actually non generic) class of frameworks for which individual welfare cannot

be identified from household demand.

   Lastly, it is important to note that what is identified is the indirect collective

utility of each member. From a welfare perspective, this is the only relevant

concept, since it fully characterizes the utility reached by each agent. However,

the inequality measures described above require more - namely, an assessment

of the intrahousehold allocation of income. We now consider to what extent the

latter can be recovered from the indirect collective utility.


5.1.2   Private goods and the sharing rule

We start with the case in which all commodities are private. In that case,

the various concepts (conditional sharing rule, generalized sharing rule, money

metric welfare index) coincide with the sharing rule, and the collective indirect

utility takes the form:


                             V a (p, y) = v a (p, ρa (p, y))


where, as above, v a is a’s indirect utility and ρ is the sharing rule. If we assume

that the first (respectively the second) good is exclusively consumed by the



                                            37
second (first) agent, the collective indirect utility of each agent is identified (as

always, up to some increasing transform).


Local identification        A first result states that the sharing rule is not fully

identified from the knowledge of the collective indirect utility, at least locally;

identification only obtains up to an additive function of the prices of the non

exclusive goods. Formally, assume that one observes the functions (q1 , ...qn ) of

(p, y), with p ∈ Rn and:


          q1 (p, y)    = χa1 (p, ρ (p, y))

          q2 (p, y)    = χb2 (p, y − ρ (p, y))                                    (4)

           qi (p, y)   = χai (p, ρ (p, y)) + χbi (y − ρ (p, y)) , i = 3, ..., n


where the functions χsi and ρ are unknown. Then:

                                                                                      
Proposition 5 (Chiappori, Ekeland 2009) Assume n ≥ 3 , and let χ̄a1 , ..., χ̄bn , ρ̄
                                                    
solve (4). For any other solution χa1 , ..., χbn , ρ , there exist a φ : Rn−2 → R such

that:


                         ρ (p, y)   = ρ̄ (p, y) + φ (p3 , ..., pn )

                          χai (ρ)   = χ̄ai (ρ − φ (p3 , ..., pn ))                (5)

                          χbj (ρ)   = χ̄bj (ρ + φ (p3 , ..., pn ))


Moreover, overidentifying restrictions are generated.


   The basic conclusion is thus that the sharing rule is identified up to an

additive function, which cannot be pinned down unless either all commodities

are assignable or individual preferences are known (for instance, from data on

singles). To see why, consider the simple case of three private commodities;


                                             38
two of these are exclusive (for members a and b respectively), while the third is

consumed by both. Individual consumptions of commodity 3 are not observed,

and its price is taken as numeraire. In practice, we observe two demand functions

q1a and q2b that satisfy:


                     q1a (p1 , p2 , y)   = q̃ a (p1 , ρ (p1 , p2 , y))         (6)

                     q2b (p1 , p2 , y)   = q̃ b (p2 , y − ρ (p1 , p2 , y))     (7)


where q̃ s denotes the Marshallian demand by person s. Now, for some constant

K, define ρK , uaK and ubK by:


                        ρK (p1 , p2 , y)     = ρ (p1 , p2 , y) + K

                            uaK (q1a , q3a ) = uaK (q1a , q3a − K)

                            ubK q2b , q3b    = ubK q2b , q3b + K
                                                                



It is easy to check that the Marshallian demands derived from ρK , uaK and ubK

satisfy (6) and (7). The intuition is illustrated in Figure 2 in the case of a.

Switching from ρ and ua to ρK and uaK does two things. First, the sharing

rule and the intercept of the budget constraint are shifted downward by K.

Second, all indifference curves are also shifted downward by the same amount.

When only demand for commodity 1 (on the horizontal axis) is observable, these

models are empirically indistinguishable. Lastly, with several, non exclusive

goods, this construct is still possible, and the constant may in addition vary

with non exclusive prices in an arbitrary way.

   Two remarks can be made about this result. One is that the indetermination

is not welfare relevant; one can easily check that the different solutions corre-

spond to the same collective indirect utilities for each agent. This is the paradox

evoked in introduction. Unlike standard consumer theory, there is no longer an

                                        Figure 2:



equivalence between identifying direct and indirect utilities. Indirect utilities

are identified as soon as the exclusion restrictions are satisfied; but they may

correspond to various, welfare equivalent direct utilities, each of them associated

with a specific sharing rule.


Global restrictions The second remark is that the non identification result

is only local. In particular, it disregards additional, global restrictions such as

non negativity constraints. If these are added, then more precise identification

obtains. For instance, consider (5), and add the restrictions that


                                     ρ (p, 0) = 0 ∀p


which stems from non negativity of consumption at very low income levels.

Then φ is exactly pinned down:


                                φ (p3 , ..., pn ) = −ρ̄ (p, 0)


                                             40
and additional, overidentifying restrictions are generated (e.g., ∂ ρ̄ (p, 0) /∂pi = 0

for i = 1, 2).

   This result should be related to recent work on the estimation of the sharing

rules based on a revealed preference approach (see for instance Cherchye et al

2012, Cherchye et al. 2014). Since the revealed preference approach is global

by nature, it can generate bounds on the sharing rule, which can actually be

quite narrow. In all cases, the global restrictions are generated at one end of

the distribution of expenditures, so their use for identifying the sharing rule

outside this range should be submitted to the usual caution. Still, they tend to

considerably reduce the scope of the non identification conclusion.


5.1.3    Public goods only

We now consider the opposite polar case, in which all commodities (but the

exclusive ones) are public. That is, utilities are now of the form:


                    U a (Q1 , Q3 , ...QN ) and U b (Q2 , Q3 , ...QN )


Note that the exclusive commodities 1 and 2 can be considered as either public

or private.

   In that case, the collective indirect utility has a simple form; namely,


                        V a (P, y)   = U a (Q1 , Q3 , ...QN )

                        V b (P, y)   = U b (Q2 , Q3 , ...QN )


The crucial remark is that the demands for public goods (as functions of prices

and total income) are empirically observed. An important consequence is that,

in general, the knowledge of indirect collective utilities is equivalent to that of

direct utilities. To see why, normalize y to be 1 (by homogeneity), and take a


                                           41
point at which the Jacobian matrix DP (Q1 , Q2 , ...QN ) is of full rank. By the

implicit function theorem, we can locally invert the function, thus defining P as

a function of Q; but then:


   U a (Q1 , Q3 , ...QN )   = V a (P1 (Q1 , Q2 , ...QN ) , ..., PN (Q1 , Q2 , ...QN ) , 1)

   U b (Q2 , Q3 , ...QN )   = V b (P1 (Q1 , Q2 , ...QN ) , ..., PN (Q1 , Q2 , ...QN ) , 1)


which proves identification. In addition, overidentifying restrictions are gener-

ated. In particular, we see that, in this context, Lindahl prices for all goods

- therefore the MMWIs - are exactly identified. Somewhat paradoxically, the

pure public good case appears to be the one in which identification is least

problematic...


5.1.4    The general case

Finally, the general case is a direct generalization of the two particular cases just

described. The exclusion restrictions described above guarantee identification

of the collective indirect utility of each agent. Then the exact intra household

allocation is locally identified up to an additive function of the prices of the non

exclusive private goods. Moreover, global restrictions (e.g. non negativity) allow

exact identification in general. The interested reader is referred to Chiappori

and Ekeland (2009 a, b) for detailed statements.


5.1.5    A Cobb-Douglas example

The previous discussions can be illustrated on a simple example, borrowed from

Chiappori and Ekeland (2009a). Consider individual preferences of the LES

to n are private while commodities n + 1 to N are public. Also, given the LES

form, it is convenient to assume that the household maximizes the weighted sum

µU a + (1 − µ) U b , where the Pareto weight µ has the simple, linear form:

where ci = cai +cbi and Y = y − i,s pi csi − j Pj Cj . The household demand
                               P            P

is thus a direct generalization of the standard LES, with additional quadratic

terms in y 2 and cross terms in ypi and yPj , plus terms involving the distribution

factor z.

   A first remark is that cai and cbi cannot be individually identified from group

demand, since the latter only involves their sum ci . As a consequence, the

various generalizations of the sharing rule will only be identified up to one

additive constant, a result mentioned earlier. Also, the constant is welfare

irrelevant; indeed, the collective indirect utilities of the wife and the husband

are (up to an increasing transform):

which does not depend on the csi . Secondly, the form of aggregate demands

is such that private and public goods have exactly the same structure. We

                      πi = pi for i ≤ n, πi = Pi                     for n < i ≤ N


so that the group demand has the simple form:

   It is clear, on this form, that the distinction between private and public

goods can be ignored. This illustrates an important remark: while the ex ante

knowledge of the public versus private nature of each good is necessary for the

identifiability result to hold in general, for many parametric forms it is actually

not needed.


Identifiability: the general case The question, now, is whether the empir-

ical estimation of the form (9) allows us to recover the relevant parameters -

namely, the αis , the γ i , and the µα . We start by rewriting (9) as:

                                                                         

                                + αia − αib (µy y + µz z)                              m

   The right hand side of (10) can in principle be econometrically identified; we

can thus recover the coefficients of the variables, namely y, y 2 , yz, the πm and

the products yπm and zπm . For any i and any m 6= i, the ratio of the coefficient

of y by that of πm gives γ m ; the γ m are therefore vastly overidentified. However,

the remaining coefficients are identifiable only up to an arbitrary choice of two

of them. Indeed, an empirical estimation of the right hand side of (10) can only

recover for each j the respective coefficients of y, y 2 and yz, that is the three

expressions:


                           Kyj   = αjb + αja − αjb µ0
                                                  

                           j
                                 = αja − αjb µy
                                            
                          Kyy
                           j
                                 = αja − αjb µz
                                            
                          Kyz                                                  (11)


Now, pick up two arbitrary values for µ0 and µy , with µy 6= 0. The last two
                          
expressions give αja − αjb and µz ; the first gives αjb therefore αja .

   As expected, a continuum of different models generate the same aggregate

demand. Moreover, these differences are welfare relevant, in the sense that the

individual welfare gains of a given reform (say, a change in prices and incomes)

will be evaluated differently by different models. In practice, the collective

indirect utilities recovered above are not invariant across the various structural

models compatible with a given aggregate demand.

   A unitary version of the model obtains when the Pareto weights are constant:

µy = µz = 0. Then Kyz
                   j
                      = 0 for all j (since distribution factors cannot matter),
       j
and Kyy  = 0 for all j (demand must be linear in y, since a quadratic term would
                                                         
violate Slutsky). We are left with Kyj = αjb + αja − αjb µ0 , and it is obviously

impossible to identify independently αja , αjb and µ0 ; as expected, the unitary

framework is not identifiable.




                                        46
Identification under exclusion We now show that in the non-unitary ver-

sion of the collective framework, an exclusion assumption per member is suf-

ficient to exactly recover all the (welfare-relevant) coefficients. Assume that

member a does not consume commodity 1 and member b does not consume

commodity 2; that is, α1a = α2b = 0. Then equations (11) give:


                  α1b 1 − µ0 = Ky1 , −α1b µy = Kyy
                                                1
                                                   , −α1b µz = Kyz
                                                                1
                            



and:

                      α2a µ0 = Ky2 , α2a µy = Kyy
                                               2
                                                  , α2a µz = Kyz
                                                              2



Combining the first two equations of each block and assuming µy 6= 0, we get:

                         1 − µ0     Ky1           µ0   Ky2
                                = −     and          =
                           µy        1
                                    Kyy           µy    2
                                                       Kyy

                         1
therefore, assuming Ky2 Kyy        2
                            − Ky1 Kyy 6= 0

                  1 − µ0     Ky1 Kyy
                                  2
                                          0
                                                        1
                                                   Ky2 Kyy
                         = −         and µ  =
                    µ0       Ky2 Kyy
                                  1           Ky2 Kyy
                                                   1 − K 1K 2
                                                          y yy


It follows that
                                 2            2  1
                                Kyy         Kyy Kyy
                         µy =     2
                                    µ0 = 2 1
                                Ky      Ky Kyy − Ky1 Kyy
                                                      2


and all other coefficients can be computed as above. It follows that the col-

lective indirect utility of each member can be exactly recovered, which allows

for unambiguous welfare statements. As mentioned above, identifiability is only

generic in the sense that it requires Ky2 Kyy
                                           1
                                              − Ky1 Kyy
                                                     2
                                                        6= 0. Clearly, the set of

parameters values violating this condition is of zero measure. Also, identifiabil-

ity requires µy 6= 0; in particular, it does not hold true in the unitary version, in

which µy = µz = 0. Indeed, the same exclusion restrictions property as above



                                         47
                                
only allow to recover α1b 1 − µ0 = Ky1 and α2a µ0 = Ky2 ; this is not sufficient

to identify µ0 , let alone the αji for j ≥ 3. This confirms that the unitary ver-

sion of the model is not identified even under the exclusivity assumptions that

guarantee generic identifiability in the general version.

   Finally, one can readily check the previous claim that the MMWIs are not

identified. Indeed, the MMWI ms of s is defined by:
                                                      !

5.2     Comparing different family sizes

A second approach enlarges the set of usable information by allowing com-

parisons between families of different composition. A first idea is to assume

some relationship between individual preferences when married and single. In



                                                     48
that sense, the ‘pure’ approach just described relies on an extreme version,

since it does not postulate any link between utilities when married and single;

hence, knowledge of an individual’s preferences when single brings no informa-

tion about her tastes within the household. At the other extreme, some models

assume that preferences are unaffected by marital status, at least ordinally. This

means that if uaS (Q, q a ) denotes a’s utility when single, then her utility when

married takes the form:


                            ua (Q, q a ) = F (uaS (Q, q a ))


where F is an increasing transform. Thus marriage can directly affect a person’s

utility level, but not the person’s marginal rates of substitution between various

commodities. Note that if we assume preferences are unaffected by marital

status, then the MMWI defined above has a natural interpretation; namely,

it is the level of income that would be needed by the individual, if single, to

reach the same utility level as what she currently gets within marriage. It must

however be stressed that the assumption of constant preferences across marital

status is not needed for the definition of the index, but only for this particular

interpretation.

   Various, intermediate approaches can be found in the literature. One, mostly

used in a labor supply context, only assumes that some preference parameters

are common to singles and households, and can therefore be estimated separately

on a sample of singles. In general, this is sufficient to identify (or calibrate) the

remaining parameters (relevant for marriage-specific preferences and the Pareto

weights) on observed labor supplies of men and women in a sample of couples.

This approach has been adopted in a series of papers recently published in the

Review of Economics of the Household (Bargain et al., 2006; Beninger et al.,

2006; Myck et al., 2006; Vermeulen et al., 2006). For instance, consider a model


                                          49
of labor supply in a couple in which the utility of agent a takes the form:


ua q a , La , Lb = αa ln (q a − q̄ a )+β a ln La − L̄a +γ a ln La − L̄a ln Lb − L̄b
                                                                                 



where L denotes leisure; note that this form is more general than the ones

considered above, since it allows for (positive) externalities of leisure within the

couple.13 The α and β parameters are assumed to be independent of marital

status, and are therefore identified from a sample of singles; the γs and the

Pareto weights are then calibrated from data on households.

   An intermediate approach, that relies on the notion of domestic produc-

tion, has recently been proposed by Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel (2013).

It posits that agents, when they get married, keep the same preferences but can

access a different (and generally more productive) technology. That is, while

the basic rates of substitution between consumed commodities remains unaf-

fected by marriage (or cohabitation), the relationship between purchases and

consumptions is not; therefore, the structure of demand, including for exclusive

commodities (consumed only by one member) is different from what it would be

for singles. More generally, one can, following Dunbar, Lewbel and Pendakur

(2012), only assume that preferences are unaffected by family composition; e.g.,

that parents’ preferences regarding their own consumption does not depend on

the number of children. These approaches are described in the next section.


5.3    Identifying from market equilibrium

Lastly, a series of recent contributions are aimed at taking to data the equi-

librium approaches described above. The basic, theoretical intuition is quite

straightforward: the equilibrium conditions on the marriage market (with or

without search frictions, but with intrahousehold transfers) either constrain or
 13 Equivalently,   this approach considers both leisures as public goods within the household.



                                               50
exactly pin down intrahousehold allocations. Several papers propose an em-

pirical implementation of this idea. A first set of works only consider match-

ing patterns; the marriage market equilibrium is then exclusively characterized

by a matrix of intermarriages between various categories, which can be de-

fined by age, education, income or any combination of these. On the matching

front, following the initial contribution by Choo and Siow (2006), Chiappori,

Salanié and Weiss (2012) have shown how a structural, parametric model can

be (over)identified from such patterns, under the assumption that, while the

surplus generated by marriage may (and does) vary over time, its supermod-

ularity (which drives the extent of assortative matching in the population) is

constant.14 According to their estimate, while the gain from marriage have

globally decreased over the last decades, the decline has been much smaller for

educated couples. Moreover, the share of household resources received has in-

creased for college educated wives, resulting in a strong increase in their ‘marital

college premium’ (defined as the additional gain provided by university educa-

tion on the marriage market). This is compatible with the theoretical analysis

of Chiappori, Iyigun and Weiss (2009), who argued that the asymmetry be-

tween male and female marital college premium could explain (at least in part)

the higher demand for university training by women. Alternatively, Jacquemet

and Robin (2013) and Goussé (2013) analyze marital patterns from a search

perspective.

   A clear limitation of these approaches is that the sole observation of marital

patterns conveys only limited information on the form of the marital surplus

(therefore on distribution). For instance, knowing that matching is assortative

only tells us that the surplus is supermodular. The previous approaches, there-

fore, must rely on strong and largely untestable assumptions on the precise form

Chiappori and Salanié (2014).




                                          51
of the heterogeneity distribution across couples. Adding information on trans-

fers would greatly enhance the identification power of these models. But such

information is precisely what collective models can provide, based on observed

behavior. The intuition, here, is that the observation of, say, labor supply pat-

terns of married couples (which reflects intrahousehold transfers), together with

that of marital patterns, should allow to fully identify a general matching model

in a very robust way. This line of research is pursued, in a series of paper, by

Chiappori, Costa Dias and Meghir (2014a, b).



6     Empirical findings

In this section we review some empirical work based on the collective model and

emphasizing the identification of the sharing rule.

    The first generation models used information on private and assignable goods

such as consumption of clothing or individual leisure to identify the sharing rule

up to a constant. These models adopt mainly two approaches for identification.

The first approach refers to what we called ‘pure’ identification; i.e., it recovers

the derivatives of the sharing rule with no further information than observed

consumption bundles of the household. As discussed above, while some identify-

ing conditions can be relaxed by using distribution factors, these models cannot

identify separately the level of sharing (how much goes to each household mem-

ber) from preferences. There exist a continuum of allocations of resources, each

associated to a utility function for each household member, that fit the data

equally well; across these allocations, income inequality within the household is

different, although the allocation of welfare to each member remains the same.

    To identify the way overall resources are allocated and thus measure inequal-

ity, one needs more information, either in terms of identifying assumptions on

the behavior of the sharing rule (such as non-negativity conditions discussed


                                        52
earlier) or assumptions on preferences. One possibility is to compare the be-

havior of married and single individuals by making assumptions on the way

preferences change with marriage. Other approaches involve specific restric-

tions on preferences. We show how some of these approaches have been used

in the literature. Finally we also consider the information content of revealed

preference restrictions. These extend the revealed preference arguments for in-

dividual choice to the case of collective households. Clearly this is a much more

complicated setup than standard revealed preference restrictions for individuals

or for unitary households because the aggregate household does not necessar-

ily behave like a rational single agent. We discuss what can be learned from

revealed preference in this context.

   However, the issue of identification of the sharing rule is deeper than what is

suggested by the use of the restrictions above and has to do with the way people

make agreements at the point of marriage and the level of commitment associ-

ated with these agreements. In other words, fundamentally the sharing rule is

identified from behavior without having to impose possibly ad hoc restrictions.

Identification requires extending the model to include marital decisions in an

equilibrium context. Indeed a marriage market equilibrium will define the shar-

ing rule and conditions in the marriage market can allow us to identify it. This

effectively introduces dynamics, which then allows one to delve deeper into the

extent of commitment and what this means about within household inequality.

Characterizing the theoretical and empirical power of using marriage market

data to understand better intrahousehold allocations is is a relatively new and

active area of research, particularly when limited commitment is allowed for.

   Before we discuss the empirical literature we need to introduce a distinction

between the concept of identifiably of preferences and the sharing rule on the

one hand and econometric identification on the other. The identifiability re-



                                       53
sults discussed above relate to our ability to recover individual preferences and

the sharing rule given we know the household level demand functions exactly.

Empirical analysis is concerned with estimating these household demands from

empirical data so as to be able to then recover the sharing rule. This issue

brings forth all the standard econometric concerns, such as the role of unob-

served heterogeneity, the endogeneity of wages, prices and income, corner so-

lutions (particularly in labor supply) etc. One of the hardest issues concerns

the way that unobserved heterogeneity enters household demands, particularly

if such unobservables are correlated with observables. The specific issue arises

from the fact that, in general, unobserved heterogeneity in preferences will im-

ply unobservables in the sharing rule. In most specifications this will mean that

unobservables are non separable from observables, with implications for econo-

metric identification. For example, Blundell, Chiappori, Magnac and Meghir

(2007) used linearity to bypass the difficulties implied by unobserved hetero-

geneity in preferences. Here we are not offering any general solution to the

problem, but we need to point out that, before we even consider identification

of the sharing rule, an empirical approach would have to solve the standard

econometric identification issues, which in this context may be severe.15


6.1     ‘Pure’ identification of the sharing rule

In this first generation of collective models we can point to three main empir-

ical studies. The first is by Browning, Bourguignon, Chiappori and Lechene

(1994, BBCL); the second is by Chiappori, Fortin and Lacroix (2002, CFL)

and the third by Blundell, Chiappori, Magnac and Meghir (2007, BCMM). All

three share a similar approach to identification: they assume efficiency and an

assignable good. However, the details of the empirical approach differ.
  15 For recent attempts in this direction (including a discussion of the specific difficulties it

raises), see for instance Lewbel and Pendakur (2013) and Chiappori and Kim (2013).



                                               54
   In BBCL the authors use a sample of couples drawn from the Canadian

FAMEX and estimate a model for the demand of mens’ and women’s clothing,

and identify the sharing rule, up to a constant. Identification relies on two

assumptions: first clothing is an assignable good, which effectively means that

we can observe male and female clothing and that only the person using the

clothing derives any utility from it. In other words clothing does not include

a public good element. Second they assume that the distribution of partner’s

income does not affect preferences, but may enter the sharing rule, reflecting

bargaining positions. Given these assumptions they identify a sharing rule as a

function of the age difference of the partners, total household expenditure (thus

allowing wealth effects in the way resources are shared) and most importantly

the share of income attributable to the female partner. It turns out that the

effect of the way resources are distributed between couples is not very sensitive

to the proportion of income for which they are accountable. For example going

from a share of income of 25% to 75% raises the share of household expenditure

by a significant but small 2.3%. The age difference and the level of expendi-

ture also matter with relatively older individuals gaining more and wealthier

households allocating more to the wife.

   The BBCL paper shows the potential of the approach and the richness of the

empirical results that can be obtained by judicious use of information reflect-

ing bargaining power of households. However, the main determinant of female

bargaining power in their model is the relative magnitude of female income. A

higher share of income may reflect her relative skills or alternatively it may re-

flect her decision to forgo leisure and work more; in other words, this distribution

factor is indeed endogenous. In principle, this fact does not harm identification

provided that labor supply is separable from consumption: controlling for total

expenditures, individual consumption should then be independent of labor sup-



                                        55
ply (therefore of labor income). However, separability is a strong assumption,

that has been empirically criticized. The next two papers address exactly this

issue by endogenizing labor supply.

    Specifically CFL set up a model of collective labor supply for couples with

no public goods. The key feature of their model is the use of distribution

factors. They use the sex-ratio (males/females) in the relevant state and a set

of indicators describing the nature of divorce laws. Within that first generation

paper the sex ratio and the divorce laws that favor women at the dissolution of

marriage are viewed as factors that will improve the share of women.16

    The empirical relevance of the discussion above for within household in-

equality and allocation of resources is illustrated by CFL. They use data from

the PSID to estimate a collective labor supply model, where the sharing rule is

identified (up to a constant) based on distribution factors. These include the sex

ratio in the state as measured by the 1990 census as well as as dummy variables

indicating the nature of divorce laws. Measuring the sex-ratio is of course very

tricky, both because we need to define the relevant labor market and because

timing may matter. In a full commitment model for example the sex ratio at the

time of marriage is what is going to matter. However the sex-ratio is unlikely

to change vastly over time and it is probably a good idea to define marriage

markets quite broadly rather than too narrowly. The authors also report using

the county level sex-ratio with the state level as an instrument, which had little

impact on their results. In their model labor supply is evaluated over one whole

year and they consider a sample where both are working. So the relevant group

are individuals with sufficient attachment to the labor market to want to work

at least some part of the year. In their model the sharing rule is allowed to be
 16 The  intuition underlying the CFL paper - that a relative scarcity of women and/or more
favorable divorce laws should improve the wife’s Pareto weight - can be supported by an
explicit matching model, with some nuances (e.g., changes in divorce laws affect differently
women already married and women getting married after the change). On these issues, see
Chiappori, Iyigun, Lafortune and Weiss (2013).



                                            56
a function of the wages of both partners, nonlabor income and the distribution

factors. Allowing both wages to enter is important: it has been empirically

observed that both wages matter when estimating family labor supply (see for

example Blundell and Walker, 1986) a fact that in a unitary context has been

interpreted as nonseparability in household preferences between male and fe-

male leisure. Here this non-separability is interpreted as being driven by the

impact of the sharing rule on individual labor supply in a collective setting. The

fact that the restrictions from the collective model are not rejected strengthens

this interpretation.

   The results suggest that marriage and labor market conditions can lead to

large differences in the allocation of household resources within a couple. For

example a $1 increase in the female hourly wage rate leads to a transfer at the

means of $1,600 to the husband, implying that most of the extra income goes

to him. However a $1 increase in his wage rate leads only to $600 transfer to

her, implying he keeps the lion share and does not behave as altruistically (to

use the authors’ words) as she does. The wage effects are of particular interest

because changes in wages and in male/female wage differentials may be a key

driver of within household allocation of resources. Unfortunately these results

are not precisely estimated; we revisit this issue below, in our discussion of

BCMM and of Lise and Seitz (2011). Anyhow, a result that stands out in CFL

is the impact of the sex ratio. Based on this result an increase of one percentage

point in the sex ratio leads to $2,160 transfer to the wife. Noting that the range

of the sex ratio in their data is 0.46-0.57 the implication is that from the least

favorable to the most favorable labor market the transfer can differ by as much

as $23,000. Of course this does not all translate into an increase in consumption

because the income effect on labor supply will imply a change in the amount of

hours worked, with women living in marriage markets more favorable for them,



                                       57
working less. To obtain a summary of divorce laws the authors constructed an

index ranging from 1-4 and indicating the extent to which the divorce laws are

favorable to women. Here the effects are particularly strong as well. A one

point increase in the index leads to a transfer of $4,310 to the wife, which again

is shared between consumption and leisure.

   These results are important because they show the extent to which within

household allocation of resources can be sensitive to external conditions affecting

the bargaining power of the members of the couple. Noting for example that

average household income in this data is $48,000 the change that can be induced

just because of (admittedly extreme) changes in the sex ration can amount to

almost half of household income.

   However, there are a number of empirical issues that were not addressed by

the papers already discussed. First, we need to be concerned that the allocation

of women across states with different sex ratios is not random with respect

to their unobserved preferences for labor supply. This can bias the results if

women who live in areas abundant with men tend to have lower labor market

attachment. Second, we need to address the issue of precision in the estimation

of wage effects, an issue that persists in the BCMM paper we will discuss below.

CLF instrument wages but the instruments are necessarily quite week: they

rely on a polynomial in age and education as an instrument while (correctly)

controlling for the level of education and for age in the labor supply function.

This leaves higher order nonlinearity in the profile of wages with respect to

age and education to act as an instrument which is both difficult to justify

theoretically and at the same time is not very informative. To solve these

empirical issues we will require exogenous events that change wages and the

marriage market, something that a newer generation of collective models is now

addressing, such as the paper by Attanasio and Lechene (2014) who use the



                                        58
experiment as an exogenous shifter in female bargaining power.

   Beyond these difficulties there is one further important issue that the papers

we discussed fail to address, namely non-participation of women. Given that

many women do not work allowing for this possibility and understanding how

resources are allocated despite the fact she is not producing in the formal mar-

ket is a key concern. The BCMM paper addresses the question of identification

and estimation of a collective labor supply model with both male and female

non-work. In addition it considers the case where the male can only choose

to work or not, rather than having a choice of hours of work. This restriction

is imposed to accommodate the fact that in the UK (where the data is drawn

from) the male hours of work distribution seems discontinuous between zero and

about 35 hours per week, with the entire mass of workers concentrated in the

full time range. This restriction is not entirely satisfactory, but it may do better

justice to the data than assuming hours of work are freely chosen. Thus the

resulting paper is where females make choices both on the intensive and the ex-

tensive margin, while males choose only on the extensive margin. The authors

prove identification of the sharing rule; however this is only identified (non-

parametrically) if at least one of the two household members work. Parametric

restrictions provide the rest. In the empirical implementation BCMM deal with

the endogeneity of the wage rate by exploiting the changes in wage inequality

across cohorts and education groups. Econometric identification relies on the

assumption that while the structure of wages changed across education groups

and cohorts - a testable assumption, preferences remained unchanged. This

implies that changes in work behavior across cohorts and education groups can

be attributed to changes in the incentive structure., which is the identification

strategy employed by Blundell, Duncan and Meghir (1998).

   The empirical analysis is conducted on a sample of married couples, observed



                                        59
between 1978-2001 in the UK Family Expenditure Survey. The assumptions im-

posed for identification (over and above efficiency) required only private goods

and one assignable good. The assignable good is leisure. Since expenditures

on children are not separately observable in the data and since these are ef-

fectively public the authors exclude all couples with children and then assume

that the observed aggregate household consumption reflects the sum of private

consumption of each of the two members of the household.

   In this model the authors estimate two different sharing rules depending on

whether the husband works or not. They differ by a monotonic transformation,

which in their empirical specification acts as an attenuation factor, implying

that the husband only gets a fraction of transfers when he is not working.

This fraction is 0.71, implying that the derivatives of the sharing rule (as well

as the level) are attenuated by that amount when he is not working. Their

empirical approach does not use any distribution factors that can be excluded

from preferences: the sharing rule depends on male wages, female wages and

unearned income as well as education and age. It turns out that empirically

the effect of the female wage on the sharing rule is not well identified. However

the effect of the male wage is precisely estimated. It implies that 88% of an

increase in male market earnings translates into a transfer to the husband if

he is working. Since there is no intensive margin for the male decision this

translates to a direct impact on his consumption, if he continues to work. If

he does not work the same change in potential earnings translates to a transfer

equal to 62% of the potential increase (0.71 × 0.88). These results imply that

when the earnings of a working husband increase the resulting increase in the

consumption of the wife is only small; if potential earnings increase (and he

is not working) her consumption declines substantially and he enjoys more of

the household resources. Finally, the wife keeps 73% of increases in unearned



                                       60
income. Nevertheless, unearned income is a relatively low fraction of household

income.

   These results again illustrate that external factors (here the relative wages)

can influence the allocation of resources substantially. Unfortunately BCMM

does not provide precise estimates of the effects of female wages and this hin-

ders an understanding of how the change in the wage structure affected within

household allocations. The source of lack of precision is the relatively small

sample size where the man does not work. Moreover, allowing both wages and

non-labor income to be endogenous, while important for obtaining consistent

estimates that make sense, does affect precision substantially. The paper does

demonstrate that one does not need (in principle) distribution factors for iden-

tification. However, looking at the empirical problem from the perspective of

CFL, other environmental factors may be very important in determining allo-

cations and if they are omitted they could bias the results. On the other hand

if included they can be allowed to affect preferences as well. Identification does

not require they affect the sharing rule alone.

   This first generation of models showed the potential of the collective model

for identifying allocations of resources within the black box of the household.

However there are key issues that had not been dealt with. First, taxes and

welfare were ignored. At one level this is an empirical specification issue because

ignoring taxes can bias the estimates of the preference parameters. But at a

more fundamental level by not taking into account the tax and welfare system

we omit one of the most important factors affecting (and sometimes designed to

affect) within household allocations. Estimating models that allow for taxes and

welfare can then explain how changes in the policy and the market environment

can affect the allocation of resources.

   The next fundamental issue is that the models described above can only



                                          61
identify the the derivatives of the sharing rule, i.e. how sharing changes when

distribution factors, prices and unearned income change. This precludes any

discussion of the the levels of inequality of resources and hence does not allow

us to put into perspective the implication of changes that occur over time. It

also does not allow us to obtain a complete picture of the distribution of welfare

in the economy.

   Adding taxes and welfare does not pose any important conceptual problems.

In practice it involves allowing for more complex budget sets and solving the

model to take into account nonlinear budget sets. An interesting issue is that the

welfare and tax system may create a further interdependence in the decisions of

husband and wife, over and above that induced by the sharing rule. These issues

are considered for instance in Donni (2003), who uses a ‘pure’ identification

strategy of the type just described, and by Beninger et al. (2006), Myck et

al. (2006) and Vermeulen et al. (2006) who use information from singles and

couples.

   Extending the model to allow identification of the level of the sharing rule

does however pose conceptual problems. Fundamentally, the sharing rule is

identified by the equilibrium in the marriage market. However, barring the use

of a complete marriage market equilibrium model one can obtain information on

the level of inequality with alternative auxiliary assumptions. One possibility

is to use information on singles. This involves restricting the way preferences

change with marriage. This is an approach used by Lise and Seitz in an early

version of their paper. Another possibility is to assume something about the

sharing rule at one point of the wage space. For example that all resources

are shared equally when wages are equal, which is the assumption made in the

published version of Lise and Seitz (2011). Finally, one can make assumptions

about the functional forms of demand, as in Dunbar, Lewbel and Pendakur



                                       62
(2013). We now look into these empirical studies.


6.2    Intrahousehold inequality over time and the sharing
       rule - Lise and Seitz (2011)

Lise and Seitz (2011) use the collective model to first estimate overall consump-

tion inequality (at the individual level) and to then decompose this to between

household and within household. The important economic fact is that the dis-

tribution of wages in the UK changed dramatically over the period they consider

[1968-2001] both within and between education groups (see Gosling, Machin and

Meghir, 2000). Moreover the structure of the marriage market has also changed

with increased degrees of marital sorting over time. They thus set up a model of

male and female labor supply with many (but discrete) choices of hours worked

for both members of the household. Hours can take values from 0-65 in five

hour intervals. In many ways their empirical framework is similar to that of

BCMM: they use couples with no children drawn from the UK Family Expen-

diture Survey over many years. However they depart in a number of important

ways: first, they allow for taxes and account for the impact of joint taxation

over the period that this was in effect in the UK (up to 1989); they allow for a

richer choice set for the male and they impose further structure so as to identify

the level of the sharing rule as well as its derivatives; they account for public

goods when they define consumption, although they are taken as separable from

private consumption and leisure.

   While the logic underlying the identification of the derivatives of the sharing

rule is similar to that of BCMM, identification of the location (level) of the

sharing rule empirically is based on the identifying assumption that when indi-

viduals have the same potential earnings they share resources equally. In earlier

versions of the paper it was instead assumed that preferences of married and



                                       63
single individuals are identical; both these assumptions can identify the model.

The point at which one pins down the sharing rule is welfare irrelevant, because

the preference specification adapts to leave welfare unchanged when the loca-

tion of sharing is fixed. In principle just normalizing the location parameter will

not cause any bias, but will of course lead to a specific level of inequality. On

the other hand using information from singles has the advantage that it uses a

restriction grounded in some explicit assumption on preferences (marriage does

not affect marginal utilities) but if wrong it will bias all results.

   Over the period considered in the paper (1968-2001) earnings inequality in-

creased rapidly; there has been a steady increase in both the potential earnings

and actual earnings share of women relative to men and a decline in male em-

ployment while female employment increased at the start of the period later

remaining constant. Consumption inequality increased rapidly in the period

between 1980 and 1990, but was basically stable the rest of the time. When

Lise and Seitz interpret these results under the prism of their collective model

they uncover some interesting facts: while between household inequality of con-

sumption increases, within household inequality of consumption declines to such

an extent that the overall inequality of consumption remains more or less the

same over time. When they consider a different measure of resources, namely

full consumption, which includes the value of leisure enjoyed by each member,

they find similar but less stark results: first between household inequality still

increases, but much less dramatically because the decline in consumption for

those households who have workless members is compensated by the value of

leisure; second again they find that within household inequality declines as be-

fore, but much less. Obviously none of these consumption measures is ideal and

a money-metric measure of welfare may be better. However, these results illus-

trate exactly the potential importance of finding credible ways to understand



                                         64
inequality (and poverty) within households. This is more so given that who

marries whom is endogenous and in part drives the way that within household

inequality is determined and has implications for between household inequality

is determined.


6.3    Intrahousehold inequality and children

While intrahousehold inequality may be of general interest because it tells us

about allocation of resources within a household and can reveal hidden poverty

and inequality, the whole issue acquires special importance when it comes to

allocations of consumption to children. Thus is because child consumption and

more generally investments in children have long term implications for the in-

tergenerational transmission of poverty. Yet little or no empirical work had

been done to understand how resources are allocated to children and the extent

to which reallocations of income from the male spouse to the female can affect

the shares directed to children. A theoretical framework for the analysis of this

question has been developed by Blundell, Chiappori and Meghir (2005). In a

recent important paper Dunbar, Lewbel and Pendakur (2013) address this issue

empirically, using data from Malawi. In their model each child is represented as

having their own utility function. This creates a very special difficulty regarding

the assumption, used for identification in studies such as Browning, Chiappori

and Lewbel (2007), that preferences of singles and married individuals are the

same. Here, such a strategy is no longer available because children are never

seen living as singles. Moreover, in data from Malawi that the authors use there

is not enough price variation - another requirement of the Browning, Chiappori

and Lewbel approach. Thus identification is obtained by making assumptions

on the structure and shape of the Engel curves.

   The identification strategy first requires either one assignable, private good



                                        65
good or one exclusive good per person. Remember that an exclusive good is

exclusively consumed by one household member type (for example child cloth-

ing is consumed only by children), while an assignable good is such that each

member’s consumption of this good is observable.17 Of course, there can be

many other purely private goods (such as food) for which we do not observe the

amounts of individual consumption - this fact does not hamper identification.

Beyond the presence of one assignable good all other goods can be private or

public or partially private.

   The assignability assumption is not sufficient to identify the share of re-

sources of each household member; additional assumptions are therefore needed.

Dunbar et al (2012) assume, first, that resource shares are invariant to total ex-

penditure. In addition, they make two alternative assumptions on preferences:

either the demand for goods is similar across household types (i.e. households

with one, two or more children) or they are similar across types of goods within

a household type. An extreme form of the assumption is that preferences do

not vary across types of household; since shadow prices vary across households

because of the partially public nature of goods this extreme assumption is essen-

tially equivalent to assuming that the assignable good used for identification is

irresponsive to prices. Another extreme form of this assumption is that prefer-

ences over the assignable good are identical across different household member

types (male, female and children). However, Dunbar et al. (2012) show that

identification only requires that some aspect of the demand functions be the

same either across household member types or across household types. Thus

in one case they assume that all household members share the same shape of

Engel curves for the assignable good. In another case they assume that prefer-
 17 It  should be stressed that a good is private when its consumption does not alter the
preferences of other household members over goods consumption: as the authors put it,
smoking by one household member may annoy the others but it can still be taken as private
if it does not in itself alter their consumption of goods.




                                           66
ences are the same across types of household (number of children) conditional

on a deflator of income. This deflator reflects the different shadow prices that

different sized households face and is the way that preferences for the assignable

good are allowed to vary across types. The key point is that the authors need to

define similarity so that identification is delivered without sacrificing theoretical

consistency (integrability) of the demand functions.

   Dunbar et al. (2012) estimate their model on data from Malawi, probably in

one of the first such studies with development data. In a sense their framework

is very well adapted to this context because wages and/or prices, which are at

the heart of some other identification strategies are often not observed. Their

approach relies on measuring expenditures and having an assignable good for

which they use clothing and footwear. The results they obtain are both as-

tounding and an excellent illustration of the importance of looking within the

household. They find that the male obtains about 45-50% of household re-

sources. His share seems to be insensitive to the number of children present.

The mother’s share declines with the second child, but then remains more or

less constant, with the consumption share of children declining.

   Even more pertinent are the implied poverty rates. Male poverty rates are

at their highest in one child households and seem to decline in households with

more children. However, the important result is that on poverty rates for women

and children: compared to the male poverty rate of around 69%, there are

79% poor women and 95% poor children in one child households. In larger

households the male poverty rate is about 55% while the female poverty rate is

89% and nearly all children are poor. Hence their approach not only offers a

more complete picture of poverty but reveals the extent of child poverty, which

is crucial to development. Without such an approach, child poverty would

not be apparent to the extent that it is in reality. While the authors did not



                                         67
focus on gender differences between children, which may be another important

dimension, this line of research can easily be extended in that direction; it offers

an obvious mechanism for trying to understand how resources are allocated by

gender.

   A potential limitation of this approach is the fixed nature of the sharing rule.

While the authors spend a lot of time explaining the upsides of not relying on

distribution factors (essentially, they avoid having to take a position on whether

they affect preferences or not), the absence of an underlying model of what the

resource share should depend on and how it can be affected by exogenous driving

forces may in some cases be problematic. In models where the sharing rule is

allowed to depend on wages or institutional features we have some understanding

of how policy can be used to target individuals. In the Dunbar et al model this

aspect is missing. However, this is not an integral part of the approach and

richer models can be identified.


6.4    Revealed Preference Restrictions and the identifica-
       tion of the Sharing Rule

The approach to the identification of the sharing rule has exploited the structure

of the demand functions and the way that income affects observed outcomes

when the collective model is true. This leads to a set of differential equations

that when solved provide the derivatives of the sharing rule. However, the

approach does not identify the level of the sharing rule.

   A different approach is that of revealed preference. In the context of the

single agent utility maximization model the axioms of revealed preference al-

low one to test nonparametrically whether a particular set of choices can be

rationalized by utility maximization and if they can, to bound the underlying

demand functions. Such an approach has been developed and implemented for



                                        68
the unitary model by Blundell, Browning and Crawford (2003, 2008) and is

based on the original work of Afriat (1973) and Varian (1982) . In the collective

framework the aggregate household demands will in general violate the revealed

preference restrictions corresponding to the unitary model simply because as

the budget constraint changes (wages, prices, incomes etc.) individuals make

different choices and in addition the Pareto weights change. This insight was

developed by Browning and Chiappori (1998) who showed that the aggregate

household demands have to possess a Slutsky matrix that can be decomposed

into a symmetric matrix plus a matrix with rank equal to the number of decision-

makers (whose demands are aggregated) minus 1. The fact that the pattern of

choices is restricted implies that there should also be revealed preference type

restrictions - as noticed by Chiappori (1988), who provides an early example in

a labor supply context. Indeed these restrictions have been fully developed by

Cherchye, De Rock and Vermuelen (2007). In a further development Cherchye,

Lewbel, De Rock and Vermuelen show how the revealed preference restrictions

can be used to bound the sharing rule without imposing any restrictions other

than Pareto efficiency of intra household allocations. The main result is based

on the following principle: suppose that a set of observed demands are collec-

tively rationalizable in the sense that the observed choices are consistent with

the existence of admissible individual demand functions. Then it has to be

that any alternative choices that could lead to a Pareto improvement within the

household should be infeasible at current market prices and for any allocation

of income within the household such that each person receives a non-negative

share. More specifically, consider the set of demands of individual 1 that are re-

vealed preferred to the current choice, based on all possible admissible demand

functions for that person. They must cost more than person ones’s share of total

household income; similarly for person 2. The least costly bundle that would



                                       69
lead to a Pareto improvement provides the upper bound for a person’s share.

The adding up the shares to total income and the assumption that the shares

cannot be negative determines the lower bound. The difficulty in implement-

ing this principle is the fact that we need to search over all possible admissible

individual demand functions.

   This principle turns out to generate non-trivial upper and lower bounds for

the sharing rule. Importantly, no restriction is needed for such bounds other

than Pareto optimality: all or some goods may be either private, in part public

and in part private or completely private. Moreover, we do not need to specify

which goods (if any) are purely private, but if such information were to be

available it can be used to tighten the bounds.

   Cherchye et al. apply their approach to the PSID form 1999, when expen-

ditures on individual consumption goods became available, until 2009. The

sample consists of childless couples where both are working. Utility depends on

leisure food and other goods which include health and transportation. Leisure

is assumed assignable, but no assumption is made on the other goods. This

is important because in this case, at least in general, neither the level nor the

derivatives of the sharing rule are point identified.

   To implement their approach they start by estimating three different ver-

sions of an aggregate household demand system: a non parametric system, the

QUAIDS demand system (Banks, Blundell and Lewbel, ) and a QUAIDS de-

mand system where the substitution matrix is restricted to be symmetric plus

rank one, which imposes that the demands are consistent with the collective

model. Given this demand system they apply their algorithm to bound the

sharing rule for different values of the full household income, wages and prices.

Their empirical results are remarkable. First, the bounds are very narrow with

the nonparametric demand system implying 12% median difference between up-



                                        70
per and lower bounds and the fully restrictive demand system only 3%. Going

from the non-parametric demand system to the unrestricted QUAIDS system

the tightening is due to imposing the parametric restrictions that may or may

not be valid - the authors provide no evidence on that. However, assuming

the parametric restrictions are valid the further step of going from QUAIDS to

restricted QUAIDS is just imposing restrictions that are implied by the prob-

lem and hence only serve to make the bounds sharp(er). Thus when Pareto

efficiency is imposed the median difference between the upper and lower bound

tightens from about 9% to 3%, a substantial improvement. It would have been

useful to use a shape constrained nonparametric demand system (see Blundell,

Horowitz and Parey) avoiding the parametric restrictions but using the Pareto

constraints as implied by the model.

   Using their bounds they establish that the female share is a normal good,

i.e. as full household income grows so does the female share; interestingly,

this finding confirms results previously derived in different contexts. Moreover

they show that in percentage terms the average female share is very closely

bounded around 50%, although there is substantial heterogeneity around that

point. However, it is impressive how tightly bounded the sharing rule is through-

out the distribution. In interpreting this result one needs to be careful because

it is full income that is being shared equally. This measure of income includes

both leisure and consumption. Thus the share of a woman with a high wage

who does not work will include her leisure and her consumption; hence a 50%

share may in certain cases hide very unequal levels of consumption of all other

goods.

   In the final part of the analysis the authors use their estimates to carry

out a poverty analysis. The idea here is similar to that in Dunbar et al (2013)

described earlier: they compare poverty rates implied by household level income



                                       71
and those implied by individual allocations. The household poverty line is 60%

of median household income while the individual poverty line is set at half this

amount. This of course is an income based and not a welfare based measure

and ignores any household economies of scale. This point not withstanding the

individual rates are higher: while household poverty is 11% individual poverty

is bounded between 16% and 21%, the lower bound being above the household

number. Interestingly the bounds do not differ by gender by any substantive

amount.

   The Cherchye et al study breaks new ground and shows the power of the col-

lective approach. Specifically it reinforces the identifiability results substantially

by showing not only that the levels of the sharing rule can be identified, but

more importantly in our view, that the entire sharing rule can also be bounded

without much more than within household Pareto efficiency. Nevertheless there

is still a long and important agenda in this research. First, empirically we need

to understand better how to deal with heterogeneity in preferences within such

a non-parametric framework as well as with endogeneity of prices and wages.

The entire analysis of Cherchye et al is based on the assumption that wages and

prices are exogenous. This is internally consistent with the absence of hetero-

geneity and shocks, but is is broadly unsatisfactory. For example there is a vast

labor supply literature dealing with endogenous wage rates. Moreover, prices of

goods may not be exogenous if there are aggregate shocks to the demand func-

tions. While these seem to be side issues as far as the central identifiability of

the collective model is concerned they are important for the ultimate empirical

credibility of the approach.

7    Conclusion

Understanding intrahousehold inequality and more broadly intrahousehold al-

locations is crucial for understanding the effects of policy and for targeting

programs designed to alleviate poverty. The implications are far reaching and

they span simple questions of who will benefit from certain programs to deeper

questions about child poverty and even child development. It is now well un-

derstood that treating households as an individual unit does not just provide

an incomplete picture of standards of living but can be seriously misleading

when we try and understand behavior and its reactions to the environment. In

our review we have discussed both the questions underlying the notion of intra-

household inequality as well as the extent of our ability to identify what goes on

in the household from typically observed data. In this context we have argued

that it is important to be able to observe variables that shift the bargaining

power of spouses without affecting preferences as well as other approaches to

peeking inside the household black box. It is evident from this discussion that

better data would be important; and nothing is more important that detailed

consumption and time use data. A renewed emphasis on such data is called for,

given the importance of the issues at hand. A better understanding of what

may constitute distribution factors and indeed experimental evidence would be

an important way to support research into intrahousehold allocations.

    However beyond the above, research is now advancing into the dynamics

of intrahousehold allocations and being linked to marriage markets. It is now

becoming clear how the conditions at the time of marriage can affect intrahouse-

hold allocations. Indeed, under full commitment, current distribution factors

may have little to do with current allocations. On the other hand full commit-

ment is a very strong and some may argue an implausible assumption. Thus

research is also advancing in understanding how allocations are determined when


                                       73
commitment is limited. In such limited commitment environments changes in

the institutional framework, may it be the structure of the welfare system or di-

vorce laws will also have important implications for intrahousehold inequality as

well as for the formation and dissolution of marriages. We thus are acquiring a

rich theoretical and empirical framework that will allow us to better understand

how individual welfare is determined within the context of the family. Important

contributions in understanding the dynamics of intrahousehold allocations and

of household formation include papers by Mazzocco (2007) and Voena (2013).

We are convinced that this is a crucial direction for future research.
