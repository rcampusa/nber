Surplus?

                                         ABSTRACT

Recent tobacco regulations proposed by the Food and Drug Administration have raised a thorny
question: how should the cost-benefit analysis accompanying such policies value foregone
consumer surplus associated with regulation-induced reductions in smoking? In a model with
rational and fully informed consumers, this question is straightforward. There is disagreement,
however, about whether consumers are rational and fully informed, and the literature offers little
practical guidance about what approach the FDA should use if they are not. In this paper, we
outline the history of the FDA’s recent attempts to regulate cigarettes and other tobacco products
and how they have valued foregone consumer surplus in cost-benefit analyses. We discuss the
evidence on whether consumers are fully informed about the risks of smoking and whether their
choices are rational, reviewing the competing arguments made by different authors about these
questions. We describe the appropriate approach to welfare analysis under different assumptions
about consumer information and rationality.        Based on our reading of the theoretical and
empirical literatures, we advocate using a behavioral public finance framework borrowed from
the literature on environmental regulation. This approach applies standard tools of welfare
analysis while allowing consumer behavior to deviate from rationality and full information
without requiring specific assumptions about the reason for the deviation. The use of this
approach would substantially reduce the confusion currently surrounding welfare analysis of
tobacco regulation.

I. Introduction

       In 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gave the Food and

Drug Administration (FDA) statutory authority to regulate cigarettes, opening a new front in the

war on tobacco. A central provision of this law required graphic warning labels on cigarette

packages, and the FDA proposed regulations to implement this requirement in 2010. Not

surprisingly, tobacco companies pushed back, mounting a legal challenge that has prevented the

implementation of the graphic warning labels. More recently, the FDA has proposed extending

its regulatory authority to new tobacco products such as e-cigarettes. These actions are

controversial and raise fundamental questions about the appropriate role of regulation in a

competitive economy.

       A critical piece of the debate around the FDA’s actions concerns the economic case for

regulation. Executive Order 12866, signed in 1993, requires an economic impact analysis

documenting benefits and costs for any regulation that is “economically significant,” a category

that includes but is not limited to regulations with an annual effect on the economy of $100

million or more. The main benefits of regulations that reduce smoking are straightforward:

improved health for smokers and also for non-smokers who are less likely to be exposed to

secondhand smoke. But a question that arises immediately is how much of the benefit to

smokers is offset by their lost enjoyment  that is, foregone consumer surplus  associated

with less smoking.

       There are strikingly different views on the correct size of this offset. At one end of the

spectrum are those who argue that there should be no offset at all. Economists Frank J.

Chaloupka, Jonathan Gruber, and Kenneth E. Warner have stated unequivocally “that the ‘lost

pleasure’ from tobacco use…should not be included as a cost in FDA economic impact analyses




                                                                                                    1
of tobacco regulations” (Chaloupka et al. 2015). They are joined in this view by groups such as

the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association. One commentator derided

FDA as a “toothless tiger” and speculated that the economic analysis accompanying the graphic

warning label rule suggested “regulatory capture” of the agency by the tobacco industry (Malone

2015). At the other end of the spectrum are those who have argued, for various reasons, that the

loss of consumer surplus may be so large as to offset nearly all of the regulation-induced health

gains for smokers. This latter group includes government economists Elizabeth Ashley, Clark

Nardinelli, and Rosemarie Lavaty (Ashley et al. 2015) and economic experts hired by the

tobacco industry (comment submitted by Robert S. Maness on behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company, and Commonwealth Brands, Inc., Docket No. FDA-

2010-N-0568, downloaded from regulations.gov on 3/19/2012).

       What explains the divergence between these two views  particularly between

economists on both sides of the debate? And, as a practical matter, how should the FDA account

for foregone consumer surplus in its regulatory impact analyses? Correctly accounting for lost

consumer surplus depends on critical assumptions about, among other things, whether or not

consumers are fully informed about the health risks of smoking and whether consumer smoking

behavior is rational in the sense of reflecting stable preferences that fully take into account the

current and expected future consequences of current choices (note that rationality does not imply

perfect foresight). The peer-reviewed literature in economics has offered the FDA little guidance

on this subject. The goal of this paper is to address these questions to help inform economic

impact estimates associated with future tobacco regulations.

       This paper makes five main contributions to this contentious and important literature.




                                                                                                      2
First, we emphasize that the correct approach to evaluating the economic impact of regulation is

to calculate changes in the welfare of a rational and fully informed consumer, rather than first

calculating the value of health gains and then offsetting them by some amount. Second, we

briefly review the economics literature on whether consumers are fully informed and rational in

their decisions about tobacco consumption, because these are critical assumptions to inform the

welfare analysis. Third, we adopt the behavioral public finance framework of Allcott and

Sunstein (2015) for welfare calculations. This framework is already used in other areas, most

notably environmental economics; it has the advantage of explicitly allowing quasi-rational

behavior or imperfect information and focusing on the net welfare effects of government

interventions rather than trying to estimate the gross health gains and corresponding offsets.

Fourth, we consider how the welfare analysis changes under the assumption that demand exhibits

constant elasticity of substitution, rather than the typical assumption of linear demand. This

shows the sensitivity of the results to one of the main arbitrary assumptions. Finally, we

motivate all our research in the context of the ongoing regulatory debate.

       The paper proceeds as follows. We begin by outlining the economic arguments

underpinning the regulatory impact analyses accompanying recent tobacco-related FDA

regulations and the counterarguments offered by those who have commented publicly. Next, we

summarize the key differences that drive these arguments: specifically, differences in underlying

assumptions about consumer information, rationality, and the correct framework for welfare

analysis. We present a simple theoretical framework for welfare analysis, borrowed from

environmental economics, which is flexible enough to allow different assumptions about

information and rationality. Using this framework, we present graphical examples of welfare

analysis of regulatory interventions, varying assumptions about information and rationality while




                                                                                                   3
maintaining the assumption of linear demand. We then discuss the implications of relaxing the

assumption of linear demand. We conclude by offering implications for regulatory impact

analysis, as well as a discussion of topics for future research.



II. A brief history of the FDA’s treatment of foregone consumer surplus in economic

impact analyses related to recent tobacco regulation

       In 1995, the FDA proposed regulations to restrict access to cigarettes by minors. The

accompanying regulatory impact analysis acknowledged the difficulty of calculating an offset for

foregone consumer surplus, but stated that no offset was required only because minors, rather

than adults, were the target of the restrictions: “FDA’s proposed rule imposes no access

restrictions on adults, who would be free to consume tobacco products if they so desired. Thus,

FDA has not included any value for lost consumer surplus in its estimate of societal costs”

(Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco

Products to Protect Children and Adolescents,” 60 FR 155 (11 August 1995), pp. 41314 –

41375). The Supreme Court would ultimately strike down this attempt to regulate on the grounds

that the FDA lacked the statutory authority to regulate cigarettes (Croley 2008). But the notion

that the enjoyment consumers who are minors derive from smoking can be ignored for purposes

of a cost-benefit analysis foreshadows a theme of the current debate.

       Following the Supreme Court’s rejection of the FDA’s attempt to regulate, anti-smoking

policy developed over the subsequent decade not through regulation, but through the courts,

resulting in the “Master Settlement” between the tobacco industry and state attorneys general.

One consequence of the fact that this process unfolded in the courts was that there was no

regulatory impact analysis by FDA. An academic cost-benefit analysis notes the critical




                                                                                                   4
importance of valuing lost consumer surplus, which they refer to as “foregone pleasure,” but

remains agnostic about how this should be done (Cutler et al. 2002).

       In November 2010, the FDA issued proposed regulations requiring graphic warning

labels on cigarette packages as required by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control

Act of 2009. The accompanying regulatory impact analysis acknowledged the need to take

foregone consumer surplus into account: “This range [of monetized gross health benefits to

smokers] tends to overstate the net benefits of reduced smoking because it does not account for

lost consumer surplus associated with the activity of smoking. Cutler…suggests that lost

consumer surplus might equal around fifty percent of the dollar value of life-year gains, which

necessitates dividing the estimated gross benefits in half.” (The FDA analysis, like ours,

considers the magnitude of lost consumer surplus relative to health gains to smokers, without

considering health gains to non-smokers. Effects for non-smokers are important for evaluating

the overall impact of the regulation but not for the narrower question of how to evaluate its

impact on smokers, which is our focus.) In other words, the FDA proposed that the offset for lost

enjoyment should be one half. They invited comment on this approach to calculating the offset,

which they referred to as the “Cutler adjustment factor.” (“Required Warnings for Cigarette

Packages and Advertisements,” Fed. Reg. Vol. 75 No. 218, 69524-69565.)

       The resulting comments showed that anti-smoking groups and the tobacco industry could

agree on one thing; namely, their dislike of the FDA’s approach to determining the offset. A

coalition of anti-smoking groups including the American Heart Association, the American Lung

Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics derided the very idea of an offset as

“wholly improper and inappropriate” and complained that “no citation whatsoever is provided”

to support this method (comment submitted in response to Docket No. FDA-2010-N-0568,




                                                                                                  5
downloaded from regulations.gov on 10/19/2012). An economic expert hired by the tobacco

industry characterized the method as “arbitrary and without any empirical support” (comment

submitted by Robert S. Maness, Docket No. FDA-2010-N-0568, downloaded from

regulations.gov on 3/19/2012).

       Several economists offered comments on the proposed rule as well. Frank Chaloupka

commented that the offset should not exceed 10% of gross internal health benefits, without

providing justification for that specific threshold (comment submitted by Frank Chaloupka in

response to Docket No. FDA-2010-N-0568, downloaded from regulations.gov on May 12,

2015). In contrast, W. Kip Viscusi argued that there is ample evidence that consumers are fully

aware of smoking’s health risks and may even overestimate them (comment submitted by W.

Kip Viscusi on behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company, and

Commonwealth Brands, Inc. in response to Docket No. FDA-2010-N-0568, downloaded from

regulations.gov on March 19, 2012). Viscusi stated in his comment that he was compensated by

tobacco companies for providing this comment, although none of his research, which is

published in well-regarded, peer-reviewed journals, has been “funded or otherwise supported by

the tobacco industry” (p. 1 of Viscusi comment).

       In response to these comments and others, the FDA offered an expanded analysis in the

impact study accompanying the final version of the rule in June 2011 (“Required Warnings for

Cigarette Packages and Advertisements,” 76 FR 120 (22 June 2011), pp. 36628 – 36777). In

particular, they did two things: first, they developed more theory to support the idea of an offset.

They discussed at length the possibility that the decision to smoke may reflect some non-

rationality, citing (among others) Gruber and Koszegi (2001), Bernheim and Rangel (2004), and

Gul and Pesendorfer (2007). Following this literature, they imposed a range of different




                                                                                                   6
assumptions about the fraction of lost consumer surplus that should be counted as a cost and used

to offset the health gains to smokers. The estimates of lost enjoyment in the regulatory impact

analysis that accompanied the final version of the rule ranged from 10 percent to 93 percent; in

other words, the FDA analysis suggested that somewhere between almost none and almost all of

the health benefits to smokers from reduced smoking are offset by lost enjoyment. Second, they

proposed a completely different method of estimating the regulation’s net health benefit (that is,

the health benefit minus the lost enjoyment) for smokers. This method posits that the net benefit

can be inferred directly from smokers’ willingness to pay for smoking cessation programs,

obviating the need to make an explicit assumption about the gross health benefit and the

offsetting loss of consumer surplus. This method results in much lower net benefits associated

with the regulation — so low, in fact, that they are exceeded by FDA’s upper-range estimate of

the costs of the regulation. Thus, getting the method for valuing lost consumer surplus right is

not simply an academic question; it may actually determine whether or not the regulation is

admissible from a cost-benefit perspective.

       Almost immediately after the Final Rule was issued, a coalition of tobacco companies

sued the FDA, arguing both that the labels violated their constitutional right to free speech and

that the FDA’s regulatory impact analysis had overstated benefits and understated costs

associated with the regulation. In November 2011, before the regulation was to have taken

effect, a US District Court issued an injunction preventing its implementation. In August 2012,

the courts ruled in favor of the tobacco companies, effectively barring the FDA from requiring

graphic warning labels (R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al., v. Food & Drug Administration, et al.,

696 F.3d 1205 (D.C. Cir. 2012)). The rationale for the court’s ruling was that the FDA had failed

to show that the graphic warning labels would reduce smoking; absent any reductions in




                                                                                                     7
smoking, the policy would have no gross health benefits. Because the rule failed to meet even

that threshold, the court did not address the issue of how net health benefits should be calculated.

As a result, the critical questions of whether people are already well informed, whether they are

rational, and how regulatory impact analysis should reflect these considerations do not arise in

the court’s ruling. The government’s request for a rehearing was denied, and the FDA did not

seek further review of the ruling. 1 Graphic warning labels therefore remain in limbo  required

by legislation, but ruled unconstitutional by the courts  for reasons that are not directly related

to the controversy over foregone consumer surplus.

        A more recent rule issued by the FDA in April 25, 2014 proposes deeming tobacco

products such as cigars and e-cigarettes subject to FDA regulation. Although the regulatory

impact analysis accompanying this proposed rule avoids even using the term “consumer surplus”

(referring instead to “full welfare gains”), the approach is conceptually similar to the regulatory

impact analysis accompanying the final rule for the graphic warning labels, with foregone

consumer surplus offsetting 67 to 84 percent of the value of smokers’ private health gains. The

regulatory impact analysis accompanying the final version of this rule, released in May 2016,

backed away from this estimate. Instead, the May 2016 analysis took a “breakeven” approach

that did not quantify the rule’s benefits but instead calculated how large the benefits of the rule

would have to be to justify the costs (which are quantified), effectively sidestepping the question

of how large the consumer surplus offset should be. 2

        In response to these FDA rules, some have argued that the FDA should abandon

altogether its attempt to value foregone consumer surplus associated with reductions in smoking.

In particular, Chaloupka and colleagues (2015) published a commentary arguing that this

approach is inappropriate because smoking behavior is irrational, an assertion they support with

two observations: first, most smokers began smoking while they were youths, and second, most

smokers regret having started smoking. Others, however, would argue that these observations do

not present insurmountable obstacles to applying the tools of cost-benefit analysis, suitably

modified to incorporate some deviations from standard assumptions (Weimer et al. 2009; Jin et

al. 2015; Cutler et al. 2015).



III. Why is there such disagreement? Enumerating the key assumptions on which there is a

lack of consensus and proposing a model that can encompass them all

       This academic debate reflects fundamental underlying disagreement about how to

evaluate the welfare consequences of regulations that reduce smoking. Specifically, there is a

lack of consensus about three key questions. First, under the assumption that consumers are

fully informed and rational, what is the appropriate framework for welfare analysis of

government regulations that yield both health gains and also potentially large losses in consumer

surplus? Second, are consumers fully informed and rational? Third, what is the appropriate

framework for welfare analysis if consumers are not fully informed and rational? In this section,

we discuss each of these questions.



A. If consumers are fully informed and rational, how should we evaluate the welfare

consequences of regulation?

       This question might seem almost rhetorical; after all, welfare analysis when consumers

are fully informed and rational is a staple of intermediate microeconomics at the undergraduate




                                                                                                   9
level. The textbook answer would be that in this simple case, welfare analysis should be based on

consumer surplus: how does consumer surplus change when regulation causes a change in the

equilibrium level of consumption? This approach is noteworthy for what it does not do; in

particular, the standard welfare analysis does not begin by calculating the health gains and then

estimate an offset for lost enjoyment. On the contrary, calculating health gains is redundant,

because consumer surplus already reflects the consumer’s valuation of any health gains resulting

from the change in demand. This illustrates an extremely important principle which holds even

when consumers are not fully informed and rational: there is no good reason why the welfare

analysis of regulations that reduce smoking should begin by calculating health benefits. (Note

that as discussed above, we are considering only internal health benefits to the smoker herself;

any externalities would need to be considered separately.)

       Two other basic points are worth making about the welfare consequences of regulation

when consumers are fully informed and rational. The first is that consumers cannot be made

better off by an intervention (such as a tax) that reduces smoking, if their initial smoking

decisions were truly the result of rational decision-making with full information. The second is

that providing accurate information that was already publicly available should not change their

behavior; by definition, if the provision of accurate information changes consumers’ behavior,

they must initially have been either uninformed or failing to use all information available to

them. We return to these points in our subsequent discussion.



B. Are consumers fully informed and rational?

       A large body of evidence suggests that consumers are aware of the health risks of

smoking (for example, Viscusi 1990; Viscusi and Hakes 2008); indeed, some evidence suggests




                                                                                                    10
that smokers actually overestimate some of the health risks of smoking (see Viscusi 2010 for a

review). At the same time, they may underestimate the difficulty of quitting (Sloan, Smith, and

Taylor, 2003). Note that being fully informed does not mean that there is no uncertainty about

the negative health effects of smoking. Uncertainty about the nature and magnitude of the

negative health effects of smoking seems pervasive, as medical research continues to uncover

new links between smoking and negative health effects. For example, recent studies show

elevated indicators of respiratory impairment in current former smokers even without evidence

of clinical disease (Regan et al. 2016; Woodruff et al. 2016). In other words, the long-term

negative health consequences smoking  even for those who have quit smoking  are even

worse than anyone had thought. The key point, though, is that if no one was aware of this

relationship (as might be inferred from the fact that these studies were published in high-impact

medical journals) this indicates that there was uncertainty, rather than a lack of information on

the part of smokers. While uncertainty complicates cost-benefit analysis, it does not by itself

offer a rationale for regulation; in contrast, if consumers are not fully informed about the known

risks of smoking, then informing them of these risks would improve their welfare. Therefore, our

focus here is not on whether there is uncertainty, but on whether consumers are fully informed

about known risks. Our reading of the evidence is that consumers are for the most part aware of

the risks of smoking, even if as noted above they may underestimate the difficulty of quitting.

       It is much harder to say whether consumers are rational in the sense of reflecting stable

preferences that fully take into account the available information on current and expected future

consequences of current choices; “[a]ddictions would seem to be the antithesis of rational

behavior” (Becker and Murphy, 1988). The theory of rational addiction developed by Becker and

Murphy (1988), building on prior work by Stigler and Becker (1977) and by Iannaccone (1986),




                                                                                                    11
is the starting point for how economists analyze consumption of addictive goods using rational

models.

       While a full review of the rational addiction model is beyond the scope of this paper, a

few points are important both for our discussion of welfare analysis and as an introduction to

later research that extends the basic rational addiction model. As the name suggests, the rational

addiction model starts with the assumption that consumers are rational utility-maximizers who

take into account the future consequences of their current choices. The model does not

necessarily assume that consumers are fully informed, although their consumption of addictive

substances is not driven by a lack of information. The key feature of rational addiction is

adjacent complementarity between consumption in different periods. Adjacent complementarity

implies that smoking now will increase the pleasure of future smoking. As a result, consumption

in the current period increases consumption in future periods. Therefore, the decision to smoke

is different each period because the stock of past smoking gradually changes, making it a

dynamic model. The full price of consumption of an addictive good includes its discounted

future effect on utility, including changes in income and health. The rational addiction model

allows discount rates to differ across individuals; indeed, consumers with high discount rates are

more likely to consume addictive goods because they place less weight on future adverse effects.

       The rational addiction model dispels the notion that smoking (or consumption of other

addictive goods) is ipso facto evidence of irrationality. Indeed, the rational addiction model can

explain observed behaviors that might appear to be less than rational, including binges, increased

use during stressful times, higher use by people with higher discount rates, and quitting cold

turkey instead of gradually. But the original rational addiction model is subject to a number of

criticisms, which have led to further research in this area. Criticisms of the rational addiction




                                                                                                    12
model include the assumption of perfect foresight, the assumption of time consistency, and the

lack of any role for regret (Song, Brown, and Glantz 2014). Perfect foresight is a convenient

modeling tool but is hardly realistic. Many smokers express regret at having ever started, but the

classic rational addiction model has no role for regret.

       Orphanides and Zervos (1995) propose a model that maintains the central assumption of

rationality but relaxes the assumption of perfect foresight, which also creates a role for the

experience of regret. Instead of perfect foresight, Orphanides and Zervos allow for uncertainty in

whether a person is likely to become addicted. The uncertainty arises because people have

different tolerances, meaning some people become addicted more easily than others, and

consumers learn about their own specific addiction tendency through personal experience. The

model assumes that people act rationally given their beliefs, which change over time with

experience. In their model, a person who (mistakenly) believes that they are unlikely to become

addicted may smoke so much that they become addicted before they realize their error. This

leads some smokers to experience regret. The smokers most likely to experience regret are those

whose initial beliefs differ strongly from their actual addiction tendency.

       Suranovic, Goldfarb, and Leonard (1999) modify the rational addiction model in two

important ways. First, they explicitly assume that quitting smoking is costly to the consumer, in

utility terms. Second, and more relevant for our current discussion, they assume a simple form

of “bounded rationality” in which, rather than optimizing over the lifespan, consumers optimize

only their consumption in the current period. In this model, some smokers become trapped by

past optimizing decisions into a situation where smoking is worse than non-smoking, except that

to quit would incur such enormous costs that the smoker continues, regretfully.




                                                                                                 13
        More recent models, reflecting developments in the field of behavioral economics, relax

the assumption of time consistency that characterized the original rational addiction model.

Gruber and Koszegi (2001, 2004) modify the rational addiction model by assuming quasi-

hyperbolic discounting, so all future utility is discounted by an additional factor (β) beyond the

standard per-period discount rate (δ). Including β in the model (with β<1) means that future

utility is discounted even more, so that future costs of smoking appear lower. The result is that

time-inconsistent people smoke more in the current period, which, through adjacent

complementarities, increases future smoking. A time-inconsistent person (β<1) will smoke more

than a time-consistent person with the same discount rate (δ). Just as a time-inconsistent obese

person may plan to start exercising tomorrow, a time-inconsistent smoker may plan to reduce

smoking tomorrow. The fundamental problem with time inconsistency is that it creates tension

between current and future selves, with smoking by the current self imposing an internality (i.e. a

health cost) on the future self.

        Bernheim and Rangel (2004) propose an alternate theory of the consumption of addictive

goods, incorporating insights from psychology. They argue that the consumption of addictive

goods is often a mistake triggered by environmental cues. In their model, a person makes choices

in two modes. The “cold” mode is rational, but the “hot” mode is swayed by environmental cues

and may lead to choices of addictive substances that are different from choices that would have

been made in a “cold” mode.

        Does the recent emphasis on quasi-rational models reflect a consensus that smoking

behavior cannot be described by rational models? It does not. As noted by Gruber and Koszegi

(2001, 2004), there is a lack of compelling evidence about whether smokers are time consistent

or time inconsistent. Instead, there is much evidence on people’s behavior in general being time



                                                                                                     14
inconsistent, but little evidence on smokers specifically. Moreover, there is no empirical test that

distinguishes clearly between rational and quasi-rational models of smoking behavior.

       What is clear, however, is that the welfare implications of different anti-smoking policies

depend heavily on whether smokers are rational or not. As noted above, when consumers are

rational and fully informed, interventions such as taxes that reduce smoking unambiguously

make consumers worse off. This is not the case in any of the non-rational models that we have

discussed. For example, Suranovic et al. (1999) argue that government intervention (such as

taxes) would help prevent consumers from falling into a smoking “trap.” In the model of

Bernheim and Rangel (2004), taxes may (under certain additional assumptions about the pattern

of consumption) be welfare-enhancing. In the model of Gruber and Koszegi (2004), a time-

inconsistent consumer would be made better off by a tax that would reduce smoking and, in

effect, save her future self from her current self. While these arguments are all intuitively

appealing, each arises from a specific model of non-rational behavior, and there is no consensus

about how welfare analysis should proceed in the general case where consumers are not rational

in some unspecified way. Ideally, methods of welfare analysis would apply regardless of the

nature of the deviation from rationality, with rational behavior treated as a special case of a more

general model. The model that we discuss below has this feature.



III.C. How should we evaluate welfare when consumers are not fully informed and rational?

       We propose a framework for analyzing the welfare implications of government

interventions under different assumptions about consumer information and choice that is

borrowed from Allcott and Sunstein (2015), whose applications are largely drawn from

environmental regulation. The literature on welfare analysis under inconsistent choice is much




                                                                                                  15
better developed (albeit evolving rapidly) in the context of environmental policy than health

policy, so we rely on references and terminology that are relatively novel to the debate over

tobacco regulation. Nonetheless, we argue that the underlying issues are the same 3 and that there

is a great deal to be learned from the debates occurring in that field.

           Allcott and Sunstein (2015), summarizing earlier work in behavioral public finance by,

among others, Chetty (2015), Mullanaithan, Schwartzstein, and Congdon (2012), and Allcott and

Taubinsky (2015), present a simple model in which individuals make a discrete decision such as

whether or not to quit smoking. They take this action when their decision utility d exceeds a

critical value p. The decision utility d is equal to the experienced utility v minus a bias parameter

b. That is, 𝑑 = 𝑣 − 𝑏. The bias parameter b could reflect any one of a number of different

inconsistencies, such as present bias (which is particularly relevant for smoking), inattention, or

imperfect information. If the bias parameter b is zero, then the model is simply the classic model

of demand, which is considered unbiased. The source of the bias is not important, however, for

welfare analysis, as long as the amount of bias accurately reflects consumer choice. (The source

of the bias will matter, however, for thinking about which policies might actually change

consumer behavior.)

           There are three implications from this framework for the welfare analysis of interventions

that reduce smoking. The first is that there is a difference between the unbiased demand curve

and the observed, biased demand curve. In the context of smoking, we think of the bias

parameter as shifting demand outwards; this could be due to incorrect information about the

health risks of smoking, incorrect beliefs about the difficulty of quitting, or the difference in

perspectives between current and future selves driven by internally inconsistent discount rates.

(In a nutshell, biased consumers smoke more than unbiased ones, which could be because they

                                                                                                               16
do not know how bad it is for them, do not realize how hard it will be to quit down the road, or

simply cannot control themselves.) In a graphical analysis, we will need to draw (at least) two

different demand curves for the welfare analysis, one representing the choices of the unbiased

consumer (where “unbiased” is equivalent to “fully informed and rational”) and another

reflecting her actual, “biased” choices.

       The second implication is that welfare analysis should be carried out using the unbiased

demand curve. Consider a bias arising from imperfect information and an intervention that

provides the consumer with perfect information. Her initial choices are uninformed, and once the

information is provided her demand changes to the informed quantity. The welfare implications

of this shift should be evaluated from the perspective of the fully informed consumer. In the case

of an informational intervention that leaves consumers imperfectly informed — for example,

overestimating or underestimating the health risks of smoking — it may be necessary to keep

track of more than two demand curves. Typically there is one demand curve for the uninformed

person, one for the person after they see the information (when the person has more information

than before, but may not be fully informed), and a third for a fully informed person (who may or

may not be equivalent to the person who sees the information). Some version of this approach

appears in many of the recent papers that analyze the welfare implications of tobacco regulation

under the assumption that consumers are not fully informed and rational. For example, Cutler et

al. (2015) evaluate the costs and benefits of different interventions for what they term Type II

consumers (those with higher demand for cigarettes, which may be due to misinformation and/or

limited rationality) using the demand curve estimated for Type I consumers (the rational, fully

informed consumers). Gruber and Koszegi observe in both their papers that they “take the

agent’s long-run preferences as those relevant for social welfare maximization” (Gruber and




                                                                                                   17
Koszegi, p. 1287, 2001; p. 1966, 2004), while Bernheim and Rangel (2004) treat “cold”

preferences as a welfare standard. Thus, the idea of using the unbiased demand curve for welfare

analysis already appears in the literature on tobacco regulation under several different names.

       A third implication is that we can rely on consumer surplus calculated using the unbiased

demand curve for welfare analysis, because the unbiased demand curve reflects the value that

fully informed and rational consumers place on different aspects of well-being (e.g., their own

health versus the enjoyment from smoking). In particular, it is not necessary to calculate the

health gains of a particular policy and then calculate an offset for foregone enjoyment; it is

sufficient simply to look at changes in consumer surplus. Jin and colleagues (2015) emphasize

this point in their discussion. It is possible to calculate the health gains and, by comparing them

to changes in consumer surplus, see how much of an offset is implied relative to the gross health

gains. Below, we derive a general formula for the relationship between consumer surplus gains

and health gains that reinforces the point that these approaches are mathematically

interchangeable. It also demonstrates that the necessary offset, in an approach that begins with

health gains, may be very small or very large depending on how far demand is from the optimal

level. Moreover, the emphasis placed (albeit implicitly) on different outcomes is quite different if

we begin by focusing on health gains and, as an afterthought, subtract off some loss of consumer

well-being than if we posit at the outset that consumer surplus is the starting point for a

discussion of a policy’s welfare impact.

       Having proposed this framework, we now use it to illustrate graphically the welfare

implications of either taxes or information campaigns. Throughout, we identify both the change

in net consumer welfare and the (internal) health gains associated with any reduction in smoking,

so that the difference between these two quantities is clear.




                                                                                                   18
IV. Welfare analysis of policies that discourage smoking: static model

       We present a graphical analysis of the welfare implications of two different types of

policies: taxes and an informational intervention. We assume that the demand curve is linear and

that the supply curve is flat. We vary the size of the taxes and the effectiveness of the

informational intervention, and we will illustrate the welfare implications of these policies under

different assumptions about whether consumer demand is biased or not. We begin by assuming

that consumer choices are unbiased, and then we relax that assumption to allow some bias.

       As already noted, we ignore any externalities from smoking and focus only on how the

government intervention affects the smoker. Although spillover effects of smoking through

second-hand smoke are considerable and important, they are not part of this analysis. The FDA

analysis already takes into account the effects of smoking (or cessation) on others; the only point

of contention is how to count the foregone consumer surplus of the smoker. Moreover, there is

no interaction between the externality of smoking on others and any lost consumer surplus. We

also do not consider peer effects; for a discussion of this issue, which is conceptually similar to

an externality, see Laux (2000). Our graphical analyses are restricted to a one-period model,

which is unrealistic, but necessary for graphical presentation; the behavioral public finance

framework itself is readily adaptable to a multi-period model.

       We begin with the simplest case, in which consumers are unbiased and there is no

government intervention (Figure 1). In this situation, consumption is 𝑄1: the intersection of 𝐷𝑢

(the unbiased demand curve) and market price. There is no deadweight loss. Suppose that the

government then imposes a per-unit tax. By definition, since consumer choices are unbiased, the

imposition of a tax reduces consumer surplus; however, the tax also yields health gains. Let s be




                                                                                                      19
the per-unit health loss to the smoker. Figures 2A and 2B depict the impact of the tax; they are

identical except for the fact that Figure 2A highlights the health gains from this tax, relative to

the no-tax equilibrium depicted in Figure 1, while Figure 2B highlights the change in consumer

surplus. The health gains are the parallelogram H in Figure 2A, with area 𝑠(𝑄1 − 𝑄0 ), while the

consumer surplus loss is triangle WL in Figure 2B, with area 0.5𝑡(𝑄1 − 𝑄0 ). In the special case

where the tax t is exactly equal to the health cost s, then the welfare loss WL is exactly one-half

the size of the health gain H. In this case, although the tax yields health gains, it has negative

consequences for consumer welfare.

       Next, we consider a slightly more complicated case in which consumer demand is biased

by some factor b which shifts the demand curve outward. In this case, consumption is 𝑄0 : the

intersection of the biased demand curve 𝐷𝑏 and the market price (Figure 3). The unbiased

demand curve 𝐷𝑢 lies below Db and the unbiased level of consumption would be 𝑄1. In other

words, biased consumers consume more cigarettes than they would if they were unbiased.

Suppose that, as before, the government imposes a per-unit tax t; for purposes of illustration,

suppose that the magnitude of t is such that it exactly offsets the bias b and moves consumption

to Q0. Figure 4A highlights the health gain from the tax, relative to the no-tax equilibrium in

Figure 3, as the parallelogram H. Figure 4B indicates the welfare gain from the tax as the triangle

WG, which is one-half the size of the health gain H. In the special case where the tax t exactly

offsets b, the welfare gain WG is exactly one-half the size of the health gain H. In contrast to the

example above in which consumer demand was not biased (Figures 1 and 2), the imposition of a

tax in this case improves consumer welfare, although not by as much as the health gains would

suggest.




                                                                                                      20
       A similar analysis holds if we consider informational interventions rather than taxes. One

complication in this case is that in order for information to have any effect, the nature of the bias

must be either a lack of information (which we consider implausible in the case of tobacco) or a

deviation from rationality that is amenable to the provision of information. Taxes, in contrast,

have the power to change behavior regardless of the reason for the bias, or indeed, the existence

of a bias. But if we are willing to allow the possibility of bias that is amenable to the provision of

information, Figure 5A and 5B depict the health and welfare gains, respectively, associated with

an information campaign that is optimal in the sense that it exactly offsets b and moves consumer

demand to the unbiased optimum Q1; these gains are identical to those depicted in Figures 4A

and 4B. Taxes are not identical to informational interventions; for one thing, they transfer

resources from consumers to the government in the form of tax revenue. The point of Figures 5A

and 5B, though, is that the relationship between health gains H and welfare gains W is the same

for any intervention that yields a change in consumption, regardless of whether the intervention

is a tax or an informational campaign.

       The examples in Figures 4 and 5 focus on interventions that are optimal in the sense that

they move consumption to the unbiased level. Similar analyses apply if the government imposes

a tax that is either less than or greater than this optimal level, reducing consumption not quite as

far as the unbiased level in the case of a too-small tax or below the unbiased level in the case of a

too-big tax. Appendix 1 illustrates these scenarios graphically, both for taxes and for

informational campaigns. More generally, we can derive expressions for the welfare gain and

health gain as a function of the tax t. For a biased consumer whose demand curve Db lies b units

above the unbiased demand curve Du, the deadweight loss associated with a tax t is




                                                                                                   21
                       𝐷𝑊𝐿(𝑡) = 0.5𝑚(𝑏 − 𝑡)2 ,                                       (1)



where m is the absolute value of the inverse of the slope of the demand curve. At 𝑡 = 0, the

deadweight loss is 0.5𝑚𝑏 2 . As t increases from zero to b, deadweight loss declines; at 𝑡 = 𝑏,

there is no deadweight loss, because the tax exactly offsets the bias. As t increases beyond b, the

deadweight loss increases. The change in deadweight loss associated with a tax t compared with

no tax is given by



                       ∆𝐷𝑊𝐿(𝑡) 𝑡=𝑡
                              |𝑡=0   = 0.5𝑚(𝑏 − 𝑡)2 |𝑡=𝑡
                                                     𝑡=0 = −0.5𝑚𝑡(2𝑏 − 𝑡).                    (2)
                         ∆𝑡




       The welfare gain associated with a tax t is simply the negative of the change in the

deadweight loss, which is a quadratic function of the tax:



                       𝑊(𝑡) = 0.5𝑚𝑡(2𝑏 − 𝑡) = −0.5𝑚𝑡 2 + 𝑚𝑡𝑏.                        (3)



       In contrast, the health gains 𝐻(𝑡) associated with a tax are linear in the tax:



                       𝐻(𝑡) = 𝑚𝑏𝑡.                                                   (4)



Both of these functions are illustrated in Figure 6: the health gains grow linearly with a tax, while

the welfare gains first increase, then decrease, with the square of the tax. Using equations (3) and

(4), we can easily see how the health gains compare to the welfare gains. Taking the ratio of

welfare gains to health gains and simplifying yields the expression



                                                                                                    22
                       𝑊(𝑡)          𝑡
                              = 1 − 2𝑏.                                       (5)
                       𝐻(𝑡)




In other words, at 𝑡 = 0, the health gains are equal to the welfare gains; at 𝑡 = 𝑏, welfare gains

are exactly half of health gains; as t approaches 2𝑏, the welfare gains represent an infinitesimal

fraction of the health gains. Any tax greater than 2b yields welfare losses, not gains, relative to

the no-intervention equilibrium. Formulating these relationships in terms of the “consumer

surplus offset” simply requires subtracting equation (5) from the number 1:



                                          𝑊(𝑡)
                       𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡 = 1 −              = (𝑡⁄2𝑏).                            (6)
                                          𝐻(𝑡)




       Thus, for extremely small taxes (close to zero) health gains closely approximate welfare

gains for biased consumers, and the consumer surplus offset that is required for regulatory

impact analysis is negligible. For taxes close to the optimal level (𝑡 = 𝑏), the health gains are

twice the welfare gains, so the offset is 50 percent. As taxes increase beyond the optimal level,

the offset increases linearly, until it is 100% at 𝑡 = 2𝑏. For a tax greater than 2b the notion of

an offset is no longer applicable because taxes in this range actually entail welfare losses, relative

to the no-intervention equilibrium. This example underscores the important point that even in a

simple case, the consumer surplus offset is not constant, but varies depending on the size of the

intervention-induced consumption change. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 8.

       There are two points worth emphasizing about this analysis. First, for a consumer who is

unbiased, taxes of any size will create welfare loss. Second, for a consumer who is biased, taxes

or other interventions to offset behavioral biases will increase consumer welfare, provided that


                                                                                                      23
the intervention is not too big in the sense that is pushes demand below the unbiased optimum.

Third, for a consumer who is biased, interventions that push demand below the unbiased

optimum have an ambiguous effect on welfare, relative to the no-intervention state, depending

on how far below the unbiased optimum the intervention reduces demand. There is a range in

which interventions that are “too big” are preferable, in terms of consumer welfare, to the

absence of intervention; but there comes a point at which no intervention would be preferable.



V. Extensions: Non-linear demand curves and multi-period models

        The figures in section IV show linear demand curves. These curves are easy to draw,

easy to shift, and easy to analyze. Actual demand curves, however, may not be linear. While the

theoretical literature is partial to linear demand curves, the empirical literature is partial to

constant elasticity curves, which are convex to the origin. We are not aware of empirical

literature that conclusively resolves whether demand curves for smoking are linear or log linear,

although as we show in this section such evidence would be important to know.

        Non-linear demand curves are not merely of academic interest. The area under the

demand curve is affected by the shape of the curve. If the shape of the demand curve is

decidedly non-linear and convex, then any welfare loss would be lower. The consensus estimate

for the price elasticity of overall demand is around −0.4, with a fairly narrow range of −0.3 to

−0.5 (Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). If we take the estimate of −0.4, then the area under the

constant elasticity curve compared to the area of the triangle assuming linear demand is about

one-third lower for a change in demand of 50 percent (see Appendix 2 for proof). Therefore,

estimates of the welfare effects that assume linear demand curves may overstate those effects by

about one-third.



                                                                                                    24
       As already noted, our graphical analysis above is for a static model. In the real world,

most smokers purchase cigarettes over many years, perhaps over their entire adult lifetime.

Therefore, any welfare effects should be summed over a lifetime and discounted appropriately.

This is straightforward when decisions in each period are independent of decisions in other

periods and discounting is exponential. In this case, the only economic consideration is what

discount rate to use; the range used in regulatory impact analyses is typically three to seven

percent, as suggested in Circular A-4, a “best practices” guide published by the Office of

Management and Budget in 2003 (available at

https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a004_a-4/). While the choice of a discount rate can

be critical for cost-benefit analysis — particularly for policies that have upfront costs and

benefits in the future — this is not our focus here.



VI. Discussion

       Our review of recent tobacco regulation and related published papers leads us to reject

the notion that foregone consumer surplus should not be counted as a cost in regulatory impact

analysis. In other words, we are unconvinced by Chaloupka et al. (2015) that foregone consumer

surplus should be largely ignored and gross health benefits used instead as a measure of

consumer welfare. Even if consumers are not rational, the correct response from an economic

perspective is not to abandon welfare analysis in favor of policies that maximize health; rather, it

should be to figure out how to perform welfare analysis when consumers are not rational. We

propose that health economists should embrace the behavioral welfare economics framework

developed for this purpose, developed primarily with reference to environmental economics.




                                                                                                  25
         We acknowledge, however, the practical difficulty of implementing this framework. In

particular, the behavioral welfare economics approach requires knowing the shape of not only

the biased market demand curve, but also the shape of the hypothetical unbiased demand curve.

This is a tall order. Once again, we propose drawing on the literature in environmental

economics and behavioral welfare economics for inspiration (Allcott and Sunstein 2015; Chetty

2015; Mullanaithan et al. 2012). Researchers in this literature have for some time focused on the

empirical question of identifying the extent of bias in consumer choices. We conclude by

mentioning four approaches used in this literature, to sketch a research agenda that might help

fill this key gap in health economics. In some cases, as we note below, health economics

research has already used these approaches without necessarily linking them to behavioral

welfare economics.

         One approach that would offer some insight into the extent of bias is measuring the

effects of nudges, where nudges are interventions that remove bias. In the smoking context, for

example, graphic warning labels ought to serve as a nudge, as discussed by Bernheim and

Rangel (2004), who refer to such labels as “counter-cues.” The effect of graphic warning labels

on actual smoking behavior remains an active and controversial area of research (Huang et al.

2014; Irvine 2016). 4

         Another approach uses self-reported well-being as an outcome measure. Chetty (2012)

points out that this is analogous to the use of contingent valuation methods for valuing

externalities: both approaches rely on individuals’ reported assessments of their well-being or

valuation of goods rather than observed willingness-to-pay. An excellent example of this


4
  Note that the impact of the Canadian graphic warning labels is important not only for what it would tell us about
the extent of bias, but because it helps inform whether the labels yield even gross (let alone net) health benefits. The
2012 US Circuit court decision rejecting the FDA’s attempt to require labels cites the FDA’s analysis of the impact
of graphic warning labels in Canada on smoking.


                                                                                                                      26
approach in the smoking context is Gruber and Mullainathan (2001), who find that excise taxes

on cigarettes raise the self-reported well-being of smokers, but not non-smokers, which is

consistent with the idea that smokers’ behavior reflects bias. Similar evidence for graphic

warning labels  for example, using data on well-being from one of the many countries that

have these labels  would provide evidence on the extent of bias that is amenable to this

intervention 5.

         Perhaps the most theoretically obvious, but hard-to-implement approach, is identifying

some consumers who are unbiased (or settings in which consumers may be unbiased) and

comparing their demand with that of biased consumers. This approach goes by different names.

For example, Chetty (2015) describes it with the term “sufficient statistics,” Mullainathan et al.

(2012) employ the phrase “using knowledge of when choices better reflect true preferences,” and

Cutler et al. (2016) refer to this as the “rational benchmark;” but the idea is the same. The

difficulty lies in identifying which consumers are biased. Several papers in the smoking

literature have used some version of this approach, relying on either demographic characteristics

(age and education) or indicators of the extent to which smokers are addicted as proxies for being

rational/unbiased (Weimer et al. 2009, Jin et al. 2015; Cutler et al. 2015).

         A final approach is structural modeling. In practice, this requires making assumptions

about the nature of the bias  for example, assuming that it is driven by time inconsistency that

can be captured in a parameter such as present bias  and then bounding the consequences of a

hypothetical policy by varying the parameter assumptions. Gruber and Koszegi (2001) use this

approach to determine a possible range of optimal cigarette taxes. An appealing feature of this

approach, in terms of regulatory impact analysis, is that these analyses already routinely include

5
 But see also Adler (2016) for cautions against the use of subjective well-being as a substitute for data on objective
well-being.


                                                                                                                    27
a range of estimates generated by different assumptions about parameters such as discount rates,

so that this aspect of the structural modeling approach is already familiar.

       None of these approaches are easy, and we do not claim to have solved the practical

question of how the FDA should carry out regulatory impact analysis of anti-smoking policies.

But we hope that we have at least offered a bridge to a larger literature in behavioral welfare

economics that will ultimately yield a general solution to the question of how to do cost-benefit

analysis when consumer choice may be biased. Within health economics, this problem arises for

many applications in addition to anti-smoking regulations. The regulation of alcohol; menu

labelling; regulation of opioids; and decisions about whether or not certain drugs can be sold

over-the-counter all raise the same difficult questions about how to measure benefits when

consumer choice may be biased by information problems, lack of self-control, or time

inconsistency, to name just a few possible sources of bias in these applications. The benefits of a

general solution to this question, even within health economics, go well beyond anti-smoking

regulations.

Appendix 1: Supplementary Figures Illustrating the Impact of Taxes or Informational

Intervention when Consumers Are Biased

         Figures 4 and 5 in the paper show the health gains and changes in consumer welfare in

response to the imposition of an optimal tax (Figure 4) or an optimal informational intervention

(Figure 5), relative to the no-intervention state shown in Figure 3, when consumer demand is

biased upward and “optimal” is defined as a tax/informational intervention that shifts demand to

the unbiased level. In this appendix, we show similar figures for taxes and informational

interventions that are either smaller or larger than the optima level.

         Appendix Figures 1A and 1B shows the health gains and welfare gains, respectively,

associated with the imposition of a tax that is smaller than the optimal tax. Both the health and

welfare gains are positive, compared to the no-intervention state shown in Figure 3 in the paper;

but they are smaller than the corresponding health and welfare gains shown in Appendix Figures

4A and 4B. The important point, though, is that the welfare gain shown in Appendix Figure 1B is

smaller than the health gain shown in Appendix Figure 1A; as the intervention increases from

zero to its optimal level, the ratio of W to H declines from one to one-half (as illustrated in

Figure 7 in the paper).

         Appendix Figures 2A and 2B are exactly analogous to Appendix Figures 1A and 1B,

except that they illustrate the impact of an informational intervention, rather than a tax, that is

smaller than the optimal level in the sense that consumption is reduced, but not to the unbiased

level.

         Next, we consider taxes that are larger than the optimal level. Appendix Figure 3A shows

the health gains associated with a larger-than-optimal tax, which are even larger than the health

gains associated with the optimal tax (depicted in Figure 4A in the paper). The welfare gain,




                                                                                                      41
however, is another story. Appendix Figure 3B shows that the larger-than-optimal tax creates a

welfare loss triangle in addition to the welfare gain triangle that was created by the optimal tax.

The larger the tax, the larger the welfare loss triangle; ultimately, the welfare loss will be larger

than the welfare gain, and the net effect of the tax on welfare will be negative. The health gains,

in contrast, continue to increase linearly.

       Finally, Appendix Figures 5A and 5B illustrate the impact of informational interventions

that are larger than the optimal level, with results exactly analogous to those shown in Appendix

Figures 4A and 4B.

Appendix 2: Varying Assumptions about the Shape of the Demand Curve


       The purpose of this section is to compare the welfare loss under two different

assumptions about the shape of the demand curve, linear or constant elasticity. In the standard

case of linear demand and flat supply curve, the welfare loss is a triangle. In the case of constant

elasticity of demand, the demand curve is convex to the origin.


       Let the demand curve have constant price elasticity, where the natural log of quantity Q is

a linear function of the natural log of price P. The linear equation has constant C and elasticity e.


                                         𝑙𝑛𝑄 = 𝐶 + 𝑒𝑙𝑛𝑃


Solving for P

                                                 𝐶

where 𝑘 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝐶 ⁄𝑒).


       Suppose that a tax lowers demand from 2q to q (as in Figure 2B). What will the welfare

loss be? For the constant elasticity demand, the welfare loss is found by integrating the area

between the demand and supply curves, from q to 2q. Because the supply curve is flat, it equals
                       1
the price at 𝑃 = 𝑘(2𝑞)𝑒 .

       For comparison to the linear demand case, we compute the area under the linear demand

curve using the same two prices. The welfare loss with linear demand is one-half the change in

quantity (2𝑞 − 𝑞) times the change in price 𝑃(𝑞) − 𝑃(2𝑞).

       The ratio of the two areas is a constant.
