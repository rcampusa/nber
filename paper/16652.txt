                                           ABSTRACT

We review the theory and evidence on venture capital (VC) and other private equity: why professional
private equity exists, what private equity managers do with their portfolio companies, what returns
they earn, who earns more and why, what determines the design of contracts signed between (i) private
equity managers and their portfolio companies and (ii) private equity managers and their investors
(limited partners), and how/whether these contractual designs affect outcomes. Findings highlight
the importance of private ownership, and information asymmetry and illiquidity associated with it,
as a key explanatory factor of what makes private equity different from other asset classes.

1       Introduction

            Worldwide, private equity funds manage about $2.5 trillion [(TheCityUK 2010), p.2].

While buyouts (BO) generally account for one half to two thirds of private equity investments by

value, venture capital (VC) accounts for the majority of investments by number of deals. The

industry underwent an extraordinary growth in the last 15 years, increasing from $100 billion in

1994 [(Fenn and Liang 1998), p.2]. A main driver of this change was institutional investors’

portfolio allocation to private equity, which increased from 3% (2%) on average in 1997 to 12%

(6%) in 2007 for large foundations (endowments).1 Private equity funds’ roles in the economy

and their managerial compensation drew scrutiny among policymakers in the aftermath of the

2007-8 financial crisis, and there is an ongoing debate about increasing taxation on private equity

managers’ profit participation (= “carried interest”), and on the industry’s impact on innovation,

competition, and employment. The industry has rapidly globalized in recent years, with China

receiving the third highest investment after U.S. and U.K. in 2008-2009, followed by France and

India.2 Reflecting their increasingly important roles as financial intermediaries and as activist

investors, the literature studying venture capital and other private equity (e.g., buyouts) funds has

grown significantly in the last decade.

            In this paper we review the literature on the following topics: why professional private

equity exists; what private equity managers do with their portfolio companies; what returns they

earn, who earns more and why; what determines the design of contracts signed between (i) them

and portfolio companies and (ii) them and their investors (limited partners); and how/whether

these contractual designs affect outcomes.

            To the best of our knowledge this is the only survey paper that treats both the venture

capital (VC) and the buyout (BO) segments as subsets of a broader, private equity industry. By

doing so, we highlight similarities among them – what makes them both “private equity” – in

contrast to the public equity markets. Key defining characteristic is the illiquidity of the capital

and the information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders of the firms. Often times, the

focus in the literature is on “leveraged” in the “leveraged buyouts” – even though an LBO is just

one of many deal structures that private equity investors employ to deploy their fund capital. We

instead focus on what distinguishes both the venture capital and buyout funds from other

investment management vehicles, such as hedge funds and mutual funds, and discuss the theory

and evidence on this “private equity” industry both as financial intermediaries and as an asset

class.3

          The paper proceeds as follows. We begin in Section 2 by defining private equity and then

discussing theories that motivate the existence and economic rationale for venture capital and

buyout specialists, respectively. Both VCs and BO investors are financial intermediaries that

raise funds from institutional investors and invest in private, illiquid companies. They are both

activist investors that exercise significant control rights over their portfolio companies, and aim to

maximize financial returns on behalf of their investors. Theories explaining the rationale for VC

emphasize the information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and investors and contrast VCs’

superior information production ability vis-à-vis banks. Theories explaining the rationale for BO

instead assume that BO targets are public firms and either highlight the improved managerial

incentives of LBO firms (as compared with those given to public company CEOs) or are

concerned more broadly with the question of why firms go private. Neither strand of theories

explains why private firms become targets of BO funds.

          Section 3 reviews the broad literature that documents the economic (value-added)

activities of VC and BO investors. The literature identifies three groups of economic activities

for both VC and BO, namely: (1) pre-investment screening activities; (2) monitoring / governance

activities during the holding period; and (3) influencing and orchestrating exiting activities.

         In Section 4 we focus on the performance of the private equity funds. We begin by

discussing the levels of risk-adjusted returns. We then review the evidence on performance

persistence, and various sources of both the level of excess performance and its persistence. The

extant evidence on excess performance (and its persistence) in private equity is mixed; we

provide several reasons as to why this is and suggest futures areas for research.

         In Section 5, we discuss the strand of literature that examines features of contracts signed

between private equity fund managers and their investors, as well as contracts signed between

private equity fund managers and their portfolio companies. Both VC and BO funds are

organized as closed-end, finite-life limited partnerships, with fund managers serving as general

partners (GPs) and investors as limited partners (LPs). Partnership agreements set management

fees, carried interest, and (in case of BO funds) terms of transaction fees and monitoring fees. The

agreements also restrict activities of the fund managers through various covenants. The literature

on VC contracts has focused on the use of convertible securities, staged financing, syndication,

voting rights, and board rights. In contrast to the extensive literature on the VC contracts, the

theoretical literature on the BO contracts is almost nonexistent. Evidence from existing empirical

analyses suggest that agency problems between GPs and LPs of BO funds may be exacerbated

when cheap debt is available and allows GPs to collect large fees from portfolio companies

upfront in the form of transaction fees.

      Finally, in Section 6 we conclude with a summary of what we know and what still needs to

be learned.


2     Why Do Venture Capital and Private Equity Markets Exist?

2.1    What is Private Equity?

We provide a definition of private equity funds by listing the following main characteristics:



                                                                                                   4
1. A PE fund is a financial intermediary, meaning that it takes the investors’ capital and invests

    it directly in portfolio companies.

2. A PE fund invests only in private companies. This means that once the investments are made,

    the companies cannot be immediately traded on a public exchange.

3. A PE fund takes an active role in monitoring and helping the companies in its portfolio.

4. A PE fund’s primary goal is to maximize its financial return by exiting investments through a

    sale or an initial public offering (IPO).

Characteristic (1) defines PE funds as financial intermediaries and differentiates it from angel

investors and private investment companies that use their own capital. Typically these funds are

organized as limited partnerships, with the venture capitalists or the buyout firm partners acting

as the general partners (GPs) of the fund and the investors — often pension funds, endowments

and other institutional investors — acting as the limited partners (LPs). Potential agency conflicts

between GPs and LPs are addressed by contractual provisions in the limited partnership

agreements, and have been examined in the literature, as discussed below.

        Characteristic (2) is the most obvious defining feature of private equity and distinguishes

it from both the traditional investment assets of stocks and bonds as well as the other alternative

asset of hedge funds. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between various asset classes within

private equity and also between private equity and other asset classes. Within private equity,

there are four main subclasses, of which VC and BO are the largest and most important two.

Overlapping circles in Figure 1 indicates where the scopes of neighboring groups overlap: for

example, the mezzanine category comprises both growth equity (that overlaps with later-stage

venture capital) and the subordinate debt layer of buyout transactions (which is often attached to

some equity ownership) and thus overlaps with both venture capital and buyouts. Distressed

investing, on the other hand, can be thought of as a specialized segment of buyouts that target

mature and distressed companies.



                                                                                                  5
          In all four cases, portfolio companies of private equity funds are private companies for

which little public information exists. Thus, information asymmetry is thought to be far greater

in private equity compared with investments in public companies that must file regular reports

with the SEC and also are often covered by Wall Street analysts. As a result, portfolio values of

private equity funds are not marked to market and fund returns are not finalized until the end of

the funds’ lifetime. In contrast, while some hedge funds participate in private equity transactions

(especially larger companies that buyouts and distressed investors invest in), they are primarily

investors in publicly traded assets such as stocks and bonds and their portfolios are marked to

market.

          Characteristic (3) is central to the raison d’être of private equity — and potentially a key

determinant of a given PE fund’s performance. While all “active” investment fund managers —

mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds — select their stocks and are evaluated on

their ability to pick winners, not all of them actively influence actions of the management of the

companies they invest in. Except for large blockholders who gain seats on the boards of public

companies, public company investors’ ability to influence the management is severely limited. In

contrast, private equity investors often condition their investments on contractual provisions, such

as board seats, veto rights, and various contingent control rights, that enable them to influence the

actions of the management while they hold their investments. In Section 3, we provide an

extensive review of the literature’s findings on these monitoring / value-adding activities

performed by PE fund managers.

          Finally, since PE funds are financial intermediaries, they need some mechanism to give

money back to their investors, which gives rise to Characteristic (4). Exits can occur through an

IPO, with a subsequent sale of the PE stake in the open market, through a sale of the company to

another investor (especially to another BO fund), or through the sale of the company to a larger

company. The requirement to exit and the focus on financial return differentiates PE from




                                                                                                    6
strategic investments done by large corporations. While corporations are active both in VC and

BO markets, their investment criteria are different from professional PE because of the lack of

need for exits and greater emphasis on synergy with their existing operations.

        To summarize, PE funds differ from both mutual funds and hedge funds in that they

invest in illiquid, private companies, and differ from corporations in that they are required to

return money to investors within a finite investment horizon and thus need to focus on targets

with a clear path to exits. These functional differences are reflected in the ways PE funds are

organized, in contrast to hedge funds and mutual funds, and as described in Table 1. PE funds

have a finite life — typically 10 years — and a fixed fund size that is determined at the time of

the fund inception. Both hedge funds and mutual funds are open-ended and do not have a finite

fund lifetime. Within the fund lifetime, investors in PE funds must commit to illiquidity of up to

10 years, unlike hedge funds and mutual funds, both of which allow redemptions on demand,

subject to some waiting period.

      Because of the illiquidity and the long-term nature of PE investments, reinvestments are

not permitted or restricted to a modest fraction of the fund size; in contrast, hedge fund and

mutual fund investors are offered options to automatically reinvest any dividends and

distributions from funds on an on-going basis. PE fees are often highest first and decline in later

years, because successful managers are expected to raise follow-on funds with new fee streams;

hedge fund and mutual fund fees are flat percentages of assets under management, so that total

fees would rise over time as assets grow. And finally, despite the common perception, hedge

fund and PE fund carried interest are earned quite differently. In hedge funds, carry is a fixed

percentage (usually 20%) of the market value of the portfolio in excess of cost basis, and can be

earned each year as long as the former exceeds the latter, subject to high watermarks. In contrast,

carried interest in PE is earned only on realized basis — i.e., only if investments are exited and

cumulative exit values exceed the contractually specified threshold amount. Since exits typically




                                                                                                 7
are concentrated in the latter half of the funds’ life, PE managers often wait for many years before

they earn any carry from their funds.


2.2   The Economic Rationale for Professional Venture Capitalists

Several theoretical papers offer economic rationale for existence of VC funds as defined above.

(Chan 1983) shows that, in a market setting with imperfect information and positive search costs,

uninformed investors and informed entrepreneurs in equilibrium are unable to overcome the

lemons problem and investors earn lower returns by investing in alternative projects. Venture

capitalists as financial intermediaries may evolve as informed screening agents that improve the

allocation of resources and welfare of the investors. (Campello and Da Matta 2010) provide an

equilibrium analysis of prospective LPs’ demand for GPs’ service, quality of GPs’ screening

activities, and payoffs GPs derive from running VC funds.

        Venture capital funds are not the only financial intermediaries that bridge between

investors and small businesses; banks also provide the intermediary function for small businesses.

(Ueda 2004) offers an explanation for why VCs and banks coexist in an economy. The key trade-

off between the two choices is that while VCs’ evaluations of the project quality are more

accurate, they also use the threat of expropriation to extract rent from the entrepreneurs. The

model explains why projects financed by VCs have less collateral, high growth, high risk, and

high profitability, and why VC markets are more active in markets where intellectual property is

better protected.

        (Winton and Yerramilli 2008) is another paper that compares venture capital financing

with bank financing. While (Ueda 2004) focuses on the ex ante screening ability differential

between VCs and banks, (Winton and Yerramilli 2008) model follow-on financing decisions, thus

incorporating ex post (costly) monitoring into their analysis. In addition to the standard continue-

or-liquidate decision, the model allows for an aggressive or a conservative continuation choice,

which makes continuation strategy risky in the sense of cash flow volatility between the two



                                                                                                  8
choices. VCs have better ability to monitor, but demand higher returns because they impose

illiquidity on their investors; in contrast, banks are less skilled at monitoring, but demand lower

returns from entrepreneurs because they themselves face lower funding cost by exposing

themselves to liquidity shocks. VCs are optimal only if firms face highly risky and positively

skewed project cash flows, with low probability of success, low liquidation value, and high

returns if successful, and if they face highly volatile cash flows across two continuation strategies.


2.3     The Economic Rationale for Professional Buyout Investor

The extant literature that relates to the economic rationale for existence of buyout investors has

focused exclusively on public-to-private transactions, where formerly publicly traded companies

are taken over by buyout investors and delisted. In one strand, the agency conflicts between

shareholders and the management of public firms are emphasized, with leveraged buyouts

proposed as solutions. In another strand of this literature, information and liquidity are

emphasized as main factors governing the firm’s decision to go private.


2.3.1    Jensen’s Theory of Leveraged Buyouts as Governance Mechanism

In a series of articles [e.g., (Jensen and Meckling 1976), (Jensen 1986), (Jensen 1989), (Jensen

2007)], Jensen and his co-authors advance a hypothesis that free cash flows in public firms

present serious agency problems and that LBOs mitigate these conflicts between managers and

shareholders. Private benefits of control (and higher compensation associated with larger firm

size) induce public firm mangers to engage in empire building and misuse free cash flows, both at

the expense of shareholders. Jensen argues that debt reduces agency costs of free cash flows and

disciplines the managers, and that the growth in popularity of LBOs during the 1980’s was partly

due to this control function of debt. Moreover, larger managerial ownership and the monitoring

and controlling functions of BO investors, combined with the discipline of debt, lead to better-run

firms and improved operational performance.




                                                                                                    9
         Studying a sample of 263 going private transactions between 1980 and 1987, (Lehn and

Poulsen 1989) find empirical evidence in support of Jensen’s free cash flow hypothesis:

undistributed cash flows are significantly related to a firm’s decision to go private, and premiums

paid to stockholders are significantly related to undistributed cash flows.4


2.3.2    Information and Liquidity as Critical Determinants of Public Status

(Mehran and Peristiani 2010) empirically examine a sample of companies that went private

between 1990 and 2007 and argue that a primary reason behind the decision to de-list was a

failure to attract financial visibility and investor interest. Firms with declining analyst coverage,

institutional ownership, and low stock turnover were more likely to go private and opted to do so

sooner. Similar results are reported by (Bharath and Dittmar 2010), who study a sample of going-

private transactions from 1980 to 2004. Both studies compare determinants of going private for

those firms that were acquired by BO funds and those that were taken over by other investors

(e.g., management and other private companies), and find that they go private for similar reasons.

For example, non-LBO going-private transactions are more likely if the firms have less analyst

coverage and higher free cash flow, as are LBO transactions. Thus, the findings in these studies

explain why firms go private in general more than why firms specifically choose to go private

under the buyout fund ownership.5

2.3.3   Economic Rationale of Private-to-Private Buyouts

While the largest buyout investments are often public-to-private deals (with high leverage) and

they tend to receive heightened attention from media due to their size and high profile, the vast

majority of buyout targets are private firms and these transactions often employ little to moderate

leverage. For example, (Stromberg 2007) reports that, of 21,397 buyout transactions between

  Also see (Kaplan 1991), (Cotter and Peck 2001), (Denis 1992), (Lehn et al. 1990), (Hite and Vetsuypens 1989),
(Denis 1994), (Gupta and Rosenthal 1991), and (Muscarella and Vetsuypens 1990).
5
  But also see (DeAngelo et al. 1984), (Slovin et al. 1991), which examine management buyouts from the 1980’s and
find that targets who receive bids with an outside buyout investor experience significantly higher returns than those
without. Also see (Masulis and Thomas 2009).


                                                                                                                 10
1970-2007, public-to-private transactions account only for 6.7% of all transactions and 28% of

firm values acquired. Thus, neither the high leverage nor the going private decision is a necessary

ingredient of a buyout investment. To the best of our knowledge, little prior theoretical work

exists that systematically analyzes the economic roles played by private-to-private buyout

investors or buyouts where high leverage is not a key ingredient. Indeed, in a recent empirical

study of private-to-private buyout transactions, (Chung 2009) argues that agency costs of free

cash flows is unlikely to explain the buyouts of privately held targets, as ownership is already

concentrated in these firms prior to buyouts. Moreover, these firms grow substantially after

buyouts. These empirical findings by Stromberg, Chung and others suggest that more research is

needed to understand the economic rationale of non-public-to-private buyout transactions.


3     What do Venture Capitalists and Buyout Investors do?

As discussed in the previous section, private equity investors are activist, hands-on investors

whose goal is to maximize financial returns on behalf of their limited partners. The literature

focuses on three main groups of activities: (i) pre-investment screening activities; (ii) monitoring

and governance activities during the holding period; and (iii) exiting activities. Both VC- and

BO-backing are associated with improved governance practice at the investee firms including

more independent and hands-on boards and higher earnings quality.


3.1    Economic Activities of Venture Capitalists

VC (and BO) firms serve as general partners of the fund they run. Since these funds have a finite

lifetime, typically 10-years long, firms raise new funds every 3-5 years and at a given point in

time mature firms are managing two or more consecutive funds. Funds that are 5 years or

younger take up more of general partners’ time and efforts, as such funds are in their “investment

periods” — periods during which the GPs of the fund search and screen hundreds of prospective

startups before committing capital to a select portfolio of 15-25 companies. Funds that are older

than 5 years are in the growth and harvesting stage — a period during which the GPs’ main work


                                                                                                 11
is to monitor and provide follow-on funds as necessary and conditional on achieving milestones,

assist the portfolio companies in value-adding activities, and finally help prepare the companies

for exit events, either via IPOs or acquisitions.              For a number of companies that are not

sufficiently successful to warrant profitable exits, this is also a period in which VCs get involved

in restructuring or shutting down the operations.

         (Gorman and Sahlman 1989) report 49 responses to a questionnaire mailed (this is pre-

email era!) to 100 venture capitalists in 1984. They provide the first evidence on how VCs

actually spend their days. For example, VCs (who responded) spend about half their time

monitoring nine portfolio investments; of these, five are companies on whose boards they sit. As

board members, a VC typically devotes 80 hours of on-site time and 30 hours of phone time per

year in direct contact with each company. Fundraising, strategic analysis, and management

recruitment are the most commonly mentioned activities that they perform. The number of

companies VCs monitor seems to have changed little since 1984: (Metrick and Yasuda 2010a)

report that, for a sample of funds raised between 1993-2006, a mean (median) VC fund invests in

24 (20) companies and has 5 (4) partners, suggesting that a partner at a typical VC firm running

two funds on average would monitor close to 10 firms at a given point in time.6

         How do VCs screen startups before committing capital, and what kind of companies do

they tend to fund? (Kaplan et al. 2009) examine 50 VC-backed companies that eventually went

public, and find that business lines remain stable from early business plan to IPO, while

management is frequently replaced. Therefore, the results suggest that the business (idea) rather

than the management team should be the key screening criteria for investments in startups. The

evidence of frequent management turnover is in line with (Hellmann 1998), which explains that




6
 For example, a hypothetical XZY Venture Partners with 4 partners may have their first fund, XYZ I, that is 7 years
old and has 20 portfolio companies, and another fund XYZ II that is 4 years and nearly fully funded, with another 20
companies. (20+20)/4 = 10.


                                                                                                                12
in equilibrium founders voluntarily relinquish control of the firm so that VCs are incented to

search for a superior management team without fear of holdup.7

       In an empirical study of a large, comprehensive small business dataset, (Puri and Zarutskie

2010) find that VC-backed companies tend to be younger, faster-growing, and larger compared to

non-VC-backed companies. Thus, scalability is an important criterion that VCs use to screen

prospective investments’ market potential, while profitability is not. The tendency for faster

growth of VC-backed firms may also contribute to the higher CEO turnover rate: rare are

individuals who have the talent and skill sets of founder-CEOs of startups as well as those of

professional managers running multi-billion dollar companies.

         Do VCs fund high-growth companies, or do companies funded by VCs grow fast?

According to (Inderst and Mueller 2009), the answer seems to be a little bit of both. The paper

shows that, in a competitive product market, new ventures financed by VCs (active investors)

may prey on rivals by “strategically overinvesting” early on, and dominate their industry peers in

the long run. The value of VCs is greater in highly competitive industries as well as in industries

with network effects and economies of scope, as is typical for many “new economy” industries.8

Collectively, these papers support the view that a VC business model works the best in newly

emerging markets that can support fast growth and large scale, and VCs strategically focus their

efforts and attain skills that enable them to identify strong business ideas in such markets and

push them to achieve high growth in a relatively short period time for attractive financial returns.

         Once VCs find and fund their portfolio companies, how do they monitor / influence them,

who receive more monitoring and why, and is monitoring valuable to the companies? VC

investments are often staged, and by structuring investments to be dispensed over many

incremental rounds, each conditional on some measure of performance, rather than an upfront



7
  (Hellman and Puri 2002), (Baker and Gompers 2003), and (Hochberg 2003) find that replacement of founder-CEOs is
more likely and/or occurs faster at VC-backed companies compared with non-VC-backed firms.
8
  In line with this view of VCs’ comparative advantage, (Hellmann and Puri 2000) find that first-mover firms are more
likely to obtain venture capital than follower (imitator) firms.


                                                                                                                 13
payment for the whole project, VCs exercise their rights to monitor, evaluate the interim

performance and (and if found unpromising) abandon the project mid-course. Consistent with the

monitoring role of staged financing, (Gompers 1995) analyzes a sample of 794 VC-backed

companies’ investment history and finds that firms with higher levels of agency costs (measured

by, e.g., the ratio of intangible to total assets, the market-to-book ratio, and R&D intensity) are

monitored more frequently, i.e., durations between their investment rounds are more frequent.

          Venture capitalists appear to influence the way in which their portfolio companies are run,

staffed, and funded. Using a dataset on Silicon Valley start-ups, (Hellmann and Puri 2002) find

that VC-backed companies are more professionalized, as measured by human resource policies,

adoption of stock option plans, and hiring of a marketing VP. Using a sample of European VC

deals, (Bottazzi et al. 2008) find that venture capitalists with more prior business experience are

more hands-on investors, helping with recruiting and fundraising for and interacting more

frequently with their portfolio companies.9 Both (Baker and Gompers 2003) and (Hochberg 2003)

find that VC backing is associated with more independent boards. (Lerner 1995) reports that

board representations increase around CEO turnover and is higher the more distant the companies

and VCs are from each other. (Cornelli et al. 2010), using East European VC investment data,

document disciplinary roles (manager evaluation and firing) played by VC-backed company

boards. Moreover, (Hochberg 2003) also finds that VC-backed IPO firms exhibit lower earnings

management than non-VC-backed counterparts.10

            Several studies document the economic roles of VCs in innovation. (Kortum and Lerner

2000), for example, find that increases in VC funding in an industry is associated with

significantly higher patenting rates, while controlling for the effect of unobservable arrivals of

technological opportunities that affect both VC activities and patenting by using instruments.

Patents filed by VC-backed companies are more valuable (cited and litigated more frequently)

than those filed by non-VC-backed companies. (Hellmann and Puri 2000) find that VC backing is

associated with a significant reduction in the time to bring a product to market and that this is

especially true for firms with first-mover positions in the markets. Finally, (Tian and Wang

2010) find evidence that firms backed by VCs with higher tolerance for failure (measured by the

VCs’ willingness to keep funding a startup conditional on not meeting milestones) stay

innovative long after VCs exit as investors.11 Overall, the evidence is strong that VCs pour funds

into innovator firms (who present the greatest “homerun” opportunities) and push for their

dominance as first movers in new markets [but see (Caselli et al. 2009) for a contrary European

evidence].12

       Some studies focus on VCs’ roles as managers of a portfolio of firms that may collaborate

as well as compete with each other. (Lindsey 2008) provides evidence that strategic alliances are

more frequent among companies sharing a common venture capitalist, and that the effect is

concentrated in alliances in which contracting problems are more pronounced [also see (Gompers

and Xuan 2009)]. (Inderst et al. 2007) argue that, by staging funding and rationing a fixed amount

of capital (bound by the size of committed capital) among a portfolio of companies in later stage

financing, VCs not only improve their bargaining power but also enhance entrepreneurs’

incentives to outperform their peer portfolio companies.

       Given these highly specialized, hands-on activities that VCs perform, it is not surprising

that the most common backgrounds VC partners have are some combination of technology /

science and business. According to (Wieland 2009), among the 125 partners from 15 VC firms,

60 percent of them hold a degree in science or engineering; particularly common is a bachelor’s

degree in engineering, which 44 percent of VCs hold. The most common postgraduate degrees

held by VCs are MBA degrees — held by 62 percent of them. 78 percent of them have worked in


11
   In a related paper, (Gompers et al. 2005) find that public companies that were once VC-backed firms themselves
spawn VC-backed entreprensuers at a significantly higher rate than others.
12
   Using a sample of 37 Italian VC-backed IPO firms and matched pairs of 37 non-VC-backed IPO firms, (Caselli et al.
2009) find that VCs choose more innovative firms at the time of backing, but post-transactions VC-backed firms do not
pursue more innovative business plans.


                                                                                                                 15
the IT or health care sector, 37 percent have worked as entrepreneurs in startups, and 38 percent

as line manager at a listed firm.13

       There is some empirical evidence that capital markets perceive VC monitoring (as proxied

by VC reputation) to enhance firm values. For example, examining a sample of VC-backed IPO

firms between 1978 and 1987, (Barry et al. 1990) find that firms backed by high reputation VCs

(as measured by, e.g., VC age and the number of past IPOs) experience lower underpricing for

their IPOs. (Krishnan et al. forthcoming) find that more reputable VCs stay involved longer after

IPOs and contribute to better long-run performance of the firms.

       Finally, VCs seem to influence timing of exit events in some cases.14 (Masulis and Nahata

forthcoming) provide evidence that VCs face pressure to have liquidity events towards the end of

their funds’ life; thus, M&A announcements of firms backed by VC funds near the end of fund

life are associated with significantly higher acquirer returns, suggesting these are fire sales. (Puri

and Zarutskie 2010) also document time-varying survival rates of VC-backed companies: they are

higher relative to non-VC-backed firms in the first four years after receiving funding, but

conditional on surviving past this point, are lower in the subsequent periods.


3.2    Economic Activities of Buyout Investors

In one of the early papers examining the first wave of buyouts in the 1980’s, (Kaplan 1991)

document status changes of LBO target firms over time and find that LBOs are neither short-lived

nor permanent: Median target firms spend about 7 years remaining private. (Stromberg 2007),

(Guo et al. forthcoming), and (Lopez de Silanes et al. 2010), using data sets that involve more

recent BO transactions, report median holding periods of 9, 4, and 4 years, respectively.

         What types of firms are likely to become buyout targets? (Opler and Titman 1993) find

that, consistent with free-cash-flow theory, LBO target firms have both low Tobin’s q and high


13
  Similar findings are reported by (Zarutskie 2010) for first-time VC partners. Also see (Gompers et al. 2009).
14
  Also see (Bayar and Chemmanur forthcoming) for a theoretical analysis of IPO vs. acquisition exit decisions by
entrepreneurs and VCs.


                                                                                                            16
cash flows relative to non-target firms, and are more diversified. Firms with large expected costs

of financial distress (measured as those with high R&D expenditures) are less likely to do

LBOs.15

          With respect to post-investment monitoring activities of buyout investors, (Cotter and

Peck 2001) find that buyout specialists use more long-term debt and are more active monitors of

firms and their monitoring roles substitute for tighter debt terms in motivating managers to run

their firms efficiently. In a case study, (Baker and Wruck 1989) examine the LBO of O.M. Scott

& Sons and document that the adoption of a strong incentive compensation plan, a reorganization

and decentralization of decision making, and the relationships between managers, PE sponsors,

and the board of directors were as important as the disciplining power of heavy debt load and

management equity ownership in improving performance of the firm.16

          More recently, (Kaplan et al. forthcoming) examine the relationship between CEO

characteristics and subsequent performance of BO portfolio companies and find that resoluteness

and execution skills, but not communication and interpersonal skills, translate to good

performance. (Acharya et al. 2009) study a hand-collected sample of boards of U.K., BO-backed

companies and find that they play a markedly active role “leading” the company strategy and

operations whereas boards of non-BO backed, plc companies play a more remote, supervisory

and monitoring role. (Cornelli and Karakas 2008) study UK firms that went through public-to-

private transactions and find (1) significant reduction in board size, (2) replacement of outside

directors with BO firm employees, (3) greater BO firm presence at boards of companies requiring

more time and efforts (e.g., firms that experience CEO change at the time of transactions), and

overall high turnover both of directors and CEOs during investment periods.17 Focusing on a


15
   Also see (Lehn and Poulsen 1989), (Lehn et al. 1990), and (DeAngelo and DeAngelo 1987).
16
   Also see (Denis 1994) for an in-depth case study comparison of an LBO vs. a leveraged recapitalization.
17
   Consistent with a tighter leash with which BO-backed company executives are managed, (Edgerton 2010) finds that
LBO target firms significantly reduce the size of their corporate jet fleets compared with those of comparable public
firms. (Brown et al. 2009) find that LBO target firms bargain harder with suppliers post transactions. The effect is
absent in cases of leverage recapitalizations; thus, it is the change in organizational form rather than leverage that lead
to price concessions from suppliers.


                                                                                                                       17
sample of public-debt issuing private firms that later have IPOs, (Katz 2009) finds that BO-

backed firms have higher earnings quality than those that do not have BO-sponsorship, engage

less in earnings management, and report more conservatively both before and after the IPO.

These findings are consistent with tighter monitoring and reputational considerations exhibited by

BO investors.

            One particularly controversial issue is how buyout investors affect employment,

productivity, and investment activities at the portfolio companies.18 (Davis et al. 2008) find that

U.S. Buyout target firms reduce more pre-existing jobs relative to controls both before and after

the transactions, but create more jobs at new establishments they open after transactions. Higher

old-job destructions of buyout target firms are driven by service sector firms rather than

manufacturing firms. (Harris et al. 2005) find that U.K. buyout target plants are less productive

pre-transaction and experience a substantial increase in productivity after a buyout, due to

reduction in labor intensity of production via outsourcing of intermediate goods and materials.

(Bernstein et al. 2010) analyze the impact of buyouts on industry performance across nations

(U.S., U.K., and continental Europe) and find that high BO activity is associated with faster

growth in productivity and employment. (Lerner et al. forthcoming) find that LBOs do not

decrease patenting activity of target firms, patents applied for by target firms are more cited, and

are more concentrated in the most important and prominent areas of companies’ innovative

portfolios. Overall, evidence suggests that buyout target firms become strategically more focused,

which lead to existing job loss where inefficiency existed, and at the same time result in focused

expansions and job creations in areas of their core strengths.


4       Performance: Risk-adjusted Returns, Persistence, and Sources of Performance

Both VC and BO funds make illiquid investments in private companies and fund returns are

reported either as IRRs or value multiples, not time-weighted returns. At the deal level,


18
     Also see (Lichtenberg and Siegel 1990) and (Long and Ravenscraft 1993) for earlier evidence.


                                                                                                    18
investment return realizations are low frequency events, and may not be observed for deals that

stagnate and are never cashed out. These features of PE investments make it challenging to

analyze their performance using standard risk-adjustment methods.

        VC and BO asset classes also share similarities in the reported findings about their

performances. While neither asset class appears to significantly outperform public benchmarks

after risk adjustments, there seems to be some performance persistence among firms. These

findings contrast sharply with findings in the mutual fund literature. The persistence is stronger in

VC than in BO, and some explanations have been offered for the difference.


4.1   Evidence on Returns

Data on investment performance of VC and BO investments can be gathered either at the

portfolio company level, or at the fund level. While the fund-level data have the advantage of

being net of fund fees and carry, aggregation at the fund level also implies loss of information

about the timing of individual investments and exits. Loss of information is particularly

problematic for cases of investment write-offs, as researchers do not observe when the funds and

their investors incur actual losses. In contrast, deal-level data allow researchers to more explicitly

control for selection bias arising from lack of observations for final outcomes of unsuccessful

investments. However, the deal-level data may suffer from incompleteness, as documented by

(Kaplan et al. 2002) and (Maats et al. 2010). Furthermore, studies using deal-level data are often

restricted (due to data limitations) to firms that underwent IPOs and/or (in case of buyouts) firms

that were publicly traded prior to transactions, which are a small and select subset of all PE target

firms. The best studies in this area have either made use of a novel dataset, developed a model

that helps overcome the data problem, or both.

        We first review the papers studying cash flows data in and out of VC and BO funds, and

then review the evidence based on company-level data. Finally, we review evidence based on VC

and BO index returns, which have been developed based on both fund-level and deal-level data.



                                                                                                   19
4.1.1     Fund-level performance

Cash flow data for fund partnerships are typically reported quarterly, and funds aggregate and net

out any opposing cash flows that occur during a given measurement period. For example, a fund

that receives a quarterly management fees of $5M and a capital call of $10M, and books an exit

distribution to LP of $40M will have a net cash outflow of -$25M to the investors that period, and

conversely the investors (limited partners) experience a net cash inflow of +$25M.19 Since this

observed net cash flow is already net of fees and carry, fund-level performance measures

represent net returns.

          Researchers face two primary challenges when using fund-level cash flows data to assess

risk and returns in private equity. First, this type of data is confidential and is not easily accessible

for research use. Recently, a small number of researchers have overcome this obstacle and gained

access to data, either from a single large investor or from vendors such as Venture Economics or

Preqin. Second, because investments are illiquid and individual project returns are not fully

realized until after the end of the fund life, usually ten years, it is not easy to measure risk

(“beta”) at the fund level, using standard time-series correlations with the market and other factor

returns. Existing studies’ approach to address this data limitation varies, though all employ some

version of market-return adjustment with an effective assumption of beta = 1.20

          Existing studies offer somewhat mixed conclusions about the fund-level performance of

private equity relative to public equity markets. Using a large fund-level cash flow dataset of

private equity funds provided by Venture Economics, (Kaplan and Schoar 2005) find that net-of-

fee returns of private equity funds (both venture capital and buyout) approximately equal the S&P

500, in the sense that discounting fund inflows and outflows using the same-period S&P 500

returns and dividing the sum of discounted present values of outflows by the sum of discounted



19
   In this example, there may or may not be a carry payment to the fund manager (general partners); but this amount (if
any) is already netted out of the total exit distributions and is reflected in the exit distribution to LPs.
20
   Beta estimates obtained using deal-level data or index returns (reported in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.4) suggest that this
assumption is too low for VC, whereas it may be reasonable for BO.


                                                                                                                      20
present values of inflows yields a ratio of approximately one (“public market equivalent”, or

PME). The inference is made by focusing on 746 funds which are mostly funds started before

1995 (and thus are fully liquidated).

         In contrast, (Ljungqvist and Richardson 2003) find that the average net-of-fee IRR of

their sample funds is 19.8 percent, 5.7 percent higher than the IRR of a simulated investment in

the S&P 500 index under an identical time schedule of cash outflows (14.1 percent). They assign

industry-adjusted risk measures to individual portfolio companies and find that the excess

performance results are robust to this further refinement on risk-adjustments.21 Ljungqvist and

Richardson obtain data from a single large investor (LP); thus their sample is somewhat smaller

— the core sample is 73 funds raised between 1981 and 1993 — and skews toward large, buyout

funds and away from venture capital funds.                    Their sample also outperforms the Venture

Economics population of funds in eight out of eleven vintage years. Thus their results may be

more representative of buyout fund performance than venture capital fund performance.

         (Jones and Rhodes-Kropf 2003) differ from other studies reviewed here in that they use

GP estimates of value changes rather than realized returns to estimate quarterly private equity

returns. Using the Venture Economics data, they find the beta of 1.80 and the annualized alpha of

4.68% for VC funds, and the beta of 0.66 and the alpha of 0.72% per annum for BO funds.

         (Phalippou and Gottschalg 2009) start with a dataset similar to that used by Kaplan and

Schoar, but make several adjustments to the measurement of the PME22 and conclude that the

performance reported by previous research is overstated. They argue, in particular, that (i) the

funds included in Venture Economics perform better than those funds excluded from Venture

Economics but whose deal-based performance is available from VentureXpert, a database of

21
   The refinement implicitly assumes that BO portfolio companies have similar leverage to their industry peers, which
have levered equity beta of around 1. On the one hand, to the extent that BO portfolio companies are more highly
levered, this may account for some of the reported excess performance here. (Axelson et al. 2010) show that LBO
firms’ leverage levels are not explained well by those of their public-market industry peers. On the other hand, BO beta
estimates using index returns and reported in Section 4.1.4 are about 1. Also see (Kaplan and Stein 1990).
22
   Phalippou and Gottshalg (2009) use the term Profitability Index (PI) to refer to this measure; however, because
Ljungqvist and Richardson (2003) use the term PI to refer to a slightly different performance measure, for consistency
we refer to it as PME, as defined in Kaplan and Schoar (2005).


                                                                                                                    21
portfolio company-level investments; (ii) Net-Asset-Value of unrealized investments tend to be

inflated and should be written-off when calculating fund distributions in the last period of the

fund’s life; and (iii) it is more conservative to use present values of fund inflows as weights rather

than the size of committed capital, because poorly-performing funds tend to invest faster, and

thus have larger present values of cost basis (inflows) than better-performing funds, which tend to

invest more slowly, do. After implementing these three adjustments, they show that the PME of

their broadened sample is reduced from 1.01 to 0.88.

         Finally, (Driessen et al. 2009) develop and apply a GMM-style methodology to a fund-

level cash flows dataset consisting of 958 mature private equity funds.             Their estimation

methodology is based on a moment condition that equates the expected discounted value of the

cost basis of an investment in a portfolio company to the expected discounted value of the exit

value of the investment; in implementation, because the deal-level cash flow data is not available,

the method is applied to the fund-level cash flows data. Driessen et al. find a market beta of 3.21

and significant underperformance for VC funds, and a low beta (0.33) and mixed evidence on

performance for BO funds. While the VC result is similar in magnitude to (Korteweg and

Sorensen forthcoming), the BO result is at odds with studies using index returns (reported in

Section 4.1.4).



4.1.2     Deal-level performance: Venture Capital

        (Brav and Gompers 1997) compare the long-run performance of VC-backed IPOs and

nonventure-backed IPOs completed between 1972-1992 and find that VC-backed IPOs generally

perform better than nonventure-backed IPOs. They identify the smallest nonventure-backed IPOs

as the main drivers of long-run underperformance of IPO firms — these firms significantly

underperform benchmarks and in the Fama-French 3-factor model. In contrast, VC-backed IPOs

do not underperform.




                                                                                                   22
         Two papers develop econometric methods that measure risk and return of VC investments

at the deal level while correcting for sample selection.23 (Cochrane 2005) measures the mean,

standard deviation, alpha, and beta of VC investments, using a maximum likelihood estimate that

corrects for selection bias. The selection-corrected mean arithmetic return is 59%, with the mean

arithmetic alpha of 32%. Volatility is 89%. While high, these figures are generally comparable to

those of the smallest NASDAQ stocks in the estimation period.            (Korteweg and Sorensen

forthcoming) develop a model that corrects for the higher frequency of observations for better

performing investments and obtain beta estimates of VC investments in the range of two to three,

much higher than previously reported in the literature. Similarly, VC betas close to two are

obtained when regressing VC index returns on contemporaneous and lagged market returns and

summing over the coefficients, as discussed in Section 4.1.4.


4.1.3       Deal-level performance: Buyouts

         (Andrade and Kaplan 1998) find that buyout transactions in the 1980’s created value

despite high leverage and subsequent financial distress [also see (Kaplan 1989a) and (Kaplan

1989b)]. (Guo et al. forthcoming), in a study examining buyout transactions completed between

1990-2006, find that they earned high financial returns on average and had operating performance

comparable to or slightly succeeding benchmark firms.           Tax benefits of leverage, multiple

expansion (market timing), and operating gains equally contributed to the results.

         (Holthausen and Larcker 1996), in an early study of the first wave of buyouts focused on

reversed LBOs, find that these firms’ operating performance is significantly better than their

industry peers for the first four years after the IPO events, while there is no evidence of abnormal

common stock performance. They, however, also document some evidence of a decline in

performance over time. Similar improvements in operating performance are also reported in

(Muscarella and Vetsuypens 1990). Echoing these earlier findings, (Cao and Lerner 2009)


23
     Also see (Gompers and Lerner 1997).


                                                                                                 23
examine post-IPO long-run performance of reversed LBOs completed between 1981 and 2003

and find that they perform as well as or better than other IPOs and the stock market as a whole.

Like Holthausen and Lacker, they also find that performance deteriorates over time.

        (Kracaw and Zenner 1996) study the announcement effects of buyouts on the stock prices

of targets and lending banks and find positive wealth effects for lending banks and targets.

Interestingly, they find negative wealth effects on the stock prices of targets of leveraged

recapitalizations.24 (DeAngelo et al. 1984) also find that public shareholders gain about 22% in

public-to-private buyouts.

         (Lopez de Silanes et al. 2010) study a large sample of buyout transactions and their deal-

level returns. They find that 10% of deals result in bankruptcy while 25% of them have an IRR

over 50%. They also find a negative relationship between deal-level returns (IRRs) and the size of

the funds investing in them: the median IRR of investments held by the top decile BO firms is

16% while investments held by the bottom decile firms have a 36% median IRR. The authors

argue that diseconomies of scale are significant in the BO industry. (Groh and Gottschalg 2009),

using a data set of 133 US buyouts, construct a mimicking levered public equity portfolio for

each deal (using deal-specific debt-to-equity ratios) and show that many such mimicking

portfolios default during the holding period. Their results highlight the difficulty of proper

benchmarking for BO returns.


4.1.4    Asset-class-level returns

Several vendors have developed VC and BO indices by aggregating either fund-level or deal-

level data.25 This enables researchers to estimate risk-adjusted performance of VC or BO as an

asset class using standard factor models. However, returns thus constructed still suffer from a

either receive new rounds of financing (in cases of VC) or have exits. Not addressing stale price

issues leads to underestimated beta and over-estimated alpha. (Woodward 2009), (Metrick and

Yasuda 2010b), and (Barber and Yasuda 2010) address this problem by including lagged values

of factor returns in the regressions and sum over the estimated coefficients across lags. 26

Consistent with stale prices, lagged factor returns (especially market returns) are often significant

explanatory variables. Market betas estimated this way are approximately 1 for BO and 2 for VC,

and alphas are not significantly different from zero for either asset class.


4.1.5       Summary

The evidence on whether VC and BO funds achieve excess performance is mixed. This is due to

several reasons. First, many of the studies that employ fund-level cash flow data make an

effective assumption that market beta for the asset class is 1, which may or may not be

appropriate. Studies using deal-level data or index returns and explicitly estimating market beta

while correcting for other data issues (e.g., sample selection, stale prices) tend to obtain beta

estimates closer to 2 for VC, and around 1for BO; more data and more studies with innovative

methodology can further improve the precision of these estimates. Second, some studies use self-

reported portfolio values as updated by GPs to gauge performance, which may be subject to stale

price problems. When these self-reported values are marked to market, as done in (Gompers and

Lerner 1997), it has a large positive effect on risk measures such as beta. Similarly, when lagged

market returns are included, estimated betas are far larger than when they are not included. Third,

in case of BO, it is difficult to adjust for the leverage risk that may vary from deal to deal and

from fund to fund. Even if the average BO beta exposure is close to 1, it may not be uniform

across funds, and cross-sectional performance variation may or may not be coming from

differences in the levels of systematic risk (via leverage or otherwise) taken by individual funds.

These and other known data issues (such as stale prices, illiquidity premium, selection bias, and

missing data on defunct dates) likely account for the mixed results thus far in the literature.

Solving methodological challenges and/or overcoming data limitations, and reconciling existing

findings towards a more unified understanding of private equity performance is an important

remaining research agenda in this strand of the literature.


4.2   Performance Persistence and Sources of Performance

      One distinguishing feature of private equity as an asset class is the evidence on

performance persistence not only at the GP level but also at the LP and the entrepreneur level (in

case of VC). (Kaplan and Schoar 2005) document that GPs whose funds outperform the industry

in one fund are likely to outperform the industry in the next and vice versa. The persistence is

found not only between two consecutive funds but also between the current fund and the second

previous fund. Persistence is found in both VC and BO, but is stronger in VC. (Metrick and

Yasuda 2010a) provide an explanation and supporting empirical evidence as to why persistence is

weaker in BO: when BO fund managers gain experience, they increase the size of their funds

much faster than VC fund managers do, thereby increasing the per-partner capital under

management. In line with this explanation, (Marquez et al. 2010) argue that PE fund managers

(and VC fund managers more than BO fund managers) with positive alpha allow their superior

performance to persist because there is assortative matching between funds and portfolio

companies along this dimension. Because PE fund managers are incented to signal positive alpha

to potential investees in order to be matched with the best firms, they are willing to not fully

capture the surplus from their alphas by either increasing the fund size or their fees. (Hochberg et

al. 2010b), on the other hand, argue that persistence results from the hold-up power of incumbent

fund investors (limited partners).

        In a different vein, (Lerner et al. 2007) examine the returns that institutional investors

realize from private equity and find that endowments (and to a lesser degree public pensions)

outperform other types of investors by a large margin. Part of the outperformance appears to be



                                                                                                 26
due to their better ability to select superior funds. Finally, (Gompers et al. 2010) study serial

entrepreneurs and find that entrepreneurs who were successful in prior ventures are much more

likely to succeed than others [also see (Gompers et al. 2009)]. One interpretation is that others

perceive them to have skill and are more willing to commit resources. Thus, success begets

success and strengthens performance persistence.

        These results are markedly different from those in other asset classes such as mutual

funds, and are thus striking. How the persistence result found at the GP level and at the LP level

relates to one another is another interesting open question. At the first glance, it appears that high-

performing PE (and especially VC) firms are matched with sophisticated investors (endowments

and public pension funds). However, (Phalippou 2010) argues that the performance persistence of

VC funds as reported in (Kaplan and Schoar 2005) is mainly driven by unsophisticated investors;

VC funds that are expected to be backed by skilled investors do not exhibit performance

persistence and a significant flow-performance relationship. This finding is at odds with the

simple matching story. Richer evidence that sheds more light on the persistence phenomenon is

warranted.

        Below, we review the extant literature that examines both sources of performance and

possible explanations for performance persistence for VC and BO. We first review the studies

that focus on VC and then on BO.

        Studies on the determinants of VC performance fall into two broad categories: those that

examine how VC-company matching at times of investment leads to differentials in performance,

and those that examine how VC’s post-investment activities (including exit decisions) are related

to investment performance.

        Several studies document that established VCs exercise pricing power, which offers an

explanation for the performance persistence phenomenon and seems particularly valuable in hot

markets. Using a unique hand-collected sample of first-round recipient companies that received

offers from multiple VCs, (Hsu 2004) finds that high-reputation VCs’ offers are three times more


                                                                                                    27
likely to be accepted, and moreover that they acquire startup equity at a 10-14% discount.

Reputation is measured as the number of past deals made in the startup’s industrial segment. The

finding suggests that start-ups perceive affiliation with high-reputation VCs to have positive

effects on their firms’ performance, and are willing to share the rent with such VCs. The effect

itself can be either certification, value-added, or both.

            (Gompers and Lerner 2000) find that competition for a limited number of attractive

investments leads to a positive relationship between capital inflows and valuations of new

investments.27 While they find that changes in valuations are not related to the ultimate success of

the firms, (Kaplan and Schoar 2005) find that market entry (the number of new funds entering the

market, and thus similar to capital inflows) and fund performance are countercyclical [see also

similar results in the context of European VC and BO investments in (Diller and Kaserer 2009)].

To the extent that higher valuations affect the division of exit values in entrepreneurs’ favor, but

not the exit values, the two findings are reconcilable. Significantly, Kaplan and Schoar also find

that the performance of funds raised by high-reputation VC firms (firms with more previous

funds) is less sensitive to market entry. Combined, findings of these three studies suggest that

reputable VCs avoid the negative effects of capital inflows on performance by successfully

insisting on favorable investment terms even in hot markets. Consistent with this interpretation,

(Gompers et al. 2008) find that VC firms with the most industry experience increase their

investments the most when public market signals become more favorable. Their investments are

more responsive than firms with less industry experience, and the increased investment rate does

not adversely affect subsequent success rates.

            How do reputable VC firms sustain their pricing advantage? Several studies argue that

the network among VCs who engage in repeated transactions with each other through deal

syndication serves as a source of performance as well as barriers to entry. (Hochberg et al. 2007)

find that funds run by better-networked VC firms perform significantly better (measured as better

     Also see (Gompers 1994) and (Gompers and Lerner 1998b) for analysis of determinants of capital flows.


                                                                                                             28
successful exit rates). While a better network status can either be a source of better screening or

conversely a result of better value-adding skills, (Hochberg et al. 2010a) further argue that VCs

use networks as barriers to entry, and benefit by getting low prices for deals. (Hochberg et al.

2010a) also find that more densely networked markets experience less entry, and document

strategic behavior by both entrants (who try to enter by syndicating with incumbents) and

incumbents (who freeze out other incumbents that facilitate entry by newcomers).

          While a number of studies document how VCs’ monitoring activities affect VC-backed

firms’ operational characteristics (e.g., board composition, earnings quality, and personnel

policy), as discussed in Section 3, few studies actually document a relationship between VCs’

post-investment activities and investment performance.28 One exception is (Bottazzi et al. 2008)

which, using a sample of European VC deals, find that companies that receive funding from more

activist VCs are more successful. In another study, (Lindsey 2008) documents facilitation of

strategic alliances among portfolio companies as a new value-added role of venture capitalists,

and finds these alliances improve the probability of exit for VC-backed firms.

          Besides monitoring and other interim activities, post-investment VC activities also

include executing exits and distributing exit proceeds back to investors, and the literature offers

some evidence of market-timing skill as a source of performance for VCs. Using a sample of

VC-backed biotech firms between 1978 and 1992, (Lerner 1994b) finds that companies go public

when equity valuations are high, and that seasoned venture capitalists (a common measure of VC

reputation in the literature) are particularly good at taking companies near market peaks. VC

returns on investments are realized (and used to calculate fund returns and carry) not when the

firms go public, but when the VCs decide to distribute the now-public stocks to their investors.29

Thus, VCs’ abilities to time the public stock market could contribute to their fund returns.

28
   One perennial problem is the difficulty of separating out the effects of sorting from the effects of value-added
activities. See the discussion of (Sorensen 2007) below.
29
   Although it is also possible for the VCs to sell the fund’s stock holdings in the open market and distribute the cash
proceeds to investors, it is more common practice for them to make in-kind distributions in cases of IPO exits. One
reason is that as insiders of the firms, VCs’ sales of stocks are more restricted than sales by limited partners. Another is
that some limited partners may prefer to receive in-kind distributions, thereby controlling the timing of liquidations.


                                                                                                                        29
(Gompers and Lerner 1998a) examine a sample of in-kind distributions by VCs to their limited

partners and find evidence that VCs use inside information to time stock distributions after

substantial price run-ups.

            While a positive relationship between VC reputation measures and investment

performance is extensively documented, this could be due to either reputable VCs matching with

higher ex-ante quality firms (because of better screening ability, better proprietary deal flow,

better network, or all of the above), or reputable VCs possessing better monitoring skills.

Disentangling the two effects is an important yet challenging research goal. A standard

econometric approach with instruments that affects VC reputation measure (e.g., experience) but

does not affect investment outcome is difficult to find in the VC setting. For example, geography-

based instruments are valid in other contexts, but in VC investments, proximity affects

effectiveness of monitoring and value-added activities, and thus cannot be excluded from the

second-stage equation.30 Prior to this realization, several papers made valiant but incomplete

efforts to solve these problems. (Sorensen 2007) explicitly tackles this problem by using the

identifying assumption that VCs and firms’ participation in a particular market, where the market

is defined by a region-year pair, is exogenous and is independent of error terms in the model.

Then, presence of other agents affects investment decisions and leads investors with differing

experiences (reputation) to invest in companies with similar unobserved quality for exogenous

reasons. Sorensen finds that the companies funded by more experienced VCs are more likely to

go public (a success measure), and that sorting is almost twice as important as value-added in

explaining the difference in IPO rates.

            Finally, (Nahata 2008) proposes a new measure of VC reputation and shows it predicts

performances of portfolio companies better than alternative measures. His proposed measure is

IPO capitalization share and is based on cumulative market capitalization of IPOs backed by the

VC. Nahata argues that this measure captures both VC screening and monitoring expertise.

         Existing studies examining determinants of BO performance have tended to focus on two

factors: whether BO reputation (or stronger relationships with banks) has positive effects on the

fund performance via better debt pricing, and whether competition (or lack thereof) among

bidders at the time of investments drives up (down) purchase prices.

         Using a sample of 180 public-to-private LBOs, (Demiroglu and James 2010) find that

reputable BO firms are better at market timing in credit markets (increasing deal activities more

when credit spreads are low and lending standards are lax), and that they get better loan terms

(lower spreads, longer maturities, higher portions of institutional loans). Though buyouts

sponsored by reputable BO firms are more levered, the valuations they pay are not higher. While

Demiroglu and James do not provide a direct evidence on fund performance, the findings suggest

that reputable BO firms’ better pricing power vis-à-vis lenders is a source of performance

persistence in buyouts. Their findings on market timing and pricing power echo parallel findings

on VC in (Hsu 2004) and (Gompers et al. 2008).31 (Ivashina and Kovner 2010) document that BO

firms with stronger bank relationships obtain better spreads and covenant terms. The results in

Demiroglu and James and Ivashina and Kovner appear to be related, as there is likely to be a

positive correlation between BO reputation and the strength of their relationships with lenders.

         (Kaplan and Stein 1993) examine pricing and financial structure of large MBOs in the

1980’s and find that over time the deals were struck with higher ratios of prices to cash flows,

employing higher ratios of debt obligations to cash flows and more junk bonds as opposed to

private debt, and more upfront monetary rewards for management teams and dealmakers. Later-

period buyouts were more likely to experience defaults and costly financial distress, and Kaplan

and Stein argue that overheating in the buyout market, driven by the demand for junk bonds, is

the most likely explanation.32

   Note, however, that in case of VC the rent is extracted from entrepreneurs, whereas in case of BO the rent is
extracted from lenders.

         Several recent studies examine determinants of the degree of competition among bidders

and their effects on buyout performance in more recent buyout booms. These studies tend to

focus on large, public-to-private transactions where it is common for the seller to receive multiple

offers and banks are hired to assist in the bidding process. In a theory paper, (Povel and Singh

2010) analyze a recent phenomenon called “stapled finance”, whereby a seller arranges a pre-

packaged loan commitment for whoever wins the bidding contest, and show that stapled finance

increases bidding competition and benefits the seller by increasing valuations, even though the

seller would need to compensate the arranging bank for offering the loan. The results suggest

that buyers of stapled finance transactions perform worse than non-stapled finance transactions,

ceteris paribus. Consistent with the theoretical prediction of Povel and Singh, (Boone and

Mulherin 2009) find that staple financing is associated with increased competition, i.e., a greater

number of firms making non-binding and binding private offers for the target firm.

         Another aspect of the bidding process that received attention during the recent buyout

boom is the so-called club deals or consortiums where multiple BO funds join forces to purchase

a target firm as a consortium.33 The evidence is mixed on the competitive effect of club deals.

Examining a sample of U.S. public-to-private buyouts conducted by prominent BO firms,

(Officer et al. 2010) find that club deals are associated with lower premiums paid to target

shareholders compared to solo-sponsored deals, especially among deals before 2006 and in target

firms with low institutional ownership. Officer et al. argue that the most likely explanation is that

club deals dampen competition and facilitate collusion. In contrast, analyzing a sample of 870

takeovers of publicly traded targets, (Boone and Mulherin 2009) find that, while target abnormal

returns are somewhat lower in consortium deals in the short run, the results do not hold for longer

event windows. Boone and Mulherin also find that BO takeovers (both solo and consortium

deals) are generally associated with greater degrees of competition than other types of bidders.

33
   Other papers that examine potential conflicts of interests at BO firms include (Acharya and Johnson forthcoming)
and (Fang et al. 2010). See (Gompers and Lerner 1999b), (Li and Masulis 2004), (Hamao et al. 2000), and (Hellmann
et al. 2008) for related evidence on combining VC with investment banking and commercial banking.


                                                                                                               32
They thus reject the view that BO consortium deals facilitates collusion, which is at odds with

Officer et al.’s conclusion. (Marquez and Singh 2010) present a theoretical model that shows that

whether club deals hurt (via lower premiums paid) or benefit (via bundled value-adding expertise

of multiple PE firms) target shareholders depend on both the number of potential bidders and

bidding costs, thus suggesting that the extant empirical findings may be reconcilable.



5    Contracts

         Contracts employed by VC and BO fund managers share many features. At the fund

level, limited partnership agreements signed between GPs and LPs are structured quite similarly.

Both VC and BO funds are closed-end, finite-life (typically 10 years) partnerships where GPs

earn management fees annually as a pre-determined percentage of base capital (e.g., committed

capital), and carried interest, which entitles GPs to (typically) 20% of the fund profit. Both types

of funds restrict GPs’ activities (e.g., investments outside of funds, investments across funds,

investment in asset classes other than private equity) through negative covenants.

         At the deal level, VC contracts and BO contracts appear to be more distinct from each

other.   Specifically, while VC investments are minority stakes and typically made using

convertible securities, and financing is syndicated and staged over multiple rounds, BO

investments are one-time acquisitions of controlling stakes and are typically financed using equity

and debt. Note, however, the observation made by Sahlman (1990) that “[t]he debt used in LBOs

is similar in function to the staged-capital-commitment process used in venture-capital deals; in

neither is there much discretionary cash flow”. (p. 516) Thus, both types of deal structures are

aimed at disciplining the portfolio company management by taking away excess cash flows from

them. Both deal-level contracts also include features like board seats that facilitate monitoring

and advising roles played by GPs.




                                                                                                 33
5.1   Contracts between Fund Managers and Investors

Compared to the extensive literature on the contracts between VCs and their portfolio companies,

the literature on the contracts between fund managers and their investors is relatively small. The

earlier studies tend to focus on VCs, while the more recent papers are more likely to contain

analyses of the buyout segment of the industry. (Sahlman 1990) was the first analysis of contracts

between VC fund managers (GPs) and investors (LPs) [also see (Gompers and Lerner 1996)].

Typical structures of limited partnerships are described, summary statistics of a sample of 76 VC

funds raised in 1986-87 are reported, and agency problems between GPs and LPs and contractual

provisions in fund partnership agreements as potential remedies are discussed.

        As discussed in Section 3, funds have a finite lifetime and VC and BO firms raise new

funds every 3-5 years. Several papers examine the strategic choices made by GPs of new vs.

follow-on funds. (Gompers 1996) finds evidence that young VC firms take portfolio companies

public earlier than older VC firms in order to establish a reputation and successfully raise capital

for new funds. IPOs are timed to precede or coincide with raising money for follow-on funds.

Similarly, (Ljungqvist et al. 2007) find that younger funds invest in riskier buyouts in an effort to

establish a track record, whereas established funds act more strategically in response to market

conditions.

        (Gompers and Lerner 1999a) find that the pay of new VC funds is less sensitive to

performance and varies less than that of older funds, which is consistent with a learning model

rather than a signaling model. (Chung et al. 2010) present a learning-based framework for

estimating total pay for performance, where pay for performance arises from both explicit pay

earned via carried interest in the current fund and implicit pay from expected future fundraising.

They find that implicit pay from future fundraising is stronger for BO funds (which are more

scalable than VC funds) and for younger funds (for which current performance is more

informative about ability). Focusing on the lemons problem that arises when existing LPs face

liquidity shocks and GPs need to raise funds from new investor, (Lerner and Schoar 2004) find


                                                                                                  34
that fund managers impose more transfer restrictions when raising new funds and also funds

focused on industries with longer investment cycles.

            (Axelson et al. 2009) analyze the optimal financing structure of buyout funds that

minimizes the agency conflicts between GPs and LPs and find that a mix of ex ante and ex post

financing achieves the second best. 34 While the closed-end fund structure with carry

compensation incents GPs to avoid overinvestment in good times, the deal-by-deal debt financing

prevents them from making bad deals in bad times (when credit market conditions tighten). The

model explains pro-cyclicality of investment volumes and counter-cyclicality of performance in

the buyout industry.

          Using detailed records on 238 funds raised between 1993 and 2006, (Metrick and Yasuda

2010a) analyze and compare the features of venture capital and buyout fund contracts. The paper

builds a model of expected GP revenue as a function of their contracts with LPs, modeling carry

as an option-like position on the fund assets and incorporating as model parameters fees, carry,

transaction and monitoring fees (in case of buyouts), as well as leverage, portfolio concentration,

and investment risk. About two-thirds of expected revenue comes from fixed revenue

components and is not sensitive to performance. BO fund managers with prior experience

increase the size of their follow-on funds significantly faster than VC fund managers do, and as a

result BO fund managers’ per personnel revenue is higher than that of VC fund counterparts. The

results are consistent with greater scalability of BO business.

          While the partnership agreements share a number of similarities between VCs and BOs,

including the fees and carry structures, there is one distinction between the two segments of

private equity: the buyout funds charge various fees, such as transaction fees and monitoring fees,

directly to portfolio companies, whereas VC funds do not. To the best of our knowledge no

theory paper has explicitly examined implications of this practice in an agency model setting.

(Metrick and Yasuda 2010a) conduct sensitivity analysis and show that, ceteris paribus, these fees

     Also see (Campello and Da Matta 2010) for analysis of VC funds.


                                                                                                35
make total GP compensation less sensitive to performance and become disproportionately large

(relative to management fees and carry) when individual buyout transactions are financed with

high debt-to-equity ratio (because these fees are charged on enterprise values rather than on

equity values). In a paper surveying the literature findings on performance and fee structures,

(Phalippou 2009) argues that, among the various components of buyout fund managers’ fee

arrangements with investors, transaction and monitoring fees are especially opaque.


5.2    Contracts between Venture Capitalists and Portfolio Companies

       There is an extensive literature, both theoretical and empirical, that examines the features

of contracts between venture capitalists and portfolio companies.35 In part, the greater interest in

VC-company contracts relative to those in BO-company contracts stems from the fact that the

relationships between VCs and entrepreneurs resemble the theoretically pristine (but hard to find

in practice) setup of principal-agent models that are used in much of the contract-theory literature

[(Kaplan and Stromberg 2001)]. Thus, the VC setup offers a rare natural laboratory to test the

implications of the theory of the firm without the usual confounding factors, e.g., the dispersed

stock ownership and short-term pressures associated with publicly traded firms. That said, we

note the dearth of papers on contracts used in buyout transactions and expect it to be a growth

area in the literature.

       One of the most frequently analyzed features of the VC-company contracts is the use of

convertible securities that combines the features of equity and debt. A number of studies offer

(generally non-mutually exclusive) explanations for its prevalent use.36 (Berglof 1994) analyzes

the potential conflict of interests that arise from a future sale of the company to a third party. On

the one hand, an entrepreneur values private benefits of control that are increasing in the firm

value and is afraid of a sale that compensates him insufficiently for their loss; on the other hand, a

VC is afraid of a premature, “cheap exit” that results in a poor return on her financial investment,

but would be enticing for the entrepreneur to accept. Since one conflict is more likely in good

states of the world and another in bad states of the world, convertible securities (either convertible

debt or convertible preferred stock) with contingent transfer of control to the vulnerable party

emerges as the optimal security that best protects the two initial contracting parties against

dilution and expropriation from the future buyer. The findings are consistent with the practice; in

the U.S., nearly all the VC investments are made with preferred stock, either with conversion

feature, or in combination with common stock, so that VCs receive the downside protection of

debt in poor states of the world, and the upside potential of equity in good states of the world.

            In contrast to Berglof’s focus on the allocation of control rights, (Schmidt 2003) argues

that incentive properties of convertible securities — effort incentives for the entrepreneur and the

VC — are crucial in explaining why they are almost always used in VC transactions while very

rarely used by banks or other outside investors that finance small businesses. They show that

convertible security achieves the first best investment outcomes (relative to standard debt-equity

contracts) when the investor’s costly effort is important37 for the success of the startup; hence, it

is used in venture capital finance where extra-financial value of VC backing is important, but not

in bank financing where banks are passive investors.

            (Hellmann 2006) argues that the key property of convertible preferred stock used in VC

transactions is that it (typically) requires forced conversion of preferred stock to common stock

upon IPO exits, but not upon exits by acquisitions. The most commonly used type of convertible

preferred stock is participating convertible preferred (PCP),38 which allows holders to “double-

dip”, i.e., receive both the debt-like payoff (redemption value) and the equity-like payoff

(participation value) as long as the security remains unconverted.                          In most VC contracts,

                                                                                                                  37
conversion of preferred stock to common is forced (“automatic conversion”) rather than voluntary

in cases of an exit via an IPO. Thus, PCP with automatic conversion upon IPOs effectively

allocates more cash flow rights to VCs in exits via acquisitions than in IPO exits. Hellmann

argues that this is optimal in a model with double moral hazard, where both the entrepreneur and

the VC provide value-adding effort. In a related paper, (Bengtsson 2009) finds that restrictive

covenants are more prevalent in contracts with debt-like payoffs (i.e., PCP) as compared to

simple convertible preferred that resembles equity more closely. (Cumming 2008) also shows that

stronger VC control rights are more likely to lead to exits by acquisitions rather than by write-offs

or IPOs.

            Another feature of VC-company contracts that has drawn significant attention in the

literature is that a VC’s total investment in a company is often staged over time and follow-on

investments are either implicitly or explicitly conditional on reaching milestones.39 (Gompers

1995) argues that this contractual feature protects VCs against inefficient continuation of the

project by entrepreneurs and thus is most valuable when liquidation values are hurt the most from

inefficient continuation, and finds empirical evidence in support of this argument. Specifically,

Gompers analyzes a sample of 794 VC-backed companies’ investment history and finds that

more frequent financing rounds (shorter duration between rounds) are associated with high levels

of agency costs (measured by, e.g., the ratio of intangible to total assets, the market-to-book ratio,

and R&D intensity).

            (Admati and Pfleiderer 1994) also analyze stage financing and show that a fixed-fraction

contract where the insider VC always receives a fixed fraction of the equity of the company in all

financing rounds induces the inside investor (the initial VC) to make optimal investment

decisions.40 In a related paper, (Fluck et al. 2004) argue that, without syndication, the holdup cost

exceeds the efficiency gain of staged financing. While staged financing reduces the agency cost


39

40
     (Lerner 1994a) provides empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis.


                                                                                                   38
of inefficient continuation of unpromising projects, it gives too much bargaining power to early-

stage venture capitalists and leads to dilution of entrepreneurs’ stake ex post, unless staged

financing is combined with pre-agreed syndication of later-stage investments. The results

highlight the complementarity of staged financing and syndication, two somewhat distinct

features of VC investments.

        In another study examining bargaining between VCs and entrepreneurs in staged

financing, (Inderst et al. 2007) argue that staged financing, combined with the closed-fund feature

of VC partnerships (whereby the fund size, or the “depth of the investor’s pocket”, is fixed) and

the fact that a fund finances a portfolio of projects, may lead not only to improved bargaining

power for the VC, but also to improved incentives for entrepreneurs. The results suggest that

staged financing and the fund structure where multiple portfolio companies compete for a fixed

amount of capital are complementary.

        (Kaplan and Stromberg 2003) analyze actual VC contracts in light of contracting theory

and find that VC contracts allow separate allocations of cash flow rights, board rights, voting

rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights among stakeholders. (Kaplan and Stromberg

2004) relate expected post-investment actions by VCs to contracts and find that greater VC

control is associated with increased management intervention while greater VC equity incentives

are associated with increased value-added effort.

        Other studies focus on less studied aspects of VC-company contracts. (Hellmann 1998)

studies why entrepreneurs give up control rights over to VC, exposing them to the risk of being

fired before their shares are fully vested. A key ingredient of the model is that entrepreneurs may

take non-contractible actions that increase their private benefits of control, while venture

capitalists may make non-contractible (and costly) efforts to search for a good management team.

Equilibrium conditions are derived where entrepreneurs voluntarily relinquish control and

knowing that venture capitalists are incented to search for a superior outside management team.




                                                                                                39
            (Field and Hanka 2001) examine a sample of VC-company contracts with post IPO

lockup clauses, which prohibit insiders from selling their shares in the open market for a preset

period of time (e.g., 6 months) after the IPO date.                    Expiration of lockups results in large

permanent increases in trading volumes and abnormal negative returns around the lockup

expiration date. (Broughman and Fried 2010) examine whether cash flow rights are renegotiated

between entrepreneurs and VCs by studying sales of Silicon Valley firms. Results suggest VCs

sometime concede cash-flow rights and allow common shareholders to receive payment before

VCs’ liquidation preferences are satisfied, especially when the firm’s choice of corporate law

gives shareholders more power to hold up the sale.

            More recently, researchers have started to examine determinants of both time-series and

cross-country variation in contract terms. (Inderst and Muller 2004) build an equilibrium model

in which capital-market characteristics affect the relative supply and demand for VC capital,

which in turn affects bargaining between entrepreneurs and VCs, which in turn affects the

valuation and relative ownership shares of VCs and entrepreneurs. The model explains the

cyclicality of the VC industry and in particular the Internet boom and bust period in which

entrepreneurs enjoyed high valuations and retained large equity shares during the boom, whereas

venture capitalists obtained much larger ownership shares and demanded low valuations during

the bust.

            Several papers empirically study the effects of legal regimes on VC contracts using

international data and offer somewhat mixed evidence.41 (Kaplan et al. 2007) examine features of

international VC contracts and find that legal regimes affect contractual features more when

investors are inexperienced, but that more experienced VCs implement U.S.-style contracts

regardless of legal regime. Use of U.S.-style contracts is associated with lower failure rates of VC

firms, even controlling for VC experience, suggesting efficiency of U.S. style contracts even in

non-U.S. markets. Similarly, (Bottazzi et al. 2009) find that the legal system in the target country

41

                                                                                                          40
does not explain contract provisions after controlling for VC home country effects. In contrast,

(Lerner and Schoar 2005) study international PE contracts (which include both VC and BO

investments) and find that, while convertible preferred stock with covenants are favored

contractual choices in high-enforcement and common law nations, majority equity ownership

combined with debt and board control are often used in low-enforcement and civil law nations.

They argue that the legal system constrains the ability of private parties to write contracts that are

complex or state contingent. Similarly, (Balcarcel et al. 2010) find that both capital flows and

investment patterns systematically vary with the rule of law variables of the target countries.

5.3     Contracts between Buyout Investors and Portfolio Companies

Researchers know relatively little about the contractual relationships between buyout investors

and portfolio companies, due in part to data limitations that appear to be even more severe for

buyouts than those for VC contracts. Here we review a small group of empirical papers that

provide evidence suggestive of potential agency conflicts between BO fund managers and

investors during hot markets.

        In one of the earlier studies examining financial structure and pricing of public-to-private

buyout transactions in the 1980’s, (Kaplan and Stein 1993) find that, over time, as the junk bond

market took off and record amounts were issued, both the buyout investors and the management

teams took more money out of transactions up-front.

        One distinct contractual difference between the BO and VC fund managers’

compensation is that BO fund managers routinely charge to their portfolio companies upfront

transaction fees at the time of the investment as well as on-going monitoring fees. These fees are

distinct from management fees that GPs charge to the investors of the funds, and may be shared

with investors and/or used to offset the management fees. Incentive effects of these portfolio

company fees are not well understood, though anecdotal evidence suggests that at the height of




                                                                                                   41
the latest BO boom of 2003-2007, they comprised a very significant portion of the GPs’ total

revenues, especially at larger funds.

          (Metrick and Yasuda 2010a) build a model that estimates expected present values of PE

manager fee revenues as functions of the fund fee structure, firm characteristics, and deal

structures (such as leverage and the portfolio company fee structure). While the expected values

of portfolio company fees (the sum of transaction fees and monitoring fees) are only a third of

expected carry when the leverage ratio is 1:1, they increase to nearly 90% of expected carry when

the leverage ratio is increased to 4:1.42 As these fees are less risky and less sensitive to

performance than carried interest, larger portfolio company fees associated with higher leverage

suggests that leverage might weaken monitoring incentives of BO fund managers to maximize

firm value and earn carry.

          Using a sample of 1,157 buyout transactions from 1980 to 2008, (Axelson et al. 2010)

show that the economy-wide cost of borrowing rather than industry-specific characteristics is the

main driver of the buyout leverage [also see (Brinkhuis and De Maeseneire 2009) for similar

findings using a sample of European buyouts]. Credit market conditions also have a strong effect

on prices paid in buyouts, and moreover use of high leverage in transactions negatively affects

fund performance. Combined with the results of (Kaplan and Stein 1993) and (Metrick and

Yasuda 2010a), these findings suggest that agency problems between buyout fund mangers and

their investors may be exacerbated when cheap debt is available and allows fund managers to

pocket large fees upfront. Clearly more research is needed to understand contractual patterns in

BO transactions.



6     Conclusion

VC and BO funds are financial intermediaries that invest in private companies, take an active role

in monitoring and advising investee companies, exit investments through a sale or an IPO, and
42
  Leverage directly impacts relative values of portfolio company fees, because these fees are paid as a percentage of
the total enterprise value of the firm, whereas BO funds invest only in the equity portions of the firm’s capital structure.


                                                                                                                        42
whose goal is to maximize present values of their current and future fund revenues (earned via

management fees and carried interest). VCs are specialists whose superior screening capability

for high-growth, risky start-up firms in high-tech sectors helps alleviate the underinvestment

problem that arises from the severe information asymmetry between informed entrepreneurs and

uninformed investors. In contrast, economic rationale for BO specialists, especially those that are

engaged primarily in private-to-private transactions and do not require high leverage, is not well

understood. More research is needed to improve our understanding of how generic BO funds

emerge in the economy. Both VC and BO-backing is associated with significant changes in the

ways the investee companies are operated, including more independent and hands-on boards,

higher earnings quality, and higher CEO turnover.

        Evidence on existence of excess performance (and its persistence) in private equity is

mixed. This is due in part to significant data limitations and methodological challenges required

to overcome the data limitations. Naïve applications of standard approaches to asset pricing tend

to produce overestimates of alphas and underestimates of market beta. Valiant attempts have been

made to correct for various aspects of data problems, including stale prices, infrequency of return

realizations, sample selection, and missing observations, especially in the VC literature where

data availability is better and the literature dates back longer. In comparison, the literature on BO

performance is more nascent and the body of research working on this topic is expected to grow

significantly.

        As VCs are thought to emerge as solutions to the underinvestment problem arising from

information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and uninformed investors, it is natural that

contracts used in VC transactions have features that address many potential agency problems. The

literature has analyzed, among other features, use of convertible securities, staged financing, and

syndication. The use of leverage as a disciplinary device to constrain the use of excess cash is

emphasized as the economic rationale of leveraged buyouts, but the economic purpose of non-

leveraged buyout transactions is not well established:        the contract (and other economic)


                                                                                                  43
mechanisms that address agency issues in these non-leveraged transactions remain an open

question. Finally, contracts between VC and BO fund managers (GPs) and their investors (LPs)

also address various agency issues. Since LPs do not monitor GPs on the day-to-day basis, their

contracts are designed to best align their interests, via use of profit-sharing agreement (carried

interest), closed-end, finite-life fund structure, limited reinvestments, and explicit negative

covenants preventing GPs from taking excessive risk and/or diverting efforts away from funds.

Recent studies suggest that these features of contracts between LPs and GPs dynamically affect

fund performance and performance persistence. Improving our understanding of the interactions

between GP incentives (that are determined by the fund structure) and fund performance is

another fruitful area for future research.

  Comparison of typical VC/PE fund terms with those of hedge funds and mutual funds

This chart compares typical fund terms of venture capital and buyout funds with those of
hedge funds and mutual funds. An “open-end” fund can issue and redeem shares at any
time (subject to lockups and waiting periods in case of hedge funds). A “finite-life” fund
is obligated to terminate and liquidate its holdings at a pre-specified date. Reinvestments
refer to use of fund distributions in order to invest in new or existing portfolio
companies/assets.
