Aggregation Reversals and the Social Formation of Beliefs

                                             ABSTRACT

In the past two elections, richer people were more likely to vote Republican while richer states were
more likely to vote Democratic. This switch is an aggregation reversal, where an individual relationship,
like income and Republicanism, is reversed at some level of aggregation. Aggregation reversals can
occur when an independent variable impacts an outcome both directly and indirectly through a correlation
with beliefs. For example, income increases the desire for low taxes but decreases belief in Republican
social causes. If beliefs are learned socially, then aggregation can magnify the connection between
the independent variable and beliefs, which can cause an aggregation reversal. We estimate the model's
parameters for three examples of aggregation reversals, and show with these parameters that the model
predicts the observed reversals.

    I.        Introduction


Richer people are more likely to vote Republican: Figure 1 shows this connection using
2000 data from the National Annenberg Election Survey. Figure 2 shows that richer
states are more likely to vote Democratic in the same election.                   More educated people
attend church more regularly, as shown in Figure 3, but as Figure 4 shows, more educated
denominations have far lower attendance rates (Glaeser and Sacerdote, 2002). Figure 5
shows the positive individual level relationship between income and service in the
military; Figure 6 shows the negative state level relationship between the same two
variables.1


These three examples are aggregation reversals where a statistical relationship at the
individual level is reversed at some level of aggregation, like the state or denomination.
On a statistical level, aggregation reversals illustrate the ecological fallacy that aggregate
relationships easily inform us about individual level parameters (e.g. King, 1997). In this
literature, aggregation reversals can result from an unusual distribution of omitted
variables across units of aggregation. But this insight does not help us to understand the
economic causes of aggregation reversals which might help us to generate predictions
about when these reversals might occur.2


In Section II, we present an economic model of aggregation reversals that relies on the
social formation of beliefs. The model assumes one exogenous variable, which could be
education or income, and one endogenous outcome, like voting Republican or Church
attendance.      Three ingredients generate an aggregation reversal. First, the exogenous
variable must have both a direct effect on the outcome and a correlation with beliefs
about the returns to the outcome. Second, the direct effect of the exogenous variable on
the outcome must go in the opposite direction of the correlation that works through
beliefs. For example, higher incomes might be associated both with a dislike for taxes

  Data sources are described in the data appendix.

  One way of understanding the difference between our approach and the ecological inference literature is
that this literature sees aggregate information as a means of inferring individual level parameters, while we
see aggregate relationships as intrinsically interesting.


                                                      2
and more liberal social beliefs.     The dislike of taxes pushes richer people towards
Republicanism; the liberal social views push them away from Republicanism. Third,
beliefs must also reflect social learning which creates a social multiplier so that the
aggregate relationship between beliefs and the exogenous variable is much stronger than
the individual relationship between those two variables.


None of these assumptions will always hold. Exogenous variables are often unrelated to
beliefs. Often, variables that increase the direct returns to some activity will also be
correlated with beliefs that make the activity even more attractive. In that case, the social
formation of beliefs will create a more standard social multiplier (as in Glaeser,
Scheinkman and Sacerdote, 2003). The unusual nature of our assumptions is compatible
with the fact that aggregation reversals are themselves unusual.


If these three assumptions do hold, then the model predicts when aggregation reversal
will occur. For an aggregation reversal, the ratio of direct effect of the exogenous
variable on the outcome to the indirect effect that works through beliefs must lie between
an upper and lower bound. The lower bound is somewhat greater than one. The upper
bound is the social multiplier in the formation of beliefs. When this social multiplier is
larger because beliefs strongly reflect social influence, then aggregation reversals become
more likely. Aggregation reversals are more likely when the beliefs correlate strongly
with the exogenous variable. Greater sorting across groups on the basis of the exogenous
variable makes a reversal less likely.


In Section III, we present an empirical methodology to calibrate our model. We use
individual level relationships and the aggregate relationship between beliefs and the
exogenous variable to predict the aggregate relationship between the exogenous variable
and the outcome. The goal of this calibration is to show the plausibility of our model, not
to reject alternative explanations for the aggregation reversal.


In Section IV, we look at the relationship between income and voting for George Bush in
2000. The rich were more likely to vote for Bush but less likely to agree with Republican



                                              3
social policies on prayer in schools or limits on abortion. The negative relationship
between social policy views and income is much stronger at the state level than at the
individual level, which suggests a sizable social multiplier. Finally, views on social
policy are highly correlated with voting for Bush, which implies that these beliefs impact
the outcome. Together these facts predict an aggregation reversal that is larger than the
one we empirically observe.


In Section V, we return to the relationship between education and religion discussed by
Glaeser and Sacerdote (2002). Education is positively associated with church attendance
but negatively associated with belief in the devil or the literal truth of the Bible.   The
denominational correlation between education and these beliefs is much stronger than the
individual correlation, which again suggests a large social multiplier. These beliefs are
also highly correlated with attendance and seem to be important determinants of religious
observance. Our parameter estimates again predict an aggregation reversal that is bigger
than the one that we see in the data.


In Section VI, we examine the relationship between income and military service. Income
is positively correlated with military service but negatively associated with pro-military
beliefs. The income-belief relationship gets stronger at the state level, but the implied
social multiplier is smaller than in our two other examples. The relationship between
pro-military beliefs and military service is also weaker than the relationship between
religious beliefs and religious attendance or social policy beliefs and voting Republican.
Our results are mixed. Using one of our belief measures, we almost exactly predict the
actual aggregation reversal. The other belief measure fails to predict any aggregation
reversal. Section VII concludes.


   II.     The Social Formation of Beliefs and Aggregation Reversals


In this model, individuals base a choice, denoted Yi on net benefits, which are known,

and benefits which are assessed. Specifically, we assume that total benefits of Yi equal




                                             4
(γA + βX i )Yi , where β is known and A is estimated. The costs of .5Yi 2 so expected

utility maximization implies Yi = γE ( A) + β X i . The variable X i is meant to capture any
variable, perhaps income or education, which might plausibly increase (or decrease) the
benefits of the activity; β and γ are parameters that we normalize to be positive. By
assumption, X i has a direct impact on the choice of Yi . To produce an aggregation

reversal, X i must also have an indirect impact through the expectation of A.


The expectation of A is based on a common prior, a private signal and the
communication of those signals within a community group.          The common prior for A
has mean zero and variance σ A2 . Each individual receives a private signal equal to
A + cX i + κ + η i , where η i is an individual-specific normally distributed error term with

mean zero and variance σ η2 , and κ is a normally distributed common error term with

mean zero and variance σ κ2 . The cX i term reflects the possibility that signals may be
correlated with individual background attributes. Through communication, people learn
the signals of a set of Z neighbors. The neighbors’ signals are garbled in transmission so
that individual i learns A + cX + κ + η z + µ zi from individual z, where µ zi is the mean-

zero garbling with variance σ µ2 .


The communication of signals is one way of capturing the social learning that is critical
to our model. This social learning creates the possibility for a correlation between an
exogenous variable and a belief to grow with the level of aggregation. Asch (1955)
pioneered a psychological literature showing that base their stated beliefs on the
statements of others, even about something so seemingly obvious as the length of a line.
While some authors have suggested that Asch’s results show just a tendency to conform
in statements, not in beliefs, Berns et al. (2005) use brain scans to show that statements
by peers about shapes cause activity in the parts of the brain associated with spatial
analysis not in the parts of the brain associated with social relations. Bandura (1977) is a
classic text on the importance of social learning. Within economics, Merlo and Schotter
(2001) is just one of the many papers on the power of social learning in experimental


                                             5
settings.3 There is abundant evidence on the importance of learning from people around
us.


We consider two cases, both of which are structured to eliminate learning about c. First,
we assume that σ κ2 > 0 , c is known to equal zero and that σ η2 is a function of X, v( X i ) .

Second, we assume that κ = 0 and c>0, but that individuals have an incorrect assessment
of c, denoted c , that they fail to update. In this case, we assume that σ η2 is a constant.

The first case assumes that individual attributes doesn’t bias signals, but create more or
less precision. In this case, actors are fully rational.4 The second case assumes that the
individual attribute biases the signal and this bias is not fully corrected.                                     This second
case assumes limited rationality.


In the first case, standard signal extraction implies that the estimate of A equals:


             (P ( X ) + ∑ P ( X ))( A + κ ) + P ( X )η + ∑ P ( X )(η
                i    i           z      z               i       i   i               z   z   z   + µ zi   )

                     v( X i )                  v( X z ) + σ µ2

around X i = X z = 0 to relate this formula to the “X” terms which determine these
precisions:

  There is also an extensive theoretical literature on social learning in economics following Kandori,
Mailaith and Rob (1993) and Ellison and Fudenberg (1993, 1995).

  A variant of this assumption might be that an individual attribute causes over-optimism about the
precision of the signal, as in Scheinkman and Xiong (2003).

       Pi′(0)( A + κ )
δ1 =                   . If we assume that the average characteristics of the communicating
           σ A2 ∆2

neighbors equal the average characteristics of people in community j, denoted X̂ j , then

the equation can be rewritten:


(1”) E ( A) ≈ K 1 + δ 1 X i + λ1δ 1 Xˆ j + noise ,


                 ZPz′(0)
where λ1 =               .       Values of “X” that reduce the variance of signals will change
                  Pi′(0)
posterior beliefs and, on average, increase the accuracy of those beliefs. Of course, in
settings when that error term is sufficiently large, changes in “X” that increase the
precision of signals can actually make realized ex post assessments more biased.


In the second case where κ = 0 and c > 0 , we assume that individuals believe that c
equals c with certainty. We continue to use the same precision notation as above,
        1                     1
Pi =        and Pz =                 , but in this case, these are constants, not functions of X. In

Both models of learning deliver a linear formula where the expected value of A equals a
constant, plus a slope parameter times the individual’s own “X” characteristic plus a
multiplier times that slope parameter times the average value of “X” in the individual’s
group. In the first learning process, the linear formulation is an approximation to a fully
rational non-linear signal extraction formula.      In the second formulation, the linear
formulation is an exact representation of an imperfectly rational learning process.


We will use the linear formulation E ( A)i = K + δX i + λδXˆ j + ε i , which might reflect

either learning process. This formula implies that average belief in community j equals
K + (1 + λ )δXˆ j plus any noise that is not averaged away. The social learning means that

the impact of “X” on group level beliefs will be stronger than the impact of “X” on
individual beliefs. The term 1 + λ is the ratio of the impact of “X” on beliefs at the
group level divided by the impact of “X” on beliefs within groups, which we refer to as
the social multiplier.


While our signal extraction description describes only one form of social learning, the
reduced form relationship E ( A)i = K + δX i + λδXˆ j + ε i does seem to capture the robust

empirical relationships between many beliefs and exogenous variables, such as the
connections between education and belief in heaven or income and the belief that
abortion is wrong.       Gentzkow and Shapiro (2004) show the relation between different
forms of education in the Islamic world and beliefs about who is responsible for the
September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.                 DiTella, Galiani, and
Schargrodsky (2007) find that beliefs about capitalism are altered with an allocation of
property rights. Our belief formation equation is simply meant to admit the possibility
that beliefs are correlated with individual and aggregate characteristics.



                                              8
With this formulation of beliefs, individual outcomes satisfy:


(3) Yi = γK + (γδ + β ) X i + γλδXˆ j + ε i ,



and group outcomes equal: Yˆ j = γK + (γδ (1 + λ ) + β ) Xˆ j + εˆ j . Table 1 lists the model’s

predictions about the coefficients when outcomes are regressed on the exogenous
variable.


Since γ and β are always positive, when δ is also positive, then the impact of social
learning will be to create a social multiplier where aggregate coefficients are bigger than
individual coefficients. In that probably more common case, people with higher values
of “X” choose higher levels of “Y” both because of the direct effect and the indirect
effect through beliefs. The belief effect becomes larger at the aggregate level because of
social learning and this causes the aggregate coefficient to be larger than the individual
coefficient.


The more interesting case, that can explain aggregation reversals, occurs when δ is
negative, and the indirect effect of “X” on “Y” that works through beliefs goes in the
opposite direction of the direct effect of “X” on “Y”.                An aggregation reversal requires
the individual-level regression coefficient of “Y” on “X” to be positive, which means that
                Cov( X i , Xˆ j ) 
β > γ δ 1 + λ                     .     An aggregation reversal also requires the aggregate
                 Var ( X i ) 
         
regression coefficient of “Y” on “X” to be negative, which requires γ δ (1 + λ ) > β .

Putting these conditions together implies that an aggregation reversal requires:


                                         β        Cov( X i , Xˆ j )
(4)                        1+ λ >          > 1+ λ
                                        γδ         Var ( X i )




                                                       9
The intuition of this inequality is that the social multiplier in beliefs must be higher than
the ratio of the direct effect of “X” on “Y” to the indirect effect that works through
beliefs, but this ratio must still be greater than one plus a term that is small when
Cov( X i , Xˆ j )                    Cov( X i , Xˆ j )
                    is small. When                        is close to zero, then the inequality means
  Var ( X i )                          Var ( X i )
that the ratio of direct to indirect effects must be greater than one and less than the social
multiplier.


The model predicts when we should expect aggregation reversals. First, there must be a
correlation between the exogenous variable and beliefs that works in the opposite
direction as the direct relationship between the exogenous variable and the outcome.
Second, there must be a sizable social multiplier in the formation of beliefs, so that the
relationship between beliefs and the exogenous variable is larger at the aggregate level
than at the individual level. In the next section, we discuss our empirical strategy for
estimating these parameters to assess whether the model can explain the aggregation
reversals shown in Figures 1 through 6.


III. Discrete Outcomes and Empirical Implementation


In this section, we discuss an empirical approach to our model of aggregation reversals.
Our approach is to estimate the key parameters using a set of empirical moments that
excludes the aggregate relationship between exogenous variables and outcomes and then
to see if those parameters predict the aggregation reversal. This approach is certainly not
an attempt to refute any alternative models of the observed aggregation reversals. Our
goal is just to show that our model is at least a plausible explanation of these phenomena.


In keeping with the model, we will continue to focus on one independent variable in each
case, either income or education. The model is aimed at explaining an aggregation
reversal of a univariate relationship, but we neither mean to suggest that other variables
don’t matter, and nor to suggest that our coefficients are causal. In all cases, we are
comfortable with the interpretation that the estimated univariate relationship reflects both


                                                     10
the impact of the independent variable and other omitted variables that are correlated
with that variable. The relationship between income and Republicanism that we examine
surely reflects many things that are correlated with income. This is not a problem for the
model and we will not try to isolate any effects that reflect income alone.


We presented the model in a continuous formulation to make it more intuitive, but our
examples will involve discrete outcomes and discrete beliefs. To move from the theory
to the data, we assume that the observed outcome variable takes on a value a zero or one,
which captures voting for Bush or attending church or owning a gun. We assume that
individuals choose an outcome of one when Yi = γK + (γδ + β ) X i + γλδXˆ j + ε i ,              is

positive. We assume that all of the relevant noise terms are normally distributed, and let
Fz (.) denote the cumulative distribution function and f z (.) denotes the density for a
normal random variable z.


The expected share of people living in place j who choose the positive outcome will
           (                          )
equal Fz1 K + (γδ (1 + λ ) + β ) Xˆ j , where z1 = (γδ + β )( X i − Xˆ j ) + ε i .   We assume that

z1 has the same distribution in each community. The average marginal effect of X̂ j on

the     share       of        the    population         that      chooses     one      will   equal

                         ((                        ))
(γδ (1 + λ ) + β ) ∫ f z1 K + (γδ (1 + λ ) + β ) Xˆ j
                    j
                                                      1
                                                      J
                                                        dj , if there are measure J communities, so

the average marginal effect of X̂ j continues to be γδ (1 + λ ) + β as shown in Table 1.


Within a community, for a given value of x, the share of people who choose one will
           (                              )
equal Fε K + (γδ + β ) X i + γλδXˆ j . If the distribution of X within the community is

characterized by a density function g(X), the estimated marginal effect of “X” is
               (                              )
(γδ + β ) ∫ f ε K + (γδ + β ) X i + γλδXˆ j g ( X i )dx ,
           x
                                                               so the average effect of x within

communities is again γδ + β .             We will use the estimated within group coefficient to
provide us with an estimate of γδ + β .




                                                   11
The estimated marginal effect of X on Y across the entire population equals

            γδλ ∂E ( Xˆ j )       ∂E ( Xˆ j )                  Cov( X i , Xˆ j )
γδ + β +                    , and             will again equal                   . As such, the
           1 − λ ∂X i              ∂X i                         Var ( X i )
existence of discrete outcome variables does require Probit estimation techniques, but it
does not change the connection between the parameters of the model and relationship
between exogenous variable and outcomes.


We assume that the “X” variable is mean zero and variance one and we will normalize
our independent variables appropriately in the empirical work.                     The parameter
Cov( X i , Xˆ j )
                    can be measured directly from the data, as it reflects the share of variation
   Var ( X i )
in “X” that is across group rather than within group. This parameter can be estimated
with the share of the variation in “X” that is explained by group dummies. We will scale
our “X” variables so that they have a mean of zero and a variance of one, so the missing
parameter is just the Cov( X i , Xˆ j ) .


We also assume that we do not measure beliefs directly but rather see several discrete
measures of beliefs that take on values of one when ψ k E ( A) + ξ ik is positive. For
example, in the case of religious belief, we have questions on statements about belief in
the devil and beliefs in the literal truth of the Bible. The parameter ψ k reflects the

relationship between the relevant beliefs and the particular discrete measure. The term ξ ik
is an error term specific to the person and the measure of beliefs. By scaling δ and the
error terms appropriately, we can always ensure that the latent belief variable has a
variance of one. We also normalize 1 − ψ k2 = Var (ξ ik ) so that the variance of the belief
proxies also equals one. These assumptions are innocuous scaling assumptions about
unobserved latent variables that drive the zero-one decision.


Within a given group, the share of the population that answers yes to belief question k is
    (                        )                (                 )
Fz2 ψ j ( K + (1 + λ )δXˆ j ) where z 2 = ψ j δ ( X i − Xˆ j ) + ε i + ξ i j . The estimated marginal



                                                  12
                                         (                    )     1
effect of X̂ j will be ψ k δ (1 + λ ) ∫ f z2 ψ j ( K + (1 + λ )δXˆ j dj and the average effect will
                                       j                            J
be ψ k δ (1 + λ ) . Within groups, the estimated marginal effect of x on beliefs will be ψ k δ
so the ratio will again give us the social multiplier.      As such, we use the within group
belief regressions to estimate ψ k δ and the ratio of the coefficient on “X” from within
group and across group regressions to estimate the social multiplier.


We estimate the parameter ψ k by assuming that we have two potential proxies for the

underlying beliefs. If ψ k is the same for both of these proxies, then covariance of the two

underlying normal variables is equal to ψ k2 . This covariance is empirically implied by
the means and covariance of the two discrete measures of underlying beliefs. If the two
values of ψ k are not the same, then the potential range for ψ k is between the underlying
covariance and one and we can consider this entire range for this variable.


Our final moment is the relationship between beliefs and outcomes. In both cases, we
observe a discrete proxy for the relevant underlying variables Yi and ψ k E ( A) i + ξ ik .
Again, we can use the means of the two discrete variables and their covariance to
estimate the underlying covariance of the two normal variables. The model predicts that
                                             (
this underlying covariance will equal ψ k γ + βδ (1 + λCov( X i , Xˆ j ) .)

Table 1 lists these set of predictions that we use to estimate the parameters. We need
estimates of six parameters: β , γ , δ , λ , ψ k and Cov( X i , Xˆ j ) . We use six moments

to estimate these parameters: (1) the within group relationship between exogenous
variable and outcome, (2) the amount of variation in the exogenous variable that is within
group, (3) the within-group effect of the exogenous variable on the proxy for beliefs, (4)
the across-group effect of the exogenous variable on the proxy for beliefs, (5) the
correlation of different proxies for beliefs and (6) the individual level covariance between
the proxy for beliefs and the outcome variable.             We will then see whether these




                                                 13
parameters predict an aggregation reversal and whether they come close to predicting the
observed aggregate relationship between the outcome and the exogenous variable.


The square root of the covariance of the latent belief variables provides our estimate of
ψk .     The share of variation in X that is explained by group dummies estimates

Cov( X i , Xˆ j ) . The ratio of the aggregation relationship between the exogenous variable

and the belief proxy and the within-group relationship between the exogenous variable
and the belief proxy delivers 1 + λ . The ratio of the within-group relationship between
the exogenous variable and the belief proxy and the square root of the covariance of the
latent belief variables delivers δ .


The value of β is found by subtracting δ /ψ k times the estimated covariance of the
latent belief proxy and the latent outcome from the estimated within group marginal
effect    of    the   exogenous variable on the outcome           and then dividing by
1 − δ 2 − δ 2 λCov ( X i , Xˆ j ) . The value of γ is found by subtracting this estimate of β

from the estimated within-group effect of the exogenous variable on the outcome and
then dividing by the estimate of δ .


    IV.        Income and Republicanism


The aggregation reversal that occurs in the relationship between income and
Republicanism is quite striking. At the individual level, there is a modest positive
relationship between earnings and voting for President Bush in 2000. According to the
National Annenberg Election Study of 2000, 55 percent of the top quintile of the income
distribution voted for the Republican in 2000; 36 percent of the bottom quintile of the
income distributed voted for him in the same year. This positive income-Republicanism
relationship certainly corresponds with popular notions of Republicanism, but those
notions are seemingly contradicted by the profoundly negative relationship between
income and Republicanism at the state level shown in Figure 2.              The correlation
coefficient is –.57.


                                             14
The model seems to have a reasonable chance of explaining this aggregation reversal
because of the multiple aspects of Republicanism.             In post-Reagan America,
Republicanism has been associated with both lower taxes, which presumably appeal to
the wealthy and conservative social stances (Glaeser, Ponzetto and Shapiro, 2005).
Republicans have regularly championed school prayer and limits on abortion. The appeal
of these social stances depends on conservative social beliefs that are not positively
correlated with income. In the Annenberg data set, the correlation between income and
the propensity to say that the government should not put limits on abortion is 10 percent.
The combination of a direct relationship between income and the financial returns from
low tax Republican policies and an indirect relationship where income decreases
conservative social beliefs which decreases the support for Republicanism suggests that
our model may indeed explain the observed aggregation reversal.


To test this hypothesis, we use the Annenberg data to estimate the parameters of the
model. We will then see whether these estimated parameters predict an aggregation
reversal and the coefficient seen in the aggregate data.      We estimate an aggregate
marginal effect of log income on the propensity to vote for Bush of -.274 using Federal
Election Commission voting records and 2000 Census data on income, with a standard
error of .058. This estimation is done using nonlinear least squares to fit the data to a
cumulative normal function. This reflects our assumption that the underlying
heterogeneity in political preferences is normally distributed. The ordinary least squares
estimate is -.272 with a standard error of .057.


We have two different belief variables that we use in our estimation: survey responses to
questions as to whether “the federal government should not put limits on abortion,” and
“the government should not support prayer in schools.” In both cases, we have reduced
the answers to these questions to taking on two values. The first column of Table 2
shows the results using the first question; the second column shows the results using the
second question.




                                             15
Two of our empirical moments are independent of the choice of belief variable. The
marginal impact of income on voting for Bush, our estimate of γδ + β , is found using a
Probit equation with state fixed effects on the Annenberg data. As shown in the first row
                                                                     Cov( X i , Xˆ j )
of Table 2, we estimate .055 for this coefficient. The estimate of                       is based
                                                                        Var ( X i )
on the amount of variation in income explained by state fixed effects. The second row of
Table 2 shows our estimate of .023 for this parameter. We have also estimated this
sorting parameter using the Census Individual Public Use Micro Samples (IPUMS) and
found a similar parameter estimate of .022.


As described above, we need the correlation between the two questions to form our
estimate of ψ k which is based on the correlation of the two variables. The third row of
Table 2 shows the estimated covariance of the latent belief variables of .143 which is our
estimate of ψ k2 .


The remaining rows in the table give estimates that differ between the two belief
questions. In the fifth row, we show the estimated impact of income on beliefs within
states, which is our estimate of ψ k δ . This estimate is -0.041 in the case of support for
limits on abortion and -0.079 in the case of opposition to prayer in school. Income is
more strongly negatively correlated with beliefs about prayer in school than with beliefs
about limits on abortion. The sixth row shows the associated value of δ which is found
by dividing this estimate by our estimate of ψ k . This parameter estimate is -.109 in the
case of the abortion question and -.210 for the prayer question.


The seventh row gives the state level marginal impact of the logarithm of income on the
share of the population that answers yes to the two questions.           In both cases, the
estimated coefficient explodes.     In the case of limits on abortion, the group-level
coefficient rises to -.399 and in the case of school prayer the group level coefficient rises
to -.477. The much stronger aggregate relationship supports the hypothesis of a social




                                              16
multiplier, although sorting on omitted variables could explain some part of the observed
group level relationship.


In the eighth row, we report the value of λ implied by the ratio of group level effects to
individual effects. In the case of abortion, this parameter is 8.73. In the case of school
prayer it is 5.02.     We also find evidence for social multipliers when we examine
relationships at lower levels of aggregation. Perhaps it is surprising to estimate social
multipliers that are this strong, but these findings are certainly in line with the social
psychology literature that argues that beliefs like these are very much the product of
social interactions.


In the ninth row, we show the estimated covariance of the latent outcome variable
(support for Bush) and the latent belief variable. There is a higher covariance in the case
of the abortion question, .219, then in the case of the school prayer question, .148. This
higher correlation reflects the stronger connection between Republicanism and views on
abortion than between Republicanism and views on school prayer.


The tenth and eleventh rows give our estimates of γ and β , the impact of beliefs on
voting for Bush and the direct effect of income on voting for Bush. In both cases, beliefs
seem to have a much stronger impact on voting Republican than income. We estimate γ
coefficients of .598 and .432 for the abortion and prayer questions respectively. When
we use the abortion question, we estimate a direct effect of income ( β ) of .144. When
we use the prayer question, we estimate a higher direct effect of income of .170.


The twelfth row gives the predicted group level relationship between income and voting
for Bush implied by these parameters. In both cases, the model predicts a healthy
aggregation reversal. Using the abortion question, we predict a negative relationship of -
.488 and with the prayer relationship we predict a negative relationship of -.377. This
predicted relationship should be compared to the actual aggregate relationship of -.274
shown in the thirteenth row.




                                            17
The predicted value found by using the school prayer question is reasonably close to the
actual aggregate relationship; the prediction based on the abortion question is far too
negative. Although given the imprecision of our estimates, it is not clear that we should
make too much of these findings. We suspect that we are predicting too much of an
aggregation reversal, because we are overestimating the size of the social multiplier in the
case of the abortion question. For example, if we used the social multiplier estimated
using the school prayer question but continued to use all of the other moments of the
abortion question, then our predicted aggregate relationship would be much closer to the
actual aggregate relationship.


   V.      Religion and Education


We now revisit the connection between education and religion discussed in Glaeser and
Sacerdote (2002).    At the individual level, more educated people attend church more
often. In the General Social Survey, 53 percent of college graduates attend church once
per month or more while 45 percent of high school dropouts attend that frequently.
However, more educated denominations are far less religious than less educated
denominations. Figure 4 shows the correlation between average years of education and
church attendance across denominations.


As in the case of voting Republican, there are at least two different reasons to go to
church. First, going to church is a conventional social activity that connects people
within a community and provides certain type of services for children. Second, going to
church is thought by some to yield otherworldly returns, such as going to heaven.
Religious beliefs are surely based on social influences. Where else would most people
come up with their views about the afterlife?     These two different functions of church
attendance—one of which is highly dependent on socially formed beliefs and one of
which is not—suggest that our model can possibly explain the aggregation reversal.


Glaeser and Sacerdote (2002) provide evidence that education predicts participation in
almost every formal social activity at the individual level.           Education predicts



                                            18
membership in political clubs, fraternal clubs, hobbyist associations and even sports
clubs. In this light, it seems unsurprising that education also predicts membership in
religious groups and attendance at church. There are several possible explanations of this
fact. Group membership may be seen as a form of investment in social capital and
people who live investing in human capital may also see returns to social capital.
Glaeser, Ponzetto and Shleifer (2006) argue that education includes heavy doses of
socialization that increases the ability to interact effectively with others. If education
directly increases the returns to social activity and if church-going is a social activity,
then this creates a direct effect where education should increase the amount of church
attendance.


Religion is, of course, not just another social club. Most religious groups also promise
some forms of otherworldly returns to religious adherence. Yet education generally
predicts less belief in the supernatural. For example, belief in heaven, the devil and the
literal truth of the bible all decline strong with years of education. There are several
possible interpretations of this phenomenon. One view is that these phenomena are at
odds with modern science and more education naturally includes more of the science that
disproves religious belief. An alternative view argues that secular education is often anti-
clerical and the negative relation between education and religion reflects the impact of
secularist indoctrination. We take no view in this debate, but simply note the robust
negative relationship between years of schooling and religious beliefs.


Whatever negative effects exist between education and religious beliefs at the individual
level, they do appear to be magnified at the denomination level. Figure 7 shows the
negative relationship between average years of schooling in a denomination and belief in
the devil. This magnification may well reflect the social formation of beliefs. Educated
denominations contain people who are less likely to be strong believers and who speak
those views regularly. The more educated denominations are also more likely to have
educated religious leaders who are less likely to be strong believers and who themselves
determine the basic tenets of the denomination. More educated denominations are more




                                            19
likely to have sermons discussing nuanced ethical issues rather than strong statements
affirming the literal truth of the bible or the damnation of non-believers.


We will use belief in the devil and the literal truth of the bible for our calibration. While
these variables take on 4 and 3 values respectively in the General Social Survey, we
reduce them to binary variables based on the mean response. Our calibrations appear in
Table 3. In the first row, we describe the within denomination relationship between
education and attendance of .031. Education has been normalized to have a standard
deviation of one, so this coefficient means that a one standard deviation increase in
education is associated with a 3.1 percent increase in the probability that an individual
will attend church regularly.


In the second row, we give the share of the variation in education that is explained by
denomination fixed effects: 5.6 percent.           Education is more closely linked to
denomination than income is to states. The third row gives the correlation of latent belief
variables implied by the correlation of our two proxies for beliefs and the fourth row
shows that this implies a value for ψ j of .412.


The fifth row gives the marginal impact of education on belief within denominations. In
both cases, more educated people are less likely to have strong religious beliefs. A one
standard deviation increase in education is associated with a 3.2 percent decrease in the
propensity to say that the bible is the literal truth and an 11.8 percent decrease in the
propensity to believe in the devil. When we divide these values by our estimate of ψ k in

the sixth row, we estimate of δ to be -.078 and -.287 for the bible and devil question
respectively.


In the seventh and eighth rows, we show the results of the cross denomination regressions
of beliefs on education and the implied social multiplier.        In the case of the bible
question, we estimate an aggregate coefficient of -.6 and a value for λ of 17.7       In the
case of the devil question, somewhat appropriately, we estimate an aggregate coefficient
of -.666 and estimate λ to be 4.6. The denomination level coefficients are almost


                                             20
identical and the difference in the social multiplier is driven primarily by the lower
individual level relationship between education and belief in the literal truth of the bible.


The ninth row delivers the implied covariance between the latent belief variable and the
latent attendance variable which is .148 in the case of the bible question and .13 in the
case of the devil question. The ninth row shows that these covariances imply almost
identical values of γ for the two belief questions: .369 and .365. In both cases, higher
beliefs are strongly associated with greater propensity to attend church. The similar
estimates of γ imply quite different estimated values for β : .06 for the bible question
and .139 for the devil question. The difference is driven by the much stronger correlation
between education and belief in the devil than between education and belief in the literal
truth of the bible.


The twelfth and thirteenth rows give the predicted and actual aggregate relationships
between education and religious attendance. In both cases, the parameters predict a
robust aggregation reversal.       With the bible question, our parameters predict an
aggregation reversal of -.479 and, with the devil question, we predict an aggregation
reversal of -.454. The actual aggregate relationship is -.314. We again predict too
negative a relationship, although our standard errors are sufficiently big that these
differences are only modestly statistically different.


There are many possible explanations for our overly negative predictions. In the case of
the bible question, we suspect that our estimate of the social multiplier is too high. In the
case of the devil question, we may have overestimated the magnitude of δ , the
connection between education and beliefs.          As before, we think the lesson of this
calibration is that the model is more effective at predicting the sign of the aggregate
effect than at accurately predicting the actual size of the effect.




                                              21
    VI.     Income and Military


We now turn to our final aggregation reversal: the relationship between income and
military service. Figure 5 shows the positive relationship between veteran status, which
is defined as having had some military service, and family income at the individual level.
This relationship we show uses data from the General Social Survey, but the Census
shows similar results. This relationship surely reflects some amount of both treatment
and selection, but when we look at parental occupation status in the General Social
Survey, we also find an -.02 percent correlation between higher income occupations and
entering into the army. People from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds tend not to
join the army, either because they are not allowed in or because they choose not to join.


Figure 6 shows the relationship between income and military service at the state level
using the 2000 census. In this case, we look only at people born after 1950 which means
that we are looking almost mainly at people who have volunteered. Alternative cutoff
dates make little difference. People from lower income states are much more likely to
join the military than people from higher income states.               The Northeast trio of
Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey are particularly unlikely to have members in
the military.


One explanation for this phenomenon that corresponds well with standard prejudices
about red and blue states is that people in high income areas are less likely to believe in
army and military service. At the individual level, perhaps, relatively anti-war teachers
perhaps tell students that fighting in armies is bad. Perhaps, high levels of income
correlate with a dislike of the self-sacrifice that military service entails.


We use two belief variables to look at enthusiasm for the army. The first belief variable
is a question about whether respondents think that the army is a good experience for men.
The second belief variable is whether respondents have confidence in the army as an
institution. In both cases, income and education are negatively correlated with the pro-
military belief.   In both cases, the correlations between income and beliefs at the state



                                               22
level are significantly stronger than the correlations at income and beliefs at the
individual level.


Table 4 yields the parameter estimates for this example. The first row gives the within
state relationship between income and military service. A one standard deviation in log
of income is associated with a 5.9 percent increase in the probability of having a veteran
in the household. The second column provides the variation in income explained by state
dummies which is the same parameter that appeared in our first example.


The third and fourth columns display the estimated covariance of the latent belief
variables and the implied value of ψ k : .335. These belief variables are less correlated
than the belief variables in the previous examples. The fifth row shows the estimated
impact of income on beliefs within states and the sixth row shows the implied value of
δ . We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in income is associated with a 10
percent decrease in pro-military beliefs, using the first question, and an eight percent
decrease in pro-military beliefs when we use the second question. In this case, the
estimates of δ using the two different questions seem reasonably close.


The seventh and eighth rows give the estimated impact of income on pro-military beliefs
across states and the implied values for λ . The implied values of λ are 2.6 and 5.9.
The confidence in the army question appears to have a much stronger social multiplier.


The ninth row gives the implied covariance of the latent belief variable with the outcome.
In the case of the question about the military being a good experience, the correlation is
robust. The tenth row shows that this correlation implies that γ equals .58 for the
question about the benefits of military service. The latent correlation between confidence
in the army and military service is almost zero and this implies a value of .037 for γ .
This small connection between beliefs and outcomes makes an aggregation reversal
unlikely.




                                           23
In the eleventh row, we show the implied values of β which is .12 when we use the
question about the military being a good experience and .06 when we use confidence in
the army. These higher values in the case of the good experience come from a higher
estimate of γ . When the impact of beliefs is estimated to be higher, then the direct effect
of income must also be higher.


Finally in the twelfth and thirteenth rows, we look at the predicted and actual aggregate
relationship between income and military service. In the case of the good experience
question, we predict an aggregate relationship of -.098 when the actual relationship is -
.092. In the case of the confidence in the army question, our low estimate of γ means we
fail to estimate an aggregate reversal and predict an aggregate coefficient of .042.


   VII.    Conclusion


This paper presents a model of aggregation reversals where individual relationships have
the opposite sign from group relationships. In the model, aggregation reversals occur
when the exogenous variable impacts the outcomes through two channels. In one of the
channels, there is a social multiplier, so the aggregate relationship between the exogenous
variable and the outcome increases at higher levels of aggregation. We focus on the case
where the exogenous variable is correlated with beliefs, because we believe social
influence is a critical determinant of most beliefs. The model predicts that aggregation
reversals will occur when the ratio of the direct effect of the exogenous variable on the
outcome to the belief effect negative and is somewhat greater in absolute value than one
and less than the social multiplier.


We applied the model to three examples of aggregation reversals. We did not try to rule
out other alternative theories or identify causal parameters. Instead, we asked whether
parameter values that were estimated from individual level relationships and the
aggregate relationship between beliefs and the exogenous variable would predict the
aggregation reversal that we see in the data. Our work does not rule out alternative
explanations, but rather tries to establish some degree of plausibility for our theory.


                                             24
We examined the relationship between income and voting for George Bush in 2000, the
relationship between education and religious attendance and the relationship between
income and military service. We used two different belief variables for each aggregation
reversal yielding six different predictions about aggregate relationships. Our calibration
exercise had successes and failures. In five out of six cases, the parameters did predict an
aggregation reversal. Except for the one case where we don’t predict an aggregation
reversal, we estimate a large relationship between beliefs and outcomes and a large social
multiplier in the formation of beliefs. Together these tend to predict an aggregation
reversal. In many cases, we predict too much of a reversal because our estimated social
multiplier is quite large.


The paper suggests that the social formation of beliefs and the resulting social multipliers
may be significant determinants of important aggregate phenomena.              These three
aggregation reversals are hardly the only such cases that exist. Figures 7 and 8 show the
aggregation reversal in the relationship between gun ownership and income. In all of the
cases we examined, we found substantial social multipliers in beliefs, but omitted
variables that could be driving these findings. We hope that future empirical work will
put more effort on more cleanly identified estimates of the magnitude of social learning.

Data Appendix


Voting and Income: State level voting results in 2000 are from the Federal Election
Commission.     State level income for 2000 is calculated from the Individual Public Use
Micro data available at ipums.org and uses the household income measure.


Micro data are from the National Annenberg Election Survey 2000.        The data CD Rom
accompanies the volume Romer, Daniel, Kate Kenski, Paul Waldman, Christopher
Adasiewicz and Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Capturing Campaign Dynamic, (New York:
Oxford University Press), 2004. We use only the data collection waves that occurred
after the election and code as voting for Bush all those who report voting for Bush. We
code as 0 those voting for Gore or some other candidate. The abortion variable is coded
so that a 1 is given to those who respond that the federal government should not restrict
abortion. Those who respond that the federal govt should restrict are coded as 0.    Those
who say the federal government should NOT allow school prayer are coded as a 1 and
those who say the federal government should allow school prayer are coded as 0.


Attendance and Education:         We use the General Social Survey 2004 data.           For
attendance, we use the variable ATTEND and code as a 1 those who attend religious
services once per month or more. For beliefs about the devil we use the variable DEVIL
and code as a 1 those who say "yes definitely" or "yes probably" when asked if they
believe in the Devil. Our recoded variable has a mean of 62 percent. For beliefs about
the bible, we code as 1 those who respond that "The Bible is the actual word of God and
it is to be taken literally, word for word." Our recode variable has a mean of 30 percent.
