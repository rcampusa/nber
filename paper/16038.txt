                                             ABSTRACT

An important class of investment decisions is characterized by unrecoverable sunk costs, resolution
of uncertainty through time, and the ability to invest in the future as an alternative to investing today.
The options model provides guidance in such settings, including an investment decision rule called
the “bad news principle”: the downside investment state influences the investment decision whereas
the upside investment state is ignored. This study takes a new approach to examining predictions of
the options model by using the tools of experimental economics. Our evidence, which is drawn from
student and professional trader subject pools, is broadly consonant with the options model.

I.     Introduction

       Every day individuals decide whether to expend resources today or keep their options

open until tomorrow. Standard neoclassical investment models provide unequivocal advice in

such situations: invest when the present value of the project’s expected cash flow is at least as

large as its costs. An important literature using options models has shown that this rule is

incorrect when investment is irreversible, uncertainty is resolved through time, and investment

can be postponed (see, e.g., Dixit, 1989, 1992; Pindyck, 1991; Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). In such

cases, the standard investment model ignores the opportunity cost of investing today—i.e.,

current investment precludes not investing if bad news is observed, and therefore potentially

provides an inferior decision rule.     One interesting manifestation of the options modeling

approach is the “Bad News Principle” (hereafter BNP) first introduced by Bernanke (1983),

which suggests that only the expected severity of future bad news matters in deciding whether

one should invest in an asset today. Indeed, the potential good news should have no effect on the

temporal nature of an agent’s investment decision. Intuitively, this asymmetry follows from the

fact that an option to wait has no value when investing now is the correct decision.

       Despite the topic’s vast normative and positive implications, there has been a limited

number of empirical studies examining the integrity of the options model.1 Hubbard (1994; p.

1829) highlights this fact when noting that “empirical research has not quite caught up with the

rapidly changing theoretical developments in this literature.” This is not surprising in light of the

difficulties associated with executing a clean empirical test of such behavior. Even when such

data are available, too many theoretically relevant factors change simultaneously to allow a clean

comparative static test.



                                                 1
       Experimentation alleviates many of these problems by use of randomization, and

therefore provides an attractive approach for analyzing the behavioral predictions from the

options model. Such an approach provides an opportunity for the researcher to vary important

parameters while holding constant other elements that could affect investment decisions. The

experimental method thus allows the researcher to study the comparative static effects of

changes in important parameters that are difficult to identify in naturally-occurring data.

       This paper follows this approach by first examining behavior of students in a controlled

laboratory experiment.     We observe an asymmetrical response to bad versus good news:

subjects are quite sensitive to changes in the “bad news” payoff state but are less responsive to

changes in the high payoff state. Finding evidence in favor of the option model’s predictions is

consistent with a broad class of preference structures, however. For example, students in the

laboratory are often found to exhibit behavior consonant with loss aversion (Kahneman and

Tversky, 1979), and therefore our findings may simply be evidence of this type of behavior in a

different environment. In this light, inference from these data should be made with great caution.

       This issue induces us to push the analysis in two different directions. In the first, we

recognize that recent research—from US housing markets, to Israeli and US stock markets, to

smaller-scale product markets—suggests that trading professionals exhibit much less, if any, loss

aversion (e.g., Genesove and Mayer, 2001; Shapira and Venezia 2000; Locke and Mann, 2004;

List, 2003, 2004). Such results suggest that finding a population of professional traders will

permit a more demanding test of the options model. Our search for professionals concluded

when the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agreed to provide i) access to professional futures and

options pit traders and ii) space on the exchange to carry out our experiments.2 Our second


                                                 2
approach uses a laboratory experiment with student subjects, but alters the payoff space: all

decisions are made over payments in the loss domain. In this case, the intuition of the decision

making process under the options model is similar, but the loss averse model yields different

predictions because agents seek risk in the loss domain and have diminishing sensitivity.

       Overall, across both complementary approaches we find data consonant with the options

model. For example, market professionals’ are acutely aware of changes in the bad payoff state

and ignore changes in the good payoff state. Interestingly, we find that they behave differently

from students: market professionals are less sensitive to changes in both the low and high payoff

states compared to students. The finding of less sensitivity to the low state is consonant with the

spirit of collecting data from professionals who are not loss averse, while the lower sensitivity to

the high state suggests that market professionals might be following the options model more

closely than the students. Turning to the environment wherein all decisions are made over

payments in the loss domain, the option model remains with significant predictive power;

consonant with List (2003, 2004), however, there are hints of loss aversion among students.

       Our findings potentially have both positive and normative implications. For example, the

results provide a useful indication of the possibilities of a class of efficient policies to stimulate

investment. Moreover, they provide guidance on the appropriate normative modeling approach.

From a methodological viewpoint, our findings highlight that there is meaningful behavioral

economic research to be done by implementing experimental protocols with non-standard subject

pools. In this regard, a useful next step is to complete the empirical bridge between the lab and

the field by exploring behavior in framed and natural field experiments that test predictions of

the options model (see List, 2006, for an example over a different set of problems).


                                                  3
         The remainder of our study proceeds as follows.           Section II begins with a brief

background of the options model to motivate our experimental design. Section III summarizes

the experimental results. Section IV concludes.

II.      Background and Experimental Design

         We begin by outlining the two-period options model. The exposition closely follows

Dixit and Pindyck (1994). Assume that agents are profit maximizing and are offered a contract

that permits them to exercise the contract now, or to wait until period 2 when all uncertainty

regarding outcomes is revealed before making the investment decision. Further, assume that

there is a fixed premium (cost) of the option, C, an initial payoff of X, and two possible payoffs

H and L (representing “high” and “low”). Players know that nature determines the payoff, and

that the high (low) state occurs with probability p (1 – p), and payoff parameters are given by L <

C < H.

         The option of investing in the contract in the first (second) period is labeled O1 (O2). The

information sets in these periods are represented by I1 and I2. Thus, (Oi|Ii) represents the choice

of option i given the information i. The standard options model predicts that a risk-neutral agent

should invest in the contract in the first period only when the ex ante expected value of investing

in period two (EV(O2|O1)) is less than the expected value from investing in period one

(EV(O1|O1)), where the expected value of investing in the first period is given by:

         EV(O1|I1) = X + pH + (1-p)L – C .                                                   (1)

Calculation of the ex ante expected payoff in period two, EV(O2|I1), must take into account that if

the agent delays the investment decision to the second period she forfeits the first period initial

payoff, X. She does not, however, forego the opportunity to invest in the second period upon



                                                  4
observing the true state. The expected value in period one of delaying the investment choice to

period two is therefore:

        EV(O2|I1) = p(H – C) +(1-p)(0) = pH – pC.                                         (2)

Hence, the condition that triggers investment in the first period is:

        X + pH + (1-p)L – C > pH – pC          or       X + (1-p)(L-C) > 0,               (3)

because the pH terms cancel. The equation reveals that the investment decision is purely a

function of the investment cost (C), the initial payoff (X), the probability (p), and the downside

risk (L).

        A distinguishing feature of the options model is that while L is an argument in equation

(3), H is not present. Hence, an important comparative static prediction is that the expected

severity of the bad state matters for first-period decision making, but the level of the payoff in

the good state has no effect. This manifestation has been termed the bad news principle (BNP;

Bernanke, 1983) and represents an important prediction of the options model. Our experimental

design addresses whether the investment decision is driven by equation (3), and explores whether

the investment decision is entirely independent of all upside gain considerations (H) but

influenced by variations in L.

Experimental Design

        Table 1 contains a summary of our experimental design, which closely follows the

options framework discussed above and Bjornstad et al. (2003). The parameter values and the

expected values EV(O1|I1) and EV(O2|I1) implied by each contract are included. The contract

parameters were selected to pit the standard neoclassical investment model against the options

model while simultaneously allowing clean tests of the comparative static predictions of the

options model. For example, contract 1 in each triad is characterized by EV(O1|I1) < EV(O2|I1),

                                                    5
whereas the other contracts, 2 and 3, have EV(O1|I1) > EV(O2|I1). And, H and L vary between

the three contract types, permitting a test of the BNP.

       Consider contract A1 more closely. In this particular contract, the high payoff, H, was

set at 12 units and the low payoff, L, was set at 1 unit. Whether the contract paid H or L

depended on the color of the ball drawn from a bingo cage, where the probability of H or L was

identical (p = 0.5). This information was common knowledge. If the subject chose to buy the

contract in period one, at a cost of C=10 units, then she immediately received a payment of X=3

units. Otherwise, she did not pay the cost of the contract and did not receive the immediate

payment of 3 units. After all participants made their choice of purchase/no purchase in period

one, the bingo cage was spun and the color of the ball that fell out of the cage determined the

payoff: a dark ball meant that the contract would pay 12 additional units, whereas a light color

ball meant that investing agents would receive 1 additional unit. For those who did not invest in

period 1, a decision of whether to invest in the contract was made after the outcome was

determined.

       One important caveat to testing the options model via our approach is that a bulk of

recent research has found evidence of loss aversion among students in the laboratory (see, e.g.,

Kahneman et al., 1990). Such experimental findings have been robust across unfamiliar goods,

such as irradiated sandwiches, and common goods, such as chocolate bars and coffee mugs. In

our case, this confound is potentially devastating, as a data pattern consistent with the BNP is

also in line with loss aversion. For example, the fact that students are more acutely aware of

losses than comparably-sized gains can masquerade as evidence in favor of the options model.

       We offer two solutions. One solution is to conduct controlled laboratory treatments with

not only students but agents who are predicted to have little, or no, loss aversion. A recent line

                                                 6
of research suggests that behavior consistent with loss aversion is attenuated, or even eliminated,

among those agents who have significant market experience or who are considered market

professionals (see, e.g., Knez et al., 1985; Coursey et al., 1987; Brookshire and Coursey, 1987;

Myagkov and Plott, 1997; Genesove and Mayer, 2001; Shapira and Venezia 2000; Locke and

Mann, 2004; List, 2003, 2004).3 Accordingly, we perform a series of experimental treatments

with market professionals that mirror the student treatments.

       Both the student and market professionals made investment decisions over at least 3

contracts (A1-A3, B1-B3, C1-C3, or some combination).4 To control for income effects and

compound lottery effects, we made all contracts monetarily binding in some sessions and

randomly chose one contract to be monetarily binding in other sessions (whereby agents made

choices and were told that only one contract would be binding).5 For those sessions where one

contract was binding, the monetarily binding contract was randomly selected via a blind draw

from a paper bag. The terms of that binding contract were then fulfilled. When examining data

across the “all binding” and “one binding” treatments we found that for both the student and

market professional populations, behavior is not different; thus we pool these data in the

empirical analysis below.6 Finally, we varied the contract sequencing to control for order

effects, of which we found no evidence so we suppress further discussion.

       Before moving to our second approach to tackling the confound issue, we discuss some

aspects of our student and trader design. First, all experiments were run with pencil and paper.

Second, when presenting the contracts we were careful to include the yields and details on how

these yields are determined (the full experimental instructions are available upon request). We

also explained several practice contracts before beginning the experiment.            Participants’

questions were invited at this point. Participants were then told that they would be given a

                                                7
packet of contracts and were to make choices between option 1 and option 2. Each of the

contracts was formatted exactly like the contracts in the examples, but differed in values of H

and L (see Table 1). Subjects made their option 1 and option 2 decisions for all contracts. Note

that for each of the contracts that subjects choose between option 1 and option 2 the outcome of

that choice was disclosed before the next choice in the next contract was made.

       After subjects made their choices and the outcome of each contract was revealed,

experimenters checked each subject’s choice to ensure that individual payoffs were correctly

calculated. Finally, in the market professional treatments the exchange rate was 4:1 (4 cents for

each unit), and the student treatment exchange rate was 1:1 (1 cent for each unit). Our decision

to quadruple the exchange rate for the market professionals was based on a detailed discussion

with CBOT officials about market professional earnings.7 In total, we observe 531 decisions:

279 observations from students and 252 from market professionals.8

       Our second solution to the confounding issue is to use a standard laboratory experiment

with student subjects but alter the payoff space to make all decisions over payments in the loss

domain. To implement this treatment, we simply transform the 9 contracts in Table 1 to be over

losses. We do this by initially endowing each subject with a starting balance of $25 and

ownership of a contract that pays -$10 with certainty. Subjects are then told that they can trade

their contract for another contract. To form the other contracts, we combine X and negative

values of H and L in a manner that ensures we are always in the loss domain. The procedure is

as follows: in period 1, we simply transform H and L in Table 1 to be negative (i.e., 12 becomes

-12 and 1 becomes -1). In period 2, we again make H and L negative, but add -3 to both H and L

(i.e., -15 and -4 result). In this manner, considering that -15 will not result because the contracts

will not be traded (agent will keep -10 rather than trading), the first decision in Table 1 becomes:

                                                 8
Option 1, trade the contract immediately. Payoffs:                   Heads:          -$12

                                                                     Tails:          -$1



Option 2, wait to trade until after coin flip is determined:         Heads:          -$10

                                                                     Tails:          -$4



For the remainder of contracts and payoffs please see Table 1a. Under this design, the intuition

of the decision making process under the options model is similar, with changes in L, and not H,

affecting the decision. Intuitively, this asymmetry follows from the fact that an option to wait

has no value when trading now is the correct decision.

       Recall that loss aversion is a behavioral manifestation that is captured by prospect theory,

which conjectures that a value function exists that is (i) measured over deviations from a

reference point, (ii) convex for losses and concave for gains, and (iii) initially steeper for losses

than for gains. Hence, a major conjecture of prospect theory is diminishing sensitivity, or that

small gains are disproportionately more attractive relative to large gains, and small losses

disproportionately aversive relative to large losses. Intuitively, convexity of the value function

in losses is motivated by the idea that the decline in value from a loss of $1100 to a loss of $1200

is less than the decline in value from a loss of $100 to a loss of $200. The implication is that in

our experiment, unit changes near zero should influence decisions more than unit changes in the

extreme—agents should be risk seeking in the loss domain.

       For ease of execution, and to maximize power, we simply provided each subject with 9

binary choices, similar to our example above—the nine choices are provided in Table 1a. And,

similar to the student treatments above, our students were drawn from the undergraduate student

                                                  9
body of the University of Maryland. Note that in this experiment we are making an important

assumption: subjects instantaneously integrate their assets so that we can couch our discussion

in terms of losses (see Mason et al., 2005, for another experiment in this spirit). Whether this

assumption is valid remains an open empirical question. In total, we observe 675 decisions—75

students each making 9 choices.

III.   Empirical Results

       We begin our discussion with a summary of the student and trader behavior within the

standard options model game, and then proceed to a discussion of the experimental data over

losses. In doing so, we attempt to highlight both data consonant with the options model, as well

as data outside of that model.

A. Student and Trader Behavior in the Standard Option Game

       Viewing the raw proportions of choices across the two options provides a useful first

glimpse at the spirit of our empirical results. Consider the graphical depiction in Figure 1, which

provides an indication of the percentage of option 1 choices across treatments. In these data

summaries, the contracts are arranged so that the leftmost bar graphs are characterized by

EV(O1|I1) < EV(O2|I1) (i.e., contracts A1, B1, and C1). The other bar charts are characterized by

EV(O1|I1) > EV(O2|I1). Accordingly, vertical comparisons provide insights into comparative

static effects of changing the high payoff state whereas horizontal comparisons provide insights

into the effects of changing the low payoff state. Two aspects of the figures provide useful

evidence. First, consistent with the options model but at odds with the classical investment

model, in B1 and C1 subjects tend to invest in option 2 considerably more often than they invest

in option 1.9 Second, there is evidence of bad and good news being treated asymmetrical by both



                                                10
students and market professionals: while vertical comparisons yield some behavioral changes,

contract preferences vary considerably when considering horizontal comparisons.

       While casual inspection of the data provides an indication of the behavioral patterns

present in our data, a more rigorous statistical analysis is necessary to place confidence in the

results. Upon completing a more formal empirical analysis, we report a first result:

       Result 1: Student behavior favors the options model over the classical model.

Evidence for this result can be found both conditionally and unconditionally.               In an

unconditional sense, first consider the percentage of students choosing option 1 in B1 and C1:

21 and 19 percent, respectively. These percentages are significantly lower than the option 2

percentages (79 and 81), providing evidence that considerably more students follow the options

model than the classical model. Second, consider the effect of a comparative static change of the

lower payoff state level, L, and the upper payoff state level, H. If the BNP holds, then changes

in L should have an influence, while changes in H should have little impact.

       Table 2 provides summary empirical results from a series of Fishers exact tests exploring

the comparative static predictions of the options model. From the top panel results, we find that

variations in H do not significantly influence contract choice in any of the cases—we can never

reject the homogeneity null at conventional significance levels (for example, A1 versus C1 yields

a p = 0.2930). Alternatively, the lower panel in Table 2 highlights that for a variety of contract-

paired comparisons the choice of option 1 (option 2) varies considerably. The data pattern

indicates that L does have a significant influence on choice of contract for students.

       While these results are certainly consistent with predictions from the options model, little

has been done to control for the data dependencies (students provided more than one data point).



                                                 11
To control for the panel nature of the data set, we estimate a fixed effects logit model of the

form:

        Option1it = Xitβ+ eit,         eit ~N[0,1],                                  (4)

where Option1it equals unity if student i chose option 1 in choice t, and equals zero otherwise; Xit

includes treatment variables L and H, and the variance of eit must be normalized because it can

only be identified up to a scale factor.

        Estimation results are contained in column 1 of Table 3. Similar to insights gained from

the unconditional tests, we learn from this model that the level of the low payoff state, L, has a

significant influence on student choice. Indeed, the value of the low payoff state is statistically

significant at the p < .01 level. Alternatively, the level of the high payoff state, H, has a much

less important influence on decisions—a coefficient less than 1/3 the magnitude of the low

payoff state. These insights lend evidence in favor of the options model, but as previously noted

this behavior is also consistent with loss-averse student agents focusing in finer detail on the loss

domain than the gain domain. Our next result addresses this issue:

        Result 2: Market professional behavior is consonant with predictions from the options

        model.

Consider first the raw data as evidence for this result (Table 4 and Figure 1): while not as

distinct as students, the percentage of market professionals choosing option 1 in B1 and C1 (42

and 31 percent) is smaller than market professionals choosing option 2 (58 and 69 percent).

Next, consider Table 4, which provides summary empirical results using a series of Fishers exact

tests. Much like the student data, we find that variations in the high payoff state, H, do not

significantly influence contract choice in any of the cases, whereas the lower panel in Table 4



                                                 12
illustrates that for a number of contracts, variation in the low payoff state, L, influences contract

choice, though to a much lesser extent than we find for students.

       Column 2 in Table 3 provides regression evidence that reinforces this insight. These

results are obtained from estimating equation (4). The estimates suggest that the level of the low

payoff state, L, has a significant influence on market professionals’ choices (at the p < .01 level),

whereas the level of the high payoff state, H, does not have a significant influence at

conventional levels. Interestingly, the market professionals are seemingly less responsive to

payoff changes than students. For example, the coefficient estimate on the low payoff state in

the market professional’s model (0.49) is considerably smaller than the coefficient estimate in

the student model (0.72). Simply stated, market professionals do exhibit behavior consistent

with the BNP, but to a slightly lesser degree than students. Our preferred interpretation is that

this result suggests that loss aversion is more prevalent among the students than the market

professionals. Yet, this comparison can be pushed a bit further; doing so leads to our next result:

       Result 3: Students and market professionals behave differently.

Evidence for this result can be found in a comparison of the data across subject type. First, as

illustrated in Figure 1, students appear more loyal to the options model than market

professionals: in both B1 and C1, students choose option 1 considerably less than market

professionals (B1: 21 percent versus 42 percent; C1: 19 percent versus 31 percent). Second a

vertical and horizontal comparison of the bars in Figure 1 provides some evidence that there are

behavioral differences.

       To push the comparison of market professionals and students further, we estimate

equation (4) using H and L in Xit and include a fully interactive model by pooling the data.

Empirical estimates, which are contained in column 3 of Table 3, provide support for the ocular

differences observed in Figure 1.     The coefficient on Student*High Payoff is statistically

significant at conventional levels, suggesting that students are influenced much more by changes

in the high payoff than market professionals. This result sheds light on an important prediction

of the options model across subject type. Furthermore, we find that the coefficient on the

interaction Student*Low Payoff is statistically significant at the p < .10 level. This result

suggests that both students and market professionals are influenced by the downside investment

state, although students are more sensitive than professionals. As previously noted, while we

cannot pinpoint exactly why this latter result occurs, it is consonant with previous empirical

evidence on the degree of loss aversion across students and market professionals.10

       As a first robustness test it is important to note that contract A1 differs from all other

choices in that this contract has a negative expected value for round 1 investments. Figure 1

shows that this appears to have deterred students, but not market professionals, from investing in

round 1. As a consequence, for treatments with H=12, students might look more responsive than

market professionals to changes in L. While our preferred interpretation of the difference

between students and market professionals for sensitivities to changes in L is loss aversion, it

would be interesting to know if this result is solely driven by contract A1. We re-estimated

equation (4) excluding the A1 observations and the results are qualitatively similar to the

estimates in column 3 of Table 3.

       As a further robustness test, we explored survey information that was collected on-site at

CBOT at the same time the experiments were conducted. Specifically, we focused on CBOT

market professionals and personal trading experience. If loss aversion is attenuated among the

experienced traders, and it is one reason for the disparate results across professionals and

students, then in these data we should find that the less experienced traders are more influenced

                                                14
by the changes in L than the experienced traders.11 This is exactly what we find: while both

groups show evidence of BNP, the lesser experienced traders are more responsive.             This

represents suggestive evidence in favor of our working hypothesis.

B. Experiment in the Loss Domain

       A further robustness test is to explore data from the experiment purely over losses. In

Figure 2 we present the results in a parallel manner to those presented above. Figure 2 shows

that, consistent with the options model, there is evidence of bad and good news being treated

asymmetrical. Vertical comparisons yield some behavioral changes, but contract preferences

vary considerably when making horizontal comparisons. For example, whereas the proportion of

agents choosing option 1 in contract A3, B3, and C3, is 87%, 76%, and 83%, the proportion

choosing option 1 in the other contracts is much lower, between 4% and 19%. Alternatively,

vertical differences are generally less, never greater than a 12% difference.

       Even though the aggregate data are in accord with the options model, we can supplement

this result by examining individual choices, focusing on the number of subjects who maximize

expected value, and the number who are risk seeking over losses. The majority of subjects—42

or 75—or 56%, are expected value maximizers in each of the nine questions, effectively

following the options model exactly. Yet, similar to the results in List (2003; 2004; 2006), there

are some subjects who show hints of loss aversion: roughly 10% of agents nearly follow

expected value maximization, choosing a contract with the higher variance rather than the

contract with the lowest expected value in at least one decision.

IV.    Epilogue

       Investment theory has been one of the richest areas of research in economics over the

past several decades. Seminal advances by Bernanke, Dixit, Pindyck, and others in the 1980s

                                                 15
and 1990s served to question the empirical foundation of the standard neoclassical investment

model.     Scholars soon recognized that an important class of investment decisions within

economics invalidated predictions of the standard investment model.         In particular, when

investment is characterized by unrecoverable sunk costs, resolution of uncertainty through time,

and the ability to invest in the future as an alternative to investing today, the standard model

oftentimes provides erroneous prescriptions. In such cases, an options model more appropriately

guides investment choices.

         In this study we pit the standard model against the options model by exploring behavior

in simple investment games in the laboratory. We use both undergraduate students and market

professionals from the Chicago Board of Trade as experimental participants. Several insights

follow. Most importantly, there is evidence that behavior of both subject types is more in accord

with predictions from the options model than the classical investment model. In particular, there

is some evidence suggesting that both students and CBOT market professionals follow the “Bad

News Principle,” an important manifestation of the options model. Yet we find some evidence

that market professionals and students behave differently—students are much more responsive to

payoff changes than market professionals.

         If these laboratory results are a reliable indicator of behavior in the field, then they

represent an important advance in several dimensions. For example, they speak to a broad range

of positive and normative issues, including the correct policy to stimulate investment and the

appropriate normative modeling approach. Moreover, our research findings complement the

extant evidence that indicates intense market experience is important in reducing behavioral

anomalies.

    For exceptions, see the literature survey in Hubbard (1994). Recent examples that document

asymmetrical responses to bad versus good news in an empirical framework can be found in

Caballero and Pindyck (1992), Pindyck and Solimano (1993), and Svensson (2000).

    In the parlance of Harrison and List (2004), we conduct “artefactual field experiments.”

    While anomalous behavioral tendencies may be attenuated amongst professionals, Haigh and

List (2005) find an unexpected result in their study of Myopic Loss Aversion (MLA) amongst

traders and students. Using a design that extended Gneezy of Potters (1997), they find that

traders’ behavior is more consistent with MLA than students’ behavior. MLA rests upon the

assumption of 1) loss aversion and 2) mental accounting – how financial transactions are

grouped both cross-sectionally and temporally. Recent efforts have attempted to disentangle the

effect of mental accounting and loss aversion on MLA (see e.g., Langer and Weber, 2005, Hens

and Wohrman, 2006).          These studies have highlighted the sensitivity of the findings on

assumptions necessary to uncover MLA, and have shown that finding evidence of MLA does not

necessarily imply strong evidence of loss aversion by itself. Indeed, given that MLA is a

composition of factors, from the results of Haigh and List (2005) one cannot conclude that

professionals exhibit more or less loss aversion than students. As such, given that the current

experimental design does not have the temporal accounting exhibited in the MLA studies, we

maintain our working hypothesis that traders are likely to be less loss averse as illustrated by

other researchers outlined above.

contracts), B (B1, B2 and B3 contracts) and C (C1, C2, C3) varied. To provide variation across

H, we randomly allocated some subjects with contracts from A, B, and/or C.

    As a further robustness test, we presented a different group of 19 students with a set of 10

contracts (yielding 190 decisions) whereby one contract was binding to test if the number of

contract choices had any influence on the contract choice. Results are similar to those presented

below so we suppress further discussion.

    The findings that results are similar between several contracts being monetarily binding versus

one contract being binding is consistent with the notion of a reduction of compound lotteries

(consistent with expected utility theory). It also suggests we have no income effects.

    CBOT officials suggested that designing an experiment with an expected payout of $30 was a

good approximation as to what an average market professional might expect to earn for an

equivalent amount of time on the floor. In fact, for 30 minutes of their time the average market

professional earns approximately $47. The minimum amount earned by a market professional is

$31 and the maximum is $74. Among the market professionals, approximately 48% reported that

they traded commodities, 41% traded financial instruments, and 11% traded both. However,

because the different assets trade at different times in open outcry (e.g., most commodities trade

from 9:20 am to 1:15 pm central time and most financial assets from 7:20am to 2:00 pm central

time), the average floor trader would be working in the pit environment for approximately 5

hours and 5 minutes, suggesting that at the $30 rate per half an hour they would earn

approximately $128,000 per year (based on 250 trading days). This is considerably more than

the average amount the medium market professional reported earning to us ($40,000–$49,000).

    As discussed below, the number of subjects presented with contract packet A (A1, A2 and A3

contracts), B (B1, B2 and B3 contracts) and C (C1, C2, C3) varied. For example, 24 (18)

students (market professionals) were shown contract pack A, 33 (50) students (market


                                                 33
professionals) were shown contract pack B and 36 (16) students (market professionals) were

shown contract pack C. To obtain these decisions, we recruited 75 undergraduate students who

each made 3-6 decisions (279 total decisions) and 55 market professionals, who each made 3-6

decisions, providing a total of 252 market professional decisions.

     Both theories provide similar advice for each of the other contracts, including A1, since the

expected value is negative. While the majority of subjects follow the options model, a full 39%

of market professionals, for example, violate the options model in A1. As suggested by an

anonymous reviewer, when we analyze the proportions investing in option 2 after excluding

subjects that appear to follow basic rules (i.e., deleting those subjects that always invested in

round 1), just 8% of market professionals fail to follow the options model.                Thus, upon

jettisoning data from those agents who always picked option 1, we find results even more

consistent with the options model. These results are excluded to conserve space but are available

upon request.
10
     Overall, the results are also in line with the notion that students are more sensitive than traders

to parameter changes in the experimental environment. This is an interesting area for future

research.
11
     Since we cannot exogenously impose “loss aversion” on agents we stress caveat lector in this

case, as in the comparison between students and traders.
