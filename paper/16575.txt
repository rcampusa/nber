                                             ABSTRACT

We document and discuss the implications of a sharp increase in the regional dispersion of skill premia
in China in recent years. This has previously been little noted or discussed. We use three urban household
surveys for 1995, 2002, and 2007 and estimate skill premia at provincial and city levels. Results show
an increase in the skill premium across all regions between 1995 and 2002, but only coastal regions
show significant increases in skill premia between 2002 and 2007. For 2007, coastal regions also have
much higher within region wage inequality and this contributes more to overall urban wage inequality
than within region inequality of non-coastal regions. Using a fixed effects model at city level, we find
that ownership restructuring is a significant factor in driving up skill premia during the first period,
and that the ongoing process of China’s integration into the global economy plays a significant and
regionally concentrated role in the second period.

1. Introduction


The behavior of the skill premium (the wage differential between skilled and

unskilled labor) is central to an understanding of the evolution of inequality in urban

China. There has been a large amount of research trying to estimate the skill premium

over time, usually measured as the return to education (see Zhang et al. 2005; Li and

Ding 2003).1 How the skill premia has evolved within regions and how this may have

affected overall inequality is, however, largely neglected in literature.


      Here, we use three Chinese urban household surveys for 1995, 2002, and 2007 to

estimate skill premia at a provincial and city level for each year. We find substantial

yearly dispersion across regions but also find an increase in skill premia across all

regions between 1995 and 2002, while only coastal regions witness significant

increases in skill premia between 2002 and 2007.


      We then use the cross regional variation in skill premia within each year to

explore which factors account for the increase in skill premia. We construct a panel

data set at city level and use a fixed effects model. We find a significant relationship

between export activity and increases in skill premia. This is stronger in the period

between 2002 and 2007, suggesting that China’s entry into WTO and wider

integration into the global economy after 2001 may have played a significant role. In

the period between 1995 and 2002, institutional change (i.e. ownership restructuring)

seemingly plays key role in driving up the skill premium in the various regions. While

                                                                                                               2
there has been research that explores the relationship between inequality and China’s

globalization process (Wan et al. 2007, Zhang and Zhang 2002, Wei and Wu, 2003,

Cai et al. 2010), little of this studies the impacts of structural changes brought on by

China’s entry into WTO.


     We also suggest that investigating how the regional distribution of skill premia

changes can also help in providing a more complete understanding of changes in

urban wage inequality. If wage inequality is decomposed into between-region

inequality and within-region inequality, the within-region inequality can in turn be

expressed by a weighted average of the inequality for all regions. The various regions

in China show different inequality and hence different contributions to overall

(residual) wage inequality. We find that, by 2007, coastal regions have much higher

within region inequality (because of higher skill premia) and this contributes more to

overall urban wage inequality, a feature that seemingly has not yet been documented

in the literature.


     This paper is organized as follows. We discuss literature on skill premia in

section 2. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 reports estimates of skill premia,

their regional distribution and evolution overtime. Section 5 investigates the factors

underlying patterns of regional skill premia over time and also discusses the

implications for overall urban wage inequality. Section 6 concludes.




                                                                                      3
2. Why Is The Regional Distribution of Skill Premium Important in China?


      China is a large developing country in economic transition and its various

regions have very different levels of economic development (Schott 2006). Earlier

research has concluded that regional disparity is a major contributor to overall

inequality (see Gustafsson et al. 2008). The literature has, however, neglected the

feature that the relative wages of skilled and unskilled labor may be different across

regions.


      Given the large amount of effort devoted in previous literature to trying to

estimate skill premia, the extension to include the regional dimension is a natural

further step. It seems well established that wage determination mechanisms were

significantly different between different ownership types of firms in the 1990s, with

private sector firms sharing a higher skill premium (Meng 2000, Dong and Bowles

2002, Xing 2008, Zhang et al. 2005). Meanwhile, different regions had a different

firm ownership mix. In 2008 for example, the registered employment share in SOEs is

around 30% for most coastal provinces (Zhejiang (27%) and Fujian (32%) for

instance). For some other provinces such as Jiangxi, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu,

Qinghai, the shares are still above 70% (NBS, 2009) 2. The above implies that

different regions have different skill premia.


      Another reason for regional unevenness is differential exposure to trade activity.

The policy of opening up was first implemented in the east and led to rapid growth of

2
  These shares are calculated using the number of staff and workers in state owned units divided by the total
number of registered employments. All numbers are for urban areas (NBS, 2009: table 4-8). Taking into account
those not registered, the SOE shares may overestimate the real shares.
                                                                                                                4
exports and FDI inflows. In 1995, the average share of exports in GDP in coastal

provinces was 32%, while that for non-coastal provinces was below 7%.3 China

experienced a sharp increase in trade activity in a relatively short period of time after

its entry into WTO (Wan et al. 2007, Branstetter and Lardy 2006), and most of the

increase was in coastal regions. By 2007, the average export share in GDP in coastal

provinces had reached 45%, while that for non-coastal provinces was still below 8%.

Along with rapid export growth, China’s exports were becoming more sophisticated

with resources moving from agriculture and textiles into machinery, electronics, and

assembly (Schott 2006, Amiti and Freund 2008, Wang and Wei 2008). This upgrading

of the export sector increased the demand for and relative wages of more skilled labor

in coastal regions.


      The above regional patterns reflect in part the policies of the Chinese

government. In the earlier reform period, the central government offered not only

preferential policies to but also more investment to coastal regions to encourage

exports and attract FDI. The five Special Economic Zones (SEZs)4, for example, are

all in coastal regions (Wang and Wei 2008). In the late 1990s however, because of the

widening regional gap, preferential policies were more often given to the central and

western regions. Many policies were also location specific, such as policies to

developing the Pudong New District in Shanghai, the Binhai New District in Tianjin,

  Coastal provinces include Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Hainan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shangdong, Shanghai,
Tianjin, and Zhejiang. Non-coastal provinces include Anhui, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Heilongjiang,
Hubei, Hunan, Jilin, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Tibet, Xinjiang,
Yunnan, and Chongqing. Export shares are first calculated for each province, and then averaged for coastal and
non-coastal regions. The shares for 2007 are calculated the same way.

and the more recent strategy to revitalize the Old Industry Base of the Northeast.

These often involve preferential policies by the central government and more

investment in infrastructure.


     Finally but by no means the least, several features of China’s labor market have

made this process less effective, although labor migration still tends to equalize

relative wage gaps among regions. In particular, the Hukou system is still a major

barrier to regional mobility of labor. Many locally provided public services such as

health care and schooling are still not available to residents without local urban

Hukou. This significantly raises migration costs (see Cai et al. 2009, Xing 2010 for a

more detailed description of China’s institutional arrangement of Hukou system). The

high price of housing is another factor preventing people moving from low skill

premium locations to high skill premium locations.


     All of the above are also often cited as reasons for growing regional disparity in

income levels, instead of changes in the relative wages of skilled and unskilled labor.

Existing literature has largely neglected the possibility that these regional imbalances

(in trade policies for example) may have different impacts on individuals with

different skills. In the same spirit, mobility restrictions such as Hukou also have

different effects on skilled and unskilled labor. As skilled workers demand more

permanent positions, they are more sensitive to the availability of housing, social

security coverage, and other public services.


     The neglect of regional dispersion of skill premia in previous literature is partly


                                                                                      6
due to limitations of data. Most existing research emphasizes regional disparities

based on aggregate data, which makes the discussion of skill premium difficult. Also,

while there is usually a clear relationship between economic development and average

regional income (the regional income level is often used as proxy for its economic

development level), the relationship between relative wages and economic

development is not unambiguous.




                                                                                    7
3. Data and Summary Statistics


     Here, we use data from three China Household Income Project (CHIP) surveys

for 1995, 2002, and 2007 to estimate the regional dispersion of skill premia over time.

The CHIP data is known for its high quality and national representativeness. In 1995,

2002, and 2007, the urban survey covered 11, 12, and 16 provinces, autonomous

regions, or municipalities, which also included a wide variety of regions in terms of

geography and economic development. Although this is not formally constructed as a

panel data set, the provinces and the cities covered by these surveys do not change

much, allowing comparisons between different years. In 1995 and 2002, the survey

collected information from Beijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei,

Guangdong, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Guansu. The only difference after

1997 is that Chongqing is separated from Sichuan Province as a municipality. More

provinces are included in the 2007 survey (the new municipalities or provinces are

Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan) while those in the previous surveys are

retained. We can thus construct a panel data at city level (though unbalanced), which

allows us to control for time-invariant unobservables.


     In using the CHIP data, we retain information on all males aged 22 to 60, and on

females aged 22 to 55. We keep only those over 22 because according to China’s

education system, people typically finish college education at age 22. The age

thresholds of 60 and 55 for males and females reflect current arrangements for

retirement age. We use labor incomes of urban workers. There are two parts to labor


                                                                                     8
income: regular wages and subsidies and other labor income. All income data are

deflated to 1995 RMB prices using the national CPI.


    Table 1 provides summary statistics, which give a sense of the evolution of

China’s labor market from 1995 to 2007. Both the average ages and education levels

increased continuously over these years. In 1995, the average age of the urban

working population was 39.5 years old. It increased to 41.5 in 2002 and then further

to 42.3 in 2007. In terms of education, the average years of schooling increased from

10.8 in 1995 to 11.3 in 2002 and to 12.8 in 2007. Looking at different education levels,

a more detailed pattern of education expansion emerges. The share of the population

with tertiary education increased significantly between 2002 and 2007. Columns 1 to

3 in Table 2 report the share of skilled workers by province. Skilled labor includes

those with college degrees (3 or 4 years) or above and those with technical school

degrees. Those with high school degrees or below are classified as unskilled workers.

As a whole, the fraction of skilled workers increased from 40.7% in 1995 to 43.6% in

2002 and to 53% in 2007, with significant differences among regions.


     The change in the shares of labor force for different firm ownership largely

reflects the restructuring process in urban China. In the mid 1990s, nearly all the

workforce was employed in the public sector of various forms. By 2007, however,

that share had decreased sharply to 62%. On the other hand, workers in the private

sector increased significantly from negligible (2%) in 1995 to nearly 40% in 2007.


    Table 2 reports income levels, inequality measures, and the skilled worker shares


                                                                                      9
for different provinces for different years. There were significant increases in income

between 1995 and 2002 and between 2002 and 2007. Annual average wages increased

from 6100 Yuan in 1995 to 9530 Yuan in 2002 and further to 18253 Yuan in 2007,

nearly tripling in 12 years. Data also indicate that both income levels and income

growth were unbalanced across provinces, with coastal regions having much higher

income levels and growth rates.


     In terms of Gini coefficients (column 4-6), there was a significant increase in

inequality for every province between 1995 and 2002. On the whole, the Gini

coefficient increased significantly from 0.296 to 0.372. For the period 2002-2007,

increases in Gini coefficients were not as large as those in the first period, with the

whole sample Gini increasing from 0.372 in 2002 to 0.407 in 2007. But the change

was different for different regions. For hinterland provinces, the Gini coefficients

even declined (Shanxi and Henan for example), while for coastal provinces, Gini

coefficients kept rising (Jiangsu for example). We also provide generalized entropy

measures of inequality with sensitivity parameter 2 (hereafter GE(2)), which can be

decomposed by region. They show similar patterns to the Gini coefficients. The shares

of the skilled worker increased for most provinces, and there were more increases

between 2002 and 2007 than between 1995 and 2002. The pace of increase was

different for different province.




                                                                                     10
4. The Regional Distribution of Skill Premia (Returns to Education)


4.1 Wage Levels of Skilled and Unskilled Workers and Skill Premium


     Average wage levels for skilled and unskilled labor and for all workers by

province are reported in Figure 1. To show regional differentials, we use the export

share in GDP as the source of regional variation in the horizontal axis. Trade activity

varies a lot across regions, and is highly correlated with regional economic

development levels. Changes in trading volume are also a major potential explanatory

variable for the changing regional distribution of skill premia.


     We concentrate on the income gap between skilled and unskilled labor (a crude

measure of skill premium), and how these gaps differ among different provinces and

how the pattern evolves over time (see Figure 1). In the mid 1990s, the income gaps

were moderate, with the skilled earning higher than the unskilled across different

provinces. In 2002, the income gap for almost all provinces increased significantly,

with some indications that the skilled-unskilled gap in coastal provinces was larger. In

2007, the skilled-unskilled gap in coastal provinces was still growing while in

non-coastal regions, no such trend appeared. Thus skilled workers in coastal regions

have higher wages relative to unskilled workers than their non-coastal counterparts.

Regional disparity for unskilled workers also exists. This disparity is not as noticeable

as for skilled workers and for unskilled workers in previous years.


     Results in Figure 1 indicate that there was a significant increase in the skill

premium for all provinces in the late 1990s, but the changes in skill premia for

                                                                                       11
different provinces show different patterns for the period 2002 to 2007. Coastal

regions face an increase in the skill premium, while in non-coastal regions the skill

premium did not increase.


     These results do not control for some key factors. First, the skilled-unskilled

classification does not take into account a number of individual characteristics. For

example, experience may be related to accumulation of human capital (both general

and specific), and if coastal and non-coastal provinces have a different age (and

therefore experience) structure, the gap between skilled and unskilled may be partly

due to the different age structure of different regions. The skill premium may be

influenced by ownership structure, industry composition, and other factors. In

particular, if rent accrues to ownership or industry affiliation, the skilled-unskilled gap

may be heavily a reflection of different regions having different ownership or

industrial structures.


     Non-work rates may also be different in different regions. When samples with

wage incomes are not selected from the working age population at random, the skill

premiums using the observed data are potentially subject to selection bias. These

concerns can be addressed by using Heckman’s two-step selection model (Heckman,

1979).


     For the first two problems, we control for experience, gender, ownership, and

industry in the regressions of wage equations, and focus on the coefficients for the

skilled-unskilled dummy. To correct for selection bias, we include an inverse Mills


                                                                                         12
ratio in regressions.


     We thus use regression equations as follows:


    ln (WAGE ) = β 0 + β1 * SKILLED + β 2 * EXPER + β 3 * EXPERSQ + γX + ρσλ + ε   (1)


where SKILLED is a dummy variable indicating that an individual has tertiary

education degree (3 or 4 year college or above) or technical school degree. Vector X

includes a gender dummy, ownership dummies, and industry dummies. λ is the

inversed Mills ratio. ρ is the correlation coefficient between the error terms of the

selection model and the wage determination model. σ is the standard deviation of the

error term for the wage determination model. In the implicit selection model which is

not written down explicitly, the regressors include all those in the wage determination

model. We also include the employment rate (one minus non-work rate) as an

instrumental variable. A Heckman two step procedure is then used for each province

separately to estimate regional skill premia.


    Table 3a reports our results. For the earlier period between 1995 and 2002, the

skill premium increases sharply across all regions. This is consistent with existing

literature that documents an overall increasing trend in rising returns to education (Liu

et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2005). Less well documented is the large variation across

regions in the skill premium. In 1995, the skill premium in Guangdong is the highest

(0.366), while that in Jiangsu is the lowest (0.070). The second lowest is Beijing

(0.108). In 2002, Henan became the province with the lowest skill premium (0.240),

Gansu became the one with highest skill premium (0.470), followed by Liaoning

                                                                                         13
(0.417), Sichuan (0.410), Chongqing (0.405), and Guangdong (0.368). Gansu and

Sichuan are western provinces, and for these there seems no clear relationship

between skill premia and economic development. The estimation of skill premia by

region is thus important for describing the evolution of inequality between 2002 and

2007. For central and western provinces, there are clear signs that the skill premium

stopped rising or even declined (Shanxi, Chongqing, and Sichuan for example). For

coastal regions skill premia kept rising. This pattern in results is consistent with both

deepening globalization and educational expansion.


4.2 Return to Years of Schooling and Returns to Different Education Levels


       Dividing the labor force only into skilled and unskilled categories is a crude

simplification. Along with educational expansion in the late 1990s, there is significant

composition change within skilled worker groups. Estimated skill premium may thus

be contaminated by composition change. We therefore estimate returns to years of

schooling and returns to various levels of educations using two different models:


        ln (WAGE ) = β0 + β1 * SCHOOLING + β 2 * EXPER + β3 * EXPERSQ + γX + ρσλ + ε   (2)


        ln (WAGE ) = β 0 + ∑ γ i * EDU i + β 2 * EXPER + β3 * EXPERSQ + γX + ρσλ + ε   (3)
                             i




In (2) SCHOOLING is years of formal schooling, and in (3) EDUi are dummies for

various education levels5. Results for these models are reported in the remaining

columns of Table 3, and largely speaking, the patterns of these results are consistent

with our results above. For the returns to years of schooling, the most important

5
    For space reasons, only college premia (or returns to college) are reported.

                                                                                             14
feature is the large regional variation in 2007. One year of schooling is associated

with a 10-14% increase in wages in coastal regions, while in other provinces returns

are well below 10%.


     Estimation of skill premia by education level also shows some other important

details in the evolution of returns. First, most of the increases in returns to education

are concentrated in higher levels of education, especially college education. Second,

coastal regions witnessed rising returns for almost every tertiary education level.

Returns to education also decreased significantly for high school graduates. Finally,

we estimate skill premia at a city level. The distributions of skill premia are reported

in Figure 2. The patterns are similar to what is observed at provincial level. A

prominent feature of Figure 2 is the larger dispersion in 2007. In particular, the upper

half of the skill premium distribution has much larger densities than in previous years,

a phenomenon already emphasized.




                                                                                       15
5. Explanation of Results and Their Implications


5.1 Factors That Influence the Evolution of the Regional Skill Premium


     To assess the importance of various factors behind the evolution of regional skill

premia, we estimate the following fixed effects model:


SKILLPREM it = β 0 + β1 * EXPGDPit + β 2 * SOEit + β3 * SKILLEDit +γXit + ui + ε it   (4)


     In this model, SKILLPREM is the estimated skill premium or return to years of

schooling, and subscript i refers to different cities. We also estimate inequality

measures and skill premia at city level to more fully explore regional differentials.

Because the sample size for individuals is smaller at city level than provincial level,

we only estimate skill premia and return to years of schooling instead of the return to

different levels of education. Once we obtain these measures, we use them as

dependent variables in the fixed effects regressions.


     EXPGDP is the ratio of export to GDP. We use the ratio EXPGDPit to measure

the openness of a particular region i at a particular time t. ui is a time invariant

unobservable individual regional characteristic. SOEit is the share of the labor force in

state owned enterprises. SKILLEDit is the share of skilled labor in the labor force.

Using a fixed effects model, we can control for regional unobserved characteristics.

We use only two periods of time in each regression, and in this case a fixed effects

model is equivalent to using a first differences method.


     Results are reported in Table 4. For the period 1995 to 2002, the openness


                                                                                        16
variable (Export/GDP) has a positive but insignificant effect on skill premia, and the

effect on the return to education is significant at a 10% level but negative. The

coefficients are 0.091 and -0.047 respectively. For the period 2002 to 2007, the

coefficients on openness variable become positive and significant at a 1% level. A

10% increase in export share was associated with an 11% increase in the skill

premium and a 2% increase in the return to schooling. The changes in the coefficients

on export variable indicate a structural change following China’s entry into WTO.


    Equally interesting are the coefficients for SOE. Between 1995 and 2002, the

coefficients of SOE are both significantly negative, which means that the relative

reduction in the size of the SOE sector played a major role in the increase in skill

premium. This is only true for the first period. Between 2002 and 2007, none of the

SOE coefficients are significant. These results are consistent with the timing of

China’s ownership restructuring process, and they support the earlier results due to

Zhang et al (2005) and Liu et al, (2010), while also indicating that their conclusions

need revision.


5.2 Skill premia and Inequality


    One implication of the evolution of regional skill premium distributions is for

regional inequality. In Figure 3, we plot the relationship between skill premia and

wage inequality at a provincial level. In 1995, both skill premia and wage inequality

at provincial level were low. Between 1995 and 2002, there is an increase in skill

premia for all regions. As a consequence, inequality within regions increased


                                                                                    17
dramatically. Between 2002 and 2007, the dispersion of skill premium across regions

also grew as did inequality across different regions. In 2007, the relationship between

skill premia and inequality became more positive and significant. In Table 5, we

regress both regional Gini coefficients and GE(2) on skill premia in different years. In

all these regressions, the coefficients on skill premia are positive. But in year 1995

and 2002, they are relatively small and insignificant. In 2007, however, the

coefficients are higher and significant at a 1% significance level.


     To assess the implications of the evolution of regional skill premium, we can

decompose the overall wage inequality (GE(2), which is regionally decomposable)

into between- and within-province inequality (see Table 6). One prominent feature of

urban wage inequality is that within regional inequality plays a progressively

important role. In 1995, the overall and within inequalities measured as GE(2) are

0.18 and 0.14. During the period between 1995 and 2002, almost all of the increase in

overall wage inequality (from 0.18 to 0.28) comes from within region inequality

change (from 0.14 to 0.24) and between region inequality even decreased slightly.

Again, most of the inequality change between 2002 and 2007 (from 0.27 to 0.36)

comes from within region inequality (0.24 to 0.31).


     The decomposition exercises in panel A of Table 6 miss the important feature

that coastal regions have much higher within region inequality than non-coastal

regions. Therefore in panels B and C we perform the same exercises for non-coastal

and coastal regions separately. Results suggest that coastal regions have much higher

within region inequality. Between 2002 and 2007 for example, while the within region
                                                                                      18
inequality in non-coastal regions increased by 0.03 from 0.19 to 0.22, that in coastal

regions increased by 0.07 from 0.26 to 0.33. In summary, the decomposition exercise

suggests a major role for within regional inequality in overall inequality, and that

within region inequality in coastal regions played an even larger role than for

non-coastal regions.

6. Conclusions


     This paper uses three Chinese household surveys for 1995, 2002, and 2007, to

estimate both the levels and changes in skill premia for different provinces. We use

them to estimate regional dispersion in skill premia. Although there is an increase in

skill premia in nearly all provinces between 1995 and 2002, we do not find such

increase between 2002 and 2007. Data from the 2007 survey indicate a strong positive

relationship between openness and skill premia, with coastal regions having much

higher skill premia than those in non-coastal regions. We interpret the results between

2002 and 2007 as the result of China’s deepening globalization after entry into the

WTO.
