           This paper     focuses     on how changes       in the economic       and regulatory     environment       have


affected    production     costs and product        characteristics     in the automobile     industry.      We estimate

“hedonic     cost finctions”       that relate product-level    costs to their characteristics.      Then we examine


how this cost surface has changed            over time and how these changes           relate to changes     in gas prices


and in emission     standard    regulations.     We also briefly consider the related questions           of how changes

in automobile     characteristics,     and in the rate of patenting,      are related to regulations       and gas prices.
