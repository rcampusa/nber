Why Have Business Cycle Fluctuations Become Less Volatile?

JEL No. E3

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper shows that a standard Real Business Cycle model driven by productivity shocks can
successfully account for the 50 percent decline in cyclical volatility of output and its components,
and labor input that has occurred since 1983. The model is successful because the volatility of
productivity shocks has also declined significantly over the same time period. We then investigate
whether the decline in the volatility of the Solow Residual is due to changes in the volatility of some
other shock operating through a channel that is absent in the standard model. We therefore develop
a model with variable capacity and labor utilization. We investigate whether government spending
shocks, shocks that affect the household's first order condition for labor, and shocks that affect the
household's first order condition for saving can plausibly account for the change in TFP volatility
and in the volatility of output, its components, and labor. We find that none of these shocks are able
to do this. This suggests that successfully accounting for the post-1983 decline in business cycle
volatility requires a change in the volatility of a productivity-like shock operating within a standard
growth model.

1. Introduction
          Kydland and Prescott (1982) established that productivity shocks could account for most

post-World War II business cycle volatility. Business cycle volatility was roughly constant up

through the period studied by Kydland and Prescott, but has changed substantially since then.

Kim and Nelson (1999), McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000) and Stock and Watson (2002) all

identify a large and statistically significant permanent decline in U.S. GDP volatility beginning

in the first quarter of 1984.

          This paper examines this decreased volatility through the lens of neoclassical business

cycle theory. We focus our analysis on changes in the variance of the Hodrick-Prescott cyclical

component of real GDP, its components, labor input, and total factor productivity (TFP). All of

these variances are about 30-50 percent smaller in the post-1983 period compared to the 1955-83

period.

          Within the neoclassical framework, changes in cyclical volatility are the result of either

changes in the volatility of the exogenous shocks that are fed into the model, and/or changes in

the structure of the model that maps the exogenous shocks into the endogenous variables. We

focus our analysis on changes in the exogenous shock volatility.

          We first evaluate the impact of changes in the volatility of TFP shocks. We find that the

volatility of this shock declines about 50 percent after 1983. We find that this volatility change

reduces the volatility of output and its components, and labor input also by 50 percent in the

Hansen (1985) model. This finding suggests that lower productivity shock volatility can be a

significant factor underlying lower cyclical volatility. Some economists will question this

finding, however, because they argue that TFP shocks are not productivity shocks per se, but

rather the endogenous consequence of other shocks operating through unmeasured capital and




                                                   1
labor utilization. This “mis-measurement” view of TFP would suggest that the change in TFP

volatility is due to the change in the volatility of some other shock, combined with unmeasured

changes in factor utilization. We therefore pursue this possibility using the model of Burnside et

al. (1996) that features both variable capital and labor utilization. We follow Chari, Kehoe, and

McGrattan (2002, 2006) and Cole and Ohanian (2002) who focus on three other shocks for

understanding fluctuations in the growth model: a shock to the household’s static first order

condition, a shock to the household’s dynamic first order condition, and an additive shock to the

resource constraint, such as government spending shocks.

       We test whether changes in the volatility of these other shocks can account for both the

change in TFP volatility and the change in the volatility of the output, its components and labor.

Our main finding is that none of these shocks do this. The volatility of the static preference

shocks is roughly unchanged between the two periods. The volatility of the shock to the resource

constraint changes significantly, but this change is quantitatively unimportant for the volatility of

TFP and the other variables. The volatility of the shock to the Euler equation changes

significantly, but generates business cycle statistics that are grossly counterfactual. We conclude

that the most promising candidate for understanding lower post-1983 business cycle volatility is

a shock that operates like TFP in a standard stochastic growth model.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature. Section 3 presents

changes in volatility of macroeconomic variables and the impact of lower TFP volatility. Section

4 studies the change in TFP volatility in the model with variable capital and labor utilization.

Section 6 concludes.

2. Connection with the Literature
       The existing literature offers several explanations for the fall in business cycle volatility,

though currently there is no generally accepted explanation of lower cyclical volatility. Kahn,

McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2002) argue that the “information revolution” has changed the

way shocks are propagated. In particular, they argue that the volatility reduction resulting

largely from improvements in inventory management techniques, using a model that differs

substantially from the standard neoclassical model. Their approach thus focuses on changes in a

specific model’s propagation mechanism with a focus on inventory management. More recently,

Campbell and Hercowitz (2005) argue that financial reforms of the early 1980’s have changed

the propagation mechanism by relaxing collateral constraints on household borrowing. Other

authors, for example Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000), maintain that improved monetary policy

since the early 1980’s has stabilized the U.S. economy. Blanchard and Simon (2001) argue that

changes in inventory management techniques, monetary policy, and also the volatility of

government spending all have been significant contributing factors to lower volatility.

       In contrast, Stock and Watson (2002) conduct a comprehensive statistical examination

and find that the volatility reduction is primarily due to “good luck.” That is, there has been a

fall in the variance of the structural shocks that impact the economy, rather than improved

monetary policy or improved inventory control techniques. Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2002)

also conclude that lower volatility is largely a matter of “good luck” in the post-1983 period.

Finally, Gordon (2005) also finds that the reduced variance of shocks was the dominant source of

reduced business cycle volatility. We accept the “good luck” conclusions of these papers, that

the shocks hitting the U.S. economy since 1984 have been smaller. Our paper complements these

latter three studies by providing an assessment of the contribution of lower shock volatility to the




                                                  3
business cycle using a DSGE framework. Our DSGE analysis allows us to make progress on

understanding which shocks are important for the change in cyclical volatility, and on

understanding the structural mechanisms through which these shocks operate. We therefore

develop a simple RBC model and we evaluate how changes in the volatility of different shocks

affect business cycle volatility. Comin and Phillipon (2005) argue that microeconomic volatility

(among listed corporations) has increased recently, and Phillipon (2003) argues that increases in

competition can jointly account for higher microeconomic volatility and lower macroeconomic

volatility.1 The closest study to ours is by Leduc and Sill (2005) who study the contribution of

TFP shocks and monetary shocks to lower volatility. They find that changes in monetary policy

are relatively unimportant.


3. Volatility in a Basic Real Business Cycle Model
         In Table 1, we present a measure of business cycle volatility for a variety of U.S.

aggregate time series.2 Here, the business cycle is defined by deviations from a Hodrick-Prescott

trend. We report the percent standard deviation of quarterly data from 1955:3 to 2003:2 in the

first column of the table. In the second and third columns, the same statistic is reported for the

pre-1984 and post-1984 subperiods. In the last column, the ratio of the volatility measure for the

late subperiod to the early subperiod is given.


1
 We do not address the possible increase in firm-level volatility, as this is beyond the scope of this paper. It is worth
noting, however, that within our framework, improved access to asset markets would tend to increase
microeconomic volatility. There is evidence that asset markets have become more efficient (see Krueger and Perri
(2006)).
2
  We use quarterly data from 1955:3 – 2003:2. The beginning date is the first for which hours based on the
household survey are available. Data has been logged before applying the Hodrick-Prescott filter. All National
Income and Product Account data is in 1996 dollars. Hours (HS) is total hours worked based on data from the
Current Population Survey and available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. The BLS data has been
seasonally adjusted prior to computing our volatility statistics. Hours (ES) is based on data from establishment
payrolls and is also available on the BLS website. Measured total factor productivity (TFP) is computed as
 log(TFPt ) = log(GNPt ) − .6log( Hourst ) .


                                                           4
        This table shows that volatilities of all series in the later subperiod are significantly

smaller than in the earlier subperiod. Output and TFP are about half as volatile, while the labor

input is 70 percent as volatile. This fall in volatility of the labor input is essentially identical in

both hours worked measured using the household survey as well as hours from the establishment

survey. A component of GNP on which we focus particular attention is consumption of services

and nondurables, since this corresponds conceptually to consumption in a stochastic growth

model. Similarly, consumer durables plus fixed investment corresponds to investment in our

theoretical model. We find that investment is 58 percent as volatile, and consumption 65

percent, in the later subperiod as compared with the early subperiod. Government spending is 55

percent as volatile. Overall, these statistics show that volatility declined 30-50 percent in these

variables after 1983.

        We first assess the impact of lower TFP volatility on output and its components, and

labor. We do this using the following real business cycle model. The equilibrium of this model

economy is characterized by the solution to a social planner’s problem (where the initial capital

stock, k0 , is given):


                               ∞
                                                         log(1 − h )
                 max E               β t log ct + θ ht
                 kt +1 , ht
                              t =0                           h

subject to

                 ct + kt +1 = e zt kt1−α htα + (1 − δ )kt

                 zt +1 = ρ1 zt + ε1,t +1 , ε1 ~ N (0, σ 12 )

        In this economy, labor is indivisible (individuals work h or not at all), and the labor

market allows trade in employment lotteries—contracts that specify a probability of working h

hours (see Hansen (1985) for details). In this problem, zt is the log of TFP, ct is consumption,

and ht is aggregate hours worked. The log of TFP follows a first order autoregressive process.

        The model is calibrated in way that is standard in the real business cycle literature (see

Cooley and Prescott (1995)). In particular, the value of the discount factor, β , is determined so

that the average quarterly k/y ratio for the model is the same as in U.S. data. The depreciation

rate is calibrated to the average investment to output ratio and the reduced form preference

             θ log(1 − h )
parameter,                      , is chosen so that individuals spend on average 31 percent of their
                   h

substitutable time working. The parameter α is set equal to average labor’s share in the U.S.

national income accounts, and ρ1 is set close to one in order to match the autocorrelation of




                                                                  7
measured TFP. These criteria lead us to assign the following parameter values: β = .988, δ =

          θ log(1 − h )
0.018,                    = 2.547, α = 0.6, and ρ1 = .95 .
                 h

           We now use the model to quantify the contribution of changes in TFP volatility to the

volatility of the other variables. We first calculate the volatility of the endogenous variables

when σ 1 is set to its value over the entire 1955:1 – 2003:2 period. We then calculate the

volatilities for the endogenous variables for the 1955-1983 subperiod when σ 1 is calibrated so

that TFP volatility in the model is equal to actual TFP volatility in that subperiod , and we

analogously do this for the 1984-2003 subperiod. The TFP volatilities we calibrate to are listed in

Table 13.

           The results of this experiment are shown in Table 2.

           The fall in the volatility of GNP and other aggregate variables is not a puzzle from

perspective of “pure” real business cycle theory. In addition, because there is only one shock in

    We use the establishment survey measure of hours worked for calibrating TFP in our model.

this model and the propagation mechanism is close to linear, the volatility of all variables falls by

the same amount. This would not be the case if we introduced additional shocks to the model.

         Several researchers, however, [Basu (1996) and Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo

(1995)] have argued that aggregate procyclical TFP fluctuations are due primarily to unmeasured

changes in factor utilization. According to these studies, once unmeasured utilization is taken

into account, there is little in the way of exogenous technology shocks to be accounted for by

exogenous shocks. Hence, in the next section, we consider the impact of changes in the

volatility of shocks other than technology shocks in a model with endogenous movements in TFP

due to labor hording and capital utilization.

         In particular, we consider the importance of an additive shock to the resource constraint

(government spending shock), a shock that affects the labor-leisure tradeoff, and a shock that

affects the savings-consumption tradeoff. Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2004) show that a large

number of structural shocks (monetary shocks) are equivalent to one of these shocks in a growth

model.


4. Volatility in Model with Endogenous Factor Utilization
         In this section, we use the model of Burnside and Eichenbaum (1996) to study the impact

of changes in the size of alternative shocks on business cycle volatility in a model with

unmeasured factor utilization. This model incorporates two sources of factor utilization in a real

business cycle model similar to the one studied in the previous section. These include labor

hording as modeled in Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (1993) and capital utilization as

modeled in Greenwood, Hercowitz and Huffman (1988) and Taubman and Wilkinson (1970).

         The equilibrium of this model is characterized by the solution to a social planner’s

problem like the one in the previous section except with two additional choice variables: labor



                                                  9
effort, e, and the rate of capital utilization, u. Labor hording is introduced by assuming that

employment ( nt ) is chosen before period t shocks are observed. The remaining choices ( kt +1 , ut ,

and et ) are made after the shocks are observed. The planner’s problem is the following subject

to this timing restriction:

        This model economy is subjected to four types of stochastic shocks which we denote as

z1 to z4 . The first is the same technology shock as in the previous section. The second shock is

an additive shock to the resource constraint. Following Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992), we

measure this as a government spending shock. The third shock is a preference shock that distorts

the labor-leisure decision. The importance of this class of shocks for business cycles has been

argued by Hall (1997) and a number of others. The last is a shock to the subjective discount

factor and introduces a stochastic wedge in the intertemporal Euler equation.




                                                                              10
           Capital utilization, ut , affects both production and the rate of depreciation. The higher

capital is utilized in production, the larger is the rate of depreciation. As discussed in Burnside

and Eichenbaum (1996), this feature and labor hoarding have important implication for the way

shocks are propagated.

           The model is calibrated in a similar manner as in the previous section. In particular, the

value of β is chosen to target the k/y ratio, φ chosen to target the i/y ratio, and g chosen to

target the g/y ratio. The parameter θ is chosen so that the average time devoted to market

activities, nt (ω + h ) , is equal to 0.31 and γ is chosen so that the average utilization rate is 0.9.4

The length of a work shift, h , is set so that effort (e) is 1 in steady state. Labor’s share is set

equal to 0.6 and the fraction of time spent commuting ( ω ) is set equal to 6/98. The

autoregressive coefficients for the shock processes are ρ1 = .95 ; ρ 2 = .98 ; ρ3 = .99 , and

ρ 4 = .99 .

           Our goal in the following three experiments is to determine if changes in the volatility of

(i) the government spending shock, (ii), the static preference shock, and (iii), the intertemporal

preference shock, can plausibly account for both the change in the volatility of TFP and the

change in the volatility of output and its components, and labor. We begin with the government

spending shock. The volatility of government spending in the data falls by almost half after

1983. To measure the impact of reducing the volatility of government spending, we simulate the

model as follows, setting σ 3 = σ 4 = 0 :

           1. Set σ 1 and σ 2 to match the volatility of TFP and government spending for the entire

                1955-2003 period shown in Table 1.

    The cyclical properties of the model do not depend on the value of the parameter γ .

         2. Keep σ 1 at the same value, but choose σ 2 to match the volatility of g during the early

            subperiod.

         3. Keep σ 1 at the same value, but choose σ 2 to match the volatility of g during the late

            subperiod.

         The percent standard deviations associated with each of these parameterizations are given

in the first three columns of Table 3.

         The key finding from Table 3 is that, although government spending is 55 percent as

volatile in the second subperiod as the first, this has relatively little effect on the volatility of any

of the endogenous variables. Thus the impact of an additive resource constraint shock is

quantitatively much too small to account for changes in the volatility of the other variables in the

model.




                                                   12
        Perhaps a reduction in the variance of the preference shock will have a more important

quantitative effect on business cycle volatility. In order to conduct an empirically relevant

experiment, we need to calibrate σ 3 . To do so, we use the first order condition for choosing et

(labor effort), which can be written as follows:

                                     yt         θt et
                                         =                                                     (1)
                                  ct nt h α (1 − ω − het )

The volatility of the left hand side can be computed from data, but the right hand side is a

function of unobservable effort. We choose σ 3 so that simulations of the model imply volatility

of the left hand side of this equation that is the same as that measured in U.S. data.

        More precisely, Table 4 gives results from the following experiment

(assume σ 2 = σ 4 = 0 ):

        1. Set σ 1 and σ 3 to match the volatility of TFP and the “theta target” for the entire

            1955-2003 period shown in Table 1.

        2. Keep σ 1 at the same value, but choose σ 3 to match the volatility of the target during

            the early subperiod.

        3. Keep σ 1 at the same value, but choose σ 3 to match the volatility of the target during

            the late subperiod.

       Table 4 shows very little change in business cycle volatility from the calibrated change in

the variance of the taste shock. The volatility in the model variables falls between 4 and 7

percent, compared to the 30-50 percent declines in the data. This finding that the change in the

shock volatility cannot account for the volatility changes in the other variables is similar to the

first case of the resource constraint shock in table 3, but for a very different reason. Here, the

volatility of the left hand side of (1) falls by only 7 percent from the early to the late subperiod.

This implies relatively little change in the value of   σ 3 . If the variance of the left hand side of (1)

had fallen more substantially, we would find a bigger change in business cycle volatility between

the early and late subperiods. Thus, the taste shock is not a useful candidate factor for

understanding changing cyclical volatility because its volatility is similar between the two

periods.




                                                  14
       Our next experiment considers the potential of the intertemporal shock to account for the

change in volatility. This shock enters the intertemporal first order condition, which can be

written as follows:

                             1          (1 − α )( yt +1 / kt +1 ) + 1 − γ utφ+1
                                =βe E
                                   z4 t
                                                                                .
                             ct                          ct +1

       A natural way to calibrate the standard deviation of this shock is to target the volatility of

consumption. If we employ this criterion, the value of σ 4 we obtain using data for the entire

period, turns out to be 0.000403. While this is a considerably smaller value than our estimates of

the other shock volatilities, it turns out to imply considerable volatility in the endogenous

variables. In particular, the percent volatility of TFP implied by our model turns out to be 0.85.

This is actually larger than TFP volatility computed from U.S. data for this same period (0.83).

       Because of the considerable volatility generated by this shock, we report results for an

experiment where the other shock volatilities are set equal to zero. That is, Table 6 gives results

from the following experiment (assume σ 1 = σ 2 = σ 3 = 0 ):

       1. Set σ 4 to match the volatility of consumption for the entire 1955-2003 period shown

           in Table 1.

       2. Choose σ 4 to match the volatility of consumption during the early subperiod.

       3. Choose σ 4 to match the volatility of consumption during the late subperiod.

       We find that considerable volatility reduction can be accounted for by the intertemporal

shock. In particular, unlike the government spending or preference shock, this shock appears to

be able to account for the reduction in volatility of TFP and other endogenous variables once

endogenous factor utilization is taken into account.

       While this intertemporal shock may be capable of potentially accounting for much of the

change in the volatility of TFP and the other variables, its contribution in this one-shock model is

flawed, because with only this one shock the model is seriously deficient as a positive business

cycle model. Specifically, it generates several business cycle statistics that are grossly

counterfactual. For example, as shown in Table 6, the fluctuations in hours worked are

significantly larger than the output fluctuations, and investment is much too volatile. An even

more striking shortcoming of this model is the fact that consumption in this model economy is

counter-cyclical, while it is highly pro-cyclical in the U.S. economy. These findings indicate that

this one-shock model is not a reasonable specification for evaluating the potential contribution of


                                                 16
the change in the volatility of the intertemporal shock. Doing this requires adding productivity

shocks, as it is well known that models with productivity shocks tend to produce reasonable

volatility and co-movement patterns compared to actual data.

       We now consider the contribution of the change in the volatility of the intertemporal

shock in an economy where technology shocks are important. Specifically, to generate a model

with potentially reasonable business cycle properties, we maximize the possible contribution of

technology shocks as follows. The value of σ 1 is chosen so that it completely accounts for TFP

volatility in the second (low volatility) subperiod. The same value of σ 1 is used in the first (high

volatility) subperiod, and we choose σ 4 in the first subperiod to account for the change in the

volatility of σ 1 between the two subperiods. Specifically, the experiment is conducted as

follows:

       1. Set σ 4 = 0 and choose σ 1 to match the volatility of TFP in later subperiod (results

           are shown in the second column of Table 7).

       2. For the early subperiod, maintain the same value of σ 1 as in step 1. Choose σ 4 to

           match the much higher volatility of TFP during the early subperiod.

Hence, in this experiment, we are allowing for a significant role for technology shocks in both

subperiods, but we are allowing a change in the volatility of the intertemporal shock ( σ 4 ) to

account for one hundred percent of the change in the TFP volatility between the two subperiods.

        The results of this experiment tell basically the same story as Table 6. A change in the

variance of the intertemporal shock can account for the reduced variance of TFP, but the implied

business cycle properties when the intertemporal shock is active (the early subperiod in Table 7)

are substantially at variance with the business cycle properties of the U.S. economy.

Specifically, hours worked fluctuates more than output, and consumption is highly counter-

cyclical (the correlation of output and consumption is -0.7).

        This experiment indicates that a change in the volatility of an intertemporal shock that

shifts the Euler equation is a very unlikely candidate for understanding changing cyclical

volatility because the business cycle properties in this model are significantly at variance with

the data. This suggests that investigating this shock seems to require a model which deviates

considerably from the growth model.

5. Conclusion
       We find that the approximately 50 percent decline in business cycle volatility that has

occurred since 1983 can be accounted for by the observed decline in the volatility of productivity

shocks. This finding is robust to allowing for endogenous TPF volatility operating in a model

with variable capital and labor utilization. In particular, we found that neither changes in the

volatility of an additive resource constraint shock, changes in the volatility of a static taste shock,

nor changes in the volatility of a dynamic taste shock can plausibly account for the change in

TFP volatility, the change in the volatility of output and its components, and labor.
