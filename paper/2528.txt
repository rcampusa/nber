                      CAN PUBLIC SPENDING CUTS BE INFLATIONARY?




1.   Introduction

     This paper studies the consequences for inflation of public expenditure

cuts.      The   setting is   that of a   small open economy, but most        of the

                              to closed economic systems as well.         While    the
analysis is applicable

emphasis     is on    the long run,    transitional dynamics will    be   considered

briefly.

     While   the purpose of this paper is to develop a general theoretical

franework, the question it addresses was motivated by the recent experience

of the Mexican economy (see Feltenstein and Morris         (1987),    Jarque (1987)

and Jung (1987)).

     With but minor abuse of language we can pose the question that is the

title of this paper in terms of the demand for and supply of seigniorage

revenue.     Monetary financing is viewed as the residual financing mode of

the government.       Specifically, real per capita public spending, current and

capital, are treated as exogenous as are real per capita lump sum          taxes   and

the proportional tax rate on domestic value added.         Real per capita stocks

of public debt, internal and external, are also taken as given.               Cuts in

                                                                 revenue by
public spending will therefore affect the demand for seigniorage
                                                                     sector   deficit
changing     the   (inflation—and—real—growth—corrected) public

that must be         financed by                      The paper      emphasises    the
                                   printing money.1

potentially      important distinction, as regards their effect on the public

sector deficit, of cuts in public sector consumption and cuts in public

sector capital formation.

     Real    seigrliorage   revenue   (the real value of   new issues     of nominal

                                                          of a "seigniorage
high—powered or base money) can be written as the product
                                            —2—


tax rate" (the proportional rate of change of the high powered nominal

money stock,     /L)   and the "seigniorage tax base" (the real stock of money

balances or the real stock of money balances per capita, m).

       Across   steady states there is a one—for—one association between the

seigniorage tax rate and the rate of inflation; in classical flex—price

models,    such a relationship may exist also              in the short    run,   say for

unanticipated, immediate and permanent changes in             .     The seigniorage      tax

is indeed often referred to as the inflation tax and we will follow this

rather sioppy usage.

    Given the seigrtiorage tax base, there will be a unique seigniorage tax

rate     that   generates    ("supplies)     the     required     seigniorage     revenue.

However, because the velocity of circulation of high—powered money is not

independent of the (expected) inflation rate,              the seigniorage tax base is

likely to vary (negatively) with the seigniorage tax rate,                at any rate in

the long run.          This leads to the possibility of a            seigniorage Laffer

curve": the elasticity of the seigniorage tax base with respect                       to the

seigniorage tax rate can become greater than unity in absolute value,2 so

higher growth rates of the nominal money stock (and sooner or later higher

actual and expected inflation) will appropriate a smaller amount of real

resources for the government.

       If there is perfect        international capital mobility       and the long—run

real interest rate is independent of the government's spending behaviour, a

cut in public consumption spending reduces the long—run rate of inflation

as long as, if there are multiple rates of inflation yielding the same real

                 revenue,   the    authorities    always   choose   the   lower   rate    of
seigniorage

inflation, i.e. as long as the equilibrium is on the (globally) revenue

efficient segment of the seigniorage Laffer curve.

   When     cuts     in public        sector       capital      formation    are   considered,          the

expenditure effect, which cet.par. reduces the budget deficit one—for—one,

lowers inflation (and is the only effect in the case of public consumption

cuts) is supplemented by three further effects.                       The direct revenue effect

represents    any     cash     returns       the    government      may     receive    as    a     direct

consequence of its ownership of the public sector capital stock (including

infrastructure).       The indirect revenue effect measures the implications of

a lower public       sector capital stock for domestic production and thus for

production or income—related taxes.                  The money demand effect is the effect

of a lower public sector capital stock on money demand (at a given real

interest rate and inflation rate) through its effect on the scale variable

(some measure of income or wealth) in the money demand function.                             While the

direct revenue effect is ambiguous, the indirect revenue effect and the

money   demand      affect will mitigate             and may even reverse             completely the

inflation reducing         expenditure effect of cuts in public                       sector capital

formation.

   When      there    is     limited        international        capital    mobility        (the    paper

considers the zero capital mobility case) the real interest rate becomes

endogenous.      The response of the real interest rate to public spending cuts

when money is the residual financing instrument is ambiguous, however.                                   It

is quite     possible that the real interest rate would rise, even in the

long—run.

    Note     that    the     paper    studies       the   effect     of    spending    cuts        on   the


inflation    rate,     not    on     the    level of      the    path of     money prices.              The

possibility of a negative association between the volume of public spending

and the general price level has been discussed by Hall (1987) and will only

be reviewed here in brief.                 Let M be the nominal stock of high—powered or

base money, V the income velocity of circulation of high—powered money, P
                                                 —4—


the general price level and          Y    real income.       The identity of exchange states

that


      MV     PY


Let    M   be given at a point in time;                through policy choice                 in a closed

economy; in an open economy through a freely floating exchange rate or, if

the    exchange      rate    is   managed,      through      capital    or       exchange       controls.

Velocity      is    generally     taken    to    be    a    non—decreasing         function       of    the


opportunity cost of holding outside money, which is the nominal interest

rate, i, when the monetary base does not earn any interest.3                                     In many

niacromodels (but not necessarily in the one considered in this paper)                                  ,
                                                                                                            a


public spending cut has a non—positive effect on the real interest rate,                                    r.

Consider the case where r actually falls.                      Holding constant inflationary

expectations (an assumption that is not in general consistent with rational

expectation formation), i falls and velocity falls                     u:h       it.    Nominal income

therefore declines.           If real income stays constant or rises,                          the price

level       falls    unambiguously.          Only      if     real     income          falls    by     more

(proportionally) than the decline in velocity, will the price level rise.

      A    necessary condition for such an association is                    a   positive effect or

real output of an increase in public spending.                       In a Keynesian model with

demand—constrained          output   and     employment,       real    output          of    course    does

decline in response to a cut in public spending,4 but the price level is

either taken to be predetermined or assumed to decline with output along a

public spending—invariant upward—sloping aggregate supply schedule.

      There are     a   whole range of possible direct and indirect, short—run and

long—run effects of public spending on equilibrium output.                                  These include

direct substitutability or complementary between current public                                  spending

and current private spending (see Buiter (1977))                      or between current public
                                          —5—


spending and    the supply     of labour.         There also can be      short—run real

interest rate effects on the supply of labour (through the intertemporal

substitution mechanism emphasised by Hall             (1987)) and on the demand for

labour (through working capital channels as in Blinder (1987)).               This paper

does not consider these effects but does allow for a long—run effect of

public spending on the private capital stock.

    The organisation of the paper is as follows.              Section 2 develops the

model.   In Section (2a) we consider the public sector and its "demand for

seigniorage'.       Section    (2b)   models    production   and    factor   demand    with

special emphasis on the role of public sector capital.              Private consumption

and portfolio behaviour (including money demand) are developed in Section

(2c).    Market equilibrium and the external accounts are given in Section

(2d).     Section   3   contains a     brief discussion      of    seigniorage   and    the

exchange rate regime.         In Section 4 we consider the longrun effects of

public spending cuts on the rate of inflation while Section 5 contains a

brief discussion of dynamic issues.            Section 6 concludes.

2b.   Production
      Domestic output      is   produced by     N    identical comretitive firms             The

production function of the ith firm is given by

      Ti       Ki,   i(KG,N),Li)                                                       (8)


Ti Mi and L are output, caoital input and labour input of the ith firm
respectively. KG is the aggregate social overhead capitol stock vboso
services are available free of charge to private firms. Ti is increasing
and     linear homogeneous in M,              I and L4,        strictly     concave,    twice

continuously differentiable        and satisfies the        made   conditions for Mi and

Li.        I is   increasing in KG,   non—increasing in N and twice continuously

differentiable.

      Gne simple special case of (8)       is      given in equar.ion (9)


      Ti   =   F(Ki,Ka,L), i.e. r(yGtfl        vG                                      (9)

In this version there is no "congestion effect" involved in the impact of
the pohlic sector stock on the output of firm i. The effect of K on the
output. of the ith firm is independent of N, the number of firma. P-yen with

                                                   —11--


Letting y           Y/L,     k        K/L and kG      KG/L equation (9') implies, through

constant returns, equation (10)


      y        f(k,kG)                                                                        (10)


      Each individual firm takes KG as given and optimally chooses                      K   and   L   to

maximise after tax profits given the real wage                    w   and the real interest rate

r.    We therefore have the following first order conditions for competitive

factor demands:


      (l_O)f1(k,kG)           r                                                              (11)



      (l_o)[f(k,kG)_kf1(k,kC)_kGf2(k,kG)J                  w                                 (12)



      Equation (11)          permits us to write the private capital—labour ratio as

a    function of         the domestic       real   interest rate        and   the public     sector

capital—labour ratio:



     k    =
              k(,     kG);       k1    i_<0; k2


     All factors of production are assumed to be complements,                       i0.

FG>0          and FyG>0.     The last of these implies f12>0 and thus k2>0.

     The demand price for labour, w, can from (12) be written as:


     w    =    (l_O)a(k,kt);      i     _cfil+kGfl2)>0;        a2 =   _(kf12+kGf22)>0        (14)6


     With the marginal product of public sector capital (f2) positive and k4

positive, there will be positive pure profits                         (k4f2 per capita)      in the

economy if capital and labour are paid their marginal products.                         We assume

that the ownership claims to this stream of pure profits are not traded

internationally and that they are perfect substitutes in domestic private

portfolios for domestic interest—bearing debt.                        The real per capita value

In   the mode: under consideration this becomes:


             (l_A)kGf2                                                                              (16',

      The importance of the assumption that strong rcongestion eifects" do

not    affect the contrib.Ltion of public capital                        to      the output         f      an

individual firm, becomis apparent                   when we   consider the exteae alternative

given in the following equation:

           = F(Ki,   KG — —                 —                           KG
      '1                  kG, Li),          kG>0;    i.e.    NK0,N)          —   kG




This    is a    simple       special case of            a general     formulation          of congestion

effects, according to which, for any K0, there exists a unique finite value

of N, N(KG) say, such that f(K,N(K'))O.                          This critical value of N is

assumed to increase with K°.                With free entry. pure profits will disappear

ony if N=N, i.e. in the special case under consideration if N=KG/kQ
                                             —l 3—


    Applying the representative firm approach to this formulation we have,

with free entry,


     (l—O) f1(k,O)     r


     (l—o)(f(k,O)—kf1(k,o))




    Under   this specification equilibrium output or output                        per worker is

independent of the stock of public sector capital.                      A   higher value of KG

simply induces more entry of new firms, competing away any pure profits.

Each of the larger number of firms employs labour and private capital in

the same proportions as before (at given             w   and r).       Total output       Y and the
total private capital stock are independent of gU,                      For reasons of space

this alternative     approach    to   social overhead capital                in    the    aggregate

production function will not be pursued          here]
2c. Private Consumption Behaviour


    Aggregate    private   consumption       behaviour      is       summarised     in equations

(18)—(23)

    q denotes per capita "comprehensive" consumption, i,e,                        the   consumption
of the single commodity plus the imputed value of the "money services"

consumed by domestic households,         c is per capita consumption of the single

commodity and md the per capita demand for real money balances,                           a denotes

per capita financial wealth or non—human wealth,                 h   the per capita stock of

human capital.    q, c     md,   a and   h   are all measured in            terms       of domestic

goods.   f*P is real per capita private ownership of net foreign assets,

which are assumed to be denominated in terms of foreign currency.

   The         model     of   consumer           behaviour     is      based     on     Well's    (1985)


reinterpretation of Blanchard's (1985) model.                          (See also Buiter (1987a)).

Each individual consumer lives forever and has a                               tine—additive utility

functional      with a ooostant pure rate of time preference, 5.                          Instantaneous

utility is the  logarithm of a homogeneous funotion of oonsumption of the
one good and real money balanoes. Labour is supplied inelastically   This

honogeneous funoticn is increasing, striotly quasi—concave and twice
continuously differentiable. It satisfies the Inada conditions, Internal
capital markets are perfect. All domestic and internationally traded
assets except money earn the sane expected pecuniary rate of return.                                  While

        individual        lives    forever,           there   is   a   constant       birt.h   rate    (and
each

population growth rate) n>0,                   Each individual earns the sane wage and pays

the same taxes.          Human capital is therefore the same for all, regardless of

age.
                                                  —15—


       Per capita comprehensive consumption q                   c+im is a constant multiple,

6,   of the sum      of       non—human wealth, a,        and human wealth, h, as shown           in
equation (18).8           Equation (19)        is the equation of motion           for per capita

non—human wealth and equation (20) that for human wealth.                         Given a standard

trsnsversality condition, (20) implies (20'):                    human capital of those alive

today    equals the present discounted value of the future after—tax wage

income earned by those currently alive.

       Note that aggregate consumption behaviour looks as though it represents

the behaviour of a representative consumer who discounts his future human

capital    income    at        a   higher   rate, r,     than   the rate     of    return   on his

non—human capital, r—n.               The excess of the human capttal income discount

rate over the rate of return on tangible assets is n,                             the birth rate.

Absent operative intergenerational gift and bequest motives, private agents

currently alive do not have as collateral (and do not act as if they had as

collateral) the future after—tax labour income of those yet to be born, the

"new entrants".       A       positive birth rate (n>0) therefore generates absence of

debt    neutrality        :
                                holding     constant     the   path   of   current    and     future

exhaustive public spending on goods and services, hulding constant the path

of current and future distortionary tax rates and holding constant the path

of current and future nominal money issues, changes in the path of lump—sum

taxes (which are consistent with the government satisfying its solvency

constraint) will affect the real equilibrium of the eocnomy.                            With   nO,
debt neutrality prevails.

     Equation    (21)         defines private     sector non—human wealth.             Note    that

domestic money, domestic—currency—denominated—public debt, equity and the

domestic capital stock are held entirely by the domestic private sector.

     Aggregate   consumption           of the single good, c,          depends positively on

comprehensive consumption, q and ambiguously on the real price of holding
money balanoes, the nominal intetest rate, i (equation (22)).                   The demand

for real money balanoes inoreases with q and deoreases with i (equation

(23)).

rketeuilibriumandtheextetnalaooounts

Since this is a one good world and the law of one prioe holds, this means

that unoovered real interest parity also holds, as in equation (24b)

3.   Seigniorage and the exchange rate regime

     For reasons of space little attention is paid in this paper to the wide

freely     floating    exchange     rate    and      a    crawling      peg    with        a   constant

proportional       rate    of     depreciation       or       appreciation       are        considered

explicitly.     Since we are focussing on the long—run inflation consequences

of public expenditure cuts, any exchange rate regime that is considered

should be viable in the long run.             Viability has several dimensions.                          We

consider two        long run seigniorage consistency and international reserve

sufficiency.

3 a. Long run   seinioraepnsistenc
     In steady—state equilibrium all real per capita assets and liabilities

of the government are constant (i.e.               bk0=f00        and    ink0)            and the   real

interest rate r is constant.          0G,   rç,    8,    p0    n and r* are parameters.                  In

the one good world of this paper,                 the terms of       trade      F        are of course

identically equal to unity and y=O.               What follows holds, however, also for

models with endogenous terms of             trade or real exchange rate,                       since     in

steady state no real appreciation or depreciation occurs.

     Real per capita steady state seigniorage is therefore given by9


           (n+)m      cG_rO_Of(k,kG)+(r_r*)f*G+(n_pG)kG+(r_n)(b_f*C)                              (30)



     Through the money demand function, we can determine which rate(s) of

inflation (there may be more than one) can generate the required steady

state real seigniorage given in equation (30).                    The money demand function

given in equation         (23)   together with equations (18),                (19)   ,    (20),   (27b),

(28b)    and (29) imply

It should be noted that throughout we assume that n>0, n+ô>r and w—70>0J0

   Holding constant the other arguments of (30) and (31) we can trace the

cet.par. relationship between long—run real per capita seigniorage or the

long—run real per capita stock of high—powered money and the (actual and

expected) rate of inflation.

   For a number            of commonly used money demand functions including the

linear     one       in   (32a)    and      the   log—linear   one   in   (32b)   the    long—run

relationship between the inflation rare (or the monecary growth rate) and

real seigniorage has the               Laffer curve" shape shown in Figure 1.


   m     = n—rnr                   a43>O; r<a3'                                            (32a)

    For the linear demand function shown in Figures IA and lB and for the

log—linear demand function shown in Figures lC and lD (both drawn with n=0)

there is a unique finite long—run seigniorage maximizing rate of inflation

(=(a/(2))—(n/2) in                he   linear case,       =(l/)—n    in che   log linear case).

Such a unimodal long—run seigniorage Laffer curve would, of course, not

exist if the money demand function were the rectangular hyperbola given in

(32c)

    This money demand function, which would correspond to equation (31) in

the Cobb—Douglas           case    (i'=0) and with          r>0, has   seigniorage      increasing

(decreasing) forever with              ir   if f3">n (if 13<n).

       For the government's fiscal—financial—monetary strategy to he feasible

if there is a seigniorage Laffer curve, the maximal amount of steady—state

seigniorsge      5    should obviously be no             less than the value         required       to

sstisfy the steady—stste budget constraint (30).                         If there is a unimodal

long—run seigniorage Laffer curve (and there are consequently two steady

state    rates       of    inflation   that generate       any     given    feasible    amount      of

long—run real seigniorage), it seems reasonable to assume that the lower of

these two inflation rates is actually chosen, by the policy makers                               (and

that we are therefore always on the revenue—efficient side of the long—run

seigniorage Laffer curve) if there is a managed exchange rate regime.                         With

somewhat less confidence the lower inflation rate may be expected to emerge

endogenously under           a   floating exchange rate regime.             No rational policy

making process would ever drive the steady state inflation rate beyond the

seigniorage      maximising        value,   as   in     addition    to    the   costs   of   higher

inflation, there would also be a reduction in inflation tax revenues.                               In

what    follows we         assume that if there is a long—run seigniorage Laffer

curve, it is unimodal.

   The minimal             long—run rate of      inflation implied by the government's

fiscal—financial—monetary strategy, 1, must be consistent with the long—run

exchange rate rule.              In our model, in which the law of one price holds,

re+w*    even outside the steady state.                 However, even if the real exchange

rate is endogenous, the steady state rate of depreciation of the nominal

exchange rate             must equal the excess of the minimal long—run domestic rate

of inflation required to generate the required steady state seigniorage,                            ,
over   the exogenous world rate of inflation,               ir*   (assumed to be constant for

simplicity), i.e.


                                                                                             (33)
                                                —21—


      As our formal model is non—stochastic and strategic behaviour is not

considered, it does not matter whether we view (33) as the steady state of

an exclienge rate management rule (i.e.                a rule for E or its rate of change

with the stock      of international reserves and the money stock adjusting

endogenously) or as the steady state of a reserve stock or money stock

management rule (i.e.        a   rule for   M   or R* with the exchange rate adjusting

endogenously).

      In most of what follows it is convenient to interpret exchange rate

behaviour    as   if    it   were    generated by          a   crawling    peg   exchange    rate

management rule which generates the real seigniorage required to satisfy

the    government      budget     identity      at     each     instant,   given   exogenously

determined   values     of cC,             o,   t,     b   and f*G and without any          maxi"

devaluations or revaluations, i.e. without any discontinuous changes in the

level of the nominal exchange rate.                  The (managed) proportional rate of

change of the nominal exchange rate,                 c will in genera? vary over time in


response to changes in cC or iC                  Such an exchange rate management rule

mimics a freely floating exchange rate except for the absence (under the

exchange rate management rule) of discontinuous changes in E even at those

instants     when "news" about the fundamentals reaches the private sector.

With a predetermined nominal exchange rate, any stock—shift changes in the

demand for real money balances (say in response to a change in the nominal

interest rate) will be reflected in changes in the stock of international

reserves.    As regards the behaviour of real money balances (per capita), m,

this regime is identical to a freely floating exchange rate regime.                         Under

the latter regime, discontinuous changes in the nominal exchange rate in

response to news replace discontinuous changes in official international

reserves.     The                   rate    management         interpretation may    make     the
                       exchange

selection of seigniorage revenue efficient solutions more plausible.

3b.   International reserve sufficiency

      Current conventional wisdom on               the    collapse of managed exchange rate

regimes     (see eg Krugman            (1979),    Flood and Garber            (1984) and    Obstfeld

(1986)) implies         that a        collapse can       occur even      if    there   is   long—run

seigniorage consistency as just defined.                    Even if the government achieves

an    inflation     rate      and     nominal    exchange       rate   depreciation     rate    that

guarantee long—run seigniorage consistency,                      (and even if the government

satisfies its intertemporal solvency constraint at each instant, in or out

of steady state), international foreign exchange reserves could still be

declining: nominal domestic credit expansion could exceed the change in the

nominal money stock demanded in equilibrium.                     This can occur even when c4,

r, kG,    pG,   b   and f*G are constant            :    the loss of official international

reserves would be balanced                in that case by a            reduction    in government

borrowing abroad        :     R*_B*      (n+ir_e)(R*_B*)    is consistent with any value of

R* (and thus, ultimately, of             R*).
      In the model under consideration, international reserves and foreign

borrowing       carry       the   same   interest       rate.      The   government's       solvency

constraint is therefore unaffected by equal offsetting changes in R* and in

*•     Note that if reserves have a lower interest rate than government debt

(as would be the case under a pure gold standard with a positive nominal

interest rate (see Buiter 1987)),                then financing a given deficit by running

down reserves rather than by borrowing abroad would gradually strengthen

                                    Similarly,     a     stock—shift     open     market    sale   to
government       solvency.

replenish the stock of reserves would, because the authorities incur a high

interest rate liability in exchange for a low interest rate asset, weaken

government solvency immediately.

      As shown in Buiter (1986),            when the interest rates on reserves and on

government debt are the same and when a government is solvent for any rate
                                             —23—


of domestic credit expansion (however low), then the government is solvent

for any other rate of domestic credit expansion (however high).                  There can

be no      international reserve problem"           as long as there is no solvency

problem.

     The    literature     just   referred    to    "creates"   a   reserve    problem   by

postulating some ad—hoc lower bound on the stock of reserves (or in the

context of our model        on the real per capita stock of reserves) and by

denying the government unlimited lines of credit even ehen solvency is

guaranteed.       If the actual      stock of reserves falls below            the critical

threshold level, the current managed exchange rate regiae collapses and

something else takes its place.              This "something else" can be         a   'free

float" (possibly followed by an eventual return to another managed rate or

rule), a maxi—devaluation, the imposition of capital or excoange controls

or any other conceivable scheme.

     I shall assume that in steady state, domestic credit expansion is such

that any reserve threshold there may be is not breached.

     Outside the steady state, the initial stock of reserves is assumed to

be   sufficient    to    keep   reserves    above   the   exogenously   imposed    reserve

threshold (if there is one),          despite any stock—shift or gradual reserve

losses incurred during the adjustment process.                  The focus is therefore

firmly     on   solvency    rather   than    on     (badly   understood)   international

liquidity problems that may occur despite solvency.12

    The coefficient a11 is positive if we are on the revenue—efficient side

of the seigniorage Laffer curve, where the elasticity of money demand with

respect to the inflation rate is less than I in absolute value)-3                           A   cut

in public consumption spending reduces the amount of real seigniorage that

needs   to be        extracted.        In the revenue—efficient region             of the Laffer

curve, lower real seigniorage means lower inflation (see equations (35s)

and (36a)).          Note that since money is the "residual                 mode of financing

lower public consumption spending does not imply lower explicit taxes.

    The effect of higher lump—sum taxes on long—run inflation is actually

ambiguous in this model.                 As shown in equations (35c)         and (36c). while

higher lump sum taxes reduce the amount of long—run seigniorage required to

satisfy the government budget constraint, it also reduces the demand for

money (at given nominal and real interest rates), which is an increasing

function       disposable       labour    income.        If   in   the   initial   steady   state

seigniorage         is   less    than     disposable     labour    income   (which    is    likely

empirically), higher lump—sum taxes will lead to lower long—run inflation

(in the revenue—efficient region of the long—run seigniorage Laffer curve).

    Lower public sector capital formation may (but need not) lead to higher

long—run inflation (see equations (35b)                   and (35c)).    Cet.par. it reduces

the deficit one—for—one, thus reducing long—run required seigniorage and

                                                                                         This we
(in the seigniorage—revenue—efficient region) long—run inflation.

shall call the expenditure effect, given by the first term on the RHS of

(36b).      However,         there may be        direct cash returns     to    the government,

asociated with        its ownership of the public sector capital stock.                   If the

(net)    rate of return pG exceeds the real growth rate n (or equivalently if

pGkC exceeds     G)   the direct effect of lower public sector capital formation

on long—run seigniorage and (in the seigniorage—revenue—efficient region)

on inflation will be positive.                 Empirically, it is of course quite possible

for pG     to be negative.                The permanent subsidisation        (for good or bad

reasons) of secular public sector loss makers would be a case in point.

This direct revenue effect is given by the second term _pC/n on the RES                          of
equation (36b).

    There is a further possible effect of a lower long—run stock of public

sector capital on the deficit, seigniorage and inflation.                        Lower k' means

lower national income, both given k and by                        inducing a reduction      in    k

(assuming f12>O)       .        Lower national income means lower income—related tax

receipts if 0 is positive.                 This indirect revenue effect is captured in the

third term on the RHS              of   equation (36b).

                                                                         the
        Finally, there is an effect on the demand for money, captured by

last term on the           P.}IS   of   equation (36b).   A   lower value of k' means a lower

real wage (since f11f22—f122>O by concavity).                     Cet.par. a lower real wage

means a lower demand                for real money balances; in the revenue—efficient

segment     of   the seigniorage Laffer              curve    this implies    higher   inflation.

This    will be referred to as the money demand                effect.

    In the seigniorage—revenue—efficient region, the expenditure effect of

a cut in public sector capital formation reduces inflation.                                The direct

revenue effect is ambiguous even as regards its sign.                        The indirect revenue

effect will worsen       inflation as long as the marginal product of public

sector   capital   is positive        (f2>0)    or     public       and    private        capital   are

complements   (f12>0).     8   is   likely to be quite small in many developing

countries,    however.     The      money   demand      effect        also       raises    inflation.

Whatever the scale measure,          income or wealth               term in the money demand

function, it is likely to be adversely affected, cet.par. by a lower social

overhead capital stock as long as the marginal product of public sector

capital is positive.

    Zero international capital mobility

    When there is international capital mobility, domestic income equals

private plus public absorption, i.e. equation (26) holds.

    Substituting for output          using the production              function, for private

consumption   using   equations (18),          (19),    (20) and          (22)    and for private

investment using the steady—state condition iPnk, we obtain


          r   1G                       n                        r    iG    i

Equations (34) (with k0'=i0n1) and              (37)    can be        used       to solve for the

long—run equilibrium values of the rate of inflation and the now endogenous

real interest rate.

      dr             a11


The coefficient a12 given in (38c)                       measures the effect of a higher real

interest rate            (cet.par.) on the          "demand for seigniorage",         i.e.   on   the

inflation—and—growth—corrected government deficit on the RHS of equation

(34),      relative to its effect on the "supply of seigniorage", (n±lr)m, on the

LHS   of    equation        (34).    A   higher value of r raises           the   deficit both by

raising the interest to be paid on the debt and by generating a lower

private capital stock,              output and income—related tax receipts.               These two

effects are captured by the terms b and —(O/(l—O)) f1/f11 respectively in

equation (38c).             Cet.par. a higher real interest rate also represents a

higher nominal interest rate,                This nominal interest rate effect will tend

to reduce m, the seigniorage tax base, since l—+iq'>O.                               A higher real

interest rate will, however, also raise the long—run ratio of non—human

wealth to disposable wage income.                   It will also, provided r>(n÷6)/2, raise

the long—run ratio of comprehensive consumption q to disposable wage income

and thus raise

      Finally,       a     higher    real   interest       rate will     tend   to   be   associated

(through a lower value of k) with a lower real wage.                       This effect, measured

by the third term on the RHS                of   (38c)    will tend to     duce m.    We will only

consider the         a   priori more plausible case in which a12 is positive, i.e. a

higher value of r raises the demand for seigniorage relative to its supply.

(Note that we also assume throughout that the nominal                             interest rate is

positive).          The coefficient a11, already discussed, will be positive if the

inflation elasticity of money demand is less than unity in absolute value,

negative otherwise.          Without a seigniorage Laffer curve, the                      curve is

downward—sloping as shown in Figure 2.                      The AAi schedule represents the

unimodal       long—run    seigniorage    Laffer       curve        generated    by an   inflation

elasticity of money demand which is below unity in absolute value for low

values     of - and rises monotonically with            i    crossing     unity for some finite

value of     ir.

ratio of comprehensive consumption q to disposable wage income (if n+l<2r),
so the second term on the         PBS   of (38e) is positive.            Human   wealth is lower,
however, when       r is higher and this will make the third term on the RHS                    of

downward—sloping          curve 50B0) and       the case where           a22    is negative   (the

     A   cut in public consumption spending shifts the long-run seigniorage

equilibrium schedule A0A0 to the left in Figure 3a and 3b.                               (We consider

the case of the unimodal long—run seigniorage Laffer curve).                             If a higher

real interest rate raises long—run absorption relative to long—run output

(a22>O), the long—run output—absorption equilibrium schedule is negatively

sloped.     It shifts to the right when cG is cut as in Figure 3a.                                  In the

seigniorage—efficient            region,    the    equilibrium       moves       from   F0     to    F1

inflation falls and the real interest rate rises.                      Note that an increase in

the real interest rate is required in the long run because, with a22>0, a

higher    real    interest rate          is required        to   boost absorption            and reduce

output,    thus    restoring output—absorption balance                     following     the        cut   in

public    consumption spending.              In the      seigniorage—inefficient region the

stationary equilibrium in Figure 3a moves from E0 to E1.                                The inflation

rate rises while the effect on the real interest rate is ambiguous.                                       If

given q, a rise in the nominal interest rate has only a small effect on the

consumption       of    goods,     Le.     if    c/       is     small,    the    output—absorption

equilibrium schedule will be near vertical and r will increase.

     Figure 3b shows the case where a22<0 and a higher value of r reduces

absorption relative to output.               In the seigniorage—revenue—efficient region

the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1 or Ej.                        The real interest rate falls

and the inflation rate either falls                   (at    F1) or rises (at           Ej).        In the

                                                region    the    stationary       equilibrium        moves
seigniorage—revenue—inefficient

     An increase in lump—sum taxes will shift the long—run seigniorage

equilibrium schedule to the left if b13—a/(w—r0)]—l<0as seems plausible

                   This is shown both in Figure 4a and in Figure 4b.                            If a22>O

equilibrium schedule shifts to the left as in Figure 4b.                                  In Figure 4a the

seigniorage—revenue—efficient equilibrium shows a higher real interest rate

and a lower rate of inflation.

seigniorage schedule to the left.                         Figures 5a and 5b show the case where

the expenditure effect is dominated by                            the direct and indirect revenue

effects      and         the   money       demar,d    effect        i.e.    b12<O       and       the     long—run

value of        k   that accompanies a lower value of k0                          (the term f12/f11 in

(38j)).         Absorption therefore declines unambiguously.                             Output, however,

also falls, both through the direct effect of a lower value                                            of A0 and

through the depressing effect on k                           of a      lower value       of       kG    (the term

l/n(f2—f1f12/f11) in (38j)).

      in Figure 5a we consider the case where a22 is positive (a higher real

interest rate raises long—run absorption relative to long—run output) and

b22 is positive, (i.e.                a lower value of i0 reduces output by more than
                                                 —33—


absorption).        The output—absorption equilibrium schedule shifts to the left

in this case, moving the seigniorsge—revenue—efficient equilibrium from Eq

to E1.      The long—run responses of both the inflation rate and the real

interest rate in the seigniorage—revenue efficient region are unambiguous:

a   cut    in public    sector     capital       formation       leads to         a    higher    rate of

inflation and a lower real interest rate.                  The higher race of inflation is

needed to extract the larger real seigniorage                          that ia required and the

lower real interest rate raises output relative to absorption.

     In Figure Sb we continue to assume that                          ia poaitive, but b22 is now

assumed to be negative: a cut in public aector capital formation lowers

absorption more than output.               The output—abaorption equilibrium schedule

moves     to the right in this case,               In the        seigniorage—revenue—efficient

region the responae of the inflation rate and the real interest rate are

ambiguous.     It is possible for the inflation rate to rise and the real

interest rate to fall (the case of a very small shift to the right of the

output—absorption       equilibrium        schedule, not         shown in         Figure     Sb).     The

inflation rate can rise while the real interest rate riaes (from Eq to E1

in Figure Sb) or the inflation rate can fall while the real intereat rate

rises (from Eç to E2 in Figure Sb).

     With a22czO we      obtain in the seigniorage—revenue—efficient region                             an

unambiguously positive effect of a cut in public sector capital formation

on the rate of inflation when b22<O,                    i.e.    when a cut            in public sector

capital     formation    reduces    absorption by              more    than   output.           The   real

interest     rate    could   rise     if    q'    is    large         and   the       output—absorption

equilibrium     schedule     shifts    to    the       left only        slightly;        a   lower    real

interest rate is more likely, however,                    It is easily checked that with

a22<O and b22>O, a cut in public sector capital formation lowers the real

interest    rate   and has an ambiguous         effect     on the rate of inflation in the

seigniorage—revenue—efficient            region.16
    The     two    cases    where   a     cut    in    public    sector   capital   formation

unambiguously raises the long—run rate of inflation are depicted in Figures

Ia and 5c.        In each case the seigniorage—revenue—efficient equilibrium is

considered,       i.e.   a11>O,     In    addition     a   cut   in   public   sector   capital

formation    is      to raise (at given values of r and

aaigniorage" relative to the "supply of seigniorage", i.e. b12<O. Finally,
vs have one of the two following output—absorption equilibrium
configurations: either the case of Figure Sm in vb,ich a higher roal
interest rate raises absorption relative to output (apprO) and a cut in
public sector capital formation reduces absorption by less than output
            or    the case of Figure Sc in which a higher                 real interest rate

raises output relative to absorption (a22<O) and a cut in public sector

capital formation reduces absorption by .ore than output (b22<O)                          Note

that   these are sufficient conditions only.                 As Figure Sb shows, they are

not necessary,

      As the analytical characterisation of                   the unrestricted five—dimensional

restrict the analysis to the case where q'=O                          -and   the classical dichotomy

holds.

      Note that when q'0,                 real per capita seigniorage j             increases   with the

inflation rate if             r-'ri   (decreases if r<n).            We only consider dynamically

efficient equilibria with r>n.                       This means that the long—run equilibrium

seigniorage schedule is always downward—sloping in                           7r—r   space there is no

reduted.        The intuition is clear.                Private capital deepening (knO) means a

lower real         interest rate.            Unless      a     lower real          interest    rate          raises

absorption         relative     to       output    (a22<0),       the       rate    of   private            capital

which a cut in public spending can peraanently raise the rate of inflation.

to be       politically or       administratively infeasible.           Barring internal or

external debt repudiation             (or   economically equivalent capital            levies on

instrument of fiscal retrenchment.               The paper emphasises and elaborates the

important distinction between cuts in public consumption expenditure which

will    tend    to     reduce    the deficit2°     and cuts     in public       sector      capital

formation which may have the perverse effect of increasing the                           deficit.

This will happen if the expenditure effect is swamped by the direct and

indirect effects of a reduced public sector capital stock on government

revenues.

       if   tbey        increase       the     (inflation—and—real--growth—corrected) public

sector deficit, the cuts in public sector capital formation will raise the

"demand for seigniorage revenue".                      Such cuts are also likely to lower the

demand      for money      (at     a given inflation rate and real interest rate> by

reducing the scale factor (real income1 in the .Toney demand function.                                 This

reduces           the      "supply            of      seigniorage          revenue.              In     the

more complicated as private consumption and nquilibriom                                L   the domestic

      The    assumption     madein the paper that real government revcnue is

2    In the cases of the         linear or log-l1nesr noney denanJ Functions the

     absolute value of the elasticity of money demand with respect to the

     nominal interest rate increases with the nominal interest rste.                      The

     long—run seigniorege Leffer curve (holding coustent the                  rs.    interest

     rste and the real scale variable in the money demand                     function) is

     uninodsi in this case.

3    In Hall (1987), the real rate of return on high—powered money is kept
     constant    through policy by varying the nominal interest rste on base

     money    with the (expected) rate of inflstion

     for the appropriate kind of saddlepoint stability.

16   It is even possible for the long—run inflation rate to rise (in the

     seigniorage—revenue—efficient region) in response to                    a   cut in public
