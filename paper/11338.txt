The Wage Curve Reloaded

JEL No. J3, E2

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper provides evidence for the existence of a wage curve -- a micro-econometric association

between the level of pay and the local unemployment rate -- in modern U.S. data. Consistent with

recent evidence from more than 40 other countries, the wage curve in the United States has a long-

run elasticity of approximately   0.1. In line with the paper’’s theoretical framework: (i) wages are

higher in states with more generous unemployment benefits, (ii) the perceived probability of job-

finding is lower in states with higher unemployment, and (iii) employees are less happy in states that

have higher unemployment. We conclude that it is reasonable to view the wage curve as an empirical

law of economics.

                                      The Wage Curve Reloaded
1. Introduction

One of the oldest empirical questions in economics is that of how the price of labor is affected by
the unemployment rate. Following a tradition begun by the New Zealand economist A.W.
Phillips (1958), this question has traditionally been studied with aggregate time-series methods.
Although its robustness is still debated, the Phillips Curve, which is usually conceived of as a
relationship between wage growth and unemployment, has become part of standard
macroeconomics.

Blanchflower and Oswald (in, for example, 1994a) argue instead for the use of microeconomic
data.1 Their book documents the existence of a logarithmic curve linking the level of pay to the
unemployment rate in the local area. Its conclusion is that, in sixteen nations, including the
United States, the data are well described by a wage curve with an unemployment elasticity of
approximately –0.1.2 A doubling of the unemployment rate is then associated with a ten percent
decline in the level of the (real) wage. This is presented in the book as an empirical law of
economics.

Since then, Blanchflower and Oswald’s conclusions have been scrutinized by other researchers.
The wage-curve finding has now been replicated for more than 40 nations. Its existence in the
United States, however, is still viewed as controversial.

One reason is that Blanchard and Katz (1997) argue for a Phillips Curve, rather than a wage
curve, in United States data. Staiger, Stock and Watson (2002) and Card and Hyslop (1997) also
report a high level of auto-regression in U.S. wages. In contrast, Hines, Hoynes and Krueger
(2001) conclude that a wage curve specification has a more natural theoretical interpretation and
fits the data (hours as well as wages) better than the Phillips Curve specification. Hines et al
(2001) produce evidence of wage curves using annual and hourly earnings from the 1977-2000
March CPS files. The authors also uncover wage curves in the PSID for male household heads
aged 25-59 who were continuously employed for 1967-1987 and 1977-1996. Using the PSID,
Hines et al suggest that a 3 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate is associated with
a 4 per cent increase in real wages, which translates into an elasticity similar to the Blanchflower-
Oswald number.

In principle, the wage curve should be as interesting to macroeconomists as to labor economists.
Yet the empirical results on the wage curve’s existence have so far made relatively little
impression on American macroeconomics. This does not seem ideal. First, macroeconomic
analysis has for some decades stressed the need for microeconomic foundations. It might be

2 In Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a) we used micro-data for twelve countries: the United States, the United
Kingdom, West Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland, South Korea, Norway, Ireland, Italy, Canada and
Australia. The book also discussed evidence based on other researchers' work in a further four countries - Sweden,
the Côte d'Ivoire, Japan and India.

natural to expect such strictures to apply empirically as well as theoretically. Second, some
macroeconomics textbooks, including Blanchard (2003), make extensive theoretical use of a
wage curve (at the aggregate level, which he refers to as a ‘wage-setting’ relation), but do not lay
out the evidence for such a curve.3 Third, the idea of viewing different US states as usefully
different mini laboratories for study -- effectively what chapter 4 of Blanchflower and Oswald
(1994a) proposes -- has become conventional in various areas of economics.

Reconsidering the evidence

The literature on international wage curves is now so large that the case of the United States is
becoming increasingly anomalous. It needs to be reconsidered.

Subsequent to the publication of the Blanchflower-Oswald book 4, wage curves were reported for
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Canada, Chile,
China, Côte d'Ivoire, Czech Republic, Denmark, East Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Great
Britain/UK, Holland, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, New Zealand, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, USA, and West Germany. The list below provides a
summary.

econometric and disaggregated estimation.

What can be learned from this work? Although inevitably imperfect, the statistical law of a wage
curve with an elasticity of –0.1 has turned out to fit the data surprisingly well.5 Interestingly,
results for the Scandinavian countries emerge somewhat below the -0.1 estimate (e.g. Pekkarinen
(2001); Brunstad and Dyrstad (1997); Holmlund and Skedinger (1990)). There is also evidence
from one or two of the former communist countries of an elasticity far above the -0.1 estimate
(e.g. Blanchflower (2001); Pastore and Verashchagina (2004); and Pannenberg and Schwarz
(1998)) although other papers for these countries do find numbers close to -0.1 (such as Kertesi
and Kollo (1997, 1999); Duffy and Walsh (2002); Elhorst et al. (2002); and Kallai and Traistaru
(2001)).

A recent meta-analysis -- on a sample of 208 wage/unemployment wage curve elasticities from
the literature -- by Nijkamp and Poot (2005) concludes that

           "the wage curve is a robust empirical phenomenon … but there is … evidence of
           publication bias. There is indeed an uncorrected mean estimate of about -0.1 for
           the elasticity. After controlling for publication bias by means of two different
           methods, we estimate that the 'true' wage curve elasticity at the means of study
           characteristics is about -0.07".

Nijkamp and Poot (2005) also test for, and find no evidence of, what they term a
Blanchflower/Oswald 'advocacy' effect.

Most economists are unlikely to feel strongly about the possible difference between a wage curve
elasticity estimate of -0.07 and one of -0.1. What matters more is whether there are countries in
which a wage curve cannot reliably be found. Here the case of the United States needs to be
confronted.

2. The Data Reloaded

Is there, or is there not, a U.S. wage curve? Given that wage curves have been found for many
dozens of other nations, it would be remarkable, and presumably important, if the same were not
true in the United States.

The aim of this paper, therefore, is to study the patterns in modern American data. We re-
estimate the U.S. wage curve on a state level panel using CPS data from 1980-2001. We explore
points made by Blanchard and Katz (1997).



5   On page 357 of Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a) it is argued that:

           "Future work will have to begin to test for statistically significant differences among numbers that
           lie in a rough band from -0.05 to -0.20. It would probably be unwise to treat the minus-point-one
           rule as more than one of thumb".




                                                            4
The paper tests explicitly for the effect of unemployment upon wages and does not discuss the
possible structure of a classical labor-supply function. This is because: first, the paper takes the
efficiency-wage theory as its maintained hypothesis and in such a framework a no-shirking
condition replaces the labor supply curve; second, the paper aims to be consistent with the
literature on Phillips Curves and wage curves; third, in other results not reported here we have
found that unemployment variables enter wage equations more strongly than do employment-rate
variables.

Overall, our results suggest that the United States has more autoregression in pay than many
nations, but that there is much evidence of a U.S. wage curve. This has implications that seem to
matter. It means, first, that US labor markets may not be fundamentally different from other
nations’ labor markets (contrary to what has sometimes been claimed), and, second, that
American macroeconomists who use the Phillips Curve in modeling might wish to work more
with micro data.

With the advantage of hindsight, our 1994 book failed to examine sufficiently carefully the
autoregressive nature of hourly pay in the United States.

Any labor economist would argue that wages and unemployment are simultaneously determined.
Within the wage-curve debate, therefore, issues of identification and measurement will matter.
Moreover, given that wages are famously sticky, it is unlikely that it will be straightforward to
distinguish between short-run and long-run effects on pay. Wage dynamics can be expected to
play a central role.

Put informally, four views are visible in the economics literature.

Idea 1 (Phillips). The rate of growth of pay is inversely related to the unemployment rate. This
hypothesis is explored in Phillips' 1958 Economica paper. He used a long run of aggregate time
series data for Britain. The idea of a function dw/dt = f(U) is not necessarily a-theoretical. It can
be justified by appealing to the notion that excess supply of a commodity gradually pushes down
the price of that commodity. Here f(.) has a negative gradient. But Phillips was not clear about
whether any relationship was to be expected between the level of wages, w, and unemployment,
U. Sargan (1964) was later to argue a version of that.

Idea 2 (Harris-Todaro) To take a job in a region or industry (or in principle even a country) that
experiences a lot of unemployment, the typical worker needs to be paid well. This is an
application of the concept of compensating differentials. A state like West Virginia, which
traditionally has had one of the highest rates of joblessness in the United States, should in
equilibrium offer better pay than one with persistently low unemployment. Otherwise workers
will find life too risky to stay. At the region or industry level, therefore, w = g(U). Here the
function g(.) will have a positive gradient.

Idea 3 (The wage curve). In most countries, it has been found, following Blanchflower and
Oswald, that regions with higher unemployment have lower wages. One way to rationalize such
a discovery is to appeal to non-competitive theories of the labor market – for example to the idea
of a no-shirking condition or a bargaining-power effect. According to this kind of analytical



                                                 5
framework, higher local unemployment makes life tougher for workers (for example, they will
find it harder to obtain work if laid off by their current employer), and therefore it is not
necessary for employers to remunerate those individuals so well. Here w = h(U), and the h(.)
function has a negative gradient.

Idea 4 (Labor demand and supply). If unemployment can in some circumstances be viewed as
the negative of employment, an observed function w = j(U) might be construed as a labor
demand or supply function. This logic might be thought to be a stretch, because labor demand
and supply theory is not typically framed in unemployment space. Nevertheless, a function w =
j(U) might be seen as some kind of demand or supply curve written in mild disguise. If j(U) is a
miss-specified labor supply function, for example, it might be argued that j(U) would have a
negative gradient. If it is a miss-specified demand function, it might be expected to have a
positive gradient.

Among these four views, there is currently disagreement, and perhaps even confusion, in labor
economics and macroeconomics. We think the current position is this. The average US labor
economist believes in Harris-Todaro and, with a bit of skepticism along the way about the nature
of macroeconomic data, also believes in some form of Phillips Curve. The average European
labour economist does not believe in Harris-Todaro and, with a bit more respect along the way
for macroeconomic data, believes in some form of wage curve.

Recent debate has probably been hampered by a tendency for researchers to concentrate on
extremes. Some commentators, for example, interpret Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a) as
arguing for a necessarily static wage curve without any autoregression in wages (although the
book includes estimated equations with lags on the dependent variable). Similarly, because
Phillips’s original article does not discuss the possibility of dynamics other than a unit root in the
pay equation, the macroeconomics literature has been dominated by simple functional forms.

We aim to find common ground between disagreements in Blanchard and Katz (1997, 1999),
Staiger, Stock and Watson (2002), Card and Hyslop (1997), Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a),
Bell, Nickell and Quintini (2002), Barth et al (2002a, b), and Fares (2002).

3. A theoretical framework

If wages and unemployment are simultaneously determined, how should we think about the
spatial patterns in pay and joblessness? A model favored by Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a)
draws on efficiency wage theory. An illustrative version is as follows.

Consider an economy consisting of just two regions. The following assumptions are made about
region 1 and, with small modifications, also about region 2.

A1 Assume that workers are risk-neutral. They get utility from income and disutility from effort.
Define the wage as w and the level of on-the-job effort as e. Assume that a worker’s utility
equals the simple difference between income and effort, so that utility is u = w – e.




                                                  6
A2 Assume that effort at work, e, is a fixed number determined by technology, but that
individual employees can decide to "shirk" and exert zero effort. If undetected by the firm, these
individuals earn wage w and have e = 0, so that u = w. They are then better off than employees
who provide effort.

A3 An individual who shirks runs the risk of being detected. Designate as δ the probability of
successfully shirking, that is, of escaping detection. Assume that anyone caught shirking is fired,
and has then to find work elsewhere (at required effort e). Let the expected utility of a fired
worker be w . Define it

w = (w – e) (U) + b[1 – (U)].                                                        (1)

This is a convex combination of w – e, the utility from working at the required effort level, and
of b, which is defined as the income value of unemployment benefit plus leisure. The function
 (U) measures the probability of finding work, and how that is affected by the level of
unemployment, U, prevailing in the local labor market.

A4 Assume that there is a constant rate of break-up, r, of firms. In steady-state equilibrium, total
new hires in the local economy are [L – n] where L is working population and n is employment,
and rn = [L – n].

                                          n         r
Unemployment is by definition U      1–     , so r = − α
                                          L         U

This implicitly defines a function (U) where the first derivative is negative and the second
derivative is positive. Thus the probability of finding a job, , is a convex function of the
unemployment rate, U.

A5 Equivalent equations hold in the second region.

A6 However, the second region differs from the first in that both workers and non-workers enjoy
a non-pecuniary benefit, ø, from living in the region.

A7 Each region is affected by shocks to the demand for labor. The shock variable is denoted s in
region 1, with a density function g(s). There is an equivalent shock variable in region 2, with
density h(.). These shocks could be thought of as exogenous movements in real input prices, but
other interpretations are possible.

A8 Workers are free, between periods, to choose to live in whichever region they prefer. They
cannot migrate during a period.

The assumptions given above describe a form of efficiency-wage model. The model’s key
characteristic is that employers must pay a wage that is sufficiently high to induce employees not
to shirk. In equilibrium, workers must be behaving optimally in their effort decisions, and firms
must be behaving optimally in their wage-setting. Regions differ in their non-pecuniary
attractions: one of the two is a nicer place to live than the other. Excluding degenerate equilibria,



                                                 7
however, each region must offer workers the same level of expected utility. This condition
defines a zero-migration equilibrium.

Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a) show that the following result can be proved.

Proposition 1: Each region has a downward-sloping convex wage curve. If regions have the
same level of unemployment benefit, they have a common wage curve given by the equation

                      eδ
w=b+e+                                                                                      (2)
             (1 − δ )[1 − α (U )]

The convexity of the wage curve follows from the convexity of the (U) function, and can be
checked by differentiation. Intuitively, as unemployment U rises, firms realize that their
employees are inherently more frightened of losing their jobs, and can pay lower levels of
remuneration while maintaining the necessary degree of worker effort. A corollary is:

Proposition 2: There is involuntary unemployment in equilibrium.

The details of the proofs, and other associated corollaries, are given on pages 66-69 of
Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a).

4. Empirical Issues

In this paper we attempt to implement empirically a version of Equation 2.

First, a logarithmic wage equation is estimated. This is not essential but follows convention in
the labor literature. Second, we test for the influence of unemployment benefits, b, within a wage
equation. Although it follows directly from the theory, we have been unable to find a literature
on testing for the effects of benefit levels in regional or state-level wage equations. The previous
wage-curve literature has been unable to do so, but in US data it is possible to use information on
state unemployment insurance payments to construct a value for the b variable across space. If
information on b is not available, it might be argued, as in Blanchard and Katz (1999), that the
coefficient on any lagged dependent variable will be biased. Third, following the previous wage-
curve literature, the nonlinear function embedded within equation 2 is approximated empirically
by a logarithmic function of unemployment, U. This is primarily for simplicity. Fourth,
equations are estimated with a lagged dependent variable (that is, a regressor wt-1). This is to
measure the degree of autoregression in pay, and to allow a direct check for pure Phillips Curve
specifications. Fifth, implicit in the analysis will be the assumption that joblessness makes
people unhappy, that is, that unemployment benefits b do not make up sufficiently for the drop in
utility upon loss of a job; this is consistent with empirical evidence on psychological wellbeing,
such as that in Clark and Oswald (1994).

Identification issues have to be addressed. Here the form of wage equation makes it natural to
use benefits b as an instrument for wages w. To complete the model, an unemployment equation
is also needed. We assume it is a second-order AR process, derived from a neoclassical demand




                                                 8
curve for labor, and use two lags on U as instruments for unemployment. Later in the paper we
estimate this function Ut = (Ut-1, Ut-2, wt, controls) directly.

The paper begins with simple wage equations. They are estimated using state-year weighted
averages based on the Outgoing Rotation Group (ORG) files of the Current Population Survey.
The data cover the years 1979-2001. The dependent variable is the log of hourly earnings in
each state-year cell. Hourly earnings are calculated as earnings per week divided by usual hours.
Top-coded earnings are multiplied by 1.5. Weights are used to calculate state-year cell averages
for the independent and dependent variables.

There is a potential difficulty with the ORG earnings or wage data. Hirsch and Schumacher
(2004) have pointed out that over 30 per cent of workers in the ORG data files have their
earnings imputed using a "cell hot deck" method. The authors argue that this can create
downward biases when the attribute being studied (e.g. union status) is not a criterion used in the
imputation itself. In addition, there will be biases in other variables, such as schooling, where we
understand only a limited number of controls (4) get used for the imputation even though sixteen
education categories are available.

Furthermore, the proportions of the wage data that are imputed have increased in importance
since a sample redesign of the CPS in 1993.6 Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter to exclude -
- in a way consistent over time -- the individuals who have imputed earnings. If past values of
wages and/or other variables in a state are used to impute current wage values (as we understand
is the case), this is likely to bias upwards the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable
whenever the imputed observations are included. In other words, this would tend to distort
research towards finding a Phillips curve.

We attempt to make an adjustment for this problem. We exclude the ‘imputed’ earners in all
years except for 1994 and 1995. In those years it is not possible to make sample exclusions
because allocation flags are unavailable in 1994 and only for a third of the months in 1995
(September-December). Allocation flags appear to be unreliable for 1989-93, moreover, when
the proportion of earnings that were allocated mysteriously drops from 14.4% in 1988 to
approximately 4% for the five years. A significant number of individuals in 1989-1993 had

in the NBER MORG are given below based on the variable I25d. In 1995 the allocation information is only
available on one-third of wage observations -- hence the small sample. In 1994 it is not possible to identify any
individuals with imputed earnings.

earnings allocated but the Bureau of the Census apparently is unable to provide further details. It
is a concern that these imputations of earnings do not appear to be random.

Our wage equations typically allow for a lagged dependent variable, wt-1, alongside a set of
standard variables that include age, gender, schooling, and industry variables. The equations also
include year dummies. Other independent variables are the log of the local unemployment rate,
union density, and average weekly benefits. These are all available at the state level. State union
density rates by year were obtained from Union Membership and Earnings: Data Book, published
by the Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., written by Barry Hirsch and David Macpherson (2002),
and are downloadable at http://www.unionstats.com/. Average weekly UI benefits data were
obtained from the Unemployment Insurance Financial Data Handbook published by the U.S.
Department of Labor Employment & Training Administration. Data are downloadable at
http://atlas.doleta.gov/XDMS/indexfrm.xml. The most recently available information on UI
benefits is for 2001.

Most states have benefit levels that are intended to replace a little under one half of lost wages.
However, there are maxima and minima on payments to unemployed individuals, and these are
the source of much of the state-by-state variation in the data.

The maxima guarantee that many high-wage workers will receive less than half their average lost
earnings; the minima mean that some low-wage workers earn more than fifty percent of their lost
wages. There are considerable differences by state in the benefits maxima. In 1995, for instance,
these ranged from a low of $175 per week in Missouri to a high of $362 in New Jersey (O’Leary
and Rubin, 1997, page 174). The average wage replacement rate since 1938 has been
approximately 35% (O’Leary and Rubin, 1997).

As an illustration, the Appendix gives data on benefit levels and replacement rates for the year
2000. The highest average level of benefits was in Massachusetts ($293) and the lowest in
Puerto Rico ($104) and Mississippi ($157). Replacement rates -- defined as the proportion of
workers’ income replaced by benefits -- were greatest in Hawaii (50%) and lowest in California
(20%).

5. Results on Hourly and Annual Wages and Earnings

In the US there was an early literature which found evidence of a positive relationship between
wages and the unemployment rate. This includes papers by Hall (1970, 1972), Reza (1978),
Behman (1978), Roback (1982), Adams (1985), Marston (1985) and Topel (1986). In
Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a) we showed that such results were sensitive to the inclusion of
region fixed-effects and to the time period used.

If few or no controls are used, the state-level correlation in the United States between wage levels
and unemployment rates is positive. This can be viewed as a version of Harris-Todaro
compensating differentials. As an illustration, on the latest US data, and after pooling the years
1979-2002, we obtain the following simple forms for log hourly earnings equations (where state
unemployment is U):




                                                10
                                       (1)               (2)               (3)

                                                                       (4.67)

N                                      1223              1223             1223

These three equations include a set of year dummies (1979-2002); t-statistics are in parentheses.

Here it can be seen that the cross-section correlation between pay and joblessness is indeed
positive, with an elasticity of 0.0333, when state dummies are omitted (there are no controls in
this equation: the estimation is simply on year-state cell averages). Yet, in the spirit of a wage
curve, the introduction of state dummies, in the second column, overturns the Harris-Todaro
positive slope. The gradient changes to -0.0188 with a t-statistic of 2.72. A similar finding is
produced in the third column where, instead of state dummies, the long-run average
unemployment rate over the period (denoted LR average Log U) is entered as a regressor. There
is then evidence of both a negative effect from the level of current unemployment and a positive
effect from the long run average of unemployment. These elementary equations are not, of
course, complete specifications. They are designed instead to illustrate how a Harris-Todaro
positive correlation between area unemployment and area wages comes to be reversed.

Table 1 reports wage equations for the states of the US between 1980 and 2001. Our data set
provides a sample size of 1122 state-year observations.7 Column 1 of Table 1 is provided as a
benchmark or extreme. Year dummies are included. State dummies are omitted. This column 1
specification gives the impression that an approximate Phillips Curve operates: the coefficient on
lagged wages is 0.955. In other words, the equation is close to being one that could be rewritten
with a pure change in log wage as the dependent variable (which would be literally correct if the
coefficient on the lagged dependent variable were 1.0). The control variables in column 1 are
age, age squared, and the percentage male -- all measured as state averages -- along with twenty
year-dummies to pick up U.S.-wide changes in the labor market. A union density variable is also
included, which enters positively and significantly.

It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that there is a simple regional Phillips Curve in
these data. The addition of a set of state fixed-effects and industry controls has a marked effect
(the industry controls are the proportion of workers in a 2-digit industry in a state-year cell). As
can be seen, in column 2 of Table 1, the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable drops to
0.6990. This means, solving out for the steady-state level of wages, that the long run
unemployment elasticity of wages is now estimated at -0.08. This number is obtained by
dividing –0.0246 by 1 – 0.6990.



7   Year 1979 has to be omitted because it is needed to generate the lagged dependent variable.




                                                          11
This is evidence of a U.S. wage curve. At -0.08, its elasticity is the same as in the wage-curve
literature summarized above. Nevertheless, Column 2 of Table 1 exhibits a considerable amount
of autoregression in pay, and Blanchard and Katz (1997) and others make a valuable point in
drawing attention to some Phillips-like effects in regional wages in the United States.

Although our paper goes on to consider many variations and checks, there is a sense in which the
main point emerges from this simple comparison of the first two columns of Table 1. Column 1
appears to be a Phillips Curve, but is specified too simply. Column 2, a fuller specification, is
consistent with the kinds of wage curves that have been found in other countries. However,
compared with some nations, the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable in the U.S. is high.

The level of state unemployment benefit enters positively and significantly in these, and later,
wage equations. As far as we are aware, this finding is a new one. The same result holds true if
the b variable is entered as a benefit/pay replacement ratio (this ratio can be obtained from the
same data source and is defined as the average weekly benefits/average weekly wages in the state
from UI records). Ideally there should be an instrument for b, but here we have to treat benefits
as exogenous. Table 2’s second column also finds that higher union density in a state is
associated with higher wages in that state, ceteris paribus.8

Column 3 of Table 1 switches to include the log, rather than the level, of benefits. The change
makes little difference. The size of the effects from benefits in column 3 seems plausible: a 100
per cent increase in the amount of benefit increases hourly wages in the long run by
approximately 15 per cent.

In line with the theoretical framework outlined earlier, it is necessary to address the endogeneity
of wages and unemployment. Column 4 of Table 1 begins this. It is estimated by Two Stage
Least Squares (2SLS) and instruments the log of the unemployment rate with one and two lags of
itself. Instrumenting produces a noticeable change in the size of the effects. Comparing Column
4 to Column 2, the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is approximately the same, but
the coefficient on unemployment has almost doubled in absolute value. As a result, the estimated
value of the long run unemployment elasticity of pay rises in absolute value to close to -0.16.

Adding in state-specific time trends, as done by Bell, Nickell and Quintini (2002) for Great
Britain, turns out to reduce the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable still further. This is
done in Column 5 of Table 1. Here, although still statistically well determined, the estimated
size of the unemployment elasticity of pay is only approximately -0.03. However, no
instrumenting is done in column 5.

Within Table 1, Columns 6 and 7 provide the fullest specifications. The unemployment variable
is instrumented; an unemployment benefits measure is included as an independent variable;
union density is included; there are year dummies, industry controls, state dummies, and state
time trends. In both columns, the unemployment elasticity of pay is estimated at approximately -
0.1. Given their completeness, it might be natural to view these as the most compelling
specifications.

8   See also, for example, Hirsch and Schumacher (2004) and Blanchflower and Bryson (2003, 2004).




                                                        12
An alternative to estimation with year dummies is to include instead the aggregate wage in the
United States (see Blanchard and Katz, 1999). This turns out here to make relatively little
difference. Estimates of this kind using the private sector hourly wage of production workers,
based around a version of Table 1, are given in Appendix 2a using both OLS (column 1) and
GLS (column 2). The results are the same. We also experimented with the private sector
weekly wage of production workers and obtained similar results. For completeness, to allow for
the possibility of endogeneity of the benefits variable, b, columns 3 and 4 in Appendix Table 2a
report a version of Table 1 with that variable omitted; there is still evidence of a wage curve
whether OLS or GLS is used (columns 3 and 4 respectively).

How robust is the wage curve?

We now attempt to probe the robustness of the -0.1 finding.

Tables 2 and 3 perform simple experiments. In each table the sample is first restricted to Right-
to-Work (RTW) and then to non-RTW states.9 In effect, this is a division between states where
unionism is weak and where it is stronger. Second, the sample is split into halves, and equation
estimates are reported separately for the periods 1980-1991 and 1992-2002. Third, education
controls are added. Table 2 uses OLS; Table 3 instruments the unemployment rate with its first
two lags.

Interestingly, the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable in Table 2 is lower in RTW states
than it is in non-RTW states. This may in part be because union contracts are traditionally for a
period of two or three years, so in this sector there is automatically a degree of autoregression. In
Table 2 the long run unemployment elasticity of wages changes a little: it is –0.05 in Column 1
and –0.08 in Column 2. Barth et al (2002a, b) argue that wage flexibility is greater in the non-
union sector in the US. Indeed, they state that there is no wage curve for their sample of union
workers. However, their work had to rely on fairly small cell-sizes in the union sector. This is
likely to be a particular problem in the southern RTW states where union membership is low.

Adding education controls -- again these are averages at the state level -- into Table 2 reduces the
unemployment elasticity of pay to a value of –0.04 in Column 3. There is, however, no
completely consistent way to control for educational levels; there was a change in the CPS
education question from 1992.

When the data are divided into two time periods, an interesting outcome is produced. This
division is done in Columns 3 to 6 in Table 2. The lagged dependent variable is found to have a
markedly smaller coefficient in the second period (that is, for the years 1992-2001) than in the
first (period 1980-91). Moreover, in Column 4, the coefficient on the local unemployment rate is
almost exactly zero. However, these estimates ignore the potential problem of simultaneity, and
the statistical significance of the joblessness variable returns when the variable is instrumented.


9 The Right-To-Work (RTW) states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wyoming and Utah. For details see http://www.nrtw.org/rtws.htm.



                                                     13
Endogeneity of unemployment is allowed for in the columns of Table 3. Across specifications,
the long-run unemployment elasticity of the wage curve varies from a low of –0.06 to a high of –
0.14. The fullest specification, and probably the most reliable, is in Columns 5 and 6. State time
trends are included. So too are year dummies, industry controls, state fixed-effect dummies, and
in Column 6 of Table 3 also education controls. In the first period, the unemployment elasticity
of pay is estimated at -0.07. In the later period, the elasticity is -0.12. It seems best simply to
conclude that these estimates cluster around –0.1.

Table 4 now explores the sensitivity of the results to measurement error by instrumenting the
lagged dependent variable itself. The approach follows that of Staiger, Stock and Watson (2002).
To obtain an instrument, the authors’ paper exploits the fact that the ORG files are obtained
monthly.

A suitable instrument must be correlated with lagged pay but uncorrelated with the other
variables in the wage equation. Our approach relies on the fact that the data set is collected
throughout each calendar year. We create two wage variables. One averages the pay data in
even months (i.e., February, April, June and so on). The other is an average of pay in the odd
months. This is done to overcome the problem that, as many states have small numbers of CPS
respondents, estimated wage equations can exhibit errors-in-variables bias.

Staiger et al (2002) split the monthly ORG files into these two independent samples (although
households appear twice in the survey, the odd and even months have no households in
common). Their innovative suggestion is this:

       "Estimates from both the odd and even month samples will be measured with
       error, but because the samples are randomly drawn, the estimation error is
       independent in these two samples. Thus one set of estimates can be used as an
       instrument for the other set of samples." (p.39, 2003).

A number of possibilities exist, so we go further and obtain separate wage estimates for
individuals in the CPS in (a) the odd months, (b) the even months, (c) the first six months, (d) the
second six months, (e) the first and third quarters, and (f) the second and fourth quarters. All
should be valid instruments. A further question that needs to be addressed is whether it is
appropriate to instrument the odd months with the even, as Staiger et al (2002) do, or vice versa.

Table 4 presents various specifications. The most persuasive equations are in part C of the table,
but the others are presented for completeness. Table 4 has three parts: the first, A, where
industry dummies are not included as controls; part B where they are; and part C which includes
state time trends and industry controls. Interestingly, the lagged dependent variable has a bigger
coefficient when the evens are used to instrument the odds than when the reverse is true. A
similar picture emerges when the two halves or the quarters are used; the use of past values to
instrument current values generates a smaller coefficient on the lag on the dependent variable.

Table 4 deliberately presents a battery of estimates to show how the results move away from a
lagged dependent variable approximately equal to unity. If the past affects the future only
through the present, then instrumenting the present with the past would seem appropriate and the



                                                14
cleanest way to do so is to instrument the second six months with the first six months. Our
preferred specification in Table 4 is therefore row 4 in part C where the even months are
instrumented with the odd months. Here the lagged dependent variable has a coefficient of 0.60
and the estimated long run unemployment elasticity of wages is approximately -0.075.

Table 5 goes a little further. It reports results where the lagged dependent variable wt-1 and the
unemployment rate Ut are both instrumented. Table 5’s aim is to try to correct, within the same
estimating equation, for the endogeneity of unemployment and measurement error in the
dependent variable. In the equations of Table 5, the dependent variable is derived from the
second six months of CPS data, January-June. Then the lagged dependent variable is itself
instrumented with the wage derived by averaging data from the first six months, July-December.
As before, the unemployment rate in time t is instrumented with the unemployment rates at t-1
and t-2.

The coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is approximately 0.81 in the first column of
Table 5. It has a small standard error, and a (Phillips Curve) null hypothesis of unity is still
comfortably rejected at normal significance levels. Column 2 of Table 5 adds state time-trends.
Once this is done, the coefficient on wt-1 drops to approximately 0.71. As before, there appears
to be some difference between the right-to-work (RTW) states and the non-RTW states. The
coefficients on the lagged dependent variable are noticeably different between columns 3 and 4
and 5 and 6. The addition of state time-trends has a noticeably large impact in the sample of
RTW states, whereas in non-RTW states the results in columns 5 and 6 are similar to one
another. The long run unemployment elasticity of wages is somewhat lower in the RTW states.

Another experiment is to alter the nature of the dependent variable. Up to this stage, the
estimation in the paper has used data on hourly wages. It is a matter of judgment whether a pay
variable is better defined as hourly or annual. While theoretical economics might favor an hourly
variable, there are practical disadvantages in empirical work. Most American workers are not
paid by the hour and are not aware of their own hourly wage rate but they do know their annual
pay. Annual earnings data are reported in the CPS in March of each year. Annual earnings are
reported on a worker's W2 form from their employer, which also appears on the individual's tax
return filed in April of each year.

From Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a), Blanchard and Katz (1997), and Card (1995), it is
known that wage curves estimated with annual pay variables tend to exhibit relatively little
autoregression. To explore this in the latest data, Table 6 switches to annual earnings as a
dependent variable. The table draws upon data from the Annual Demographic March files of the
CPS. These files contain information on each interviewed worker’s earnings in the preceding
year. We calculate weighted averages of earnings, using the earnwt variable, and map that to our
file. This is done at the level of the state/year cell. Other control variables, including age, gender
and industry, are derived from the ORG files and are the same as those used previously in Tables
2-4. Data are available on the numbers of weeks worked during the preceding year and the usual
hours. In Table 6, columns 1-4, 6 and 7 are pay equations estimated for full-time/full-year
workers, defined as those who worked for 52 weeks and at least 35 hours per week. In columns
5 and 8 of Table 6 we impose no such restrictions and use the level of wages in the region.
Sample sizes for state/year cells range from an average of 760 workers in Vermont to 6,527 in



                                                 15
California. Overall, sample sizes are smaller in the March files than in the ORGs; they average
about 75,000 cases in the former case and 165,000 in the latter. To deal with the possibility that
small sample sizes might be responsible for the results, in columns 4 and 5 a set of weighted
estimates are also given. These use as weights the cell counts obtained when we averaged.
Reassuringly, weighting turns out to have a negligible effect.

Table 6’s results are fairly strong. In all but one column there is a well-determined effect from
local unemployment upon the level of pay. The estimates of the long-run unemployment
elasticity in Table 6 are generally consistent with, though a little lower than, those obtained in
Tables 2-5. They range here from -0.02 to -0.12. As in previous research, the coefficient on the
lagged dependent variable is smaller than in the ORGs. Including state effects, year effects and
industry controls, the coefficient on wt-1 is around 0.35. Adding in state time-trends reduces the
lagged coefficient on the wage still further, to around 0.13, whether OLS or GLS is used.
Average weekly benefits remain strongly significant at conventional levels, and positive in all
specifications.

Appendix Table 2b explores a number of other issues.

First, it examines the extent of any bias when estimation does not take account of the fact that a
significant proportion of wage observations in the ORGs are imputed. Column 1 of this Table is
the equivalent of column 2 of Table 1; column 2 of Appendix Table 2b takes the same
specification but now includes all observations of the wage, whether imputed or not. The bias
from including the imputed observations appears to be miniscule.

Second, we use an alternative estimation method. Developed by Blanchard and Katz (1997), it
involves a two-stage procedure. At the first stage a wage equation is estimated in each year with
a number of controls included to distinguish differences in worker and workplace characteristics,
and the coefficients on the state dummy variables are then used at the second stage. In five of the
six specifications that Katz and Blanchard (1997) report in their Table 2, they do not include any
average worker or workplace controls at the second stage; when they do, the size of the lagged
dependent variable falls from .633 to .258 when the March CPS (1980-1991) is used. Column 3
of Appendix Table 2b provides the results using their two-stage procedure with the same set of
controls as used in column 2 also with the imputed data excluded for the period 1980-2001.
Now the lag is .744 with industry controls included, and comparable to the result in column 1,
with a long-run elasticity of -.11. In column 4, the coefficient on the lagged wage is higher when
the industry variables are excluded. Omitting the age and gender variables, in column 5 of
Appendix Table 2b, has little further impact.

If the sample is restricted to the years 1980-1991 that were available to Blanchard and Katz, and
we include only non-imputed data at the first stage, and only year and state dummies as
additional controls at the second stage, we get exactly the result they obtained in column 3 of
their table. As can be seen below, the results are different when either more years or more
controls are added at the second stage or both (controls are as in Appendix Table 2b, column 2).

Third, Doug Staiger has suggested to us that if wages genuinely follow a random walk, and there
are no state-level effects on wages from variables like climate or regional prices, then any
specification with state-specific parameters (e.g. state fixed effects or state time trends) will be
biased toward finding a wage curve. An analogy is to running spurious regressions in time series
analysis. Supposing that Y follows a random walk:

Yt = Yt-1 + et,

then, if we run the regression,

Yt = b0 + b1Yt-1 + et

the coefficient on b1 is biased downward below 1, and the usual OLS test of b1=1 over-rejects.
This problem is worse if we include a time trend on the right hand side. In the state data, the
analogy is that when we include state dummies or state-specific time trends, the coefficient on
the lag is biased down. The size of such bias is uncertain. Columns 6 and 7 of Appendix Table
2b are two simple ways of addressing this, but are suggestive only. Column 6 replaces the state
fixed-effects with the long-run average of the log unemployment rate for the period 1979-2003,
while column 7 uses a 19 year moving average of state unemployment rates -- a 19 year average
is used because we have data back only as far as 1960. These variables enter positively, as we
found earlier, suggesting a version of Harris-Todaro compensating differentials. The lag on the
dependent variable is now .839 with a long-run elasticity of -.17 and -.15 respectively.
Evidence of a US wage curve remains.

Unemployment equations

Lying behind each of these wage equations is, implicitly, an unemployment equation.               As
explained earlier in the paper, it takes the form Ut = (Ut-1, Ut-2, wt, controls).

The natural justification for this form is to define area unemployment as U = P(wt, controls) –
N(wt, controls) where P is the participation rate in the area and N is the level of employment
demand in the area. We assume the customary AR(2) form of an employment function, and also
that participation is a non-decreasing function of the wage in the area. Then the unemployment
rate in a state, in time period t, is a function of itself lagged twice and of the current wage rate.
With these assumptions, the wage should enter positively in the estimated unemployment
equation. The greater is the price of labor, the lower will be the level of labor demand and the
higher the degree of labor force participation, and so, other factors constant, the higher will be
the unemployment rate.

In principle the wage variable inside the unemployment equations should be in real rather than
nominal terms, which means that annual state-level price indexes are required. Such data do not



                                                17
exist. However, subject to the assumption that there are not significant variations in the state
structure of prices, year-dummies can be used as an alternative.

It is useful to study the exact empirical structure of this unemployment equation when fitted to
US data over the period. Table 7 does so. The table models the log of the unemployment rate in
the state/year cell for the period 1980 to 2002. This effectively treats US states as a panel.

A central concern of the analysis here is whether well-behaved unemployment equations can be
estimated once both state fixed-effects and year effects are incorporated. There appears to have
been little attempt before in the U.S. literature to estimate such equations. The well-known paper
by Blanchard and Katz (1992) on regional evolutions comes close to this, but it focuses primarily
on employment rather than unemployment data per se.

Table 7 presents a selection of state unemployment equations. It includes controls for workers’
age and its square, gender, the log of hourly and annual pay, and union density in the state.

Extra controls are added as we move across the columns of Table 7. In later columns, in line
with the theoretical framework, the level of pay is instrumented using the state benefits level.
Column 1 contains only year dummies. The coefficient on the first of the two lagged dependent
variables is approximately 0.9. Hourly pay is positive but poorly determined. Union density has
no effect. Column 2 of Table 7 adds state fixed-effects into the specification. Once this is done,
the unemployment equation begins to take the form that might be expected from economic
theory. Unemployment is autoregressive: Ut-1 enters with a coefficient of approximately 0.8 and
Ut-2 with a coefficient of approximately -0.08. Log hourly pay now has a large and well-
determined positive coefficient. The coefficient on union density is positive, although the t-
statistic remains weak. These results are consistent with an inverted labor demand function.

It is natural to examine the implied long run elasticity. Column 2 of Table 7 can be solved out, in
the usual way, for a steady-state logarithmic equation in which the wage elasticity of
unemployment is approximately 0.6.

Column 3 of Table 7 introduces 44 industry dummies. The size of the union density effect
increases and becomes significantly different from zero at the 5% level. The second lag on
unemployment loses significance. As an experiment, column 4 replaces the hourly pay variable
from the ORGs with the annual pay variable taken from the March CPS data. The pay variable
remains significant at the 5% level.

In Table 7, columns 5 through 7, the unemployment equations are estimated with 2SLS. The pay
variables are instrumented by the state’s average weekly benefit. This correction for endogeneity
has the effect of markedly increasing the coefficient on pay in an unemployment equation. It also
reduces the size of the Ut-2 effect. The coefficient on union density is then poorly determined in
all later specifications. Layard, Nickell and Jackman (1991) and OECD (1994) have argued that
high levels of unionization are part of the explanation for differences in unemployment across
countries.10 Whatever the evidence across countries, it does not seem, controlling for the wage,

                                                      18
that there is reliable evidence for this claim across the states of the USA. However, we have not
attempted to explore the reduced-form effects of unions.

6. Empirical Results on Happiness and Job-Finding

This section presents evidence that can be viewed as complementary to the earlier wage
equations. It uses subjective data to explore how workers’ wellbeing and perceptions are
influenced by the local rate of unemployment.

Implicit in the paper’s analytical approach to the labor market are two building blocks. One is
the idea that a rise in local unemployment weakens workers’ utility relative to employers’ utility.
To be more specific, the expected utility level of a worker should, according to the theory, be
lower in areas where unemployment is high. The reason is that in such areas the typical
employee is more fearful of job loss. Such a prediction is captured in the theoretical equation 1
given earlier in the paper (because the level of expected utility is a decreasing function of
unemployment, U). Second, the worker’s perceived chance of finding another job if laid off is,
according to the theory, a declining function of the local unemployment rate. In principle, both
these ideas can be checked empirically. The problem in practice is the availability of appropriate
data.

We test these two hypotheses by using information on reported happiness and on workers’ job-
finding perceptions. We draw upon data from the General Social Survey (GSS) series for the
United States. Although still little used by economists, the GSS contains useful data on workers’
attitudes and subjective wellbeing.

Happiness data in the GSS are available for most of the years between 1972 and 2002 (there were
no surveys conducted in 1979, 1981, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001). We were able to map
onto the survey series the state/year unemployment rates.11 Data are available in 45 states;
surveys have not been conducted in 6 small states (Maine, Hawaii, New Mexico, Nebraska,
Idaho and Nevada).

First, we estimate a series of happiness equations based upon the specifications used -- for a
different purpose -- in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004). The specific focus here is upon
workers’ subjective wellbeing and on how that is shaped by the state of the local labor market.
Second, we explore a variable measuring an individual's fear of unemployment, and again
attempt to see how it is affected by labor-market conditions.

In the GSS, respondents are asked to report their levels of subjective wellbeing. The question
asked is:

        Taken all together, how would you say things are these days -- would you say that
        you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?



11 We are grateful to Tom W. Smith at NORC for giving us permission to use, and providing us with, the state level
codes that allowed us to map in the state/year unemployment rates.



                                                       19
On average, between 1972 and 2002, approximately 32% of respondents said they were very
happy, 56% were pretty happy, and 12% not too happy. We treat this as a dependent variable.

The first two columns of Table 8 estimate ordered logit happiness equations for the pooled years
1972-1998. State dummies and year dummies are included. Because of the inclusion of the state
unemployment rate in an equation estimated at the level of the individual, standard errors are
adjusted for clustering at the state level.

For the sake of completeness, the first column of Table 8 estimates a happiness equation for the
full GSS sample, that is, one including non-workers. The log of the local unemployment rate
here enters negatively, with a t-statistic of 1.78. In other words, Americans who live in a state
with higher unemployment report lower happiness scores, but this effect is not quite statistically
significant at the 5% level.

When the sample is restricted to workers, however, in column 2 of Table 8, it can be seen that the
unemployment effect becomes better determined. The coefficient is now –0.17 with a t-statistic
of 2.19. Although the coefficients in ordered logits are not straightforward to interpret, it can be
checked that this implies that higher unemployment in the area makes employees systematically
less likely to report themselves in the two happier categories of the GSS survey responses. This
is consistent with the conceptual framework sketched earlier.

In Table 8, therefore, where pay is deliberately omitted from the equation, a higher local
unemployment rate is associated with a lower reported level of workers' ‘utility’. This finding is
similar to that in country-level data, as discussed in Di Tella, MacCulloch and Oswald (2001)
and Oswald (1997a). It also seems consistent with UK results, of a different kind, on ‘fear’ of
unemployment in Blanchflower (1991).

Column 3 of Table 8 estimates an ordered logit where the dependent variable is employee
responses to the following question.

       "About how easy would it be for you to find a job with another employer with
       approximately the same income and fringes you now have? Would you say very
       easy, somewhat easy or not easy at all?"

Responses vary cyclically over time and, consistent with common sense, appear to be negatively
correlated with the aggregate unemployment rate.

Data on this survey question are available only for the years 1977, 1978, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986,
1989-1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. The percentage of people saying it would
be 'very easy' to find a job was highest in 2000, when the US unemployment rate was lowest at
4%. Conversely, the proportion saying it was 'not easy' was highest in 1982, when
unemployment was at its peak of 9.7%.

Column 3 of Table 8 estimates an ordered logit where the dependent variable is the individual’s
perception of how easy it would be to find a comparable job elsewhere. This is a subjective
variable, of course, but it seems potentially of interest. The estimated perceived-chance-of-
finding-a-job equation is an attempt to show how fear of unemployment (or more precisely, the
local rate of unemployment) works: it influences workers' feelings about the probability of
finding a new job. Such a finding is required if the conceptual framework proposed for the wage
curve is the correct one. Standard errors are once again adjusted for clustering. The likelihood-
of-finding-a-job equation captures the subjective probability of getting work and has a negative
gradient with respect to the state unemployment rate. With a t-statistic of 4.79, the impact of the
log of state unemployment in column 3 of Table 8 is a well-determined one. This finding is
consistent with one part of the wage-curve framework.

The fact that the log of state unemployment enters significantly and negatively is compatible with
results in Blanchflower and Oswald (1999) and Schmidt (1999). A greater rate of joblessness in
the worker’s region leads, it might be said, to a diminution of that worker’s power relative to the
firm. As local unemployment rises, workers become less confident about being able to secure a
position with another employer.

Although the data used in this section are of a more subjective kind than used by most labor
economists, they paint a picture that is consistent with the analytical foundations of the wage-
curve. Unemployment in the local area acts to lower workers’ reported happiness and to reduce
an individual’s perceived chance of finding a job.

7. Conclusion

Economics has few empirical laws. It is important to know if the wage curve qualifies as one.
Although evidence for such a curve has been found in more than 40 countries, the existence of a
wage curve in United States data has been viewed as more controversial.

The estimates in this paper use a longer period of data than has been possible before. It also
attempts to correct for endogeneity and measurement error. The paper finds -- consistent with an



                                               21
efficiency-wage framework -- that wages are lower in U.S. states with higher unemployment. As
has been discovered in many other nations, this wage curve has a long run elasticity of
approximately –0.1.

A number of other results emerge. They are compatible with the theoretical framework proposed
in the paper.

   Wages are greater in states with more generous unemployment benefits.

   The higher is the unemployment rate in a state, the lower are the levels of happiness reported
   by workers in that state.

   The higher the unemployment rate in a state, the lower is the typical worker’s perceived
   chance of finding a job.

   Evidence for the wage curve is particularly strong in non-union (Right-to-Work) states.

   Except in isolated specifications, there is not persuasive support for a simple Phillips curve.
   It seems more sensible to view the data as being characterized by dynamic fluctuations
   around a long-run wage curve. State wages in the United States are autoregressive (as
   explained in Card and Hyslop, 1997, and Blanchard and Katz, 1997), but not extremely so.
   In many specifications, the coefficient on a lagged dependent variable is 0.5 or smaller.

This paper’s results seem consistent with the empirical law proposed in Blanchflower and
Oswald (1994a). The United States has a wage curve.

Notes: the mean wages were calculated using the earnwt variable and excluding any individual whose earnings were allocated using the I25d variable. The
exclusion was not used in 1994 and 1995 as the wage allocation variable I25d is not available in 1994 and for only 1/3rd of the months in 1995. T-statistics are

Notes: the log of the unemployment rate is instrumented with its 1 year and 2 year lags. All equations also include the averages of age, age squared and gender
in each state/year cell. Source: weekly wage benefit amount available from Unemployment Insurance Financial Data Handbook published by the U.S.
Department of Labor Employment & Training Administration. Data are downloadable at http://atlas.doleta.gov/XDMS/indexfrm.xml for years up to 1997 and
subsequently at http://atlas.doleta.gov/XDMS/indexfrm.xml. State level union density rates are obtained from Union membership and earnings: data book by
Barry Hirsch and David Macpherson and downloadable at http://www.unionstats.com/. All other data are weighted averages in each state/year cell obtained
from the March CPS files 1981-2002. Data relate to the preceding year so data for 2001 are obtained from the March 2002 Annual Demographic file. Full-
time full year includes only individuals who worked 52 weeks and usually worked >=35 hours per week. t-statistics are in parentheses.

Notes: controls are as in Table 1. Column 1 is from Table 1 column 2. Two-stage procedure involves running a first stage regression
and extracting the mean wage residual (coefficient on the state dummy variable). Controls at the first stage for 1979-1991 are age
and its square, gender, years of education, 4 race dummies and 45 industry dummies. After 1991, years of education is replaced with
16 highest qualification dummies and 5 race dummies. Average log unemployment is the average for each state from 1979-2003.
