              INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES:
                         SCOPE, METHODS, AND EFFECTS

                                  ABSTRACT




     This paper discusses the scope, methods, the effects of international
coordination of economic policies. In addressing the scope for and of
                                                                  barriers
coordination, the analysis covers the rationale for coordination,
to coordination, the range and specificity of policies to be coordinated,

the frequency of coordination, and the size of the coordinating group. Turning
to the methods of coordination, the emphasis is on the broad issues of rules
versus discretion, single-indicator versus multi-indicator   approaches, and

hegemonic versus more symmetric systems.
     In an attempt to shed some light on the effects of alternative rule-
based proposals for coordination, we present some simulations of a global
macroeconomic model (MULTIMQD) developed in the International Monetary Fund.
The simulations considered range from 'smoothing    rules for monetary and

fiscal policy that imply only minimal international coordination, to more
activist "target—zone" proposals that place greater restrictions on national
authorities in the conduct of monetary and/or fiscal policies.     The simulation

results are compared to the actual evolution of the world economy over the
1974—87 period. Our findings suggest that simple mechanistic rule—based

proposals are unlikely to lead to improved performance.

I      Scope for and of Coordination


       The most logical    atarting point ia to ask why international policy

coordination would be beneficial in the first place.         After   all, if in
the   domestic economy, the working of the invisible hand under pure

competition     translates independent decentralized    decisions into a

social optimum why should not the same principle apply to policy

decisions by     countries in the world economy?
       The answer   is   that economic policy actions, particularly those of
larger countries, create quantitatively significant spillover effects
or externalities for other countries, and that a global optimum

requires that such externalities be taken into account in the decision—
making calculus. 3/ Coordination is then best seen as a facilitating
mechanism     for internalizing these externalities.
       This   conclusion can perhaps be better appreciated by emphasizing

the departures from the competitive model in today's global          5cy•
Cooper (1987) has identified several such departures, and his analysis

merits some extension here.

       Unlike the atomistic economic agents of the competitive model who

base their consumption and      production decisions on prices   that are   beyond

their control, larger countries exercise       a   certain degree of influence
over   prices, including the real exchange     rate.   This of course raises

the specter that they will manipulate such prices to their         own   advantage
and at the expense of others. Two examples are frequently          cited——one

dealing with inflation, and the other with real output and employment.
Under floating rates, a Mundellian (1971) policy mix of tight monetary
                                          —4—



and   loose fiscal policy allows an appreciated        currency to enhance

a country's disinflationary policy strategy——but            at the cost of

making it harder for trading partners to realize their own           disinflation
targets.       Similarly,   under conditions of high capital mobility and

sticky nominal wages, a monetary expansion under floating rates

leads    to   a real depreciation and to an expansion of output and

employment       at home.   But the flip side of the coin is that output

and employment contract abroad. 4/         Seen in this light, the role of

coordination is to prevent——or to minimize——such intentional as well

as unintentionel       "beggar—thy—neighbor"   practices.    Most international

monetary constitutions       have injunctions against "manipulating" exchange

rates    or international reserves.
         existence of public goods——and their role in the resolution
        The
of inconsistencies among policy targets——constitute a second important
point of departure from the competitive model.          When   there are   N

currencies,      there can be only N—I independent    exchange   rate targets.

Similarly,     not all countries   can achieve independently set targets

for current account surpluses.

provide no     justification for intervention. 5/ Much as in the coapetitive
model,    the economic system will generate signals——in the form of changes

in exchange rates, interest rates, prices, and incomes——that will lead

to an adjustment      of targets such that they eventually become consistent.

If,   however,    the path to consistency involves large swings in real

is   the notion that a certain degree of stability in real exchange rates
and an open international trading and financial system are valued in and
of themselves, i.e., they are public goods (in contrast, the market
signals that resolve supply/demand inconsistencies in the competitive
model, are not regarded as public goods). If
                                              that is accepted, there is

a positive role for coordination, both to identify target Inconsistencies
at an early stage and to resolve them in ways that do not produce too
little    of the public good(s). 6/         It   is of course possible for groups

of countries who value the public good highly to attempt to obtain more

of it by setting up "regional zones of exchange rate stability or of

will loosen the external constraint and permit each country to move

closer to internal balance.

     All of this establishes a presumption that there can be valid

reasons for deviating from the tradition of decentralized decision—

making when it comes to economic policy, that is, that there is scope

for coordination.      This presumption   is reinforced by two empirical

observations.   The first is that the world economy of 1988 is

considerably more open and integrated than that of 1950, or 1960, or

even of 1970.   Not only have simple ratios of imports or exports      to

GNP increased but also——and probably more fundamentally——areglobal

capital markets more integrated. 9/       With larger spillovers, there is

more at stake in how one manages interdependence. Second, there is by

now widespread recognition that the insulating properties of floating

exchange rates are more modest than was suspected prior to their

introduction in 1973. 10/

     But a presumption that cooperation could be beneficial       is not    the

same as a guarantee——nor does it preclude the existence of sometimes

formidable obstacles    to its implementation.

     Suppose national policymakars have a predilection for inflationary

policies but are restrained from implementing them by the concern that

relatively expansionary mooetary policy will bring on a devaluation

(or depreciation).     Yet, as outlined by Rogoff (1985), if all countries

pursue such inflationary policies simultaneously, none has to worry

about the threat of devaluation. Here, coordination may actually

weaken discipline by easing the balance of payments constraint.        In a
                                          —7


similar vein, as noted by Feldatein (1988) there is the potential risk

that a coordinated attempt     to stabilize     a pattern of nominal or real

exchange rates could take place at an inappropriately high aggregate

rate of inflation.      The proposals put forward by U.S. Treasury Secretary

Baker and U.K.    Chancellor Lawson, at the 1987 Annual Meetings of the

Fund and the World Bank, for a couatodity—price—baaket             indicator   as a

potential 'early—warning" signal of emerging aggregate price developments,

addresses   just such a concern. 11/       Equally troublesome would be a

coordination of fiscal policies that yielded an aggregate fiscal deficit

for the larger countries that put undue upward pressure on world interest

rates.   The basic point is straightforward: there is nothing in the

coordination process in and of itself that reduces the importance of

sound macroeconomic policiea.      12/    There can be coordination around

good policies and coordination around bad ones——just as with the exchange

rate regime,   where there are good fixes and bad fixes, and good floats

and bad floats.   13/   Welfare improvements are not automatic.

     It is only realistic,    too,   to   acknowledge that there are barriers

to the exercise of coordination. Four of the more prominent               ones are

worth mentioning. 14/     First,   international policy bargains that involve

shared objectives can be frustrated if some policy instruments are

treated as objectives in themselves.           Schultze   (1988), for example,

offers the view that ft would have been difficult            to   have reached a

bargain on target zones for exchange rates in the early l9BOs given

President   Reagan's twin commitmenta to increased defense spending and
                                          —8—

cutting taxes.     In some other countries,     the constraints    on policy

instruments may    lie in different areas——includingstructural            policies——

but   the implications are the same.
      Second,   there can at times   be   sharp disagreements    among    countries
about the    effects that policy changes have     on    policy targets.     In   some

cases,   these differences   may extend beyond the size to even the sign

of various policy—impact multipliers. 15/         The harder it is to agree on

how   the world works,   the harder it is to reach agreement on a jointly
designed    set of policies.
      Third, while most countries have experienced a marked increaae                in
openness over the past few decades, there remain huge cross—country
differences in the degree of interdependence. Large countries——the
United States being the classic case in point——are generally less
affected    by other countries'   policies than small ones.       Coordination——

as Bryant (1987) has recently emphasized——is not a matter of altruism.

It is rather the manifestation of mutual self interest.            To the extent

that large countries     are less beset by spillovers and feedbacks          than

small ones,     the former's incentive to coordinate on a continuous basis

may be lower. 16/       In this regard,   the high degree of trade interdependence

shared by members of the European Monetary System (EMS) can be seen as

a positive factor in reinforcing incentives        to coordinate in that group.


      Finally, as Polak (1981) has reminded       us,    in terms of national

priorities,     international bargaining typically comes after domestic

bargaining.     More   specifically, the   compromise    of growth and inflation
objectives    at the national level may leave little room for further

compromise    on demand measures   at the international level.
                                            —9—

       These bsrriers      to coordination should not be overestimated: one

of the clearest examples of true coordination——the                 Bonn Economic

Summit of 1978——occurred just when domestic bargaining over the same

issues was most intense; 17/ the growing integration of capital

markets——of    which the global stock market crash of October             1987 is but

one reminder——has brought       the implications of interdependence          home   to
even large countries; and continued empirical work on multi—country
models should be       able progressively to whittle        down   the margin of
disagreement       on the effects of policies.      Still, ss readers of Sherlock

Holmes will be awsre, sometimes the most telling clue is that the

hounds didn'   t   bark.   If the scope for coordination is to expand beyond

the efforta of the past,       these obstacles     will need to be overcome.

       Turning from the scope        for to the scope of coordination,       a

key issue concerns the apprnpriate range and depth of policies to be

coordinated.

       The case for aupporting a wide—ranging,            multi—issue appruach to

coordination is that it increases the probability of concluding some

policy bargains      that benefit all parties,      18/    that favorable spillover

effecta are generated across negotiating           issues, and that improved

economic performance today depends as much on trade and structural

policies   as on exchange—rate and demand      policies. Exhibit k is the
Bonn Economic Summit       of 1978   where commitments to accelerate growth
by   Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany were exchanged for a
commitment by      the United States    to come   to grips with its inflation

and oil problems,      and where agreement    on macroeconomic and energy

policies    has been credited with reinforcing progress on the Tokyo

Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.            19/

     The defense of a narrower approach to coordination rests on the

arguments    that negotiation   costs rise rapidly with the spread of

Issues under consideration,      20/ that prospects for implementation

of agreements dim as the number of jurisdictional spheres expands (i.e.,

Finance Ministers can negotiate agreements but fiscal policy Is typically

the responsibilityof legislatures,       while monetary policy is the province

of Independent central banks); and that heated disputes on some issues

(such as the stance of monetary and fiscal policIes)               can frustrate   the

chance for agreements in other areas (like defense and foreign assistance)

where coordination might be more fruitful.           21/   In addition, a case

could be made that coordination      is only likely        n areas    where there is

a consensus    about   the effects of common policIes.       22/

     In view of these conflicting considerations,            it is hard to fault


present institutional      practices on the range of coordination.           Those

practices    entail high—frequency coordination on narrow issues in a

multitude of fora (such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the

Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (DECO), the Bank

of International Settlements (815), and the General Agreement of Tariffs

and Trade (GATT); 23/ less frequent (say, biannual) and wider               coordna—

tion at a higher level in more limited fora (such as the LMF's Interim

              or the Group of Seven major industrial countries);            and even
Committee,

less frequent (annual), wider—yet coordInation at the highest level

(heads of state and of governments at the economic summits).                Thus,

                                           11   —




there are occasional opportunities for multi—issue bargaining, but
without the exponential increase in negotiation costs that might ensue
if this were the order of the day. All in all, probably not a bad
compromise.
       The   depth" of coordination covers the degree of             specificity
and   disaggregation within a given policy area.            Here,    two issues arise——

one dealing with fiscal policy, and the other with structural policies.

A   strong implication of recent research is that aggregate measures,

such as the central or general—government fiscal deficit, are not

likely to be a good guide to the effects of fiscal policies on macro-

economic variables such as the current account, the exchange rate, and

the rate of interest.   24/    The reason is that such effects depend on

how the deficit is altered: that is, taxes versus expenditures,               expen-

ditures on tradables versus nontradables,           taxes   on investment versus

those on saving, fiscal action by a country with a current account

surplus versus a deficit,     and anticipated versus unanticipated           policies.

This suggests that mote specificity in coordination——quiteapart from

its positive effect on the ability to monitor the implementation of

agreed—on policies——would     be desirsble. It is notable that the Louvre

Accord of February 1987 smong the Group of Seven specified not only

quantitative tsrgets for budget deficits but also some quantitative

guidelines of how these overall fiscal targets wets to be achieved. 25/

      In the ares of structural policies,       a good case can also be made

for specificity——buton somewhat different grounds.                  Here, coordination

msy often best be interpreted not as the simultsneous spplicstion of the
                                      —   12   —




same policy instrument in different doses or directions across coun-

tries, but rather as the simultaneous application          of different policy

instrumenta——Th/with each country adopting the policy best tailored to

its particular structural weakness. 27/            in some cases, this may imply


reducing impediments    to labor mobility or to market—determined wages;

in others, it may mean increasing incentives for private investment

relative to those for private saving; and in still others, it may mean

changes   n   the trade and distribution system.         The simultaneous appli-

cation of the policy measures across countries may be necessary to

overcome the blocking tactics of domestic pressure groups and to enhance

the credibility of the exercise.     Again,        the depth or specificity of


coordination can be as relevant as the range.

     Another salient issue    concerns the question of when to coordinate.

There has been, and continues to be, wide variation in the frequency

of coordination across different fora——ranging           from one—of—a—kind


meetings like the 1971 smithsonian Conference on exchange rates to

the near continuous discussion and decision making at the Executive

Boards of the LMF and the World Bank.

-    One position is that, given the constraints,           true coordination

cannot be expected to be more than an episodic,           regime—preserving

effort.   Dini (1988) has recently argued that international consider-

ations still play only a small factor in policy making, and that only

at times of crisis is a common interest in coordinated action clearly

recognized.    28/   Some might even go farther and argue that the reservoir

of international compromise should be conserved            for situations when

there is a high probability        of a policy deal and when failure to reach

an agreement would carry a high cost.

     Our view is that both the likelihood and effectiveness of coordi-

nation   will be enhanced   when    it   is   a   regular,    on—going process——and

for at least three reasons. First, the potential for multiperiod
bargaining    expands the opportunities for policy bargains (by facilitating,

for example,   phasing of policy meaaures)             .   What should     count in assess-

ing the gains to coordination is the present discounted value of welfare—

improving    policy agreements over an extended period——not the welfare

change in a single period.         Second, as suggested in the game—theoretic

literature,    the existence of repeated bargaining strengthens                  the role

of reputational    considerations in coordination.               29/   In contrast,   when

coordination is a once—and—for—all or episodic exercise,                    there is a

higher risk that agreed policies will never be implemented because of

the much—discussed problem of time—inconsistency,                  i.e.,    the temptation

to renege on earlier policy commitments                when it    later becomes

advantageous to do so. 30/     To be effective, coordination agreements

need to pass through the market filter of credibility,                     and credibility

is more likely if sticking to the agreement enhances reputation,                      which

in turn allows profitable bargains to be struck in the future.                      Third,

once coordination is established as a routine on—going process,                     there

is apt to be more freedom of policy maneuver for all participants than

when negotiations are conducted in a crisis atmosphere and when dis-

agreements——which after all are inevitable——may be inappropriately

seen as signaling the collapse of coordination itself. 31/

practice does not provide a definitive answer.                 Among

countries,     we have the Group of Seven and the Group of Ten.                 For the


developing countries,           there sre the Group of Twenty—Four and the Group

                                   for including                  the largest industrial
largest externalities. This argues

                            there is the general         proposition   that the costs of

                                     that might endenger the continuity of the
negotiation, and conflicts

 exercise,     increase significantly with the number of players.                 This

 argues    for a relatively small group. Third, and pointing in the
 opposite direction,        a small group runs the risk of concluding policy

                                    the direct participants——but which

 are not satisfactory to those countries not sitting at the

 table. 32/

         In   light of these considerations,         it is worth mentioning two

                                                      of Seven.                       One
 features of recent coordination efforts by the Group

 of them, proposed at the Venice Economic Summit in 1987 and incorporated

 in subsequent coordination meetlogs,            is the addition of aggregate
                                          -15-

indicators    for the Group of Seven as a whole to the list of individual—

country indicators.       Aggregate indicators     for the group may include

such variables       as the growth rate of real GNF and of domestic demand,

the interest rate, the current account position,          and the real exchange

rate.     A strong motivation for such aggregate indicators is that they

can be helpful in gauging the impact of G—7 coordination agreements

and actions among the Group of Seven on the rest—of—the—world,            with

particular reference       to the developing countries.    For example,       it has

been estimated that each 1 percent change in real GNP in the industrial

countries    is associated,    ceteris   paribus, with approximately a    3   percent

change (in the same direction)       of export earnings in developing countries.

Similarly, a     1   percent change in "world    interest rates implies roughly

a S3—4 billion change in net intereat payments by capital importing


developing countries.        In short, aggregate   indicators can be seen aa

an analytical instrument for helping to evaluate whether a given

policy    package for the    larger countries is also in the interest of
others.
        A second notable feature is that the Managing Director of the

Fund participates       in these Group of Seven coordination meetings.          Since

the Fund's membership includes not only the larger industrial countries

but also the smaller industrial countries,          as well as moat of the


developing countries, one rationale for the Managing Director's

participation is that it provides a systemic perspective and evaluation

on proposed policy agreements——while still keeping the meeting small

enough for administrative efficiency.

II   Methods of Coordination

     This section, shifts the focus from whether to coordinate to

how to coordinate.    More specifically,   the advantages and disadvantages

of alternative methods of coordination are discussed, with particular

attention   to the issues of rules versus discretion,   single versus

multi—indicator approaches, and hegemonic versus symmetric systems.

     It is not surprising that many of the issues that emerged

during the long and continuing debate on the relative merits of rules

versus discretion in domestic economic policy should have resurfaced in

the dialogue on international economic policy coordination.         After all,

the present system of managed floating,     even as it has evolved since

the Plaza Agreement   of September 1985, is much closer to a pure discretion

than to a pure rules model.     In this regard,   the gold standard with its

automatic specie flow mechanism, the adjustable peg system with its

clesr implications for the subordination of domestic monetary policy to

the exchange rate (except during fundamental disequilibria),        the   1S
with its parity grid and divergence indicator,      target zone proposals

with their trigger for coordination discussions whenever the actual

exchange rate threatens    to breach the zone, and pure floating with its


complete prohibition on all official intervention in the exchange

market——all can be considered less discretionary than the present

                          The debate is thus not about what         but rather
exchange rate system.                                         is,


about what should be.

        Those who support a more rules—based approach to international

economic policy rest their case on essentially four arguments.                 First,

the most promising    route    to   eliminating any excess demand for coordina-

tion in the world econcoy is not by increasing the supply, but rather by


decreasing the demand (or the need) for coordination. 33/                 That decrease

in demand, in turn, can best be brought about by the application of

simple policy rules, such as the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate.

In the process,    one would eliminate——so          the argument goes——most of the

negotiation costs and burden—sharing conflicts                that are intrinsic to

more discretionary systems.          Second, rules are regarded        as the only

viable mechanism    for    imposing discipline          on economic policymakera   who

might otherwise manipulate the instruments of policy for their own
objectives. 34/ Third, rules are regarded as enhancing the predict-
ability of policy actions and thereby improving the private sector's
ability to make informed resource allocation decisions. 35/ Fourth,
rules are championed as providing protection against the lack of
knowledge about how       the economy operates      by pre—empting     destabilizing
fine—tuning.
     The   main counter—arguments in favor of a discretionary approach
are the following. First, rule—based adjustment systems often turn out
to be less automatic in practice than in theory. For exorple, the

automaticity of the specie—flow mechanism under the hiatorical gold
standard was often undermined by the proclivity of authorities to
offset or sterilize the effect of gold flows. 36/
                                            —   18 —




        Second, rules will impart discipline to the conduct of macro—

econcmic     policy only to the extent that the penalties        for breaking the

rules are significant enough to ensure that the rules are followed.

The Bretton Woods rule that countries should consult with the Fund

once there was a cumulative parity change of 10 percent or more,

while complied with in a technical          sense, fell short in a substantive

sense of its original      purpose.      The discussion surrounding the revision

of     original Cramm—Rudman deficit—reduction targets in the United
      the
States is a more recent case in point. History could in fact be seen
as just as kind to the proposition that the policy regime adjusts to the
amount of discipline      that countries     want to have——as to the reverse. 37/

Also,    care needs to be taken to separate the effects of policy rules

on economic outcomes from other influences.             In this connection,    the

oft—made argument that the EMS was a major determinant of the 1979—85

disinflation in Europe would seem          to be   based on shaky ground. 38/

        Third,   it is by no   means   clear that rules are necessary    to obtain

the   benefits of greater predictability of policy. For example, the
practice of pre—announcing money—supply targets——sometimes accompanied
by announcements of public—sector burrowing requirements——providesthe

markets     with information on the authorities'        policy intentions,    but

stops well short of a rigid rule.

        Finally,   while rules diminish the risk emanating from fine tuning,

they increase the risk stemming from lack of adaptability to changes in

the operating      environment. 39/     The idea of a 'craw1ing—peg" rule
                                         —   19 —




based on inflation differentials drew quite a few supporters in the

1960s as the right antidote for sticky nominal           exchange   rates.   Yet

its neglect of the need for real exchange rate changes now seems more

serious in light of the real economic disturbances           of the early

l970s. 40/    More recently,    the crumbling       of the link between narrow


monetary aggregates and the ultimate targets of monetary policy in the

face of large scale financial      innovation and institutional        change has

reminded   us anew of the limitations of policy rules.

     In light of all this, there may not be any attractive alternative

to conducting economic policy coordination in a judgmental way.

     Even after the choice is made about coordinating via rules or

discretion,     there remains   the decision of whether to coordinate

around a single indicator       or a set of indicators.      A regime of fixed

exchange rates or target zones is an example of the former approach,

while the ongoing Group of Seven coordination exercise is an example

of the latter.

     There are two main considerations that are typically advanced

to support the single—indicator spproach.            One is that it avoids

over—coordination of policies by presening for each country freedon
of action over those policies not used to reach the single target
variable. Thus, for example, if the exchange rate is the focus of
coordination,    monetary policy will be constrained, but other policies

will be less affected.      tmplicit in this line of argument is the view

that attempts to place many policies under international coordination
                                         —
                                             20 —



will   ultimately prove self defeating and may even induce national

authort1es       to compensate by exercisIng    greater independence in
uncoordInated policy Instruments, such as trade policy. 41/
       The    second, and probably more important,     defense of a single—

indicator     approach is that it sends a clear signal to markets about

the course of future policy.        If, for example,    the monetary authorities

commit themselves      to maintain a fixed exchange rate within a given

band, then movements of      the exchange    rate provide an unambiguous guide
for   monetary policy.     A similar message would derive from a nominal

income target for monetary or fiscal policy, with the exchange rate

left to determination of the market.          In contrast,   a multI—Indicator

approach increases      the authorities' scope for discretion since they

can appeal to the conflIctIng messages coming from dIfferent Indicators.

In cases where the authorities'       past record of policy performance has

been weak and where a single objectIve of policy is predominant (such

as disinflation), a single—indicator framework for coordination can

carry significant advantages in the battle to restore credibility to

policy.

       But relying on a single polIcy IndIcator can also carry

substantial risks.       Perhaps   the most serIous one is that the single

indicator can send weak——or even false——signals about the need for

changes      in other policies that are not beIng coordInated. This is

perhaps best illustrated by considering the problem of errant fiscal

policy under a regime of fixed exchange rates or of target zones.

       First, consider fixed rates.      With high capital mobility,    a fiscal

expansion will yield an incipient positive interest rate differential,
                                         —   21 —



a capital inflow, and an overall balance of payments surplus——not a

deficit. Here, exchange rate fixity helps to finance——and by no means

disciplines——irresponsiblefiscal policy. 42/            Only if and when the

markets expect fiscal deficits to be monetized will they force the

authorities to choose between fiscal policy adjustments and deval-

uation. 43/    The better the reputation of the authorities,          the longer

in coming will be the discipline of markets, i.e.         ,
                                                              the exchange rate

will provide only a weak and late signal for policy adjustment.               In

this connection,    it is worth observing that whereas         the EMS has produced

a notable convergence    of monetary policy, convergence of fiscal policy

has not taken place. 44/

     Next, rerun the same fiscal expansion          under a target zone regime,

where the zones are to be defended by monetary policy.            In such a

scenario,   the appreciation of the currency induced by the fiscal

action will prompt a loosening of monetary policy to keep the rate from

breaching   the zone.   Here,   coordination around a single indIcator,

namely,   the exchange rate,    will have exacerbated——notcorrected——the

basic cause of the problems.      45/   The single indIcator     would have Sent

the wrong signal for policy adjustment.

     In contrast,   a multi—indicator approach to coordination——assuming

that the list of indicators included monetary and fiscal policy

variables——wouldnot be susceptIble to this weak or false—sIgnal

problem. 46/    This is because such an approach goes directly to the

basic stance of fiscal and monetary policies, rather than passing
                                           —   22 —




through the medium     of   the exchange   rate.       If, for example,   the    impetus

for coordination was     a misalignment of exchange rates, and            if    the

root   cause   of the misalignment   was an    inappropriate     stance and/or mix

of   monetary and fiscal policies,     the multi—indicator approach would be

appealing.

       But all is not a bed of roses       here either.       While all effective


approaches to coordination require a consiatency of policy instruments

and targets within and across countries,              this requirement of consistency

or compatibility can take an added prominence when authorities make

public a set of targets and intended courses for policy instruments. 47/

       Two aspects merit explicit mention. One ia that exchange rate

targets——or     even concerted views on the existing pattern of exchange

rates——must be consistent with the announced course of monetary and

fiscal policies.      Without that consistency,          attempts to provide the

market with an anchor for medium—term exchange rate expectations                      are


likely to prove fruitless.

       The second point is that the credibility of multiple policy targets

also hinges on the constraints on policy instruments.                Two such constraints

are the striking inflexibility of fiscal policy in almost all industrial

countries,     48/ and the limited   ability of sterilized exchange market

intervention to affect the level of the exchange rate over the medium—

term (unless of course it provides a signal about the future course of

policies).     49/   A relevant concern is that limitations on other policy

instruments may wind up with monetary policy being asked to carry too
                                           —
                                               23 —



heavy   a burden——with primary responsibility for maintaining internal

and external balance.       In such a case, any contribution that a multi—

indicator approach to coordination could make to enhancing the predict-

ability of pnlicies would also be diminished.              This is so because a

shock to the system——such as the October 1987 global stock market crash———

might raise the question in minds of market participants                of whether

monetary policy would serve its internal or external master.

      Yet another key methodologicsl issue associated with coordina-

tion——particularlywhen       it    involves joint decision        making——is   whether
one   country should, by    common    consent, have a predominant voice on
the   course of policies, or alternatively,           whether that influence should

be shared more equally.           In this respect,     the historical gold standard,

the Eretton Woods system, and the EMS are all often regarded as hegemunic

systems,    while the ongoing Oroup of Seven coordination process would

qualify as a    more symmetric      exercise. 50/
      Hegemonic exchange rste systems have            typically    operatod under

what might be called an "implidit contract" between the leader and the

satellite countries. 51/          Under Bretton Woods, the leader (that          is,   the

United States) carried      the obligation to conduct        prudent macroeconomic

policies——perhaps best summarized by a steady, low rate of inflation.

This obligation was reinforced by the leader's commitment to peg some

nominal    price——in   that case,    the price of gold.      Since there can be


only N—i exchange rates among N countries,             the leader was passive

about its exchange rate.          The satellite countries committed to peg
                                               —    24 —



their    exchange rates within agreed margins to the leader.                    As a reaction

to the competitive depreciation of the 1930s, cumulative exchange rate

adjustments greater than 10 percent were to be placed under international

supervision and were to be taken only under conditions of                       fundamental

disequilbrium.'           By   virtue   of their exchange rate obligations,         the

satellites sacrificed independence in their monetary policies but

expected to import stability from the leader.

        With the benefit of hindsight,          that this implicit contract

came under strain from two main directions (in addition to Triffin's

(1960) well—known         confidence      problem.')    One was the breakdown (after

the mid—1960s) of discipline by the leader such that the satellites

came to see it as exporting             inflation rather than stability.          The


response was for the satellites              to sever their      formal links with the

leader (in the early 1970s) and thereafter to seek stability via other

mechanisms,      inlcuding national money—supply targeting             and regional

exchange rate arrangements.              The second atrain was an excessive          rigidity

of   nominal exchange rates in the face of fundamental disequilibrium
that produced a misalignment of the leader's real exchange rate in the
late l960s.        The   leader then abandoned the commitment to           be    passive
about    its   exchange    rate.
        The   implicit contract         in the E1S is   similar in   many ways to that

under    Bretton   Woods.       While there    is   no formal    leader, most    observers

regard    the Federal Republic of Germany (and             its    Bundesbank)    as the de

facto or acknowledged leader. 52/              Germany follows macroeconomic

policies that export price stability and anti—inflationary

credibility    to the others.     It   is   noteworthy that while there have to

date   been 11 realignments     in the      EMS,   none   of them has resulted in a
revaluation relative to the deutsche mark, thus leaving Germany's
reputation    as so exporter of stability           intact.    Other members of the


exchange rate mechanism of the EMS can be characterized                   as •tying

their hands" on domestic monetary policy so as to make credible both

their exchange rate obligations and their inflation                objectives.   53/

Exchange rate adjustments are placed under common supervision.                   When

realignments do take place, they do not always provide full compensation

for past inflation differentials.             In this way,     the resulting   real


appreciation for high—inflation countries can act as a disincentive to

inflation    (by penalizing exports, output, and employment), while the
leader    receives    a gain in competitiveness           that provides some quid—pro—

quo for its export of anti—inflationary credibility.                54/    Monetary

policy in Germany is typically regarded as the anchor and is considered

so disciplined       as to do away with the need to peg to some "outside'

nominal    price.

       While there have clearly been perioda when large countries have

exerted    a stabilizing    influenoe on the system, it is hard to aocept

that hegemony is a necessary characteristic of a well—functioning system

of international       economio peiioy coordination.           There are several reasons.

First, careful.      study of alleged hegemonio systems,          including    the gold


standard,    reveals    that the amount of coordination needed for amooth

functioning was substantial.       55/      The coordinated interest rate actions

of   September   1987 in the EMS when Germany and the Netherlands lowered

their rates, and France raised its rate, are a recent example of such

cooperation.     Second, much of what passes for the stabilizing influence

of hegemony can also reflect common objectives.        Again,     the EMS serves

as a useful laboratory.         In the early 1980s, disinflation was the top

priority in virtually all EMS countries. Since Germany had the best

reputation fot price stability, there was a         cmonalityof      interests

in trying to converge to the German inflation rate.            Now, however,

some observers argue that given both the progress already made with

inflation and the high unemployment rates prevailing in some EMS (and

potential EMS) countries,        it is time to give greater weight to objectives

other than inflation.     56!    If such a decision were taken, it would

probably result in a more symmetric EMS——and this quite apart from

shifts among members in relative economic size or reputation.           57/


Third,   attempts   to reinstate   a hegemonic approach   to   coordination when

economic realities no longer support it could be counterproductive.

In the present context, there appears to be no obvious candidate that

combines an unblemished     record for economic stability,       a dominant


position in international trade and finance (relative to other members

of the coordination group), and a willingness to accept the requisite

responsibilities.

III     The Effects of Coordination

        Identifying   key issues related to the scope and methods of economic

policy coordination is one thing; attempting to infer its effects is

quite    another.     The   later is   obviously an empirical question     that
requires    for analysis some type of quantitative economic model.

        Earlier efforts to gauge the effects of international economic

policy coordination or of alternative international monetary arrangements

fall into two categories.           One strand of the literature compares the

value of a welfare function where each country maximizes              welfare indepen-


dently with that where the coontries maximize a joint welfare function.

Two controversial       findings    are that the gains     from coordination are

likely to be Thmall" for the largest countries             and that the gains     can

even be negative if countries coordinate using the wrong' model of the

world economy. 58/

        These findings      should not be used as an indictment of coordination——

for at least five reasons.           First, a comparison of optimal uncoordinated

with optimal coordinated        policies may not be generalizable       to the more

relevant    comparison of suboprimal uncoordinated          with suboptiool     coordinoted

policies.     In particular, the link between pressures for protectionism on
the one    hand, and recession and exchange rates on the other, could result
in    quite a different counterfactual (i.e., what would happen in the

absence of coordination)        than that assumed       in these studies. 59/     Second,

some of the gains froa coordination may be unobservable (unwritten

pledges    to alter policies       in the future), or difficult     to separate from
                                            —   28   —




less   ambitious    forms of cooperation (exchange            of information across

countries),      or extend beyond the realm of macroeconomic policy (joint

measures to combat terrorism, to harmonize nternaconal fare schedules

for air travel, and so on).            Third, a judgment that gains from coordination

are small presupposes some standard of comparison.                  Would    the gains from

international coordination be          small relative to the gains from coordi-
nation of   policies across different economic agencies within a national

government?      Fourth, empirical estimates             of gains from coordnaton have

typically compared policies that do not exploit the incentive governments

have to adhere to agreements           in order to enhance their reputation for

consistency.       Currie, Levine and     Vidals         (1987) argue,   n   contrast,   that

comparison of reputatonal policies shows large gains.                        Fifth, the

danger that coordination may reduce welfare because policymakers use the

wrong model(s)      is greatest    f    they ignore model       uncertainty.     If,   however,

policymakers recognize that they do not know the true model and take

this uncertainty into account, policy may be aet in a more cautious

fashion, with positive effects on the gains                 from coordination. 60/

       The second strain of the        empirca1 literature attempts            to quantify

the effects of specific policy proposals                 (such as the introduction of

target zones) by comparing them either with a baseline that describes

the current policy stance, or with historical values for the macroeconomi

variables   of interest.        This typically involves the simulation of a

global   econometric model.        Such   an application of models          is still in its
infancy.    To   date,   most   attentIon has been paId to         rule—based    proposals
                                        —    29   —




for   policy coordination that focus on real effective exchange rates.

Two   examples   of such studies are Edison, Miller, and Williamson (1987)

and Currie and Wren—Lewis (1987).      They compsre simulated outcomes of

cooperative policy rules to recent historical experience.          Both of these

studies,   however,   are open to the classic Lucas    (1976) critique that,

due to the endogeneity of expectstions        of economic agents, estimates of

"structural parameters" will differ under different policy regimes; in

these studies, expectations are formed in a mechanistic fashion——

independent of the policy regime.

       This chapter reports some initial      rule—based simulations   from s

global macroeconomic model developed in the Research Department of the

Fund, called MIJLTIMOD.    Two   questions   are addressed:   first, would s

smoother path of monetary snd fiscal policies have produced a smoother

path for real exchange rates, resl output, and inflation          than that

observed historically;     and second, what would be the variability of

policy instruments under s simple or extended "target zone" scheme

where the real effective exchange rate is treated as an intermediate

target?    61!   The "effects'   of coordination are generated by comparing

the counterfactual simulstions to a baseline simulation where MULTB'IOD

is constrained to replicate the historical data over 1974—87 by includ-

ing the appropriate residuals     in each equation.     These same residuals

are also used in the counterfactual simulations, each of which postulates

that policy would have been different in some way from its historical

stance.

     By virtue     of using MULTDIOD for the simulations,         this approach


differs from earlier work in two important respects.              One is that


expectations are                     reflect the stance of policy. This
                      forward—lookingand

permits expectations to differ across different policy regimes. 62! For
                                                                      will resist move-
instance,   if it is known that the monetary authorities

ments away from an Thquilibrium" level for the exchange rate, then this

will condition the value expected for the exchange rate in the future.

In this sense, the results are less subject to the Lucas critique than

previous work. 63!       in a related vein, the model attributes complete

credibility to the government' a policy stance and assumes that the private
sector forms its expectations in a fashion that turns out to be correct
ex post. Thus, it gives a potentially powerful influence to changes in
present   and future policies.        Second, although this section concentrates

on the larger industrial countries, MULTIMOD contains a fully specified

developing—country block.

     Before      proceeding    to a capsule   summary of   MULTLMOD    and to the

simulations      themselves,    it is worth emphasizing a caveat.         This paper    is


the first attempt to apply MULTIMOD to policy coordination issues.

values   and historical periods,      and about     the effects of alternative

coordination proposals——including those that rely on judgmental or

discretionary application of policies.

     MEILTIMOD is documented fully elsewhere and we will therefore                 limit

ourselves    here   to   describing its msin features.       64/    The model contains

submodela    for the three largest industrial        countries      separately——that is,

for the United States, Japan and the Federal           Republic of Germany——for         the

remaining four Group of Seven countries as a group (France, the United

Kingdom,    Italy and Canada),     and fot the remaining smaller industrial

countries as a group.         Developing countries (excluding the high—income

oil exporters) are modeled as one region, but with some industrial

disaggregation.        Each of the country or regional submodels has equations

explaining the components of aggregate demand as well as the supply of

the various goods produced.         The submodels    are linked through trade and

financial    flows.      The parameters of the behavioral equations           are in most

part estimated      using annual data available      since   the early 1960s.

     In the case of industrial countries, financial markets are assumed

to exhibit both perfect capital mobility and perfect substitutability
between assets denominated in different currencies. 65/ Consequently,

arbitrage conditions link the returns           on long— and short—term bonds and on

domestic    and foreign honda.      Moreover,   as suggested       earlier,   expectations

are assumed    to be     forward—looking, and to be consistent with the model's

solution in future periods.         Thus interest    parity holds both ex ante and

ex post in model simulations where future variables are correctly antici-

pated——that is, where there are no "surprises." 66/                As a result, the
                                         —   32   —




change tn the exchange rate bet5en two currencies from one period to
the next is determined by their Interest differential prevaIling in the
first    period.
        Similarly, expected long—term bond rates and rates of inflation
are also consistent with the model's solutions for future periods in the
absence    of further shocks.      The rate of inflation——unlike prices in

financial markets——is not assumed perfectly flexible,              Instead, rigidi-

ties In wage and product markets make for persistent effects oa output as

a result of purely monetary shocks; only in the medium— to long—run will

full   employment    result. 67/    Thus, both monetary and fiscal policies of

the industrial countries have signifIcant and persistent effects             on   real
varIables, both in the country undertaking the policy change and             in other

countries.

        In order to provide some feel for the properties of MULTIMOD,

Table 1 shows      the effects   of monetary and fIscal policies      in each of the

three major    countries   on itself, on the other three major countries,          and

on    the remaining Group of Seven countrIes.         These   policy changes are
assumed    to be unanticipated at the time of initiation.           Two comments are

in order about the results.         First, and not surprisingly,      policy actions

taken by the UnIted States have much larger splllover effects than those

undertaken In Japan or In the Federal RepublIc of Germany.              This reflects

the large sIze of the U.S. economy and the fact that, while a relatively

closed economy to imports, a relatively large share of Its imports come

from other Group of Seven countrIes. Japan Is only roughly half as
                                             —    33 —




large    (in terms   of   GNP)   and   obtains more of its imports from outside the

Group sources.       Germany     is   the most open      but is smaller    than Japan; the


spillovers of its actions primarily affect other European countries.

Second,    while both monetary and fiscal policies               have strong effects on

domestic real output over the medium—term,                 fiscal policy has a much

larger own—effect on the current account than does monetary policy. 68/

This is because the output and relative—price effects go in the same

direction for a fiscal policy change, whereas they offset each other in

the case of monetary        policy.      A fiscal expansion,      for example,    induces

an appreciation of the real exchange rate and an increase in domestic

demand——both of which lead to a fall in net exports. 69/                     In contrast,

a monetary expansion        yields a depreciation of tl:          real    exchange rate——

which promotes net exports——and an increase in domestic demand——

which penalizes      them; because       the relative—price effect dominates——at

least in the case of the United States and Japan——the                    result is a small

improvement    in the current         account.

        One rather minimalist interpretation of coordination is that large

countries should use their monetary and fiscal policies in a largely

independent decentralized way            but should avoid sharp changes in policy
stance    that would, in turn, generate sharp changes in real exchange                 rates.

Such a concession to internalizing               externalities   would not affect the

ultimate    size of the stock adjustment of actual to desired policies but
would    constrain the speed of         adjustment——much      in the same    spirit that
speed    limits in boat marinas discourage large              boats from producing    wakes
                                           —   34 —




that   would topple smaller boats.         One exponent of      smoothing" guidelines

is Corden (1986, p. 431), who states: 70/

        If we accept that the spillover effects of a foreign
       fiscal policy change can be defined as the adverse
       effects of the destabilizationof the real exchange
       rate, two implications follow.
          The most important implication is that each country
       benefits the other by maintaining relatively stable policies,
       meaning policies which will minimize real exchange—rate
       changes in either direction. Coordination consists
       essentially of a reciprocal agreement to modify policies
       that generate real exchange—rate instability."

       Charts 1 to 3 sinmarize developments for some indicators of policy

stance since the first full year of generalized floating (1974), while

Chart 4 gives a measure of real effective             exchange rates for the Group

of Seven countries.     71/   There are well—known difficulties in getting

good policy indicators,       including    the problem that each of the series——


money growth, the share of government            purchases   on goods and services in

GNP, and the ratio of tax receipts less non—interest transfer payments

to net national product and interest receipts——are              all endogenous to

some extent.    It should also be emphasized that this historical period

contains   several different policy regimes,           ranging fror   irgeting of

monetary aggregates over much of the earlier part of the period, to the

strengthening   of intenational economic policy coordination since the

Plaza Agreement of September       1985.

       Nevertheless, some useful stylized facts emerge from an examination

of historical   data.    First, money growth rates are quite volatile and

appear to be postive1y correlated across economies.                Second,   taxes net

of transfers seem to exhibit more variation than government spending;

evidence    of fiscal stimulus in the United States in 1983 is clear.

Finally,    real exchange rates        exhibit large fluctuations,         especially for
the United States.

        To estimate the effects of 'smoother               policies,   each of the variables

in Charts 1 to 3 was replaced by its five—year moving average.                    Those

values then         wee   input as exogenous variables        into MTJLTIMOD and the

values of endogenous variables were calculated.

        Table   2   presents the mean and standard deviation of several macro-

economic indicators, comparing their historical values with those resulting
from a simulation of smoother policies. Interestingly enough, smoothing of

policy variables is nowhere near sufficient to produce smooth values for
major   macroeconomic variables. On the contrary, such a simple smoothing

rule tends to accentuate some of the fluctuations                 in the historical data.

For example,        though the average growth of real gross domestic product is

about the same as in the historical          data, its standard deviation is higher
in    the policy smoothing       simulation. Real effective exchange rates are

somewhat less variable with smoothing,             but real short—term interest rates

are   considerably more variable.
       This simulation        illustrates that    smoothing policy instruments         may
lead to less, not more, smoothness in target variables.                   Other variables
exogenous    to the model are also a source of             variation in   output and

exchange   rates.         The model simulation suggests       that the random shocks

over the historical period, including changes in non—policy variables

such as oil production, have had a greater influence in producing swings

The role of policy has been to accommodate partially those shocks.                For

by WIllIamson (1983 and 1985), and extended by WIllIamson and Miller

(1987).     The original proposal calculated     'fundamental equilIbrium

exchange rates,     and advocated the use of monetary policies to resist

movements   away from those rates.   As explaIned by WIlliamson (1983):

     'The basic focus of exchange rate management should be on estimatIng
     an approprIate value for the exchange rate and seekIng to limit
     devIations from that value beyond a reasonable range (p. 47)...
     While other techniques, lIke sterilIzed intervention, may be able
     to give limIted assIstance, a serious commItment to exchange rate
     management leaves no realistic alternative to a willingness to
     direct monetary polIcy at least in part toward an exchange rate
     target. (p. 56)

     More recently, Williamson and Miller (1987, p. 7) supplement the

prescription   that monetary policies be used to target real effective

exchange rates with the assignment of fiscal policies to targets for the

growth in domestic demand for the Group of Seven countries:

     "The basic argument is that a nominal income target fulfills the
     same function as a money supply rule, providing a "nominal anchor'
     to prevent inflation from taking off and a guide to expectatIons,
     while avoiding the shocks to demand that come from varIatIons In
     velocIty...'

In addition, the proposal, or     blueprInt,' specifies     (p. 2) that:

     "the average level of world (real) short—term Interest rates
     should be revised up (down) if aggregated growth of nomInal
     Income is threatenIng to exceed (fall short of) the sum of
     the target growth of nominal demand for the participatIng
     countrIes."

     Earlier simulation    studies of target zones have been undertaken     by

WillIamson and MIller (1987, Appendix C), based on EdIson and others (1987).

Those studIes employed    the Federal Reserve Board's multicountry model (MCM),

which is characterIzed    by adaptive expectations.      As emphasized earlier, in

simulation MULTINOD uses model—consistent forward—looking        expectations——a

looking   expectations——a

would argue, more firmly grounded——answers.

      Two simulations were performed——one               for the original target zone


proposal (labeled "target zones'), and one for target zones augmented by

a rule for fiscal policy (labeled "blueprint").                      The attempt was made to


stay close to      the   spirit of the original proposals while still making a

few minor modifications.

      Much   of the action     in   a   target   zone scheme         centers around the
monetary reaction function since           it   policy that is typically
                                                 is    monetary

assigned to the exchange rate. In the standard version of MULTINOD, the
reaction function for short—term interest rates involves reaiating aovements
away from an exogenous        target for base money.              The demand   for base   money,

in   turn, is assumed to depend on real GNP and on its deflator

with elasticities close to unity.                When the effects of target

zones are simulated,        this term is retained but with a much lower weight

than normal. 73/         The "target—zone'        element in the reaction function

is represented by the assumption               that the short—term interest rate

deviates from the baseline depending on the cube of the deviation of

 the real effective exchange rate from. its target value. 74/                     Thus,   the


monetary policy rule used in both               the   target—zone and blueprint

simulations    takes the following algebraic                 form:

       (1)   r -   rb =   f(c-)/nJ       + a

where, as in Edison and others (1987),
                                       r is the short—term                      rate, rb is

 its baseline value, c is the log of the real effective                     exchange rate, c ita

 target value, and n is half the width of the target zone, (namely, 10

                                                                 output
and prices, and a is a negative constant. 75/

     Targets for the real effective       rate were taken from Williamson

(1985). 76/     As in Edison and others (1987), an adjustment       to the level

of the target real effective rate is made to keep it compatible with the

definition used in the model, but the constraint        is imposed that the

translated target exchange rate variable follow the same               as in

Williamson (1985). 77/

     As mentioned earlier, the 'blueprint         proposes that fiscal policy

follow a rule targeted on nominal domestic demand growth.           As such, the

equations   in HL'LTIMOD   for real government spending on goods and services

had to be endogenized along such lines.         The target paths for nominal.

domestic demand growth were taken from Williamson and Miller (1987)

for the period 1980—87; outside       that period, we used their formula to

calculate   targets.

     The ma±n results of interest are portrayed        in Charts 5 to 8, where

actual (historical) values are compared        to simulated   values for the target—

zone proposal and for the Blueprint proposal.         The charts cover real

effective   exchange rates, real GNP growth rates, rates of inflation,          and

current account balances.      Bands 10 percent each side of WillIamson's

fundamental    equilibrium exchange   rates have been drawn on Chart 5.

     Several interesting——albeit      tentative——conclusions     emerge from the

simulations.

    First,    there is surprisingly little success in limiting real exchange

rate movements away from their targeta, especially for the United States. 78/

This is apparent for both the more limited sssignment of monetary policy

to target exchange rates and the case where fiscal policy is made endogenous,

though not specifically for exchange rate targeting.       Also,   the cost of


resisting exchange rate in terms of greater variability of nominal interest

rates appesrs to be quite high in the model.       In 1985, the short—term

rate in the United States is 370 basis points below its baseline value

in the target zones simulation, and 260 basis points above in Germany.

An attempt to increase the feedback onto interest rates of real exchange

rates produced explosive behavior in the model, and negative nominal

interest rates.    Why is the movement in real effective exchange rates

so small?    In the model, this is the result of the long—run neutrality

of real variables with respect to monetary policy, and of the fact

that monetary policy changes are anticipated in advance.        A nominal

depreciation resulting    frnm anticipated monetary expansion      leads quite

soon to increases in import prices and domestic inflation, reducing the

amount of real depreciation.      Such s scenario has been discussed by

Feldstein    (1987, pp. 11—12) in the following terms:

       a.. if the United States had agreed in 1983 to the demands of
     the French and others who wanted us to stop the dollar's rise
         [it would have come about through]       easier
                                                    monetary policy
     [which] would have produced inflation sod the inflation would
     have caused the          nominal value to decline. In the end,
                       dollar's
     there would have been no change     the real exchange rate or
                                           in
     the trade deficit but a higher price level and s higher rate
     of inflation."

       With   perfect foresight of policy changes, the required movements                       in

monetary policy may be quite large for even small, and transitory, real

exchange rate changes. It can be seen from Chart               5   that the       dollars
real effective     exchange rate is judged by Williamson and Miller                   (1987)
to be undervalued       in 1978—80, but overvalued from 1982—85.                  Thus, interest

rates have to rise in the earlier period but fall in the latter (relative

to baseline).      With perfect foresight,        the amount they must rise in the

earlier period is amplified because it is known that they will be lower

later. 79/      Note that monetary policy is effective             in the model in the

short run, provided that the money supply change is unanticipated.

Table 1 indicates that an increase in the money supply of                 5       percent

causes a real effective depreciation           in the first year ranging from               2


percent in the case of Germany to 4 percent in the United States; by

the second—year, the depreciation has been reduced to 1 to                    2   percent.

If anticipated beforehand,           the extent of the depreciation       is further

reduced.

       In future work, we intend to relax the assumption               that the shocks

of   the   l980s——as   well   as   the policy reactions——are correctly anticipated
when   the simulation begins.          Specifically,     we plan   to do an experiaent
where the values of exogenous          variables are projected using information

then available, and where in each period a drawing is made from the random

errors in both policy reaction functions and in relationships describing

private behavior.       Expectations      of future variables would thus be

successively updated.         This alternative method of simulation is

discussed     more fully below.        It will be interesting to see       whether

this   alternative    expectations       structure,   which provides market parti-

cipants with less information than assumed here, produces a signifi—

candy    different outcome       for exchange      rate behavior under target zone

proposals.

       A second conclusion is that the use of monetary policy alone to

maintain target zones——keeping           the same stance of fiscal policy as in

the baseline——seems      to   exacerbate the inflationary pressures of the late

1970s and early 1980s, and to lead to more variable inflation rates; see

Chart 7.      In this simulation,    the United States eases monetary policy to

prevent the dollar's appreciation in the 1980—85 period; with perfect

foresight of such a policy stance, tnflation rises somewhat in the late

1970s in anticipation.        Conversely,      the dollar's undervaluation      in 1987

(according to the calcdated fundamental equilibrium exchange rate)

requires a tightening      of policy, which tends to lower inflation            rates in

the mid—1980s    below baseline levels.

       The substantial effects on real variables in the blueprint simulatn

appear to be the result mainly of the fiscal rule.                  In the blueprint

simulation,    GNP   growth is   smoothed considerably          in the United States and

the Federal Republic of Germany; see Chart 6. The recession of 1982 and

the high growth of domestic demand in the United States in 1984 are both

smoothed out; U.S. GNP growth in 1984 is only 2.7 percent, compared to

7.2 percent historically,        while    the United States no longer experiences

a recession in 1982.      Moderation of sharp GNP movements is however not

so evident for Japan and the other Group of Seven countries.                  Indeed,

the non—U.S. Group of Seven countries              experience   large output variations

in 1975—76 in    the blueprint simulatIons. ThIs            may   be a   result of a

mechanical    application of the Williamson—Miller   formula for calculating

nominal demand targets; if adjusted in an ad hoc fashion (as is done in

Williamson and Miller (1987) for the second oil shock), a more reasonable

path might result.

     Third, current account imbalances      are reduced for the major three

countries   in the blueprInt simulation, in the sense of being closer to

zero; see Chart 8.     Most of the effects again come as a result of the

changes in fiscal stance.     In particular, targets for domestic demand

growth in Germany and Japan are consistently above the historical values,

and this leads to a much more stimulative     fiscal policy in these countries

(see Williamson and Miller (1987), Charts 4 and 5).       But again, there is

a cost.     General goverrunent fiscal deficits reach 10 percent of GNP in

Germany and 8 percent in Japan in the early 1980s!       By the same token,

it is the fiscal stimulus——ratherthan the monetary policy change——

that is the cause of the sizable appreciation of the yen and deutsche

mark in the 1980s relative to baseline.       Clearly, such large deficits

would not be tolerable politically.     It is also noteworthy that the

counterpart   to the smaller current account surpluses   in Germany and

Japan is larger surpluses    in the other Group of Seven countries,   rather

than a reduction of U.S. deficits.     This occurs because a weighted average

of domestic demand targets for France, the United Kingdom, Italy and

Canada in Williamson and Miller (1987) is consistently lower than

actual demand over the period 1974-87.

     In concluding this discussion, we reiterate     that it is important not

to read too much into these preliminary simulation     results—-for at least

three reasons.
                                         —   44   —




      To begin with, and harking back to our earlier discussion about

the quality of coordination,      it would be inappropriate       to generalize

about the effecta of more judgmental discretionary approaches to

coordination from sImulations of more mechanical rule—based coordI-

nation proposals.

      Second, we need to obtain more information on the robustness              of


our preliminary findings with respect to alternative assumptions

about the relationship between interest rates and exchange rates,

and to alternative targets for real effective exchange rates and nomInal

domestic demand growth.      In a similar vein, it would be useful to

employ MULTIMOD to draw out the implications of alternative

coordination proposals for the developing countries.

      Finally,    the method of simulating     alternative    policies itself

                             It is sufficient         here to note just two of the
requires further study.

avenues that might be explored in further work.

      Instead of recreating     history by using the same residuals as in the

historical data, it     could   be revealing   to do many simulations based on

different    drawings from the   distribution of the error terms present in
the historical data. Such repeated stochastic simulations avoid the
criticism    that a policy rule may be appropriate          only to a particular

historical episode, rather than to fundamental features of the economy.

      A second avenue is to delve more deeply into the nature of policy

              and rules, and how these relate to historical experience.              One
guidelines

way   to tackle   this problem would be to assume that actual policy over the
                                             —   45 —




historical period     could be described       by an estimated reaction function,

with a systernaric part (that    is a function          of observable variables)         and a

random part.      In one set of simulations,        the systematic      part of the policy

rule (i.e., the     feedback rule      including        the variables   targeted and

their coefficients) would be changed but the random part would be left

unchanged. The argument here would be that the random part represents

either a component of discretionary          behavior or errors in implementing

policy,   and   that this random element would remain under all policy regimes.
In a aecond aet of simulations, one would               alternatively aaaume that
any   new policy rule would be implemented without error so that the

random part     is identically zero.     The     latter set of simulations could
be viewed aa     too favorable to a    new   policy rule, while the        first   aet
would perhapa not be     favorable enough.         The two    alternative may      therefore

give reaaonable bounda to the effects of            new    policies and   may   help us
distinguiah expectatinnal errors from shocks to structural equations.

  1/ This paper was presented st a conference organized by the L'ff
and HWWA—Institut fur Wirtschatsforschung on "National Economic Policies
and Their Impact on the World Economy" held in Hamburg on May 5—7, 1988.
In addition to colleagues in the Research Department, the authors are
indebted to Hali Edison, Martin Feldstein, Pieter Korteweg, and Jacques
Melitz for helpful comments on an earlier draft.

  2/ See the surveys by Artia and Ostry (1986), Cooper (1985), Fischer
(1987), Hamada (1979), Home and Masson (1988), Kenen (1987), Polak (1981)
and Wallich (1984).

  3/ Evidence on the size of spillover effects from policy actions by
the major industrial countries is discussed in the latter part of this
section and in Table 1 of Section IV.
  4/ The conclusion that a monetary expansion under            rates affects
real output in opposite directions at hone and abroad floating
                                                       is associated with
the Mundell (1971)—Fleming (1962) model. For a recent evaluation of
this model, see Frenkel and Razin (l987a); a broader survey of the
International transmission mechanism can be found in Frenkel and Musaa
(1985). Econometric models are more divided on whether a monetary
expansIon under floating rates has negative transmission effects on real
output abroad; see Helliwell and Padmore (1985) and Bryant and others
(1988).
  5/ We regard the label as inappropriate, both because the proponents
of decentralized macroeconomic policy—making——including Corden (1983),
(1986), Feldatein (1987), Niehans (1988), Stein (1987), and Vaubel
(1985)——are geographically quite diverse, and because some prominent
German economists, such as Puehl (1987), have stressed the importance
of coordination.
  6/ Corden (1986) has recently argued that there oay be a case fur
asking large countries to slow their speed of adjustment to desired
policy targets so as to dampen movements in real exchange rates that
could cause difficulties for others (see SectIon IV).

  L Another constraint on regional attempts to create more of the
public good is that they may divert or discourage its production
outside the region; the argument here is analogous to the concepts of
"trade creation" and "trade diversion" In the customs—union literature.
  8/ To reach this conclusion, It is necessary to assume that each
player does not have sufficient polity Instruments to achieve all Its
policy targets simultaneously, and that coordination alters the trade-
offs   among policy targets; see Gavin (1986).   Without those assump—

9/    See Fischer (1987) and Frenkel (1983,     1986).

10/  See Goldstein (1984).  This is not to say that the insulating
properties of floating rates are inferior to those of alternative
regimes. Indeed, it is hard to see any other exchange race regime
surviving the shocks of the 1970s without widespread controls on
trade and capital.

11/ On the possible use of commodity—price indicators in the conduct
of monetary policy, see Fieller (1987).

12/   See Bocklemann (1988) for a similar conclusion.

13/   See Frenkel   (1985).

14/ Another barrier is disagreement over forecasts for key economic
variables over the medium—term; on this point, see Tanzi (1988).

15/  See Bryant and others (1988) and Helliwell and Padmore (1985) for a
comparison of open—economy multipliers from different global econometric
models. Frankel and Rockett (1986) illustrate the sensitivity of
welfare effects of coordination to the selection of the "right" versus
the 'wrong" economic model.

16/ See Fischer (1987).   Dini (1988) goes further to argue that when
the incentives to coordinate differ widely among group members, there
may be a tendency for bilateral bargains to take place among those who
have the most to trade.

17/  See Putnam and Bavne (1984).  At the same time, the Bonn Summit is
regarded in some quarters as illustrative of the pitfalls of coordinating
macroeconomic policies when the economic outlook is changing rapidly.

25/ For example, the Louvre Communiqué' states that: "The United States
'verrnent will pursue policies with a view to reducing the fiscal 1988
deficit to 2.3 percent of GNP from its estirmted level of 3.9 percent in

26/    Because coordination of structural policies typically involves
Tfferent policy instruints, individual country actions cannot——
unlike coordination of fiscal policies——be evaluated with reference
to an aggregate policy indicator that would be desirable from a
global perspective.

27/ This is not to deny the helpful role that harmonization
i'ructural policies——ranging from adopting similar tax provisions to
implamenting common regulations concerning movements of goods, labor,
and capital——could play   in
                           certain circurmtances.
 28/ Those wi-jo hold the view thst international factors have minimal
flfluence on policy—making, sonetiis also argue that countries'
policy commiunents in coordination agreents represent policies
that would have occurred even in the absence of such agreeitnts.
Under this view, coordination affects only the timing of policy
announcernts with countries delaying such announcenents until
coordination meetings so that they can present a dowry to the
others.

29/     See the papers in Buiter and Mareton (1985).

30/     The classic references to what ie called the     '•time   inconsistency"
of    policies are         and   Prescott   (1977) and Calvo (1978).

31/    As Poehl (1987, pp. 19—20) notes: ". . . international cooperation
does   not necessarily imply that all parties must agree on all details at
all times. It is important that      c   regard it ae a process of maintaiz. ing
stability in our increasingly interrelated rld economy..          The process

of international     cooperation  may be difficult and burdensome, even
frustrating    at tines,   but there is no alternative to it."

32/ It is precisely because of the risk of '•collusion" among the
coordinating countries that Vaubel (1985) favors decentralized decision
making.

33/     See Polak (1981) and Ilenen (1987).

34/ It is in this context that the          probls   of time—inconsistency and
moral hazard often surface.

35/ Advocates of rules also argue that once the public knows better
what the authorIties will do, markets wIll demand less of a risk—

mechanism of the EMS. The sample was comprIsed of 22 industrial coun—
tries.  The E2-S dummy variable was not         statistically

whereas the level of the inflation rate in 1979 was. Note that this
finding does not preclude a helpful role of the EMS in disinflation
since participation could still have reduced the output cost of
disinflation (see, for example, Giavazzi and Giovannini (1988)); but
this is a different story.

39/   As developed in Polak (1988), the need for rules to guard against
the dangers of fine tuning has receded in any case since economic policy
in most industrial countries is now oriented much more toward the medium—
term.   Fischer (1987) makes the complementary point that the state of
our knowledge about the effects of monetary and fiscal policy is too
rudimentary to justify policy rules. Niehans (1988) expresses doubts
that   rules could be relied upon to reduce International disturbances.

exchange rate movements and fiscal policy under target zones is being
increasingly recognized. Whereas first—generation target zone proposals
spoke only of monetary policy, second—generation proposals have added
a policy rule or guideline for fiscal policy; contrast Williamson (1985)
with Williamson and Miller (1987).

Economic Summit included growth rates of gross national product,
interest rates, inflation rates, unemployirent rstes, ratios of
fiscal deficits to GNP, current account and trade balances, money
growth rates, international reserve holdings, and exchange rates.

47/  There is also the question of the proper assignment of policy
instruints to policy targets.   This issue is touched on in the next
section.

as more symmetric systems.

51/   See Frenkel and Goldstein (1988).

52/   See Ciavazzi and Giovannini (1986).
53/  In practice, high—inflation countries have sometimes resorted to
capital controls during exchange rate crises so as to avoid the choice
of having to give up either monetary independence or the exchange rate
target.

54/ To the extent that the EMS produces greater stability and pre-
dictability of exchange rates, all members also share any efficiency
gains associated with moving closer to a single currency.

61/   See Williamson (1985) and Williamson       and Miller (1987).

62/  Another recent paper, Taylor (1986), considers different exchange
rate arrangements in a rational expectations model; however, only
completely fixed and freely floating exchange rates are compared, and
the model is limited to the seven major industrial countries.

63/ The model simulations do not, however, allow for two other ways in
which private sector behavior may be affected by changes in policy regimes
First, the variance of output, prices, or exchange rates may be different,
leading to different degrees of substitutability among goods or assets.
For example, it has been argued that the greater variability of exchange
rates has led to a lower level of international trade than would have
prevailed under fixed rates.   Second, expectations may contain "speculativ
bubbles in some circumstances, and hence may not solely reflect economic
fundamentals. For example, the rise of the 1J.S. dollar early in 1985
despite declining interest rate differentials in favor of dollar—
denominated assets is hard to explain.

64/   See Masson and others (1988).

65/ In contrast to the industrial countries, developing countries are
not assumed to face perfect capital markets, Instead, the availability
of financing reflects their ability to service debt, as measured by a
ratio of their inflation—adjusted interest payments to the value of their
exports. It is assumed that there is an uppor limit to this ratio,
beyond which the risk of nonrepayment becomes high, and consequently
creditors would refuse to grant further new lending. As a result of
the financing constraint, imports by developing countries are also con-
strained, tending to reduce both consumption and investment. The con-
straint on financing is, however, not solely based on current developments
but also reflects an assessment of future export prospects of developing
countries; expected future exports are made to be consistent with the
model's solution for those future exports.

66/ This is a feature that will be relaxed in future work——in
particular, by mposng shocks to residuals in successive periods.

67/ Labor markets do not appear explicitly in the model, but features
of wage bargaining, such as those due to overlapping multiperiod contracts
are reflected in the equation estimated for inflation.

68/ One strong implication of this empirical regularity is that any
"assignment rule" that assigns monetary policy to the current account——
for example, Williamson and Miller's (1987) Blueprint——is going to face
problems; on this point, see Genberg and Swoboda (1987) and Boughton
(1988).
                                   —   52 —




69/  It is assumed here that fiscal expansion is not accommodated by an
increase in money growth.  Current account effects also reflect the impact
of interest rate changes on net investment income.

70/ Niehans (1988, p. 215) also stresses the importance of steady
policies: The first, and most promising, step to reducing international
disturbances must surely be the avoidance of the policy shifts that
produce them. Especially for the dominant economy, the United States,
the most important part of cooperation is steadiness."

71/  The measure of real effective exchange rate is the country's manu-
factured export price, divided by a weighted average export price of its
competitors, including developing countries. Thus, an increase indicates
appreciation.

72/ Corden (1986, p. 431) recognizes this to some extent: "[Coordinationi
means, incidentally, that if private investment in a country declines
there should be some compensating increase in its fiscal deficit to modify
the current account effect.  It does not necessarily mean that a fiscal
policy stance should be stable."

73/ The role of this variable is to give a nominal anchor to the system.
The inclusion of this term is also consistent with the intent of the
blueprint proposal to make the level of interest rates depend (in an
unspecified fashion) on the growth of aggregate UN?.

74/   Edison and others (1987, p. 97).

75/  In implementing the rule, the value given by Edison and others
t1987) to n, 10 percent, was initially tried, but the model either would
not solve or gave negative nominal interest rates. Consequently a higher
value, 20 percent, waa used, implying a lower feedback of exchange rate
miaalignmenta on interest rates.

76/  Again, we adopt Williamson's (1985) estimates of target or equilibrium
real effective exchange rates merely to stay as close as possible to the
original proposals. There should be no implication that we agree or
disagree with those estimates.

77/ It should also be noted that MULTIMOO's definition of real effective
exchange rates is wider than moat measures, since it allows for competition
from manufacturea produced in developing countries.

78/ It is also the case in Edaon and others (1987), that real exchange
rates undera target zone regime differ little from their hiatorical
values.

79/  Suppose there are three time periods, and that interest parity
relates interest rates and exchange rates. Suppose also that the exchange
rate is unchanged in the third period.   In each period, the nte:est rare
differential is equal to the appreciation that is expected (and actually
occurs) next period.  Thus, tn terms of deviations from baseline,
          —
dt = et+1   et, where e3 0. Then in the second period, the interest
differential will have to be equal to the desired change in the exchange
rate; if it is overvalued by 5 percent, interest rates will have to be
5 percentage points lower,   If in the first period the exchange rate is
