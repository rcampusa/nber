          THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TECHNICAL TRADING-RULE PROFITS
       IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET: A BOOTSTRAP APPROACH


                              ABSTRACT

     In   this paper, we present new evidence on the profitability
and statistical significance of technical trading rules in the
foreign exchange market. We utilize a new data base, currency

futures contracts for the period 1976-1990, and we implement a
new testing procedure based on bootstrap methodology. Using this
approach, we generate thousands of new exchange rate series

constructed by random reordering of each original series. We
then measure the profitability of the technical rules for each
new series. The significance of the profits in the original
series is assessed by comparison to the empirical distribution of
results derived from the thousands of randomly generated series.

Overall, our results suggest that simple technical trading rules
have very often led to profits that are highly unusual.

Splitting the entire 15-year sample period into three 5-year
periods reveals that on average the profitability of some trading
rules declined in the 1986-1990 period although profits remained

positive (on average) and significant in many cases.

I. Introduction and Motivation

     Since the advent of floating exchange rates in the early
1970s, numerous empirical studies have investigated the time series
behavior of exchange rates and the empirical distribution of
exchange rates. A null hypothesis that features prominently in
these studies is whether exchange rates can be characterized as
serially independent drawings from a stationary distribution.
Alongside these studies, tests of foreign exchange market
efficiency have examined the profitability of various trading
rules. A null hypothesis in these studies has been that mechanical

rules for generating trading signals should not result in unusual
(risk-adjusted) profits.

     A variety of empirical studies (reviewed in Section II)
support the notion that mechanical trading rules are often
profitable when applied in the spot foreign exchange market. A
drawback to these studies is that most do not measure the
statistical significance of their results, while others measure
statistical significance assuming that the volatility of exchange
rates is constant. The latter assumption is questionable since
recent evidence rejects the hypothesis that exchange rates can be
described as random, independent drawings from a stationary
distribution. Evidence is more consistent with the view that
exchange rates are drawn from non—stationary distributions.

    The purpose of this paper is to undertake new tests of the
random behavior of exchange rates and the profitability of
mechanical trading rules. Our tests do not rely on assumptions

                                 1
regarding the distribution of the process underlying exchange rate

changes. Our approach involves the application of bootstrap methods
—-   i.e.   the generation of thousands of new series of pseudo
exchange rates, each new series constructed from random reordering
of the original series. We measure the profitability of the
mechanical trading rules for each new series. The significance of
the results from the original series can be assessed by comparison
to the empirical distribution of results derived from the thousands

of randomly generated series.

      Overall, our empirical results suggest that mechanical trading

rules have very often led to profits that are highly unusual
relative to the profits earned by the same rules when applied to
the randomly generated time series of exchange rates. Based on a
sample of five currencies over the period January 1, 1976 —
December 31, 1990 and nine trading rules, we find that in 31 cases

the original exchange rate series produced profits in the top 1% of
all times series, in eight cases the original series produced
profits in the top 5% of all time series, and the remaining six
cases produced profits that were positive but not significant.
Splitting the entire 15-year sample period into three 5—year
periods revealed that on average the profitability of mechanical
trading rules has declined in the 1986-1990 period, although
profits remained positive (on average) and significant in many
cases.

     The plan for the remainder of the paper is to review some of
the earlier research on spot exchange rates and market efficiency

                                 2
in Section II. We present our own methodology and data sources in
Section III. Our empirical results are presented in the following
section. A summary and conclusions are in the final section.


II. Previous Research

       A. Efficient Market Theory
       There are now a substantial number of empirical studies
testing the efficiency of the foreign exchange market. Surveys of
this literature have been prepared by Levich (1985, 1989) and
Hodrick (1987). A critical point in the formulation of these
studies is that all tests of market efficiency are tests of a joint
hypothesis ——   first,      the hypothesis that defines market equilibrium
returns as some function of the available information set, and
second, the hypothesis that market participants set actual prices
or returns to conform to their expected values.

       To be more specific, if we define r1+1 as the actual one—period

rate of return on asset j. in the period ending at time                         and
E(rj1+1111) as the expected value of that return conditional on the

information set available at time t, then the excess market return
can be written as


                =           —                                           (1)
                    r1,+1       E(r1+1I I,)   •




The market is efficient if the expectational errors follow a fair

game   process such that E(Z+1II,)=O and               Z,is uncorrelated with
for    any value of .           In   words,       the market is efficient if,   on

                                              3
average, expectational errors are zero, and these errors follow no
pattern that might be exploited to produce profits.
     In the case of speculative trading In spot or forward foreign

exchange markets, risk is present but a risk premium may or may not
be characteristic of equilibrium pricing and returns.' For example,

in the monetary model of exchange rates, domestic and foreign
currency bonds are assumed to be perfect substitutes once the
interest differential between foreign and domestic assets offsets

the foreign exchange rate change. In this case, there is no foreign
exchange risk premium —— any sustained speculative trading profits

would be deemed unusual and a violation of market efficiency.
However, in the portfolio balance model of exchange rates, domestic

and foreign currency bonds are assumed to be imperfect substitutes,

and in equilibrium investors require a risk premium (which could
vary over time) in addition to the expected exchange rate change to

compensate them for the uncertainty of exchange rate changes. In
this case, some positive level of profits from trading rules would
be consistent with an equilibrium. Since the equilibrium expected

return in foreign exchange speculation could be zero or positive
and time varying, it has been difficult to gauge what constitutes
unusual or excessive profits as would be characteristic of an
Inefficient market.

     The primary technique for testing spot market efficiency has
been to compute the profitability of various mechanical trading


      Asset models of exchange rates are discussed in Levich (1985)
and Branson and Henderson (1985).
                                 4
strategies. One popular technique for generating buy and sell
signals is the filter rule.2 An x percent filter rule leads to the

following strategy: 'Buy a currency whenever it rises by percent
above its most recent trough; sell the currency and take a short
position whenever the currency falls            percent below its most
recent peak.' In the spot foreign exchange market, the expected
profit (P) from a long foreign currency (FC) position over the
period (t,t+1) is


          E(P,1) =    E [in (S+1/S1) J —   (i   —   i)       (2)



where FC represents the interest earned on the long FC position,
  is the interest expense of the short $ position and S is the spot

exchange rate in $/FC.3 The right-hand-side of equation (2) is the
uncovered interest parity condition (also known as the Fisher Open
effect). Accordingly, under the joint null hypothesis of market

efficiency and no foreign exchange risk premium, expected profits
will be zero. Spot speculation of the sort described can be
conducted using lines of credit secured by Treasury Bills that earn



     2 Filter rules were used by Alexander (1961) to test for
trading profits in American equity markets. Follow up tests by Fama
and Bluine (1966) found that no profits were available after
adjusting for transaction costs, dividends paid during short sales,
and pricing discontinuities.

      To avoid Siegel's Paradox, the interest rate i and i should
be compounded continuously. Contrary to results suggested by Black
(1990) we view the Siegel Paradox as a nominal effect. By using
continuous compounding, expected profits are zero from the
standpoint of both the $ and FC based investor.
                                  5
interest for the speculator. It follows that the entire realized
profit from following a mechanical signal


                =   in   (S11/S)   — (i   —
                                                            (3)




should be interpreted as an unusual return —— a risk premium, over

and above the risk free rate of interest. However, under the joint

null hypothesis of market efficiency and a time varying exchange

risk premium (RP1), expected profits from currency speculation will
be positive. In this case, only the excess profit


                =        — RP                    (4)



should conform to the conditions of a fair game if the market is

efficient. The conundrum, then, in interpreting the empirical
series of profits as in equation (3) is that occasional profits may

be the result of chance, but sustained profits could either be
indicative of market inefficiency or fair compensation for an
exchange risk premium. The empirical support for a non—trivial
exchange risk premium is mixed.4 In practice, most empirical
studies have not taken an exchange risk premium explicitly into
account.

     B. Empirical Evidence on Exchance Markets

     Studies by Dooley and Shafer (1976, 1983) report the filter


       See Froot and Thaler (1990) for a discussion of the evidence
on the foreign exchange risk premium.
                                     6
rule trading profits for nine currencies using daily spot rates
over the 1973-1981 period. Their calculations are adjusted to
reflect the interest expense and interest income of long and short
positions (as in equation [3]) and transaction costs are
incorporated by using bid and asked foreign exchange quotations.
Their results indicate that small filters (   = 1,   3, or 5 percent)
would have been profitable for all currencies over the entire
sample period. The authors also reported results for 10, 15, 20 and

25 percent filters. These filters were profitable in more than one-

half of the sub—periods but the results were more variable than for

the smaller filters. However, even with the small filters there
appears to be some element of riskiness in these trading rules
since each filter would have generated losses in at least one
currency during at least one sub—period. Even so, for three
currencies (Yen, Guilder, and Pound sterling) every small filter
was profitable in every sub—period. The authors did not report any
measures of statistical or economic significance of these profits.

     A study by Sweeney (1986) used a similar filter rule technique

on daily exchange rates for ten currencies over the April 1973 —
December 1980 sample period and reached similar conclusions.5

Filters of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 percent led to trading
profits in more than 80% of the cases. The results for the smaller

      Sweeney imposes a restriction on short FC positions. From and
initial position in $, a buy signal triggers a move into FC while
a sell signal results in a move back into $. Profits from this
trading rule are evaluated vis-a—vis the benchmark of buying and
holding the FC. The same methodology was used by Cornell and
Dietrich (1978) in an analysis of five currencies over the March
1973 — September 1975 period.

                                7
filters (0.5, 1, and 2 percent) were again superior. Sweeney
divided his sample into a 2.5-year estimation period followed by a
5—year post—sample period. Filter rules that were profitable in the

first period tended to be profitable in the second. Under the
assumption of constant exchange rate volatility, Sweeney calculated
that in about one—third of the cases, the profits from filter
trading were statistically significant. Again, the results were
more pronounced for the smaller filters.

     Schulmeister (1987,1988) conducted an in—depth analysis of the
$/DM rate over the April 1973 - September 1986 period using several

technical models in addition to the simple filter model.' In
particular, Schulmeister tested a popular moving average rule that
generates signals based on a cross—over between short—term and

long—term moving average of past exchange rate. According to this
rule, when the short—term moving average penetrates the long—term
moving average from below (above) a buy          (sell) signal is
generated. Results for the 3 day—b day, 5 day—b day, and 4 day—l6
day combinations are reported.
     Schulnieister's results suggest that most of these technical
models would have resulted in profitable trading strategies even
after adjusting for interest expense and transaction costs. In
particular, the moving average rules are profitable in each of the
10 sub—periods analyzed. Schulmeister suggests that the reason for

his results is that exchange rate changes and speculative profits

     6 He also tested a momentum model, based on the rate of change
in past exchange rate, and a combination model involving both
moving average and momentum models.
                                 8
appear to be non-normally distributed. There are too many small
exchange rate changes (relative to a normal distribution) but also

too many large exchange rate swings (also relative to the normal).
The implication from the latter is that once an exchange rate move

has started, it is likely to proceed more or less uninterrupted,
which allows market technicians time to identify a profitable
investment opportunity.5
     Two papers that analyze the statistical properties of
exchanges rates are also worth noting. In an analysis of daily spot

exchange rates over the period 1974-1983, Hsieh (1988) rejects the
hypothesis exchange rates are independently drawn from a fat—tailed

distribution that remains fixed over time. While the usual tests do

reveal the presence of serial correlation in exchange rates, Hsieh
argues that this may be the result of heteroskedasticity. Once
heteroskedasticity is removed from the data, very little serial
correlation remains. Exchange rates appear more accurately
characterized as drawings from distributions that vary over time
with changing means and variances.6



      A trend following rule in which the investor buys more as the
currency goes up and sells more as the currency goes down is a
dynamic call replicating strategy. As the strategy produces a
synthetic currency call option, the profits from this strategy
should be skewed. By comparison, the trading rules here entail a
fixed position that is held until the next signal of opposite sign
appears.
     6 This result underlies the generalized autoregressive
conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model that includes the
specification of a time—varying and serially correlated error term.
An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process is a
more restricted representation of a time series process with
constant variance and time invariant parameters.
                                9
       Engel and Hamilton (1990) model the time-varying nature of
exchange rate distributions as a Markov switching process between
state 1 and state 2 where exchange rate movements are drawn from
distributions

              N (j , a2)       in state 1, and

              N (h2     a2)    in state 2

Assume that these states evolve so that

              Pr(s1 = 1       s1 = 1)     =    p11

              Pr(s, = 2       s1 = 1)     =    1 —   P11

              Pr(s1 = 1       ; =   2)    =    1 —   p
              Pr(s1 = 2       s =   2)    =    p
If p,1 and p22 are high, and             and 2 have opposite signs, then there
will be "long swings" (i.e. uninterrupted trends) in exchange rates
--   the   sort that might be susceptible to mechanical trading rules.

Analyzing quarterly data for the period 1973:4 —             1988:1,   Engei. and

Hamilton conclude that the long swings hypothesis (p,1 and p high,

and , and      I2     with   opposite signs) fits the data significantly
better than a state independent model of a single distribution.



III. Data and Methodolov
       A characteristic of exchange rates is that while it might be
possible to model a series from one period as drawings from a fixed

distribution, it is not possible to "turn the clock back" and draw

additional samples from the same time period. Instead, researchers
typically "turn the clock forward" and draw additional observations

from an extended sample period. This technique may confound the

                                              10
analysis if the sampling distribution itself varies over time.
     In classical statistics,        statistical statements about
population parameters are based only on the sample of data actually

drawn in the context of an assumption about the distribution
function that generated the sample. An alternative is the bootstrap

approach, which assumes nothing about the distribution generating
function.' The distribution generating function is determined
empirically using numerical simulation. By drawing numerous random

samples (with replacement) of size n   from the original data itself,
these new samples generate an empirical distribution. Probability

statements regarding the original data (for example, the mean,
standard deviation, or other moments) can now be made with
reference to the empirical distribution.

     In this paper, we have collected data on futures prices for
five currencies (British pound (BP], Canadian dollar (CD], German

mark [DM], Japanese yen (JY], and Swiss franc (SF]) for the period

January 1, 1976 through December 31, 1990, or approximately 3800
daily observations. Our data source is I.P. Sharpe & Co., now a
part of Reuters. Quotations are on closing settlement prices from
the International Monetary Market of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A single time series is assembled by bringing together
quotations on successive near—term contracts. For example, futures
prices in January and February of 1976 reflect the March 1976


      For more on the bootstrap method, see Efron (1979, 1982) and
Hinkley (1988). For an application of bootstrap techniques to
technical trading rules in the stock market, see Brock, Lakonishok
and LeBaron (1991).
                                11
contract; futures prices in March, April and May of 1976 reflect
the June 1976 contract; and so forth.' Since futures prices reflect

the contemporaneous interest differential between the foreign
currency and the U.S. dollar, price trends and profits can be
measured simply by


                   =   in   (F+1/F1)                               (5)



where F is the currency futures price at time

     By the use of futures contracts, we eliminate the need for
overnight interest rates on spot interbank deposits and we also
obtain a reliable and consistent data set. However, each individual

futures contract displays a deterministic decline in maturity from

roughly 110 days to 20 days as we follow its price movements.
Samuelson (1976) has proved that "near futures contracts show more
variability than (sufficiently far) distant ones," so there is some

possibility that return variances may be rising as our contracts
move toward maturity and then falling abruptly as we roil into the

next futures contract. However, Samuelson (1976) also shows that

for some stationary price generating processes, variance may rise
over some intervals as time to maturity (T) rises, even though in


     '
         The June 1976 Japanese yen contract had extremely light
trading volume and so there are no observations for yen during the
months of March, April and May 1976. Data for the yen begin in June
1976 with prices for the September contract.
         In this assumption, we rely on the interest rate parity
relationship that is well established in the empirical literature.
See Frenkel and Levich (1988).
                                       12
the limit, variance of futures price changes is zero as T-'. Thus,
whether variance rises as our futures contracts move from T=llO to

20 days to maturity remains an empirical question. As a practical

matter, however, volatility in futures price changes, c2(P11), will

be heavily dominated by spot price changes (See Appendix). Our
analysis of futures price changes reveals that there is no
significant difference between volatility for 'far' maturities
(80Tf1l0) and 'near' maturities
     In order to generate a vector of buy and sell trading signals,

we utilize filter rules of size x — 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5%
and three moving average cross—over rules: 1 day/5 day, 5 day/20
day, and 1 day/200 day. Each vector of signals is then applied to
the original series of futures prices to measure the actual
profitability of using these mechanical rules on the original
sequence of price changes given in equation (5). As noted earlier,
technical models employing filter rules and moving averages are
popular models that have been analyzed in earlier studies. The
filter sizes and moving average lengths are selected as they have
been applied in earlier studies. Other filter sizes and moving
average lengths along with other technical models could, of course,

be analyzed. Data—mining exercises of this sort must be avoided.
Rather than torture the data until a profitable rule materializes,

we will report our empirical results for all of the popular models
that we test.

     We now describe our simulation technique. Each series of
futures prices of length N+l corresponds to a series of log price

                                13
changes of length N. These N observations could be arranged in M =
Nt separate sequences, each sequence (in         1, ... M) corresponding

to a unique profit measure (X[m,r)) under trading rule r for r 1,
    R.'° For each currency, we generate a new comparison series (a

shuffled series), by making a random rearrangement of price changes
in the original series. By operating on the sequence of price
changes, the starting and ending price levels of the new series are

constrained to be exactly as their values in the original data. And

by randomly rearranging the original data, the new series is
constrained to have identical distributional properties as the
original series. However, the time series properties of the new
data are made random. Our simulation, therefore, generates one of

the many paths that the exchange rate might have followed from its
level on the starting day of the sample until the ending day
holding constant the original distribution of price changes.
     This process of randomly shuffling the series of returns is

repeated 10,000 times for each currency, thereby generating 10,000
i.i.d. drawings from all in   = 1,   ... M   possible sequences. Each of
the 10,000 notional paths bears the same distributional properties

as the original series, but the time series properties have been
scrambled with each path, by construction, drawn independently of
the other notional paths. Each technical rule (all filters and
moving averages) is then applied to each of the 10,000 random
series and the profits, X[m,r], are measured. This procedure


     10
       In our case with N approximately 3800, M is, conservatively
speaking, a huge number. With N=50, for example, M = 3.04 X l0.
                                     14
generates an emDirical distribution of profits. The profits of the
original series can then be compared to the profits from the
randomly generated, shuffled series. Under the null hypothesis, if

there is no information or signals in the original sequence of
data, then the profits obtained from trading in the original series

should not be significantly different from the profits available in
the shuffled series. The null hypothesis that there is no
information in the original time series of data is rejected at the

a percent level if the profits obtained in the original series are
greater than the a percent cutoff level of the empirical
distribution.


IV. Empirical Results
     In Table 1, we present descriptive statistics on the original
times series of futures price returns. The mean daily return for
all currencies is small and averages near zero. The largest
(absolute) mean return was negative four basis points per day for
the BP in the second sub-period, or roughly 10% per annum. The
daily standard deviation varies from 0.27% for the CD to 0.79% for

the SF. For the CD and the JY, the standard deviation of returns is

fairly constant across the three sub-periods. However, for the
other three currencies, volatility rises sharply in the second sub—

period.
     The autocorrelation of daily returns for lags 1—10 are




                                15
reported in Table 2. The estimates reveal a considerable amount
of significant autocorrelation. For the DM, SF, and CD we find
evidence of significant positive autocorrelation at lags 1 and/or
2. In more general tests for autocorrelation, we find significant
Box-Pierce Q statistics for the DM and CD (over the full sample)
and the JY and SF over the 1976-1980 subperiod.'2 No Q statistics
are significant for the BP, or for any currency in the final 1986-

1990 subperiod.
     Sample autocorrelation may be spurious in the presence of
heteroskedasticity)3 Given the empirical evidence reviewed earlier

on heteroskedasticity in currency movements, we follow the
methodology of Hsieh (1988) and compute heteroskedasticity-
consistent estimates of the standard error for each autocorrelation

coefficient, s(k) =    V(1/n)(l-s-y(x2,k)/a),   where n is the sample
size, y(x2,k) is the sample autocovariance of the squared data at
lag k, and a is the sample standard deviation of the original data.

As expected, this adjustment reduces the number of significant
autocorrelation coefficients. None of the adjusted Box—Pierce Q




     H    Autocorrelations   at lags 11—30 were computed but they are
not reported here.
     12
        The Box-Pierce Q(k) statistic tests the joint hypothesis
that the first ) autocorrelation coefficients are zero. We also
computed Ljung-Box Q statistics which gave nearly identical
results.

statistics are significant at the 5% level.'4

     The profits associated with the generation of buy and sell
signals using filter rules and moving average rules are reported in

Tables 3A and 3B respectively. Over the entire 15—year sample
period, every size filter results in positive profits for every
currency. Average profit in the Canadian dollar across all filters
is 2.0%, substantially less than the average for other currencies
where results range between 6.9% and 8.1% . The results are much
the same for the moving average rules which led to average profits

of 2.7% for the CD, and between 7.0% and 9.0% for the other
currencies.
     As expected, small filters and trading rules based on short—

term moving averages result in considerably more trading signals
than larger filters and rules embodying long—term moving averages.
The most 0.5% filter traded 901 times in 15 years, or about 60
trades per year; the 1/5 moving average rule for the Canadian
dollar produced 987 trades or about 65 trades per year. We
calculate that the likely cost of transacting in the currency
futures market is about 2.5 basis points (0.025%) per transaction
for a large institution. A more conservative estimate would be
roughly 4.0 basis points.' At 65 trades per year, a speculator


       The adjusted Box—Pierce Q(K) statistic is calculated as
E'1..1(p(k)/s(k)]2, which is asymptotically distributed as X2   with   K
degrees of freedom.
     ' We consider two elements in the cost of transacting: first,
the bid/ask spread which we take as $0.0002 or $0.0001 per
transaction, and second, the brokerage commission estimated at
$11.00 per round-trip transaction. Since the sizes of currency
                                 17
would have his trading profits reduced by 1.62% per year or 2.60%
per year if we take our more conservative measure. Transaction
costs of this magnitude would nearly decimate the 3.3% annual
return for the 1/5 moving average rule in the Canadian dollar and
take a considerable bite out of the other transaction generating
rules. For the other trading rules we consider, the volume of
trading is considerably smaller, and transaction costs do not

significantly affect profits.
     The rank of the filter rule profits for the actual series in
comparison to the 10,000 randomly generated series is also reported
in Table 3A. The results are quite striking. In nineteen of the
cases, the profits of the actual series rank in the top 1% (9900
and above) of all the simulated series. In six further cases, the

rank is in the top 5% (9500 -   9899). The remaining five cases rank
lower, but in no case lower than the top 21% of the simulated
series (rank 7900 and above). Thus in 25 of our 30 cases, we can
reject the hypothesis that there is no information in the original

series that can be exploited for profit by our filter rules.
     The results are much the same for the moving average rules. We

find twelve cases in which the profits of the actual series rank in

the top 1% of all of the simulated series and two additional cases
that are significant at the 5% level. The remaining case ranks


futures contract are fixed and futures prices are variable, the
percentage cost of transacting varies somewhat across currencies
and over time. Our likely estimate reflects an average across these
dimensions.



                                  18
lower, but still in the top 6% of the simulated series (rank 9400
and above). Again, these results imply a strong rejection of the
hypothesis that there is no information in the original series that

can be exploited for profit by our moving average rules.
     Summary statistics for the simulated series and filter rule
trading strategies are shown in Table 4A. In all thirty cases, the

average profit is very small and insignificantly different from
zero. In only one case (the 0.5% filter rule for the British pound)

is the average profit positive for the sample of 10,000 simulated
series. The other sample statistics for the simulated series
suggest that average profits are normally distributed without
skewness or kurtosis.

     These results strongly suggest that the actual exchange rate
series contained significant departures from serial independence
that allowed technical trading rules to be profitable. If the
actual series had been generated randomly, our simulations suggest
that average profits would be close to zero. Gauged against these

simulations, the actual path of exchange rates is seen to embody a

significant degree of serial dependence.
     To measure the stability of these results over time, we split

the sample period into three, five-year sub—periods and repeated
our analysis. We decided to split the sample in this arbitrary way

rather than based on foreign currency strength and weakness, since

the latter might exaggerate the profitability of trend-following
rules. Our results for filter rules (in Table 5A) show that out of

ninety cases (5 currencies x 6 filter rules x 3 periods) the

                                19
application of filter rules to the original data resulted in
profits in 80 cases and losses in the remaining ten cases. Across
all currencies, the average profitability of filter rules rose from

7.2% in 1976—1980 to 7.3% in 1981—1985, but fell to 4.0% in 1986—
1990. Smaller filters appeared to be most profitable in the first
two sub-periods, while in the final sub—period, the 3%, 4%, and 5%

filters appeared to be more profitable on average. The recent
decline in profitability is most apparent for the DM and SF, for
which 0.5%, 1% and 2% filters generally would have produced losses.

Nevertheless, of the ninety cases in Table 5A, profits significant
at the 10% level were found in more than half of the cases.

     A similar set of results for moving average rules during the

three sub—periods is reported in Table 5B. All 45 cases (5
currencies x 3 rules x 3 periods) result in positive profits. On
average, there is some deterioration over time in the profitability

of these rules, but the overall decline is small. The most
pronounced decline was for the 1 day/5 day rule in the third sub-
period for DM and SF. Despite this, more than half of the cases
held significant profits at the 10% level.

    These results for five—year sub—periods illustrate some of the

risks that are entailed in technical trading, although it appears
that some of these risks can be diversified by not operating in a

single currency with a single technical rule.


V. Summary and Conclusions
    The purpose of this paper was to update earlier evidence on

                                20
the profitability of simple technical trading rules and to extend
these results using a new statistical test. Our results show that
the profitability of simple technical models that was documented on

data from the 1970s has continued on into the 1980s. Moreover, our
statistical tests suggest that the profitability of these technical

rules is highly significant in comparison to the empirical
distribution of profits generated by thousands of bootstrap
simulations.

     The profitability of trend following rules strongly suggests
some form of serial dependency in the data, but the nature of that

dependency remains unclear.'6 Oddly, the B? series does not reveal

any significant autocorrelation, yet the trading profits in the BP
are similar to other currencies. Our technical rules for the OM, CD

and SF are most profitable during subperiods when there is no
significant autocorrelation, rather than in other subperiods when

serial correlation is present. Only the JY has its most profitable

subperiod when its autocorrelation is significant.

     The persistence of trading profits over the 15-year sample
period is itself a striking result. However, we also found evidence

that these profits have declined somewhat over the most recent
five—year sub—period. Possible explanations for the persistence of
trading profits are the presence of central bank intervention that

tends to lean against the wind and retard exchange rate movements.

The profitability of trend following rules may be the result of

     16 Bilson (1990) models the relationship between past and
future exchange rate changes as a non—linear function of observable
variables.
                                21
excessive speculation that cause prices to follow, at least
temporarily, a speculative bubble path away from their fundamental

equilibrium values. It is also, of course, possible that too little

capital is committed to currency speculation making market prices
slow to adjust to their equilibrium values. While commercial banks

are exceedingly active in interbank market trading and intra—day
positions may be large, far less capital is committed to overnight

and longer—term currency positions.
     The results presented here could be extended in several
worthwhile directions. One would be to specify alternative models
for generating exchange rates such as a univariate ARIMA time
series model, a Markov switching model as discussed in Section II,

or a GARCH model. Each specification could itself be taken as the
null model, and we could then generate numerous simulated series

using bootstrap techniques. Comparing the profitability of the
original series with the empirical distribution of profits (and
distributions of other sample statistics) would determine whether
we can reject any null model.'7 While this technique could clarify

which statistical model (or models) were consistent with the.
generation of currency prices, because these null models are not

necessarily equilibrium economic models, they would not necessarily
tell us whether the profits earned by technical trading rules were

unusual in an economic, risk-adjusted sense.


          Brock, Lakonishok and LeBaron use technical models in
concert with bootstrap simulation techniques to test the adequacy
of alternative null models for the generation of stock market
prices.

     Using the notation from the text, we can write the interest
rate parity relation with continuous compounding as


          F1 — S1 exp(i11 —       i]    —     s1 exp(D1]       (Al)



At time (t—l), equation (Al) can be re—written as



          F11       S1 exp(D1]                                 (A2)



Dividing Al by A2 and taking logarithms, we have



          in (F1/F1)         in (S,/S1.1) + CD1 — D1.1)        (A3)

or
                —    s   +   d1                                (A4)



where f1 is the price trend or the daily profit as defined in
equation (5) in the text. The variance of f1 is



          a2(f1) —       c2(s1)   +    a2(d1) + 2 Cov(s1,d1)   (A5)
As an empirical matter, it is well documented (see Levich (1989))
that the volatility of the interest differential, d1, is far less

than the volatility of the spot rate. Practically speaking, then,
volatility in futures contracts will tend to be dominated by
contemporaneous volatility in spot contracts rather than by changes
in interest rates as the contract matures.
