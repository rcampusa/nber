Disposition Matters: Volume, Volatility and Price Impact of a Behavioral Bias

                                           ABSTRACT

In this paper, we estimate the behavioral component of the Grinblatt and Han (2002) model and
derive several testable implications about the expected relationship between the preponderance of
disposition-prone investors in a market and volume, volatility and stock returns. To do this, we use
a large sample of individual accounts over a six-year period in the 1990’s in order to identify

investors who are subject to the disposition effect. We then use their trading behavior to construct

behavioral factors. We show that when the fraction of “irrational” investor purchases in a stock
increases, the unexplained portion of the market price of the stock decreases. We further show that
statistical exposure to a disposition factor explains cross-sectional differences in daily returns,
controlling for a host of other factors and characteristics. The evidence is consistent with the

hypothesis that trade between disposition-prone investors and their counter-parties impacts relative
prices.

Introduction

        An important challenge to behavioral finance is to find a direct link between
individual investor behavior and asset price dynamics. Few doubt that large numbers of
investors behave irrationally and are prone to behavioral heuristics that lead to sub-
optimal investment choices, however the empirical evidence that these investors affect
prices has been elusive. While irrational individual investor traits and tendencies are
interesting in their own right, their relevance to asset pricing is limited, unless irrational
or at least behaviorally biased individuals can be shown to be the marginal investors in
economically relevant settings. Demonstrating their marginality is a particularly difficult
challenge because behavioral data are limited in scope and dimension. Aside from a few
limited, natural experiments (cf. Green and Rydqvist, 1999) nobody has yet established
an empirical link between the apparent irrationality of investor behavior and changes in
asset prices.
        This is not to say that evidence on the market impact of individual investor choice
is lacking. Warther (1995), Cohen (1999) and Zheng (1999), for example, all find a
relationship between aggregate fund flows and equity returns over long periods. Using
individual fund flow data, Edelen and Warner (1999) show a high frequency correlation
between flow data and the stock returns. Goetzmann and Massa (2000, 2002) establish
the causality from flows to prices and demonstrate that the aggregate magnitude of the
shocks can be large. In other research Goetzmann et al. (2000) and Brown et al. (2002)
find that behavioral-based factors, orthogonal to standard asset factors, spread asset
returns. However, while all of these studies use behavioral factors, the factors are not
“irrational” in the Kahneman and Tversky sense. Cash flow shocks or changes in
preferences by individuals might simply be related to rational portfolio rebalancing
activity by investors, or even rational trading on inter-temporal regularities such as
momentum or mean reversion.
        In this paper, we focus on the most widely documented behavioral heuristic
among investors, the disposition effect. Grinblatt and Han (2002) find compelling
evidence that U.S. stocks with large, unrealized capital gains have higher expected
returns – exactly what their model of the disposition effect would predict. Their results




                                              2
strongly suggest that a disposition factor constructed directly from individual investor
decisions should be priced.
       The disposition effect was introduced to the finance literature by Shefrin and
Statman (1985) as a characterization of the tendency of individuals to ride losses and
realize gains. As such, it was based directly on Kahneman and Tversky’s loss aversion
framework. Statman and Thorley (1999) point out that the disposition effect, being based
on a mental accounting framework, is stock-specific rather than related to the market as a
whole. Thus it might not manifest itself as a pervasive, market wide risk factor. However,
that is the proposition we test in this paper. Using a database of individual investor
decisions, we construct factors from actions taken by the investors who demonstrate
disposition biases and then we test whether these factors are related to asset prices. We
use them to explain the residual portion of stock returns, volume and volatility dynamics
as predicted by the Grinblatt and Han model, and we show some evidence that these
disposition-effect-based factors spread returns.      The evidence is consistent with the
hypothesis that trade between disposition-prone investors and their counter-parties
influences relative prices.
       The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 1, we describe our
approach and relate it to the existing literature. In Section 2, we lay out the testable
restrictions. In Section 3, we describe the data we use. In Section 4, we report the way we
construct our behavioral factors. In Section 5, we describe the empirical tests and their
results. A brief conclusion follows.


1 Relation with the literature and our approach

       Loss aversion postulates that investors have the ''tendency to seek risk when faced
with possible losses, and to avoid risk when a certain gain is possible.” Loss aversion
relies on studies in psychology that show that a decline in utility arising out of the
realization of losses relative to gains induces investors not to sell losing stocks relative to
winning ones. This intuition was formally developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
and applied empirically to the financial markets by Shefrin and Statman (1985) and
DeBondt and Thaler (1985). Barber and Odean (2000, 2001, 2002) and Odean (1998,



                                              3
1999) empirically demonstrated that investors do indeed tend to ''hold on to the losers and
sell the winners.” Widespread evidence of loss-aversion and the disposition effect have
since been found and explored by other authors. Weber and Camerer (1998), Weber and
Zuchel (2001) have experimentally documented the effect for investors. Oehler et al.
(2002) show that it is pervasive across markets around the world. Dhar and Zhu (2002)
find that the tendency towards the disposition effect differs among individual investors
depending upon personal characteristics. Ranguelova (2001) finds the disposition effect
is most pronounced on trades of small stocks. Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000) find strong
evidence of loss aversion in Finnish data, and Genesove and Mayer (2001) shed further
light on investor irrationality by analyzing loss aversion and seller behavior in the
housing market. More recently, Jackson (2002), and Brown, et al, (2002) using
Australian data, provided evidence of the “half-life” of the disposition effect among
investors.
       Considerable theoretical analysis suggests that behavioral biases could affect asset
prices. For example, Shumway (1997) develops an equilibrium asset pricing model
based on loss-averse investors and shows that loss aversion induces investors to demand
a higher risk premium for risk associated with negative market returns. Grinblatt and Han
(2002) develop a theoretical model to explain the equilibrium price implications of the
disposition effect. This allows them to relate momentum to the amount of unrealized
capital gains/losses and to derive cross-sectional implications they use to test their model.
They find that a capital gains variable has pricing implications, a result that would be
implied by the salience of disposition-prone investors.          Other empirical evidence
suggesting that behavioral biases have price impact is not entirely lacking. Coval and
Shumway (2001) report evidence of behavioral biases among proprietary traders at the
Chicago Board of Trade and investigate the impact of such biases on prices. They show
that losing traders tend to buy contracts at higher prices and sell contracts at lower prices
and they document a short-term price impact. Kaustia’s (2001) study of IPO’s finds
evidence that the disposition effect impacts the prices of recently issued stocks. With the
exception of these few studies the relevance of the disposition effect to asset pricing has
been tantalizing but not entirely convincing.




                                                4
2 Analytical Framework


        Grinblatt and Han (2002) derive closed-forms for the stock price and the trading
volume as a function of fundamentals and disposition variables. We adopt their
specification and refer the reader to their paper for further detail. In particular, they show
that:


                    Pt +1 − Pt = w ( Ft +1 − Ft ) + (1− w )ν t ( Pt − Rt ),            (1)



where Pt is the price of the asset, Ft is its fundamental value and Rt is its reference price.
The latter is the weighted average of the past prices at which the disposition-investors
executed trades. The variable w is the weight that accounts for the representation of the
                                                                       1
disposition investors in the economy. In particular, w =                   , where µ is the proportion
                                                                    1 + µλ

of disposition investors and λ is the relative intensity of the demand perturbation induced
by the disposition effect. The variable ν defines the law of motion of the reference price.
It follows R t = ν t −1Pt −1 + (1− ν t −1 )R t −1 and is bounded between 0 and 1.


        Grinblatt and Han also show that:


                   Vt ≈ w |Ft +1 − Ft − ν t −1 (Pt −1 − R t −1 )|,               (2)


        Therefore, the price of a stock, as well as its trading volume, are a function of
both the fundamentals (Ft) and the accumulated impact of prior capital gains/losses (Rt),
weighted by the representation of the disposition investors in the market (w). In
particular, the disposition effect drives a wedge between the fundamental value of an
asset and its market price. This spread is directly related to the amount of unrealized
gains/losses and to the percentage of disposition investors in the market. Conditional on
constant weights w, both return and trading volume are a function of a backward looking
component ( ν t −1 (Pt −1 − R t −1 ) ) and of the shocks to the fundamentals ( Ft +1 − Ft ).



                                                    5
              Grinblatt and Han test these restrictions by focusing on momentum and assessing
the role of past gains/losses on stock returns using a gains variable constructed from past
returns and turnover. A stock that has had positive momentum for a while (i.e., is a
winner) must have a positive spread between fundamental value and market price that is
related to the existence and the position size of disposition investors. Therefore, the
aggregate amount of unrealized capital gains provides a way to test the impact of the
disposition effect.
              Note that it would be useful to estimate the effects of a time-varying µ. If the
representation of the disposition investors in the economy changes (i.e., µ fluctuates over
time), their impact will also differ. We can directly see this by considering Equation 1. It
shows that the stochastic component of price is the part related to the shocks to the
fundamentals (i.e., Ft), while the second part (i.e., Rt) is backward looking. If we assume
that µ changes over time, we can consider the derivative of price with respect to µ. The
same can be done for the volatility and for the trading volume. This implies:


                   ∂ Re t t      ∂σ t                        ∂Vt
                            < 0,      < 0, and                   < 0 if Ft+1 > Rt+1,   (3)
                     ∂µ           ∂µ                          ∂µ


where Rett is the actual ex-post return on the stock, defined as (Pt+1-Pt)/Pt. The intuition is
the following. Disposition investors tend to hold losers and sell winners. This implies
that, if the stocks are doing well and prices are above the reference point,1 an increase in
the fraction of disposition investors (i.e., the net buyers of losing stocks) reduces the net
demand, lowering prices (Pt+1), returns, volume and volatility. Another valuable test of
the disposition effect relies on the estimation of the relationship between the fraction of
disposition investors and the main pricing variables (i.e., returns, volume and volatility),
directly testing restriction 3. The attraction of focusing directly on µ is that it is the only
variable in the equation that is independent of prices or economic values. As such, it
allows a direct test of the effects of investor behavior.
              It is also worth noting that restriction 3 in general provides us with two further
testable restrictions. First, it implies a strong relationship between the percentage of

                                                                    6
disposition investors in the market and market variables (i.e., returns, volatility and
volume). Also, the restriction suggests that the relationship will be of the same sign for
all the three market variables. Moreover, given that most of our sample covers a boom
period during which, on average it was commonly believed that Ft+1 > Rt+1, we can also
consider a third, stronger, implication. That is, we expect that, in our sample, on average,
the relationship will be negative.
         In order to test these restrictions, we proceed as follows. First we identify the
disposition investors. Then, we construct factors based on the trades of these investors
and test whether these factors explain differences in stock returns, volume and volatility.
Finally, we test whether these factors spread returns in sample. This is a necessary
condition for them to be priced in equilibrium.

3 Data


         We use data provided by a nationwide discount brokerage house. These data
contain information on over 100,000 accounts for around 86,000 households. For each
account we have the daily transactions on all the assets for the period 1/1/1991-
28/11/1996. For each transaction in the account we know the security traded (identified in
the case of a stock by the CRSP CUSIP), the direction of the trade, the quantity traded,
and the commission paid.
         For each account we also know some demographic information about the
investor. Each investor may hold several accounts. We follow Barber and Odean and
concentrate on only their equity holdings. We conduct our analysis at the investor level
and consider each single buy and sell order for each account. For a more detailed
description of the data we refer to Barber and Odean (2000, 2001, 2002) and Odean
(1998, 1999).
         We report descriptive statistics of the data in Table 1. In particular, in Panel A,
descriptive statistics for groups of accounts are broken down on the basis of the average
number of transactions per year. For each group we report the number of accounts, the
number of transactions and the percentage (out of the total transactions) of purchases and




                                              7
sales. We also report the average Running Balance and the Turnover Ratio.2 In Panel B,
we report some disposition characteristics. That is, for each group we separately consider
the buy-at-gain, buy-at-loss, sell-at-gain and sell-at-loss transactions, as described in the
next section. For each of these categories of transactions, we report the number of
transactions and their percentage in terms of number of overall transactions.
           In terms of representativeness of the sample, we refer to Kumar (2002). He
compares this sample to the one reported by the Census Bureau (Survey of Income and
Program participation, (SIPP), 1995) and the Federal Reserve (Survey of Consumer
Finance (SCF), 1992, 1995). For example, in our sample the median portfolio size of an
investor is $13,869. This compares to 16,900 for the SCF 1992 and to $15,300 for SCF
1995.


4 Construction of the variables


4.1 Construction of behavioral ratios
           We consider two types of measures. The first is meant to identify investors on a
transaction basis. That is, for each transaction we distinguish trades “at-loss” and trades
“at-gain”. Then, for each stock we construct a daily time series of the “sales-at-loss”,
“sales-at-gains”, “buys-at-loss” and “buys-at-gains.”
           In order to identify sales at loss, we have to make some assumptions about the
previous price at which the stock was purchased. We assume a “LIFO” criterion. That is,
the last shares bought are assumed to be the first ones sold.3 For example, consider the
following sequence of transactions for a given investor at the beginning of the sample,
January, 1991. First a buy happens at a particular price. Next, if a sell occurs in the next
period, then we calculate the difference between the sell price and the price at which the
previous purchase occurred. If the difference is negative, i.e. is the sale occurred at a
price lower than the price at which it was previously bought, we record this as a “sale-at-
loss.” If, on the contrary, the difference is positive, we consider it a “sale-at-gain.”

2 The Running Balance is constructed as the average holdings standardised by the amount of time they are held. Turnover is
calculated as the absolute sum of purchases and sales (expressed in terms of number of shares) divided by the average running
balance.
3 Every sell until the first buy operation within the period 1991-1996 is ignored.




                                                                    8
         For each sale, the quantity is compared to the quantities previously bought. If the
quantity is lower or equal to the number of shares bought in the previous purchase
transaction, the profit or loss is given by the difference between the prices of the two
transactions. If, however, the quantity sold is greater that the number of shares purchased
in the transaction immediately before, we use the LIFO criterion and refer back to earlier
purchases, until we have fully matched the current shares sold with previous purchase
transactions. We then calculate the profit/loss of the sale by weighting the quantity
previously purchased by the price at which the transaction took place.           The LIFO
criterion is, of course, a necessary accounting convenience adopted for our analysis. It’s
validity or relationship to the disposition effect has not been tested experimentally,
despite its intuitive appeal. Thus, it is conceivable it could make our measure of the
disposition effect a less than perfect one. Never-the-less, it is not clear why this approach
would bias our results one way or the other.


         Lets us look at a sample case:


Transaction date   Quantity Price         Buy/Sell Gain/Loss
910101             100       100          Buy        -
910105             100       110          Buy        (110-100)*100
910110             200       70           Buy        (70-110)*100
940101             310       150          Sell       (150-70)*200+(150-110)*110+(150-100)*10
950103             50        110          Sell       (110-100)*50


         For the above data we compute the gain/loss measures in the following manner.
We start with the first buy operation on 01-01-1991. Calculation of the gain/loss for this
transaction is indeterminate. Next, 100 shares are purchased on 01-05-91. So the buy-on-
gain is equal to: 100 x (110-100) = 1000. The next purchase is a buy on loss. That is, the
loss is equal to: 200 x (70-110) = -8000. The next transaction is a sell. The investor is
selling 310 at a price 150. Out of these 310 units, the first 200 units are compared to the
previous purchase price of 70, the next 100 would be compared to the purchase price of
110 and the next 10 would be compared to the purchase price of 100. So the total would



                                                 9
be 200 x (150 – 70) + 100 x (150 – 110) + 10 x (150 – 100) = 20500. This represents a
“sell-on-gain,” realizing profit.
       It is worth noting that we use the same convention for both buys and sells. That is,
for each sale-transaction, we identify whether it was a profit or loss, from the investor’s
standpoint. Analogously, in the case of purchases, using as anchor or reference point the
previous transaction of the investor, we identify whether it took place at a loss sale where
the investor lost with respect to his previous transactions or whether he gained.
       For the construction of our disposition factors, it is desirable to create proxies for
the relative representation in the market of the disposition investors – i.e., the relative net
demand of disposition investors over the net total demand in the market. We use as our
criterion the fact that disposition investors tend to sell winning stocks (i.e., sell-at-gain)
and buy losing stocks (i.e., buy-at-loss). We consider three types of daily disposition
variables: W1, W2 and W3. W1 is constructed as the dollar-value of total buys-at-loss
minus buys-at-gain on a given day, standardized by the sum of buys-at-loss and buys-at-
gain. This can be calculated for a specific stock, for a portfolio of stocks or for the market
as a whole. W2 is constructed as the ratio between the total dollar value of sells-at-loss
minus sells-at-gain standardized by the sum of sells-at-loss and sells-at-gain. W3
combines the information from buys-at-loss and sells-at-loss. It is constructed as the ratio
between buy-at-loss plus sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain minus buy-at-gain standardized
by the sum of buy-at-loss, buy-at-gain, sell-at-loss and sell-at-gain.


                  (B
                   lt   − B gt )              (S   lt   − S gt )              (S   lt   − S gt ) + (Blt − B gt )
          W1t =                    , W2 t =                        , W2 t =                                        (4)
                  (B
                   lt   + B gt )              (S   lt   + S gt )              (S   lt   + S gt ) + (Blt + B gt )


       Notice that the reference point is always the price at which the investor’s previous
transaction was executed, under the LIFO criterion. This may date back as much as five
years in our sample. One potential problem with this approach is fact that disposition
investors may simply coincide with “smart” investors, who sell high (at-gain) and buy
low (at-loss). To address this issue, we also consider a second way of constructing the
factors that uses the information contained in the overall portfolios of the investors – i.e.,
both realized and paper gains/losses.


                                                                   10
4.2 Construction of other variables.
         We use daily data on the 100 largest stocks in the U.S. market at the beginning of
the period. We consider two measures of trading: volume: the number of shares traded,
and turnover, measured by volume divided by the outstanding number of shares.
Following previous researchers, i.e. Anshuman, Brennan (2001) and Chordia and
Subrahmanyam, (2001) we perform our analysis based on turnover, and use volume and
volatility as control variables. Previous authors find that turnover is a “characteristic” that
affects the return of each stock.
         Given the daily frequency of the data, we use a range-based measure of volatility.
Alizadeh, Brandt and Diebold, (2001) recently showed that that “theoretically,
numerically and empirically the range-based measure of volatility is not only a highly
efficient volatility proxy, but also that it is approximately Gaussian and robust to
microstructure noise.” Thus for each stock we construct volatility as the log percentage
range:


                               max{s∈Day }P − min{s∈Day }P         

where, for each stock, daily volatility is defined as the log percentage range between the
highest price of the day minus the lowest price of the day (i.e., for each time s in the day)
standardized by the sum of the highest and lowest prices.
         We also include, among the other control variables, the three Fama and French
factors (Market, HML and SMB), the risk-less rate, the return on the stock, the volatility
of the stock, and the logarithm of its trading volume.


5 Tests of the impact of behavioral factors


         We first consider the relationship between our behavioral factors and market
variables (i.e., returns, volume and volatility) at the single stock level and at the portfolio



                                              11
level.      In particular, we consider the contemporaneous correlation between the
disposition factors and return, volume and volatility, as predicated by restriction 3.


5.1 Behavioral factors and trading volume
         We first consider the relationship between the proportion of disposition trades and
trading volume. In order to test restriction 3, we perform a panel regression of the
logarithm of turnover on the disposition factors and a set of control variables.4 We
consider three specifications. The first specification is based on all the stocks and the
others are based on portfolios of stocks (10 portfolios of 10 stocks each and 5 portfolios
of 20 stocks each). In the case of portfolios, the values are the average values of the
stocks in the portfolios. In the case of portfolios, the trading volume on a given day is
the average volume of the stocks in the portfolios on that day. For example, in the case
of the five portfolio results, the dependent variable is the average volume for the 20
stocks in the portfolio for that day, while the portfolio-specific characteristics in the set of
independent variables are likewise the average on that day of these characteristics (such
as volatility) for the 20 stocks comprising the portfolio. In particular, the disposition
variable is the average ratio calculated for those specific stocks in the portfolio.
         The results, reported in Table 2, show a significant negative correlation between
disposition factors and turnover. This holds both at the stock level (first column) and at
aggregate level (columns 2 and 3). Thus we find that, consistent with model predictions,
not only is there a strong relationship between disposition factors and turnover, but also
the relationship is negative, as our stronger restriction would have required for the period
considered.     In other words, in a period of rising prices on average, the relative
prevalence of disposition investor trades would lover turnover as they held on to their
gains.


5.2 Behavioral factors and volatility
         We now consider the impact of our behavioral factors on volatility. We regress
volatility on our disposition factors and a set of control variables. As before, we consider


4
 The estimates are based on White's adjusted heteroscedastic consistent least-squares regression (White
1980).


                                                   12
three specifications: the first based on individual stocks and the other two based on
portfolios of stocks (10 portfolios of 10 stocks each and 5 portfolios of 20 stocks each).
In the case of portfolios, as before, the dependent variable values are the average variance
estimates for the stocks in the portfolios – not the portfolio volatility which is a function
of the portfolio correlation structure. The results, reported in Table 3, show a significant
correlation between behavioral factors and volatility. This holds both at the stock level
(first column) and at the aggregate level (columns 2 and 3). As was the case for turnover,
the correlation is negative, as our stronger restriction would have required for the period
considered.


5.3 Behavioral factors and returns
       We now consider whether returns are correlated to disposition factors. A
contemporaneous correlation is of course insufficient to infer a risk premium associated
with shifts in the structure of demand towards disposition-prone investors, but it is
certainly a necessary condition for a factor to be priced. We regress returns on the
disposition factors and a set of control variables, including the market return and the
Fama and French factors HML and SMB. Again, we consider three specifications: one
based on all the stocks and the others based on portfolios of stocks (10 portfolios of 10
stocks each and 5 portfolios of 20 stocks each).
       The results, reported in Table 4, show a significant correlation between behavioral
factors and returns. This holds both at the stock level (first column) and at the portfolio
level (columns 2 and 3). As was the case for turnover and volatility, the correlation is
negative, as our stronger restriction predicted. It is important to note that the factor is
effectively explaining the residual component of the time-series of returns to portfolios
and stocks. The high t-statistics on the market returns and the Fama and French variables
are a function of the fact that these are stacked regressions that do not control for
correlation   across   portfolios    (although     the   White   adjustment   accounts   for
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations). By the same token, however, the regression on
these factors and characteristic control variables should account for most of the cross-
sectional correlation in stocks or portfolios. Yet even with these control variables we
find that the behavioral factors still strongly co-move negatively with returns.     This is



                                             13
consistent with   the hypothesis that trade between disposition-prone investors and their
counter-parties affects relative prices. As such, it could be a “style” effect of the sort
modeled in Barbaris and Shleifer (2002), for example.


5.4 Aggregate disposition factors and market variables
       It is not implausible that demand shocks by “disposition-disposed” investors
might be related to market variables – even prices -- at the individual level or even the
level of small portfolios. If they were only security-specific, however, these effects would
logically cancel each other out at a higher level of aggregation. To explore this issue,
Table 5 reports results based on a factor that is constructed by aggregating the
disposition-prone buys and sells across all 100 stocks. At this level, the results depend
upon the tendency of disposition-prone investors to trade in the same direction on a given
day – otherwise we would expect little variation in the series and no explanatory power.
Table 6 examines the aggregate effect somewhat differently. Not only does it use the
aggregated behavioral variable, it also is not performed on stacked series.’ For the return
regression, for example, we explain the daily time-series of the equal-weighted return
index across 100 stocks by the aggregate disposition variable and a variety of controls.
Note that we had to remove the market-factor from the specification, since the dependent
variable in panel C is almost perfectly correlated to the S&P 500 index itself.
       In the aggregate specifications, the results for turnover are somewhat lessened,
although not insignificant for the specification using both buys and sells. The results for
volatility and returns are all relatively strong. Thus, not only does disposition matter at
the individual security level, the aggregate behavior of disposition-prone investors
appears to matter at the aggregate level, suggesting that behavioral effects might be
important at the market-wide level.
       Thus far, the results support the strong form of restriction 3. We find a strong and
statistically significant negative relationship between our disposition demand and market
variables. In particular, the relationship between returns and factors is consistent with the
disposition variables being characteristics of individual stocks, either due to fundamentals
of the style preferences, as well as with the disposition variables being factors that are
priced. These explanations of course are not mutually exclusive.



                                             14
        Indeed, as indicated in equation 1, stock returns are a function of two components,
a backward-looking component related to the price reference (Rt) and a component that
accounts for the fundamentals (Ft). Only the latter should be priced, as it is a function of
the shocks (innovations) to the fundamentals, while the former only relates to past
shocks. If the percentage of the disposition investors in each company were not
stochastic, we would expect it to affect stock returns by merely amplifying the shocks to
the fundamentals. That is, it would act as characteristic, without being a factor of its own.
If, on the contrary, the percentage of the disposition investors changes over time, the
change in their relative representation in the markets becomes a factor itself. In this case,
it may be priced. In order to distinguish these two possibilities, we turn to tests of pricing.


6 Are behavioral factors priced?
        One of our goals is to assess the impact of behavioral biases on prices. We
therefore perform a standard asset pricing Fama and MacBeth [FM] two-stage time-series
cross-section test, applied to daily returns.
        We follow two approaches: first we use individual stock returns (Table 7) and
then size-sorted portfolios (Table 8). In order to construct the disposition factors, we
proceed as follows. Once the daily purchases and sales of the different classes of
investors have been identified and the behavioral ratios have been constructed, we build
portfolios based on them, following the Fama and French (1993) procedure. That is, we
rank stocks on the basis of the behavioral ratios and then construct portfolios based on the
differences between the returns of the portfolios constructed from high-factor stocks and
the portfolios constructed from low-factor stocks. Portfolios are constructed daily.
        We apply the FM procedure on rolling intervals and daily updated betas. We
consider 20-day rolling windows. This generates sets of betas that are then used as
explanatory variables in the second step of the procedure. We consider the three Fama
and French factors (Rmkt, HML and SMB) and our disposition factors. The first step of
the procedure generates the βs. These are estimated via a time-series regression. Then, the
βs are used in a second-pass regression along the lines of Fama and MacBeth.
        At this stage we also include some “characteristics” (Brennan, Chordia and
Subrahmanyan, 1998). These are the volatility on the stock, the logarithm of turnover of



                                                15
the stock and the logarithm of its trading volume). In the case of portfolios, the
characteristics are aggregated for each size-sorted portfolio. We consider alternative
specifications based on a different number of factors and characteristics. We also
consider the cases with different disposition factors. In order to overcome the potential
problems of lead-lag effects due to asynchronous trading with daily data, we apply a
Dimson-Marsh correction. We consider two alternative specifications: in the first ones we
use 3 days of leads and lags, while in the second we use five days of leads and lags. If
our hypothesis is correct, we expect the betas of the behavioral factors to have additional
explanatory power.
       The results in Tables 7 and 8 provide some evidence in favor of pricing – at least
over this limited six-year time interval. The regressions in Table 7 are estimated at the
individual security level, while the regressions in Table 8 are estimated at the portfolio
level. Note that the behavioral factors spread returns nicely, while the traditional factors –
most notably the market betas – have fairly little power.              On the other hand,
characteristics like turnover and volatility provide additional explanatory power, beyond
the factor used to create portfolios. In all the specifications, regardless of the number of
additional factors (1 or 3 factor model) and characteristics (volume, volatility, turnover)
that are included, our behavioral factors are always strongly significant. Moreover,
consistent with what we saw in the previous section, the factors always reduce returns.
This supports our hypothesis, based on extending Grinblatt and Han’s model, that an
increase in the fraction of disposition investors in the market reduces price pressure and
lowers ex-post returns.


Conclusion
       Measuring the impact of behavioral biases of asset prices is difficult because
econometricians rarely have access to individual investor decisions.           And yet, all
behavioral theory is grounded in assumptions about individual decision-making under
uncertainly. Ultimately, tests of the relevance of behavioral finance must be conducted
jointly on behavioral data and asset data. In this study, we consider the widely
documented disposition effect. We construct behavioral factors that are based on the
fraction of disposition investors trading on a given day. We derive and estimate the



                                             16
empirical implications of a model which has previously motivated an empirical asset
return study that provided strongly suggestive of a behavioral influence on the markets.
We show that factors aggregated up from individual investment decisions are statistically
related to returns, volume and volatility. Not only does the disposition bias of investors
appear to affect the return of the company in which they trade, but exposure of a stock to
the aggregate percentage of disposition investors in the economy is associated with lower
ex post returns.   An important caveat to the inference about pricing is that a six-year
window of returns cannot reasonably represent expectations or equilibrium conditions.
Never the less, the results of a classic asset-pricing test over a substantial sub-period is
strongly suggestive of the possibility that exposure to the behavior of rationally-
challenged investors is a strong candidate for a priced factor.
       This study has further implications for volatility studies and micro-structure
effects. We find evidence that both volume and volatility may depend in general upon the
composition of the market, and more specifically on disposition-prone investors.

We report descriptive statistics of the dataset. In Panel A, we report descriptive statistics for groups of accounts
broken down on the basis of the average number of transactions they enact each year (n). We consider 5 classes of
accounts: the ones with less than 5 transactions, the accounts with less than 10 and more than 5 transactions, the
accounts with less than 15 and more than 10 transactions, the accounts with less than 20 and more than 15
transactions and the accounts with more than 20 transactions. For each group we the number of accounts, the number
of transactions and the percentage (out of the total transactions) of purchases and sales. For each group we also report
the average running balance Running Balance and the Turnover Ratio. The Running Balance is constructed as the
average holdings standardised by the amount of time they are held. Turnover is calculated as the sum of absolute
value of purchases and absolute value of sales (expressed in terms of number of shares) divided by the average
running balance. In Panel B, we report some “disposition characteristics” of the accounts. That is, for each group we
separately report the buy-on-gains, buy-on-loss, sell-on-gain and sell-on-loss transactions, as described in the text in
the Section on Data Construction. For each of these categories of transactions, we report the number of transactions
and their percentage in terms of overall transactions.

We report the estimates of the regression of the logarithm of turnover on our disposition factors and a set of control
variables. We consider three types of disposition variables: W1, W2 and W3. W1 is constructed as the ratio between
buy-at-loss minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-loss and buy-at-gain. W2 is constructed as the ratio
between sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain standardized by the sum of sell-at-loss and sell-at-gain. W3 is constructed as the
ratio between buy-at-loss plus sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-
loss, buy-at-gain, sell-at-loss and sell-at-gain. W1, W2 and W3 have been divided by 1,000. The control variables
include: the three Fama and French factors (Rmkt, HML and SMB), the risk-less rate (Rf), the return on the stock (Ri),
the volatility of the stock, and the logarithm of its trading volume. For each stock we construct volatility as the
logarithm of the ratio between the highest price of the day minus the lowest price of the day, standardized by the sum
of the highest and lowest prices. The estimates are based on White's adjusted heteroscedastic consistent Least-squares
Regression (White 1980). The frequency is daily. The period is 1st January 1991-30 November 1996. We consider
three specifications: one based on all the stocks and the others based on portfolios of stocks (10 portfolios of 10 stocks
each and 5 portfolios of 20 stocks each). In the case of portfolios, the values are the average values of the stocks in the
portfolios.

consider three types of disposition variables: W1, W2 and W3. W1 is constructed as the ratio between buy-at-loss minus
buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-loss and buy-at-gain. W2 is constructed as the ratio between sell-at-loss

                                     Table 4: Returns and Disposition Factors

We report the estimates of the regression of stock returns on our disposition factors and a set of control variables. We
consider three types of disposition variables: W1, W2 and W3. W1 is constructed as the ratio between buy-at-loss minus
buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-loss and buy-at-gain. W2 is constructed as the ratio between sell-at-loss
minus sell-at-gain standardized by the sum of sell-at-loss and sell-at-gain. W3 is constructed as the ratio between buy-
at-loss plus sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-loss, buy-at-gain, sell-
at-loss and sell-at-gain. The control variables include: the three Fama and French factors (Rmkt, HML and SMB), the
risk-less rate (Rf), the volatility on the stock, the logarithm of turnover of the stock and the logarithm of its trading
volume. For each stock we construct volatility as the logarithm of the ratio between the highest price of the day minus
the lowest price of the day, standardized by the sum of the highest and lowest prices. The estimates are based on
White's adjusted heteroscedastic consistent Least-squares Regression (White 1980). The frequency is daily. The
period is 1st January 1991-30 November 1996. We consider three specifications: one based on all the stocks and the
others based on portfolios of stocks (10 portfolios of 10 stocks each and 5 portfolios of 20 stocks each). In the case of
portfolios, the values are the average values of the stocks in the portfolios. The coefficients have been multiplied by
1,000.

                  Table 5: Aggregate [W3] Disposition Index and Market Variables
We report the estimates of the regression of the logarithm of turnover, volatility and returns on our disposition factor
W3 and a set of control variables. W3 is constructed as the ratio between buy-at-loss plus sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain
minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-loss, buy-at-gain, sell-at-loss and sell-at-gain. The index has
been constructed as aggregation of trades (i.e., buys and sales) across the entire market and has been divided by
1,000. The control variables include: the HML and SMB, the risk-less rate (Rf), the return on the stock (Ri), the
volatility of the stock, and the logarithm of its trading volume. For each stock we construct volatility as the logarithm
of the ratio between the highest price of the day minus the lowest price of the day, standardized by the sum of the
highest and lowest prices. The estimates are based on White's adjusted heteroscedastic consistent Least-squares
Regression (White 1980). The frequency is daily. The period is 1st January 1991-30 November 1996. We consider
three specifications: one based on all the stocks and the others based on portfolios of stocks (10 portfolios of 10 stocks
each and 5 portfolios of 20 stocks each). In the case of portfolios, the values are the average values of the stocks in the
portfolios. The values of the coefficients in Panel B have been divided by 1,000 and the values of the coefficients in
Panel C have been multiplied by 1,000.

                       Table 6: Aggregate Disposition Index and Market Variables
We report the estimates of the regression of the logarithm of turnover, volatility and returns on our disposition factors
and a set of control variables. These variables have been aggregated across all the 100 stocks considered. The
disposition factors have been constructed as reported in Tables 2-4 and then for each of them we constructed indexes
as aggregation of trades (i.e., buys and sales) across the entire market and has been divided by 1,000. The control
variables include: the HML and SMB, the risk-less rate (Rf), the return on the stock (Ri), the volatility of the stock,
and the logarithm of its trading volume. For each stock we construct volatility as the logarithm of the ratio between
the highest price of the day minus the lowest price of the day, standardized by the sum of the highest and lowest
prices. The estimates are based on White's adjusted heteroscedastic consistent Least-squares Regression (White 1980).
The frequency is daily. The period is 1st January 1991-30 November 1996. We consider three specifications: one
based on all the stocks and the others based on portfolios of stocks (10 portfolios of 10 stocks each and 5 portfolios of
20 stocks each). In the case of portfolios, the values are the average values of the stocks in the portfolios. The values
of the coefficients in Panel B have been divided by 1,000 and the values of the coefficients in Panel C have been
multiplied by 1,000.

                     Table 7: Fama-MacBeth Regressions:
            Explaining the Cross-Sections of Individual Stock Returns

The table reports the results of the second stage of a Fama-MacBeth procedure. We consider the
three Fama and French factors (Rmkt,, HML and SMB) and our disposition factors. We consider
three types of disposition variables: W1, W2 and W3. W1 is constructed as the ratio between buy-
at-loss minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-loss and buy-at-gain. W2 is
constructed as the ratio between sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain standardized by the sum of sell-at-
loss and sell-at-gain. W3 is constructed as the ratio between buy-at-loss plus sell-at-loss minus
sell-at-gain minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-at-loss, buy-at-gain, sell-at-loss
and sell-at-gain. We first construct portfolios that mimick these factors (Fama and French, 1993),
based on the difference between the return of the portfolio made of the high-factor stocks and the
portfolios made of the low-factor stock and then we run the first step of the procedure estimation
βs. These are estimated as a time-series regression. Then, the βs are used in a second-pass
regression along the lines of Fama and MacBeth. At this stage we also include some
“characteristics” (Brennan, Chordia and Subrahmanyan, 1998). These include the volatility on
the stock, the logarithm of turnover of the stock and the logarithm of its trading volume. ). A
Dimson-Marsh correction is applied to control for potential lead-lag effects due to asynchronous
trading. We consider 2 alternative specifications: in the first ones we use 3 days of leads and lags,
while in the second we use 5 days of leads and lags. We consider different specifications with
different explanatory variables as well as different disposition variables. The frequency is daily
and the procedure is applied at the stock level. The period is 1st January 1991-30 November
1996.

                       Table 8: Fama-MacBeth Regressions:
                 Explaining the Cross-Sections of Portfolio Returns.

The table reports the results of the second stage of a Fama-MacBeth procedure. For 10 size-
sorted portfolios. We consider the three Fama and French factors (Rmkt,, HML and SMB) and our
disposition factors. We consider three types of disposition variables: W1, W2 and W3. W1 is
constructed as the ratio between buy-at-loss minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-
at-loss and buy-at-gain. W2 is constructed as the ratio between sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain
standardized by the sum of sell-at-loss and sell-at-gain. W3 is constructed as the ratio between
buy-at-loss plus sell-at-loss minus sell-at-gain minus buy-at-gain standardized by the sum of buy-
at-loss, buy-at-gain, sell-at-loss and sell-at-gain. We first construct portfolios that mimick these
factors (Fama and French, 1993), based on the difference between the return of the portfolio
made of the high-factor stocks and the portfolios made of the low-factor stock and then we run
the first step of the procedure estimation βs. These are estimated as a time-series regression.
Then, the βs are used in a second-pass regression along the lines of Fama and MacBeth. At this
stage we also include some “characteristics” (Brennan, Chordia and Subrahmanyan, 1998). These
include the volatility on the stock, the logarithm of turnover of the stock and the logarithm of its
trading volume. ). The characteristics are averaged for all the stocks within the portfolio. A
Dimson-Marsh correction is applied to control for potential lead-lag effects due to asynchronous
trading. We consider 2 alternative specifications: in the first ones we use 3 days of leads and lags,
while in the second we use 5 days of leads and lags. We consider different specifications with
different explanatory variables as well as different disposition variables. The frequency is daily
and the procedure is applied at the stock level. The period is 1st January 1991-30 November
1996.
