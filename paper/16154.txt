Business Cycles, Consumption and Risk-Sharing: How Different Is China?

                                            ABSTRACT

Can standard business-cycle methodology be applied to China? In this chapter, we address this question
by examining the macroeconomic time series and identifying dimensions in which China differs from
economies (such as Canada and the U.S.) that are typically the subject of business-cycle research.
We show that naively applying the standard business-cycle tools to China is no more ridiculous than
applying it to Canada, although the dimensions along which the model struggles is different. For China,
the model cannot account for the low level of consumption (or high saving) as a proportion of income
observed in the data. An examination of provincial level consumption data suggests that the absence
of channels for intranational consumption risk sharing may be an important reason why the business-cycle
model has trouble accounting for Chinese consumption and saving behavior.

1      Introduction

The economic importance of China in the world economy is difficult to overstate. Simply by

virtue of China's 1.3 billion people it’s economy is large in an absolute terms and is poised to

overtake Japan as the world's second largest. Its sustained growth in real per capita GDP, at an

average of 8.6 percent from 1978-2007, is high by any standard.2 While there has been a good

deal of economic research done on China, most of it has been on microeconomic issues. Given

the pace of globalization and China's role in international economics, surprisingly little research

on China has been done on the macroeconomic side by academic economists.

       There may be several reasons for this, but two possibilities jump to mind. The first

concerns doubts about data quality. In one example of potential measurement error, in revising

PPP exchange rates used to deflate nominal GDP, the World Bank revised the real GDP data for

China downwards by about 40 percent.          On the other hand, following the 2004 Chinese

Economic Census, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revised GDP from 1993-2004 upward

so that by 2004, nominal and real GDP were modified to be 16 and 6 percent higher,

respectively. Whether one believes in the accuracy of these revisions or not, the magnitude of the

revisions serve to underscore some of the uncertainty surrounding the data. A second possibility

stems from China's ongoing transition from a centrally planned to a market based economy but

with continued heavy involvement of the government. Researchers may be skeptical as to

whether a transitional economy such as China’s is appropriate for analysis by the current

generation of business cycle models. These models are typically solved as approximations

around the steady state but one can question whether China has converged to the steady state

growth path.    In this sense, China may be `too different’ from the typical country that

macroeconomists study with the standard toolkit of business cycle models.

                                                3	  

	  
       In this chapter, we examine the extent to which China's macroeconomy is suitable for

business cycle modeling. Using the available data, we address whether China is sufficiently

similar or different, say in comparison to Canada and the U.S. Of course, if we find that China is

too different for business cycle modeling, it is possible that the underlying cause is data quality.

In any event, it is beyond our manpower resources and our expertise to do anything about data

quality issues and understanding the macroeconomics of China is too important to wait until the

`high-quality data' are available.

       We focus on two issues. First, we investigate the extent to which the cyclical properties

of the post-reform Chinese economy (1978 to 2007) can be understood with a very basic real

business cycle model. The model we use is nearly identical to Mendoza (1991), who studied the

Canadian economy from 1946-1985. The only part of the model that is specific to China are the

parameters of the exogenous processes (government spending and productivity) which we

estimate from the Chinese data. Otherwise, we employ the same parameter values as Mendoza to

facilitate the comparison between Chinese and Canadian macroeconomic behavior.

       The main finding from this analysis is that China is not so very different. The business

cycle model works about as well for China as it does for Canada in terms of matching the

volatility and persistence of the macroeconomic data. For China, the model’s primary

shortcoming is in explaining consumption and saving behavior whereas for Canada it is in

explaining the persistence of investment and the trade balance. The model predicts consumption

to be too smooth and to be too large a fraction of GDP as compared to the data.

       The second issue we address is motivated by the `failure’ of the business cycle model to

explain household consumption behavior. Here, we examine the extent to which either markets

or institutions in China carry out intranational risk sharing as a potential cause of the anomalous

                                                 4	  

	  
consumption/saving behavior. Since the representative agent setup in the business cycle model

that we employ rests on an assumption of perfect within country risk sharing, severe violations of

the risk-sharing assumption may explain the inability of the model to account for this aspect of

the data. If opportunities for consumption risk-sharing are absent, people will have a strong

precautionary saving motive that normally does not arise in the model.

        Using provincial level data on real per capita consumption and income, we conduct a

formal test of the risk-sharing assumption. We follow Crucini’s (1999) study of risk-sharing

across U.S. states and among G-7 countries. By employing the same methodology as Crucini, we

can directly compare our results for China with his results for the U.S. and across the

industrialized economies.

       The primary finding from this analysis is the degree of within China risk sharing is

strikingly low. During the post market reform period (1979-2004), the data tell us that there was

about the as much risk sharing across Chinese provinces (i.e., very little) as there was

internationally among G-7 countries from 1970 to 1987. Since many capital controls were still in

place during the 70s and 80s, it is perhaps not surprising that international risk sharing was

imperfect.3 We find the degree of risk sharing across Chinese Provinces is much lower than that

across U.S. states.4 The differences in risk-sharing opportunities (and by implication of

consumption and saving ratios) constitute one of the major differences between China and the

industrialized countries.

       The remainder of the chapter proceeds as follows. The next section covers the application

of the business cycle model to China. Section 3 presents an informal examination of the

provincial level data. The formal test of the risk-sharing hypothesis and comparison of our

results to Crucini's for the U.S. and G-7 countries is undertaken in Section 4, and Section 5

2       Does the Business Cycle Framework Work for China?

In this section, we investigate the extent the cyclical properties of the post-reform Chinese

economy be understood with a very basic real business cycle model.

        The model we employ is a variant of Mendoza (1991) and Uribe and Schmidt-Grohe

(1994). It is a one-good small open economy model with a representative consumer/producer

who seeks to maximize expected lifetime utility,




where             is the subjective discount factor,      is consumption,        is hours worked, and

             is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. This is same the period utility function

used by Mendoza. The difference is that he assumes an endogenous subjective discount factor.

Agents can issue or hold an internationally traded one-period non state contingent bond that pays

off one unit of the consumption good next period. The current resources available to the agent

are the value of the bond holdings      and income       . These are consumed        , saved, and paid

as lump sum taxes        . Taxes fund wasteful government purchases              , and the government

runs a balanced budget so that          . Saving is achieved by investment           in real capital or

bond purchases        . The period budget constraint facing the agent is


                                                                         ,

where         is the rate of return on the bond between time       and       .

        Output is produced by the Cobb-Douglas technology

                                                               ,

                                                 6	  

	  
where        is an exogenous technology shock and the capital stock         accumulates according to



                                                                             .

        The last term in the accumulation equation is an adjustment cost that imposes a penalty

for rapid changes in the capital stock. In open economy models, including the adjustment cost is

standard and necessary in order to prevent international investment flows from being overly

responsive.

        The exogenous state variables are government purchases, technology, and the world

interest rate,      , which are assumed to evolve according to the first-order autoregressive

processes,




where                      ,                  and                    . The subjective rate of time

preference is set to the long-run (steady-state) interest rate such that                    . As in

Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003), we achieve a stationary steady state level of bonds                by

introducing a country premium              that is increasing in deviations from a fixed debt level,5

                                                                        .

        The model is completed by imposing the national income accounting identity



where            is the trade balance. Given the solution of the model, construction of auxiliary

variables such as the current account,

and national saving,



follow directly.

2.1    Calibration and Simulation

The data that we employ in our quantitative analysis are annual observations from the China

Statistical Yearbook (various issues, see statistical appendix) spanning 1978-2007. In calibrating

the model, the parameters that govern the exogenous state variables                           are estimated

from the data by least-squares of the AR(1) models. The capital adjustment parameter                      is

chosen to match the volatility of investment. In setting the remaining parameter values, we draw

from the literature and make no special adjustments specific to China. Table 1 reports the

parameter values that we use. We take              from Mendoza (1991) and             from Schmitt-Grohe

and Uribe (2003).          We set the discount factor                     where      is the mean world real

interest rate. The values for         ,    , and           are all standard in the business cycle literature

(recall that this is an annual model).

       We examine four versions of the model which differ by the shocks that are allowed to hit

the economy. They are,

       1)          The All Shocks model, which has all three shocks                     running.

       2)          The No Government model, which allows productivity and interest rate shocks

                   only.

       3)          The Domestic Shocks model , which shuts down world interest rate shocks but

                   leaves productivity and government shocks running.

                                                        8	  

	  
       4)       The Productivity Shocks model, which shuts down interest rate and government

                spending shocks.

       Table 2 shows implied volatility of the key variables from the model and in the data since

19786 . Let us begin with the `All Shocks' model. In the data, consumption is somewhat more

volatile than output, a feature that the model has trouble explaining. The high consumption

volatility is not a feature specific to China, as this is a feature of many emerging market

economies and also of some industrialized countries such as Great Britain. While also

understating the volatility of net exports and the current account, the model overstates the

relative volatility of investment, employment, and savings.

       World interest rate shocks have a mall contribution to the volatility of the endogenous

variables. Eliminating government spending shocks, however, results in consumption being even

quieter (and saving being much too volatile). The ability of either the `All Shocks' or the

`Domestic Shocks' model to generate the correct amount of volatility is mixed.

       Table 3 reports (model) implied and data values of the first-order autocorrelation of the

macro time series. Keeping government spending shocks in the model are important, otherwise

the implied trade balance (and current account) to GDP ratio becomes too persistent. The

persistence of the other variables are little affected by the inclusion of government spending. The

primary shortcomings of all four versions of the model are that implied persistence of

employment is overstated and that of investment is understated.

       Table 4 examines the co movements of the macro variables. Consumption, investment,

and saving all comove with output in the appropriate direction. The last two rows highlight the

importance of the government shocks, for the external balances become much too procyclical

when they are omitted. Although slightly positive, the low cyclicality of the external balances

                                                9	  

	  
comes from the fact that government spending is procyclical. The other difficulty in the model is

that the predicted co movements between saving and consumption are much higher than in the

data.

        To compare how China’s business cycle differs from developed economies, Table 5

shows the main results from Mendoza’s (1991) simulations from the model calibrated to

Canadian data from 1946 to 1985. He calibrates his model to exactly match the volatility of

GDP. In doing so, the model is able to match the volatility of consumption, investment, hours,

and the trade balance to GDP ratio. Saving and productivity implied by the model are not volatile

enough but the most obvious shortcoming of the model is the lack of persistence that it generates

in investment and in the trade balance.

        How different is China? Overall, the model actually works about as well for China as it

does for Canada, although the dimensions along which it fares poorly is different in each case. A

pretty consistent theme that emerges from the analysis of China is that the standard specification

and calibration has trouble explaining household consumption, which in the data is too volatile

and too low relative to GDP. The other side of this problem is that both the investment and

saving ratios implied by the model are too low. To give one more illustration of this difficulty,

we note that the mean values of consumption, investment, and saving in the data (as a fraction of

GDP) are 0.465, 0.375, and 0.393 respectively. China's current account surplus did not accelerate

until around 2004, so the national saving ratio is only around 2 percentage points higher than the

investment ratio. These values contrast with the steady state ratios implied by the model, which

are 0.600 for consumption, 0.268 for investment, and 0.268 for saving.

        One potential explanation for these deviations between the moments in the data and those

implied by the model is a severe violation of the perfect within country risk sharing assumption.

                                               10	  

	  
We now turn to an investigation of this idea.

3      Informal Examination of China's Provincial Data

The business cycle model assumes that markets are complete and/or a social planner directs

allocations to achieve a Pareto Optimum. In either case, consumption growth across households

are predicted to be highly (possibly perfectly) correlated. This section focuses on that prediction.

       We employ provincial level data, which we obtain from the China Statistical Yearbook

(various issues) and the China Statistical Data Compilation 1949-2003. We refer to `provinces'

as regions classified as Provinces, Autonomous Regions, and Municipalities. These exclude

Hong Kong and Macau. These are annual observations spanning from 1954-2004 and have not

been subjected to the NBS revisions.7,8 Nominal values are deflated with the aggregate price

deflator. We also deflated provincial nominal figures using provincial price deflators. The main

results are unchanged by doing this. We are primarily interested in consumption behavior during

the post-reform (1978-2004) period. However, since they are available, we also examine the data

from the pre-reform (1954-1977) period which allows us to assess consumption allocations

determined under central planning.

       We begin with an examination of provincial real per capita consumption growth. Average

growth rates over the subsamples are displayed in Figure 1, where a large jump in growth can be

observed for every region in the post-reform period. At the aggregate level, consumption growth

nearly triples from 2.5% to 7.2% per year. In provinces such as Shanghai, the growth rate went

from 0.6% during the pre-reform era to 8.3% in the post-reform period. However, Shanghai is

an example of a province that suffered a great deal from the Great Leap Forward (1958-1961)

that resulted in widespread famine. Omitting these years, the growth rate is slightly under 3%.

In fact, 8 provinces experienced an annual consumption growth rate of less than -20% in at least

                                                 11	  

	  
one year during this period. This contrasts with the much more modest change in Qinghai

province. Qinghai, which seemed to be doing relatively well in the pre-reform period, had an

average growth rate of 4.0%. In the post-reform era, it's growth increased only to 4.7%.

       In addition to raising consumption growth, the economic reforms after 1978 also seemed

to have reduced the overall riskiness of life. Figure 2 shows provincial volatility (standard

deviation) of consumption growth in the two periods. Volatility declines in every province

except for the southern province of Yunnan and Zhejiang bordering Shanghai to the south on the

eastern coast. Gansu, an economy based heavily on mining in the interior western region, shows

a huge decline in consumption growth volatility. A curious (perhaps troubling) feature of the

data is that consumption growth volatility reported in the aggregate China figures lies below

most of the provincial volatility levels.

       Turning to output, Figure 3 shows the well known and corresponding acceleration of

average annual growth rate of real per capita provincial GDP in the post-reform era. An

interesting feature of this figure is the unevenness of output growth across the provinces. During

the pre-reform period, the interior provinces such as Xinjiang (1.2%) and Inner Mongolia (0.5%)

experienced very low growth. Even when omitting years of the Great Leap Forward, growth

rates are a low 1.8% for Xinjiang and 1.7% for Inner Mongolia whereas areas such as Hubei

grew at nearly 5%. Similarly, post-reform output growth is unbalanced and ranges from 6% in

Gansu to 11.7% in Zhejiang.

       The volatility of provincial output growth is displayed in Figure 4 shows the huge

reduction in volatility following the market reforms. Pre-reform output volatility during our

sample was largely self-inflicted by central planning disasters such as the Great Leap forward

(1958-1961) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) which resulted in serious economic

                                               12	  

	  
upheaval. While pre-reform China seems unimaginably unstable, post-reform China has been

quite the opposite. The aggregate volatility of per capita output growth of 2.5% from 1979-2004

is roughly the same level experienced in the U.S. during the years (1969-1983) before the `Great

Moderation.'

        To get an idea of the degree of integration or coordination across provinces, Figure 5

shows the correlation between provincial output growth and aggregate output growth.

Correlations during the Mao Zedong years are relatively high with an average value of 0.84. This

is higher than output growth correlations among US states shown in Figure 6. For the U.S., the

correlation average is 0.7 from 1969-1983 and 0.56 from 1984-2008. In post-central planning

China, the average correlation falls to 0.4 which suggests a low level of integration across

provinces on the production side and an increase in the relative importance of idiosyncratic

(provincial level) risk.

        We next proceed to get a sense of the ability to insure against idiosyncratic income risk.

The typical approach to risk sharing is an environment of complete financial markets where a

full menu of state-contingent assets are traded. China's pre-reform environment was perhaps the

farthest thing possible from complete markets. But, by the second theorem of welfare economics,

if the leadership acts to maximize social welfare, any Pareto Optimal allocation achieved can

also be achieved by a competitive equilibrium. China potentially had at its disposal an

institutional setup that could actually achieve perfect consumption insurance. A benevolent

social planner would have ordered that consumption be directed across provinces such that

consumption growth between any two provinces is perfectly correlated. Such is the basic tenet of

communism: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,” as the Marxist

slogan goes.

                                                13	  

	  
       The key figure of this section and the one that speaks directly to the risk-sharing issue is

Figure 7. It displays the correlation between provincial and aggregate per capita consumption

growth, which should be close to 1 under perfect insurance.9 In 15 of the 24 provinces for which

we have data over the two subsamples, the correlation declines. So for slightly more than half of

the provinces, the pre-reform regime was better able to provide consumption insurance. The

average correlation declines from 0.42 to 0.32 in the post-reform period, a statistically significant

difference at the 10% level, and the correlation for three of the provinces in the latter period are

negative.

       The degree of risk sharing across countries is a topic also studied by international

economists.10 In the international economics literature, a widely documented fact, known as the

`consumption correlation puzzle,' is that the correlation of consumption growth between two

countries is typically smaller than the correlation between output growth between the same two

countries. For example, Choi and Mark (2010) report an average consumption correlation across

G-7 countries and the aggregate of 0.4 and an output correlation of 0.5. This is a puzzle, because

even if financial markets are incomplete (say there is only a single non-state contingent bond

traded across countries), we expect the correlation between the two countries’ consumption to be

much higher than the correlation between their output. It is against this backdrop that we present

Figures 8 and 9, which plots the correlation between provincial and aggregate consumption and

output. During the pre-reform years, there is a substantial consumption correlation puzzle as

provincial consumption correlations (average value 0.42) lie far below the output correlations

(average value 0.84). During the post-reform period, the puzzle is attenuated to the extent that

provinces look like the industrialized countries in this dimension with an average consumption

correlation of 0.32 against an average output correlation of 0.40.

4         A Test of the Perfect Risk Sharing Hypothesis

In this section, we employ a methodology used by Crucini (1999) to formally test of the risk-

sharing hypothesis across Chinese provinces. Since Crucini applied the same test to U.S. states

and G-7 countries, we can use our results to assess the degree of within country risk-sharing in

China to that in the U.S. and to international risk sharing across industrialized countries.

          Let    be log real per capita consumption of province          in year    , and      be log

aggregate real per capita consumption. If there is perfect risk sharing, provincial consumption

growth should be perfectly correlated with aggregate consumption growth. A testable implication

of the hypothesis of perfect risk sharing is that a regression of the change in provincial

consumption,        , on the change of aggregate consumption,         , will yield a unit-valued slope

coefficient and that coefficients on any additional regressors will be zero. Let               be the

innovation (unexpected change) to province                permanent income. Crucini (1999) suggest

running the regression

                                                                                                  (1)

and testing the null hypothesis (perfect risk sharing) that                  against the alternative

hypothesis (imperfect risk sharing) that                   . The innovation to permanent income is

unobserved and must be estimated. As in his paper, we consider three alternative estimates of

this variable. Income model I assumes that provincial and aggregate income growth,                and

       , are generated by a first-order vector autoregression. Income model II assumes that

provincial income growth follows a first-order autoregression. Income model III assumes that

log provincial income is a driftless random walk. The residual from estimating the income model

                                                 15	  

	  
serves as the estimated innovation to permanent income,        .

       For each income model specification, we estimate 24 regressions of eq(1). Although there

are 31 provinces, we have continuous observations from 1954 to 2004 for only 24 of these

provinces. To summarize the results, we report average figures in Table 1.

       We do not get exceedingly precise estimates of          as the standard errors are about the

same size as the estimates.     In the pre-reform era, under income model I (provincial and

aggregate income growth generated by a VAR(1)), perfect risk sharing is not be rejected at the 5

percent level for 6 provinces. In 8 provinces, the hypothesis of zero risk sharing could not be

rejected, and in 8 others, the data are uninformative as neither the hypothesis that             or

       can be rejected. The evidence for effective consumption risk sharing is not much different

when innovations to permanent income are modeled by income models II (AR(1)) and III

(random walk).

       In post-reform China, there is some evidence of a slightly increased degree of risk

sharing. The magnitude of our estimated      coefficients is bigger, and perfect risk sharing is not

rejected for 9 provinces under income model I.

       To compare China to within U.S. and international G-7 risk sharing, Table 7 reproduces

Crucini's results. Since state level consumption data is unavailable for the U.S., he uses retail

sales as the proxy. It can be seen on the basis of retail sales, there appears to be a great deal of

risk-sharing within the U.S. Perfect insurance cannot be rejected for 33 states (66% of the

sample) using income model III. The international story, at least among the G-7 during the 70s

and 80s is one of substantially less risk sharing. Perfect risk sharing cannot be rejected for at

most 28% of the sample.

       Thus for post-reform China, the degree of risk sharing is substantially below that in the
                                                 16	  

	  
U.S. and about at the same level across industrialized countries in the 70s and 80s. It makes

sense that international risk sharing may have been low at that time since there were still many

capital controls in place (1970-1987). Overall, the conclusion has to be that there is very little

consumption risk sharing across Chinese provinces. 11

       To summarize the findings on risk sharing; first, as measured by income volatility, the

pre-reform era was a riskier environment than post reform. Although riskier, the state run model

appears not to have done substantially worse at implementing a program of consumption risk

sharing than post-reform China. Nevertheless, the ability to hedge against idiosyncratic

provincial level income risk appears modest. The absence of effective risk-sharing channels tells

us that the precautionary saving motive must be very strong for Chinese households.

Presumably, this is an important factor driving high household saving rates and the current

account. We caution the reader not to infer normative implications of this analysis. Even though

risk-sharing is still quite modest, the growths enabled by the post-1978 reforms have

undoubtedly improved welfare.

5      Conclusion

To answer the questions posed in the introduction, we do find that China's macroeconomics are

different from developed countries that are usually studied in business cycle research, but not so

different that it is an unsuitable target for this research. One of the most prominent differences in

the Chinese data that sets it apart lies in the consumption/saving decisions by households. The

business cycle model cannot explain why Chinese households consume such a small fraction of

income, why consumption moves around so much relative to income, and why the co movement

between consumption and saving is so low.

       We get a clue as to why the model falls short in this dimension from the analysis on

                                                 17	  

	  
intranational consumption risk sharing. As in Xu (2008), we detect a low degree of cross-

province risk sharing. In this dimension, each province is about as segmented from one another

as between the G-7 countries during the 70s and 80s. Given the difficulty of hedging income risk

and natural household concerns about income security, the environment would seem to create a

significant motive for precautionary saving, which is not present say within the U.S.12

 See Pierfederico et al (1996) and Ostergard et al (2002) who test the risk-sharing hypothesis
across U.S. states, and Lewis (1996) and Canova (1996) who test the risk-sharing hypothesis
internationally.

       	  While
        our primary focus is on risk-sharing during the post-reform years, we also conduct our
analyses on pre-reform data from 1954-1977. This analysis finds that consumption risk was
shared even less under central planning than has been observed in the pos-reform period. The
central planning committee evidently did not direct allocations in the same way as the social
planner of our macro models.

 Mendoza achieves a stationary steady state by assuming that the subjective discount factor is
endogenous.

 We are working with a stationary model so the data have all been passed through the Hodrick-
Prescott filter.

 Provincial data is reported by each Provincial Statistical Bureau, not the NBS. So, the dates of
revisions to provincial accounts data are staggered.
8
 The provincial data only spans up to 2004 where the aggregate data used in business cycle
calibration extends to 2007. We used the revised aggregate data but the business cycle moments
are similar to the unrevised series.

The existence of non traded goods and differences in consumption weights across provinces
would cause the correlation to drop below, but not far from 1 even with complete risk sharing.

  The puzzle was noted by Backus et al. (1992) who find that a two-country business cycle
model fails to explain most of co-movements of major macroeconomic variables across
countries.Subsequent studies that attempt to explain the puzzle include Baxter and Crucini
(1995), Kehoe and Perri (2002), Kollmann (1996), and Iacoviello and Minetti (2006) who study
the role of the asset market incompleteness in the international business cycles whereas
Stockman and Tesar (1995), Wen (2007), Xiao (2004) introduce taste or demand shocks in their
models.

 Xu (2008) employs the Crucini test but employs household survey data spanning 1980 to 2004
and reaches conclusions similar to ours.

 Wei and Zhang (2010) investigate the interesting idea that competition for marriage partners
combined with a surplus of Chinese males drive the high saving rates.
