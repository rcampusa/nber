       In the last decade at least 13 studies have examined whether acquisition of the

General Educational Development certificate (GED), the school leaving credential most

commonly available to school dropouts, improves their labor market outcomes.1 A

critical unstated assumption underlying all of these studies is that the labor market value

of the GED credential does not depend on the skills with which dropouts left school.

Adolescents drop out of high school with different skill levels and for different reasons.

Some leave with command of at least elementary cognitive skills and do so because they

have found desirable employment. Others leave with very weak skills and little

employment prospect because they dislike school. It is not obvious that the payoff to a

GED would be the same for dropouts in these two groups. The primary purpose of this

paper is to show that the labor market payoffs to a GED are, in fact, quite different for the

two groups of dropouts.

       The best known paper on the labor market benefits of the GED credential was

written by Cameron and Heckman (C-H) in 1993. C-H showed that males who dropped

out of high school and subsequently obtained a GED did not fare as well in the labor

market of the mid-1980s as did males who completed 12 years of schooling and

graduated from high school with a conventional diploma. This finding is important

because the percentage of young adults who obtain “high school completion” status by

passing the GED examination has increased markedly over the last 30 years. Currently,

one in seven young adults classified in the Census as a high school graduate holds a
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                 2




GED.

       This paper uses data from the sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond

(HS&B) data base to address three questions prompted by the C-H results. First, is the

differential between the earnings of young males with high school diplomas and those

with a GED that C-H observed in National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data

from the mid-1980s also present in HS&B data from 1991? The answer is not obvious

because changes in the economy have continued to depress the earnings of male workers

with little formal education (Blackburn, Bloom, and Freeman 1990; Juhn, Murphy, and

Pierce 1993; Katz and Murphy 1992). It is possible that economic changes led employers

to pay less attention to differences among the credentials of workers with no post-

secondary education or to pay more attention to these differences. Given the relevance

of C-H’s finding to the educational decisions of the large number of students who

consider dropping out of high school each year, it seems important to examine whether

the finding can be replicated with data from the early 1990s.

       Second, on average, do males who leave high school before graduation obtain any

labor market benefits from the GED credential? C-H (1993b) express ambivalence on

this point, writing:

       ... the NLSY data strongly reject the hypothesis that GED recipients are the labor

       market equals of high school graduates. The same data do not reject the hypothesis

       that high school dropouts and GED recipients are indistinguishable. A closer look
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  3




       at the evidence indicates, however, that GED recipients lie between dropouts and

       graduates in their economic standing but are much closer to dropouts.2

The question is important because the GED is the one educational credential that a great

many school dropouts obtain -- approximately half a million each year.

       Third, are the labor market benefits of the GED different for dropouts who leave

school with very weak cognitive skills than for dropouts who leave school with stronger

skills? If this is the case, then past studies that have assumed constant effects of the GED

across different skill-groups in the dropout population may have obscured important skill-

GED interactions.3 Exploring the possibility of such interactions will not only inform our

general understanding of the nature of the payoffs to GED-acquisition, but will also help

us to better understand the way that this credential works in the labor market.

       To preview our central results, when we fit models with specifications similar to

those used by C-H, our results are very close to theirs.4 On average, GED recipients do

not fare as well in the labor market as conventional high school graduates. GED

recipients do earn somewhat more, on average, than observationally similar dropouts

without this credential, but much of the difference stems from differences in accumulated

work experience. However, these average effects mask a more complicated pattern.

GED-holders who had very weak cognitive skills as tenth graders earn substantially more

at age 27 than low-skilled dropouts without the credential. For dropouts with stronger

cognitive skills as tenth graders, acquisition of a GED is not associated with higher
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   4




earnings at age 27.



                                   The GED Credential

       In all 50 states, as well as in Canada, a school dropout can obtain the GED

credential by achieving state-specific passing scores on a seven and one-half hour, five-

part written battery of tests assessing skills and knowledge in five areas: writing, social

studies, science, reading, and mathematics. Until 1988 the format of the items on the test

was exclusively multiple-choice. In that year an essay became part of the writing

examination.

       Much of the growth in the number of young adults obtaining a GED stems from

government policy.5 The Adult Education Act of 1966 provided significant funds to

states for GED preparation programs. The Welfare Reform Act of 1988 specified that

women without high school diplomas who receive AFDC payments must either find

employment, return to high school, or enroll in adult education programs, most of which

are aimed at preparing participants for the GED examination. The 1986 amendments to

the Higher Education Act specified that applicants for Pell grants to pay for post-

secondary education or training must demonstrate “ability to benefit” from the financial

aid. For a school dropout, obtaining a GED is the easiest way to satisfy this condition.

       In general, information on who obtains a GED cannot be obtained from the most

obvious sources, the U.S. Census of Population and the monthly Current Population
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                 5




Survey (CPS), because these surveys do not distinguish between the GED credential and

a conventional high school diploma obtained by completing high school. However, the

education supplement to the 1993 October CPS did ask respondents between the ages of

15 and 29 whether they graduated from high school by obtaining a conventional diploma

or by obtaining a GED. We used this data source to estimate the percentages of 22-29

year-old males in each racial/ethnic group who were conventional high school graduates,

GED-holders, and permanent dropouts.6 As indicated in Table 1A, less than half of

Hispanic males aged 22-29 reported that they had obtained conventional high school

diplomas, compared to slightly less than three-quarters of black males and slightly more

than three-quarters of white non-Hispanic males. Almost four out of ten Hispanic males

reported that they were school dropouts who had not obtained a GED, compared to

approximately one in ten black males and one in ten white males. Four percent of black

males and white males and seven percent of Hispanic males reported that they obtained

high school graduate status by obtaining a GED. A surprising pattern is that

approximately 10 percent of respondents indicated that they had “completed high

school,” but did not respond to a question asking whether they had done so by obtaining a

GED.7 A comparison of the number of self-reported GED recipients in this 1993 CPS

with GED Testing Service figures on the number of 22-29 year old males in the U.S. who

held the GED credential in 1993 suggests that more than 80 percent of the non-

responders were conventional high school graduates rather than GED recipients.8
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   6




       Table 1B displays the median hourly earnings of groups defined by their

secondary school leaving credentials. The median hourly wage of males who reported

obtaining a GED was seven percent higher than that of male dropouts without a GED and

ten percent lower than that of males who reported earning a conventional high school

diploma. The median wage of males who reported that they were high school graduates

but declined to identify whether they had obtained a GED was lower than the median

wage of self-reported GED recipients. 9

       Why would a school dropout benefit in the labor market from obtaining a GED?

First, studying for the GED examination may increase a dropout’s skills. This is unlikely

for most GED recipients, given that the median length of time GED examinees report

preparing for the examination is only 30 hours (Baldwin, 1990). However, participants

in some GED preparation programs do study for several hundred hours -- potentially long

enough to increase skill levels.10 It seems likely that GED recipients who left school

with very low cognitive skills would be those most likely to devote significant effort to

studying for the GED examinations. Second, obtaining a GED may signal to employers

that the dropout possesses desirable traits, such as mastery of basic skills or a high level

of motivation (Spence, 1973). This could be particularly important for dropouts whose

school records and initial labor market track record were poor. Third, acquisition of a

GED may have indirect positive effects on subsequent earnings by improving access to

post-secondary education and work experience, both of which result in increases in
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                    7




marketable skills. Our analytic strategy distinguishes the indirect effects of GED

acquisition on subsequent earnings from the direct effect.



                         The High School and Beyond Data Base

       In 1980, the U.S. Department of Education initiated the collection of information

on the personal characteristics, family backgrounds, schooling, and cognitive skills of a

stratified random sample of 14,825 sophomores in the nation’s high schools. Follow-up

interviews soliciting information on subsequent schooling and labor market activities

were conducted in 1982, 1984, 1986, and most recently, 1992.11 Using questions asked

in the follow-up interviews, it is possible to distinguish GED-holders from conventional

high school graduates.

       One strength of the High School and Beyond (HS&B) data base is the availability

of detailed transcript-based information on post-secondary education, investments that

may be important determinants of earnings. A second is the availability of scores on

cognitive tests taken by members of the sample during their sophomore year in high

school. These scores provide information on skills that would be rewarded in the labor

market irrespective of educational credentials (Neal and Johnson 1996). Consequently,

the scores serve as critical control variables in isolating the impacts of credentials on later

earnings.12 These scores also enable us to explore whether GED acquisition affects

earnings at age 27 differently for males who had very low test scores as tenth graders than
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  8




for males with higher tenth-grade test scores. For reasons we explain in a later section,

we defined dropouts with very low cognitive skills as those whose tenth grade math

scores were in the bottom quartile of the distribution of scores for high school

sophomores in 1980.

        The data set also contains scores on cognitive tests taken by the HS&B sample in

1982, the high school graduation year for those members of the sample who stayed in

school. As explained below, the two sets of test scores provide a basis for examining the

relative achievement gains between 1980 and 1982 for students who stayed in school, for

those who dropped out and obtained a GED during this period, and for those who

dropped out and did not obtain the alternative credential.

       One limitation of the HS&B data is the lack of information on labor supply and

hourly wages in 1990 and 1991, the two years immediately prior to the most recent

interview. Only information on annual earnings is available for these years, and

consequently it is not possible to determine the extent to which differences between the

earnings of groups with different educational credentials stem from differences in wages

versus differences in labor supply. A second limitation, particularly relevant in studying

school dropouts, is that only individuals who were high school sophomores in 1980 were

included in the sample. Consequently, males who had dropped out of school prior to

their sophomore year are omitted.

       We included in our analytic sample the 4,216 males who took the mathematics test
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  9




administered to tenth graders in the baseline sample in 1980, participated in the 1992

survey, had positive annual earnings in 1990 or 1991, and were not in college in both of

these years. For individuals who reported their earnings for both 1990 and 1991 and

were not in college in either year, our dependent variable is the natural logarithm of

average earnings (in 1991 dollars) over the two years. For individuals who reported

positive earnings for one year and were in college during the other year or did not report

earnings for the other year, we used the log of earnings for one year. We excluded all

individuals who reported being in the military in 1992.

       We defined our dependent variable in this manner for two reasons. First, for

HS&B participants who reported earnings for both years, the two-year average is a more

precise measure of permanent income than the earnings measured in a single year.

Second, using earnings (in 1991 $) for one year for those individuals who were in college

or in the military in the other year or who did not respond to the question about earnings

in the other year allowed us to include 107 males who otherwise would have been

omitted from the sample. Their inclusion is likely to reduce sample selection bias. Our

regression models identified individuals who had earnings for one of the two years, but

not both, using a pair of dichotomous predictors.13

       Forty-six percent of the school dropouts in the HS&B sample obtained a GED

before 1990, the start of the two-year period for which earnings were measured. This is

higher than the 35 percent of male dropouts in the NLSY sample who obtained a GED
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                 10




(Murnane, Willett, and Boudett, 1995). The explanation lies in part in differences in the

sample structure. To be included in the HS&B sophomore sample, an adolescent had to

be in grade 10 in 1980, and consequently all school dropouts in the HS&B sophomore

sample completed at least nine years of schooling. The NLSY sample includes

individuals who had completed as few as six years of schooling before dropping out.

Among male school dropouts in the four youngest cohorts of the NLSY, forty percent of

those who dropped out after completing at least nine years of schooling subsequently

obtained a GED. The comparable figure for males who dropped out before completing

nine years of schooling is 30 percent.14

       Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the high school graduates, GED-

recipients, and permanent school dropouts in our sample. Overall, 10 percent of the

sample is Black, 21 percent is Hispanic, 65 percent is non-Hispanic white, and 4 percent

is “other”(a combination of Asians, Pacific islanders, native Americans, and otherwise

not classified racial/ethnic groups). This racial/ethnic composition reflects the

oversampling of Hispanic youth in the HS&B sampling design. On average, GED

recipients in this sample completed 10.3 years of schooling before dropping out. This is

only slightly more than the 10.2 years of schooling completed, on average, by males who

dropped out of high school and had not obtained a GED by the start of 1990.15 For ease

of exposition we refer to this group as “permanent dropouts,” recognizing that individuals

in this group may have obtained a GED after December 31, 1989.16 As illustrated by
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  11




mother’s educational attainments, GED recipients tend to come from more advantaged

families than permanent dropouts, but from less advantaged families than high school

graduates. A similar pattern holds for high school test scores. The average score of GED

recipients on the mathematics test administered in the sophomore year was 8.6, almost

twice the average score of permanent dropouts (4.5), but only slightly more than half of

the average score of males who subsequently obtained a conventional high school

diploma (15.3). Table 2 also shows that 18 percent of high school graduates, 38 percent

of GED recipients, and 59 percent of permanent dropouts had sophomore math scores in

the bottom quarter of the distribution.17

       One striking characteristic of the GED recipients in the HS&B sample is how

many obtained this credential soon after leaving high school. As indicated in column 3 of

Table 3, 30 percent of the recipients obtained the GED by the end of May 1982, the

month when their cohort graduated from high school. Another 17 percent obtained a

GED within the subsequent seven months. This concentration of the timing of GED

acquisition is to some extent a result of survey design: individuals not included in the

HS&B sophomore cohort because they dropped out of school before grade 10 may have

been more likely to obtain a GED later in their lives than members of the HS&B sample;

also, school dropouts in the HS&B sample who acquired a GED after 1989 are counted as

permanent dropouts. A comparison of the entries in columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 indicate

that not only are dropouts who leave school with relatively strong cognitive skills more
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  12




likely to obtain a GED than those who leave with weaker skills; they are also more likely

to obtain the credential quickly. Fifty six percent of male dropouts whose tenth grade

math scores were in the upper three-quarters of the test score distribution had obtained a

GED by 1989, and among those who did, 37 percent obtained the credential by June

1982, the month when their high school cohort graduated. In contrast, 36 percent of male

dropouts whose tenth grade math score were in the lowest quartile of the test score

distribution obtained a GED by 1989, and among those who did, 19 percent obtained it

by June 1982.

       The high percentage of GED recipients who obtained the credential before the end

of the calendar year in which their cohort graduated from high school raises the question

of whether the option of obtaining a GED very soon after leaving high school induces

some students to leave school.18 There is no way to answer this question with these data.

However, the question is important in light of the differences between the average

earnings of conventional high school graduates and those of GED recipients that we

report later in the paper.

       Table 4 provides descriptive statistics on the amounts of post-secondary education

obtained by conventional high school graduates, GED recipients, and permanent dropouts

in the sample. All of these statistics are derived from transcript data.19 We base estimates

of the number of years of post-secondary education completed on the assumption that 24

credits (eight three-credit courses) constitute a year of post-secondary education.
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   13




       Thirty percent of GED recipients obtained at least one post-secondary education

credit by the end of 1990. This figure is markedly higher than the eight percent of

permanent dropouts who obtained some post-secondary education, but much lower than

the 69 percent of conventional high school graduates who did so. Eight percent of GED

recipients completed at least two years of post-secondary education by 1990, and less

than two percent completed at least four years. Among GED recipients who did obtain

post-secondary education, most did so at community colleges. Almost one in four GED

recipients (24 percent) obtained at least one college credit in a two-year college. In

contrast, only 6 percent earned a credit at a four-year college.

       According to the transcript data, improved access to post-secondary education was

not likely to be the mechanism through which most dropouts benefitted from obtaining a

GED. The modest educational attainments of GED recipients stand in stark contrast to

the responses of a national sample of GED test-takers asked about their future plans. In

1994, 66 percent responded that they were planning future study (GED Testing Service,

1995, p. 25). Part of the explanation for the difference between educational plans and the

transcript-based estimates of educational attainments may be that GED recipients enrolled

in institutions such as proprietary training schools that did not provide transcripts.20

         We explored the impact of educational credentials on subsequent earnings by

fitting two sets of regression models. The first set follows the assumption implicit in past

GED studies and posits that the relationships between educational credentials and

subsequent earnings do not depend on the skills with which students left school.

Equation 1 depicts the basic model:

         in the “other” race category (“white” is the omitted category),

regioni = a vector of three dummy variables indicating the region of the country in which

         individual i’s school was located during the sophomore year in high school,
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                         15

         level of education of individual i’s mother and the number of siblings in

and the $’s, ", (, *, ., and 2’s are parameters to be estimated.

         The second set of regression models allows the relationships between educational

credentials and subsequent earnings to differ by tenth grade math score. Equation 2

and the $*’s, "*, (*, 8’s, 6’s, >’s, .*, and 2*’s are parameters to be estimated.



Estimation

       We fitted our models using standard regression methods, computing standard

errors by robust methods that do not depend on normality assumptions (White, 1980).

We did not use the sample weights in fitting our models because the analytic sample was

a non-random subset of the full sample and included only members of the HS&B

sophomore cohort who took the tenth grade math test and who reported earnings for 1990

or 1991. Consequently, application of the sample weights would not have created a

sample representative of males who were in 10th grade in 1980. Since the original HS&B

design did oversample particular groups, especially Hispanic students, the decision to

weight each observation equally gives disproportionate weight to these groups. As

explained below, we verified that our substantive results are not sensitive to the decision

on whether to use the sampling weights.

                    The Effects of Education Credentials on Earnings

Treating GED recipients as a single group

       Table 5 presents parameter estimates and associated standard errors for a set of

fitted models similar to Equation 1, predicting the impact of educational credentials on

the natural log of average annual earnings, controlling for race and ethnicity, tenth grade

math score,21 region, and a set of family background characteristics. The omitted

category for the years of secondary school completed is grade 9. The models reported in

Table 5 are similar to those fitted by C-H. Most importantly, they do not distinguish

between GED effects for dropouts who left school with very weak cognitive skills and for

those who left with somewhat stronger skills.

       The coefficient on the dichotomous variable representing high school graduate in

Models 1 through 3 is an estimate of the average difference between the log earnings of

male high school graduates and those of observationally similar males who dropped out

of school after completing grade nine (Model 1), holding constant years of work

experience (Model 2), and holding constant both work experience and years of post-

secondary education (Model 3). The coefficients on the GED indicator in Models 1-3

can be interpreted similarly as estimates of the difference in log earnings between a GED

recipient and a permanent dropout with the same number of years of completed

schooling.
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   18




       The estimated coefficient on high school graduate in Model 1 of Table 5 implies

that high school graduates with no post-secondary education earned 42 percent more

than observationally comparable permanent dropouts who completed nine years of

schooling, and 32 percent more than permanent dropouts who left school after completing

11 years of schooling.22      On average, GED recipients earned 13 percent more than

permanent dropouts without this credential who had completed the same number of years

of high school.23

       Cameron & Heckman (1993b) report that the estimated wage differentials between

conventional high school graduates, GED recipients, and permanent dropouts are smaller

in models that control for work experience than in models that do not. We find the same

pattern for the earnings differentials in our data. The estimate of the earnings differential

between conventional high school graduates and permanent dropouts is approximately

one-quarter smaller in Model 2, which controls for years of work experience, than in

Model 1, which does not. Similarly, the estimate of the earnings differential between

GED recipients and permanent dropouts is smaller by one-third in the model that controls

for work experience than in the model that does not. The explanation is that years of

work experience has a strong positive relationship with log earnings, and high school

graduates have more work experience by age 27 than do GED recipients, who in turn

have more work experience than permanent dropouts.24

       The coefficient on high school graduate in Model 3, which controls for years of
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                 19




completed post-secondary education, is 17 percent lower than the analogous coefficient

in Model 2, which does not control for post-secondary education. The explanation is

straightforward. High school graduates complete more years of post-secondary education

than do school dropouts, and each year of completed college is associated with a four

percent increase in earnings at age 27. In other words, access to college is a primary

mechanism through which the conventional high school diploma results in higher

earnings at age 27.

       The coefficients on GED are virtually identical in Column 2 and Column 3. The

explanation is not that post-secondary education does not pay off for GED recipients. In

fact, college pays off as well for GED recipients as it does for conventional high school

graduates.25 Instead, the explanation, as shown in Table 2, is that GED recipients obtain

only marginally more post-secondary education than do permanent dropouts. In fact,

among dropouts with the same sophomore test scores, GED recipients obtain no more

post-secondary education than permanent dropouts.

       At the bottom of Table 5, for each model, we list the result of testing the

hypothesis that GED recipients who dropped out after 11th grade earn as much at age 27

as high school graduates. This null hypothesis can be rejected unequivocally in Models

1 and 2 that do not control for years of post-secondary education. However, it cannot be

rejected in Model 3, which controls for post-secondary education, even though the

predicted earnings differential between high school graduates and GED recipients who
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  20




left school after completing 11th grade is substantial in this model (nine percent). The

reason the predicted high school graduate/GED earnings differential is smaller in Model 3

than in the models that do not control for post-secondary education is that one of the most

powerful mechanisms through which conventional high school graduation, but not receipt

of a GED, pays off is by increasing access to post-secondary education.26

       The t-statistic associated with the coefficient on GED recipient in Model 1

(t=2.01) indicates that GED recipients do fare better, on average, in the labor market than

permanent dropouts with the same sophomore test scores and years of completed

secondary school. However, much of the impact consists of improved access to work.

Holding constant years of work experience (Models 2 and 3), there is no statistically

significant difference between the annual earnings of GED recipients, treated as a single

group, and those of observationally similar permanent dropouts. In this respect our

findings are similar to those of C-H.



Distinguishing GED effects for Dropouts with Low Sophomore Test Scores from
Those for Dropouts with Higher Sophomore Scores
       In research using different data and a different methology, we found quite large

labor market benefits associated with the GED credential for dropouts whose cognitive

skills were just sufficient to pass the GED exams (Tyler, Murnane, and Willett 1997).

These results suggested that the common practice of treating GED recipients as a single

group in studies of the labor market effects of the credential could obscure differential
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                    21




effects for different skills groups. To explore this, we recoded math test scores into

quartiles, based on the distribution of math scores for the baseline HS&B sample. We

then fitted a taxonomy of regression models similar to Equation 2 that included dummy

variables representing the main effects of test score quartiles, the main effects of

secondary school credentials (GED and high school graduate), and the interaction of the

test score quartiles with the two secondary school credentials. Parameter estimates are

reported in Table 6. As in Table 5, Model 1 of Table 6 does not control for years of work

experience or years of post-secondary education; Model 2 includes work experience; and

Model 3 includes both work experience and years of post-secondary education.

       We then tested a series of hypotheses concerning the relative value of the GED

and the high school diploma for males with particular tenth grade math scores. We found

striking contrasts between the results for males whose tenth grade scores were in the top

three quartiles of the test score distribution and the results for males whose scores were in

the lowest quartile of the distribution. We could not reject the null hypotheses that the

magnitude of the GED effect was the same for males in the three top quartiles. Thus, we

refer to males with scores in the top three quartiles as higher scoring males, and to males

with scores in the bottom quartile as low scoring males. The results of the key hypothesis

tests are reported at the bottom of Table 6.

       In models that do not control for years of completed post-secondary education

(Models 1 and 2), high school graduates with tenth grade math scores in the upper three
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  22




quartiles of the score distribution unequivocally earn more on average at age 27 than do

GED recipients with similar math scores (p<.01). However, in models that hold constant

years of completed post-secondary education (models 3, 4, and 5), we cannot reject the

null hypothesis at the .10 level that earnings at age 27 do not differ between the two

groups (Hypothesis 4, Table 6). The explanation lies in the importance of post-secondary

education. College pays off for both high school graduates and GED recipients.

However, as shown in Table 2, conventional high school graduates complete almost two

and one-half more years of college, on average, than do GED recipients. Consequently,

holding constant years of completed post-secondary education (Models 3, 4, and 5)

eliminates a primary mechanism (college enrollment) through which high school

graduates differentiate themselves from GED recipients.27 It is also the case that among

higher scoring males, there is no statistically significant difference between the earnings

at age 27 of permanent dropouts and those dropouts with a GED (Hypothesis 3, Table 6).



       Among low scoring males the pattern is quite different. In all models low scoring

GED recipients have higher predicted earnings than low scoring permanent dropouts with

the same observed characteristics (p<.01). In Model 1, for instance, which does not

control for work experience, the estimated earnings difference is 36 percent.28 The

estimated earnings difference is eight percentage points lower in Model 2, reflecting the

importance of work experience as a mechanism through which the GED credential
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  23




impacts on the earnings of low scoring dropouts. Adding years of post-secondary

education (Model 3) does not markedly alter the estimated earnings difference, reflecting

the negligible post-secondary educational attainments of low scoring GED recipients as

well as low scoring permanent dropouts.

       The earnings premiums of 36 percent associated with the GED for school dropouts

with tenth grade test scores in the lowest quarter of the test score distribution seems high.

Indeed, it is higher than the 10-19 percent estimate of a GED effect that Tyler, Murnane,

and Willett (1997) obtained for white dropouts with low test scores in a study that used

Social Security earnings data and a natural experiment methodology. There are two,

potentially complementary reasons why the 36 percent estimate may be upwardly biased:

measurement error and omitted variable bias. Some of the GED recipients with scores in

the bottom quartile on the relatively short tenth grade math test may actually have had

stronger cognitive skills than their low test scores indicated. These stronger skills

enabled them to pass the GED exams and also were valued in the labor market. Also,

those dropouts with test scores in the bottom quartile who did obtain a GED may have

had unobserved strengths even as tenth graders, such as very high levels of motivation

and persistence, that employers would have rewarded even had the dropouts not obtained

the GED credential.29

       While these potential sources of bias are certainly plausible, it is important to keep

in mind that even if the true effect of GED acquisition on the earnings of males who left
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  24




school with weak cognitive skills is half as large as the estimated impact of 36 percent,

the basic story would still hold. This story is that acquisition of a GED leads to higher

subsequent earnings for male dropouts who left school with very weak cognitive skills,

but not for dropouts who left school with somewhat stronger skills. To understand this, it

is important to keep in mind that low scoring permanent dropouts are the least attractive

job candidates to most employers. It seems plausible that employers who do consider job

candidates from this generally unattractive pool would favor those with the motivation to

take a seven and one half hour exam and sufficient cognitive skills to pass the five parts

of the exam. Much of the earnings differential between GED recipients with low

sophomore test scores and observationally similar permanent dropouts may stem from the

credential improving access to work.

       Another way to view the evidence is that the earnings at age 27 of dropouts who

had very low test scores as sophomores and subsequently earned a GED are about the

same as those of permanent dropouts whose tenth grade math scores were in the upper

three quarters of the test score distribution. This pattern raises the following questions:

Given that permanent dropouts with relatively high tenth grade math scores earned

considerably more at age 27 than did permanent dropouts with low tenth grade math

scores, doesn’t this mean that employers reward the cognitive skills of dropouts without

their being signaled by the GED credential? Doesn’t it mean that dropouts who left

school with weak cognitive skills, but subsequently increased these skills and perhaps
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   25




improved their work ethic as well, would have been able to convince employers of their

increased value without the GED credential? The HS&B data base lacks the

experimental data to address these questions. However, it seems plausible that high

scoring dropouts may have been pulled into the labor market by relatively attractive job

opportunities that helped them to establish a solid employment record. In contrast, the

poor employment record of dropouts who left school with weak cognitive skills and a

poor work ethic may have been a significant obstacle to overcome for those who

subsequently acquire the skills and attitudes to be more productive employees.30

Completing and passing the lengthy battery of exams required to obtain the GED

credential may have enabled dropouts who did increase their skills to signal to employers

their increased value.

       Among males with tenth grade math scores in the lowest quarter of the

distribution, there is no statistically significant difference in earnings at age 27 between

those who graduated from high school and those who dropped out after completing

eleventh grade and subsequently obtained a GED (Hypothesis 2, Table 6). Both earned

45-50 percent more than permanent dropouts who dropped out before completing tenth

grade and did so with tenth grade math scores in the lowest quarter of the national

distribution. Again, it is important to put this pattern in perspective. The 18 percent of

high school graduates who had tenth grade math scores in the lowest quarter of the test

score distribution were likely to be among the least academically skilled of high school
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  26




graduates. The results for Model 1 of Table 6 show that the labor market did not treat all

27-year-old high school graduates alike. Those with tenth grade test scores in the bottom

quartile of the distribution earned approximately 25 percent less than high school

graduates with higher tenth grade math scores. By passing a lengthy battery of

examinations, GED recipients demonstrate that they are as productive as the least skilled

high school graduates, a group earning considerably less at age 27 than high school

graduates with greater tenth grade cognitive skills.

       Several other parameter estimates in the fitted models displayed in Table 6 are

notable. Controlling for years of completed work experience, each year of completed

post-secondary education increases subsequent earnings by an estimated four percent

(Model 3), a return similar to that reported by Kane & Rouse (1995).31 As mentioned

above, we found no evidence that the earnings premium from post-secondary education

was different for GED-holders than for conventional high school graduates.

       One other striking pattern in Table 6 is that the magnitude of the Black-White

earnings differential is considerably smaller in Model 2, which include controls for years

of work experience, than in Model 1, which does not. The explanation is that Black

males have, on average, almost one year less work experience as of age 27 than do White

males, and work experience is a critical determinant of earnings.



Sensitivity analyses
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                    27




       We conducted a variety of sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our

results. Model 4 of Table 6 presents the estimated coefficients of a model identical to

Model 3 except the dummy variables indicating that information on earnings was missing

for either 1990 or 1991 are omitted. Model 5 differs from Model 3 only in that it includes

as additional control variables tenth grade scores on tests of reading, science. The

estimated coefficients in Model 4 and Model 5 are very similar to those in Model 3, and

there are no differences in the results of the critical hypothesis tests.

       We also fitted a variety of models with different parameterizations of the

interactions between sophomore math score and the GED and high school diploma.32 The

results were consistent: among dropouts with low tenth grade math scores, those who

subsequently obtained a GED earned more at age 27 than those who did not obtain this

credential. Dropouts who had higher tenth grade math scores earned more at age 27 than

observationally similar dropouts with low tenth grade scores. Among higher scoring

dropouts, those with a GED did not earn more at age 27 than those without this

credential.



Sample selection bias

       Interpreting the critical coefficients in Model 3 of Table 6 as the direct effects of

educational credentials on earnings rests on the assumption that, after conditioning on

observable individual characteristics, the 4,216 males for whom we observe earnings and
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   28




tenth grade test scores are a random subsample of the males in the HS&B data set. As the

extensive literature on selection bias documents, this assumption may not be valid. As a

result, relationships between educational credentials and subsequent earnings in the self-

selected sample may not provide unbiased estimates of the relationships in the population

of males who were high school sophomores in 1980.

       Two hundred seventy eight males were excluded from our earnings sample

because they were in college in both of the years in which we measured earnings, 166

because they were not working and were not in college during these years, and 683

because they did not complete the tenth grade math test administered in 1980. C-H

(1993b) attempted to deal with the sample selection problem by fitting a wage equation

that included as predictors two inverse Mills ratios, from bivariate probit selection

equations describing an individual’s “risk” of being in the earnings sample given that he

is (1) working and (2) not in college. In the models that included the selection terms, the

coefficients indicating the earnings premiums high school graduates and GED recipients

received relative to the earnings of permanent dropouts were 10-50 percent smaller than

the analogous premiums estimated in models without the selection terms.

       C-H (1993b) do not emphasize the extent to which their results are sensitive to the

corrections for selectivity bias. One reason may be that they did not have confidence in

the exclusion restrictions that they used for identification -- namely, that indicators of

local labor market conditions belong in the probit equations, but do not belong in the
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  29




main wage equation.33

       Had we been able to identify appropriate exclusion restrictions, we would have

fitted selection models analogous to those employed by C-H. However, our data set did

not include any variables that we could use for defensible exclusion restrictions.34 As

mentioned above, our central results would not change if the critical coefficients were

10-50 percent smaller. It would still be the case that acquisition of a GED is associated

with considerably higher earnings for male dropouts who left school with very low

cognitive skills, but not for dropouts who left school with higher skills.



Does preparation for the GED exams result in an increase in cognitive skills?

       While the self-reports of GED test-takers indicate that most do not spend a great

deal of time studying for the exams, some do. This led us to wonder whether the

cognitive skills of dropouts who passed the GED exams increased more between 1980

and 1982 than did the skills of permanent dropouts, and whether they increased as much

as the skills of their peers who graduated from high school in 1982. To examine this

question, we fitted models in which the gains in score between 1980 and 1982 on tests of

reading, writing, science, and mathematics were the dependent variables.35 Explanatory

variables included the number of years of high school completed, and two dichotomous

variables, one indicating that the individual obtained a GED between 1980 and 1982, and

the second indicating that the individual obtained a GED between 1983 and 1989. The
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   30




reason for two indicators of receipt of GED is that it seemed likely that dropouts who

passed the GED exams between 1980 and 1982 would be more likely to show gains in

cognitive skills between 1980 and 1982 than would be the case for dropouts who passed

the GED exams after 1982, since test preparation by the early GED recipients may have

increased the cognitive skills that are measured by the 1982 High School and Beyond

standardized tests. All models also included controls for race and ethnicity, family

background characteristics, and scores on the other tenth grade tests.

       The models predicting the test score gains between 1980 and 1982 have little

statistical power. However, the estimated coefficients, which are displayed in Table 7,

show several consistent patterns. Students who graduated from high school increased

their skills in each subject area between 1980 and 1982 more than did permanent

dropouts. The point estimates imply that dropouts who obtained a GED also increased

their skills in all subject areas more than did permanent dropouts with the same number

of years of completed high school. Moreover, those dropouts who obtained the GED

credential between 1980 and 1982 increased their cognitive skills during this period more

than did dropouts who obtained a GED at a later date. While it is not possible to

eliminate the possibility that this pattern reflects unobserved heterogeneity, the pattern is

consistent with the hypothesis that studying for the GED examination did increase the

math skills of dropouts.

                                        Conclusion

       In models that treat GED recipients as a single group, the results of our analyses

using HS&B data support Cameron & Heckman’s (1993b) primary conclusion: male

GED recipients did not earn as much in the early 1990s at age 27 as did conventional

high school graduates, even after taking into account that they come from less advantaged

families and had lower academic skill levels when they were sophomores in high school.

On average, GED recipients earned somewhat more at age 27 than observationally similar

permanent dropouts, but the difference is statistically significant only in models that do

not control for years of work experience.

       The most important new insight from this paper is that the average difference

between the earnings of GED recipients treated as a single group and those of permanent

dropouts reflects quite a large difference for dropouts who leave school with very weak

cognitive skills and no difference for dropouts who leave school with somewhat higher

skills. The logic underlying this pattern is that dropouts who left school with very weak

academic skills are the least desirable applicants for most jobs. As a result they earn

only about two-thirds as much at age 27 as dropouts who left school with stronger

academic skills. Those dropouts with low sophomore test scores who later increase their

skills and perhaps improve their work ethic as well appear to use the GED to signal to

employers that they are more desirable employees than they had been in the past. This

signal enables them to increase their earnings to the level of permanent dropouts and
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  32




GED recipients who left school with stronger cognitive skills. This earnings level is

considerably higher than the earnings of permanent dropouts with the same low tenth

grade skills.

       Post-secondary education pays off for GED-holders as well as for high school

graduates. Consequently, those GED recipients who use the credential to gain access to

post-secondary education benefit from this investment. However, only 11 percent of

GED-holders had completed at least one year of college by the age of 27, and only 8

percent had completed at least two years of college.

       In summary, the evidence for males from High School and Beyond indicates that

labor market benefits in the early 1990s associated with a GED accrued primarily to the

subset of dropouts who left school with very low academic skills.

       A potential cost of the GED certification program is that its existence may induce

some high school students who do have the cognitive skills to obtain a conventional high

school diploma to drop out of school and acquire the alternative credential. The evidence

from High School & Beyond is that the GED credential is the labor market equivalent of

a high school diploma only for males who had extremely low academic skills as tenth

graders. These males, both those with a high school diploma and those with a GED, fare

poorly in the labor market. For males with tenth grade academic skills in the upper three

quarters of the test score distribution, the GED is not the labor market equivalent of the

conventional high school diploma.

Note that the definitions in Panel A are mutually exclusive and, hence, the entries in a column sum to 1. The
definitions in Panel C, however, are not mutually exclusive (e.g., an individual could have earned credits in both a
two-year and a four-year institution). Hence, we would expect the sum of the entries in a column to be higher than
the estimate of the percentage of a group who obtained at least one post-secondary credit.

Sample Selection
     The data used in this paper are from the High School and Beyond national longitudinal
survey of 14,825 individuals who were in the 10th grade in 1980. To be included in our sample,
males in the survey had to have participated in both the 1980 base year survey and in the fourth
follow-up survey conducted in 1992. In Table 1A below we tabulate the results of this and other
sample selection decisions that were made to create the final analytic sample of 4,899 males used
in this paper.

Identification of Education Status
     The GED is commonly referred to as a “high school equivalency” certificate. Thus, GED-
holders may equate obtaining a GED with graduating from high school, making it unclear how
they would answer a survey question about high school completion. There is only one secondary-
education-status question in the four High School and Beyond surveys that specifically asks
respondents whether or not they have earned a GED, and as a result, identification of true GED-
holders in the High School and Beyond data is not straightforward. Responses to that question,
which was asked in the third follow-up survey (1986), are coded into variable TY18 in the High
School and Beyond data.
     Our secondary-education-status identification strategy begins with variable TY18. The 831
males and females who identified themselves as GED-holders on this question were all coded as
GED-holders in our project, unless high school transcript data disagreed with the self-reported
status. Remaining to be resolved were (1) establishing that individuals who called themselves high
school graduates on TY18 were, indeed, regular high school graduates, (2) resolving the
secondary-education-status of individuals who either indicated they were still in high school in
1986 or whose values on TY18 were missing or invalid, (3) establishing the secondary-education
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                                51




status of individuals who did not participate in the third follow-up (1986) survey, and (4)
establishing the final (as of 1992) secondary-education status of individuals who indicated on
TY18 that they had no diploma or certification as of 1986. In Table 3A below, we present the
variables in High School and Beyond that we used to resolve each of these issues.

 but who obtained the credential by 1992.

 certification” to identify inconsistencies

 inconsistencies



     Using these variables and a relatively complex algorithm we were able to sort the 14,825
members of the High School and Beyond sample into the categories in Table 4A below.

     Thus, we are unable to positively identify about 7 percent of the entire High School and
Beyond sample. However, when we reconstruct Table 4A using only males who participated in
the fourth follow-up (1992), the percentage of individuals for whom we cannot identify the
secondary-education status is only about 3 percent, as shown in Table 5A.

Table 5A. Distribution of males in the High School and Beyond who participated in the fourth
follow-up survey by secondary-education status.
 Type of certification                    Frequency            Percent
 Regular high school graduates               4,959               81.1

 GED-holders                                  478                 7.8

 Permanent dropouts                           469                 7.7

 Conflicts in status, left unidentified       209                 3.4

     Finally, the discrepancies between the first four rows of Table 5A, above, and the rows of
Table 2A, which give the distribution by secondary-education status of our final analytic-sample,
are explained by the sample selection criteria of Table 1A.

Sample Selection
     The data used in Tables 1A and 1B are from the October 1993 Current Population Survey
(CPS). To be included in the sample used to construct Table 1A observations had to meet the
following criteria:
          C       not employed in the agriculture, forestry, or fisheries sector,
          C       last job was not in the military,
          C       not self-employed,
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                    53




       C      non-missing on CPS variable A-S40 (identification of educational attainment),
       C      age 22S29, and
       C      male.
    To be included in Table 1B the additional restriction was the individual had to have been a
member of the outgoing rotation group in the October 1993 CPS.

4. A critical difference between C-H’s study and ours lies in the measures of labor market

outcome. They use hourly wage and annual hours of work; our data set contains only

information on annual earnings.

5. C-H (1993b) summarize much of the evidence in this paragraph.

6. We included in our sample only males who were at least 22 years of age because

younger males were likely not to have significant labor market attachment.

7. To make the educational attainment figures in Table 1 comparable to the percentages

of males who graduated from high school that are based on the usual CPS or Census data,

the percentages of GED recipients and the percentages of males who did not report how

they obtained high graduate status (No response) should be added to the percentage of

high school graduates in Table 1A. The resulting estimates of the percentages of males

who are high school graduates (92 percent for whites, 89 percent for blacks, and 63

percent for Hispanics) are close to estimates reported in the NCES publication, Dropout

Rates in the United States: 1994 (McMillen and Kaufman, 1996).

8. See the data appendix for a description of the calculations used to conclude that most

of the non-responders to the question about how they obtained high school graduate

status were actually conventional high school graduates rather than GED recipients.

9. As noted in Table 1B, the sample sizes used in estimating the median hourly wages for

males with different educational credentials are quite small. Imprecision of estimates

may help to explain why the estimated median hourly wage of those “high school

graduates” who failed to report how they acquired this status was slightly lower than the

estimated median wage of self-reported GED recipients and markedly lower than the

estimated median wage of self reported holders of conventional high school diplomas.

10. On average, participants in the JOBSTART program spent 128 hours on educational

activities, most of which was GED preparation(Cave & Doolittle, 1991, p.76).

11. While over 30,000 sophomores participated in the base year and first follow-up

surveys, only 14,825 of these individuals were followed into the second, third, and fourth

surveys. Of these 14,825 respondents, 13,749 were surveyed in the base year, 14,102 in

the first follow-up, 13,682 in the second follow-up, 13,425 in the third follow-up, and

12,640 were surveyed in the fourth follow-up. See the data appendix for details on how

the analytic sample was constructed.

12. The NLSY, the data base used in many previous studies of the GED, includes scores

from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), which more than 90

percent of the sample completed in 1980. At the time participants in the NLSY took this

test battery, they were between the ages of 15 and 23, and 40 percent of dropouts who
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                 56




obtained a GED by 1994 had already done so. In studying the impact of GED acquisition

on subsequent labor market performance, it is inappropriate to use as control variables

scores on tests taken after GED acquisition. The reason is that preparation for the GED

exam or participation in post-secondary education made possible by GED acquisition

may have increased cognitive skills and test scores. If this does occur, then controlling

for the ASVAB scores eliminates one mechanism through which GED acquisition may

impact on subsequent earnings.

13. We verified that the answers to our research questions were not sensitive to the

decision to define the dependent variable as the log of average earnings in 1990 and 1991

instead of as the log of 1991 earnings.

14. The reason we restricted the NLSY sample of dropouts used in the comparisons to the

youngest four cohorts is that they are the cohorts that were most similar in age in 1980 to

the HS&B sophomore cohort when it was first interviewed in 1980.

15. C-H (1993b) report a larger difference between the average number of years of

schooling completed by permanent dropouts and GED recipients than the difference we

report. The explanation lies in the composition of the sample. C-H’s NLSY sample

included males with as little as six years of completed schooling. All of the school

dropouts in our HS&B sample completed at least nine years of schooling.

16. Eighteen males in our sample whom we classified as “permanent dropouts” obtained

a GED in the period 1990-92. According to a publication of the American Council on

Education (1995), about 38 percent of the individuals who obtained a GED did so when
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   57




they were age 25 or older.

17. There are several reasons why there is not exactly 25 percent of the analytic sample in
each test score quartile. We calculated the cut-off scores defining the test score quartiles
using information on both male and females in the High School & Beyond data set; the
analytic sample contains only males. We used sample weights in defining the test score
quartiles; we did not use sample weights in calculating the statistics reported in Table 2.
Finally, while the test score quartiles were defined using information on all students who
completed the test, the analytic sample includes only individuals who reported annual
earnings for 1990 or 1991.

18. Fine (1991) makes this argument. Another possible explanation is that the males who

obtained a GED prior to the graduation of their cohort were older students who would

have dropped out of school in any case. The age distribution of the early GED-recipients

does not support this hypothesis, however. Eighty-nine percent of the males who

obtained a GED before their cohort graduated from high school were aged 18 or less

when they obtained the credential. As indicated in Table 3, 47 percent of the dropouts in

the sample who obtained a GED by the end of 1989 did so by the end of 1982.

19. In our measure of post-secondary education we included credits earned in (non-

college) post-secondary training institutions that provided transcripts. We did so because

we could not reject the null hypothesis that the earnings payoff to credits earned in such

institutions was the same as the payoff to college credits. Our results are not sensitive to

this decision because only four percent of GED recipients in the sample earned a credit at

a non-college training institution that provided a transcript.

20. Murnane, Willett, and Boudett (1997) reported that receipt of the GED credential did

increase the likelihood that school dropouts would enroll in training programs not
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   58




provided by employers.

21. As explained below and demonstrated in Table 6, the sophomore math score is a

much more powerful predictor of earnings at age 27 than are the other sophomore test

scores. In fact, when we added the sophomore reading, writing, and science test scores to

Model 1, 2, and 3 in Table 5 (which include the sophomore math score), we could not

reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients on these additional test scores were all zero

The respective p values associated with the hypothesis test are 0.44, 0.61, and 0.84.

22. The 42 percent differential is calculated as (e.353-1) and the 32 percent differential as

(e(.353-.074) - 1).

23. We did not use sample weights in fitting the models depicted in Table 5. However,

the results using sample weights are quite similar. For example, when Model 1 is

estimated using the fourth follow-up sample weights (the HS&B variable is FU4WT), the

coefficient on high school graduate is 0.393 and the coefficient on GED is 0.163.

24. Work experience is measured as the number of months in which an individual had any

employment between June 1982 and 1992, divided by 12. The unconditional mean

values of work experience for high school graduates, GED recipients, and high school

graduates reported in Table 2 are quite close. However, when estimated in a model that

controls for family background characteristics and years of post-secondary education,

GED recipients are predicted to have .43 more years of work experience than

observationally similar permanent dropouts and high school graduates 2.22 more years.

25. In a model that includes a GED by years-of-post-secondary-education interaction and
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                    59




a high-school-graduate by years-of-post-secondary-education interaction, we are unable

to reject the hypothesis that the estimated coefficients on these two interactions are equal

(p=0.748).

26. Using data from the National Adult Literacy Survey, Sum (1996) also found no

statistically significant difference between the earnings of GED recipients and those of

high school graduates with no post-secondary education. This result needs to be

interpreted cautiously, however, since GED-recipients and conventional high school

graduates who do not go on to college are self-selected groups. College is a common

path to higher earnings and GED recipients are much less likely to acquire college credits

than are high school graduates.

27. Kirsch et al.(1993) report a pattern consistent with our finding that GED recipients

earn as much as conventional high school graduates who do not go to college. They find

that, on average, GED recipients score as high on the National Adult Literacy Survey as

high school graduates who do not go to college.



28. The 37 percent figure was calculated as follows: e(0.306) - 1, where .306 is the

coefficient on the GED indicator in Model 1 for males in the lowest quartile The results

were not substantively different when Model 1 was fitted using sample weights.

29. We thank an anonymous referee for pointing out these two possible sources of bias.

30. Holzer (1996) documents employers’ resistance to hiring applicants who have spotty

employment records for even low-wage jobs. Meyer and Wise (1982) and Ellwood
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                  60




(1982) show that early youth unemployment impacts negatively on workers’ subsequent

wages. They find little impact on subsequent employment. However, Rich (1994), using

more recent data, finds negative effects of early youth unemployment on subsequent

employment prospects.

31. Kane & Rouse (1995), using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High

School Class of 1972, report that a year of completed post-secondary education was

associated with an earnings differential of 4-5 percent. They treat 30 college credits as a

year of education. We treat 24 credits (eight 3-credit courses) as a year of post-secondary

education.

32. One model that we fitted parameterized the main effect of tenth grade math score as a

fourth order polynomial, and the four math score terms were also interacted with the

dichotomous indicators for high school graduate and GED recipient.

33. C-H do not describe in their 1993b paper the exclusion restrictions they imposed in

estimating their selection model. Instead, they refer the reader to an earlier unpublished

version of the paper.

34. As described in the text, more males were excluded from our analytic sample because

they did not take the HS&B sophomore math test than were excluded because they were

either in college in 1990 and 1991 or did not report earnings for these years. Thus, even

if the indicators of local labor market conditions that C-H used had been present in our

data set, they would not have solved the primary sample selection problem in our data.

35. Both the 1980 tests and 1982 tests were scaled using Item Response Theory (IRT) so
Murnane, Willett, and Tyler                   61




that the scores on the two tests are equatable. In 1982 the same tests were administered

to school dropouts as to students still in high school.
