        The paper discusses the historical background     and institutional    details of Hong Kong’s

currency board. We argue that its experience provides a good opportunity to test the macroeconomic

implications   of the currency board regime. Using the method of Blanchard and Quah (1989), we

show that the parameters of the structural equations and the characteristics    of supply and demand

shocks have significantly changed since adopting the regime. Variance decomposition       and impulse

response analyses indicate Hong Kong’s currency board is less susceptible to supply shocks, but

demand shocks can cause greater short-term volatility under the system. The decent performance

of Hong Kong’s currency board is due mainly to the stable fiscal policy of its government.   Counter-

factual exercises also show that three-fourths of the reduction in observed output volatility and two-

thirds of that in observed inflation volatility are explained by the adoption of the currency board,

while the remainder is explained by changes in the external environment,          The improvement   in

stability does not rule out the possibility of monetaty collapse, however.

1.     Introduction

       Currency board, first introduced in the British colony of Mauritius in 1849, is a

rule-based monetq         institution that is rather different from a central bank.      Although

there are variations,     a typical currency board has two essential characteristics.          First,

the board has the obligation to exchange on demand local currency for some major

international currency, which is often called the reserve currency, and vice versa, at a

fixed exchange rate stipulated in the legislation. Second, local currency is issued based

on at least      100 percent     reserve of securities    denominated    mainly in the reserve

currency.

        Since the nineteenth century, dozens of currency boards had been established in

British colonies     and other places, often in response to monetary           or exchange rate

disturbances.’     However, when these colonies became independent nations after World

War II, most of them decided to replace the currency board with a central bank. Only

very few currency boards still survive today. Some people may be inclined to believe

that this form of monetary institution has already lost its practical importance.               This

judgment is premature. Recently, Argentina and Estonia have enacted laws to establish

currency boards, which have also been recommended               for Russia, Bulgaria and some

other nations      in Eastern    Europe    (see Hanke, Jonung,      and Schuler     (1993)).     The

currency crisis of Mexico in 1995 has further stimulated people to consider the system

seriously.    If this renewed interest could be sustained and these countries were to adopt

currency boards eventually, then as Schwartz (1993) had commented,                   “a watershed

would have been reached in the annals of political economy.”

          Do the potential       benefits of currency boards outweigh              their costs in these

countries? Some of the theoretical advantages and disadvantages                     of currency boards

are well known.2         For example, convertibility of currency is guaranteed               and there is

little or no uncertainty        about the exchange rate. On the other hand, in times of

domestic liquidity crisis, a currency board arrangement cannot act as a lender of last

resort. In theory, its reserve currency can only be used to buy local currency or foreign

securities.    It would be a violation of its basic principle if the reserve were to be used

to purchase the assets of a domestic bank suffering from a run.3                        Moreover,     since

currency board is a rule-based arrangement, active discretionary monetary policies are

precluded.     Whether this macroeconomic             self-discipline is regarded as an advantage,

however,      is more controversial.

     To assess the viability of adopting          currency boards as the monetary institution, we

should not satisfy ourselves with theoretical discussions alone. Since they have been in

existence for almost one and a half centuries,               a more fruitful appro,ach is to analyze

rigorously     the empirical      data generated      from actual experience.         This literature     is

generally lacking. In this paper, we shall analyze the macroeconomic                    implications of a

currency board regime using Hong Kong data and methods developed by Blanchard



2
      Williamson (1995) provides a useful summary of the advantages and disadvantages of currency
    boards.

3
       The currency board of Hong Kong is an exception to this rule. There is no formal legislation
    prohibiting the board from using its foreign exchange to purchase domestic assets, although the
    board has so far refrained from doing so in a significant way. See the balance sheet in Table 7. One
    interpretation is that the legislature provides an “escape clause” with which the board can act as a
    lender of last resort during financial crises. As long as the escape clause is only invoked in truly
    exceptional and justifiable situations, it will not jeopardize the credibility of the currency board, See
    Persson and Tabellini (1991) for an illustration and discussion of escape clause models. See also
    footnote 14.

and Quah (1989) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993, 1994). The viability of the

regime is also discussed.

       In the next section, we shall briefly discuss the historical background          of Hong

Kong’s currency board and argue why its experience provides us with a unique natural

experiment to evaluate some aspects of the system. In Section 3, we shall outline the

structural vector autoregressive       (VAR) model implemented in this paper. Section 4

presents the quantitative      results and their interpretations.   Section 5 summarizes some

general properties       and implications   about currency boards that we have learned from

the Hong Kong experience.




2. Historical Background of Hong Kong’s Currency Board

       The currency system of Hong Kong, following that of China, was based on the

silver standard in the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth centuries.4 In 1934, the

United States decided to buy silver at a very high fixed rate and that led to large

outflow    of silver from Hong Kong and China. As a result,                   both   governments

abandoned the silver standard. In December 1935, Hong Kong enacted the Currency

Ordinance, which was later renamed as the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and purchased

all privately held silver coins. At the same time, the note-issuing           banks, which were

private   enterprises,     had to deposit     their silver reserves      with the newly created

Exchange      Fund   and received      Certificates    of Indebtedness     (CIS) in return.   The

Exchange Fund sold the silver in the London market for sterling. From then on, if an

authorized bank wanted to issue more notes, it was obligated to purchase more CIS

    Greenwood (1995), Nugee (1995), and Schwartz (1993).


                                                   3
from the Exchange Fund with sterling at a fixed rate of       sixteen HK dollar to one

pound. The Exchange Fund would also buy the CIS from the banks if the latter decided

to decrease the money supply. Thus, the monetary system had all the features of a

currency board, with the exception that legal tenders were issued by authorized private

banks rather than directly by the board.

     The peg to the sterling lasted for more than three decades, despite four years of

interruption during World War II. In 1967, because of devaluation of the sterling, the

sixteen HK dollar peg could no longer be sustained. In       July 1972 further pressure

from the devaluation of the sterling forced the eventual abolition of the link between

the sterling and HK dollar. The latter was pegged to the US dollar at a rate within an

intervention band. This also did not last long. Again devaluation of the US dollar and

an inflow of capital to Hong Kong led to the decision of free-floating the HK dolls

against the US dollw. The currency board system was no longer operating.

     Under the free-floating, system from 1974 to 1983, authorized banks still had to

purchase CIS, which at this time were denominated in HK dollar, from the Exchange

Fund if they wanted to issue more notes. The Fund maintained an account with these

banks. The payment for the CIS was simply a transfer of credit from the banks to the

account of the Exchange Fund. Starting from May 1979, the note-issuing banks were

required   to maintain   100-percent   liquid-asset cover against the Fund’s short-term

deposits. This cover did not imply that the Exchange Fund could effectively limit the

creation of money because the banks could borrow foreign currency to obtain the

liquid assets. Money growth in this period was higher and more volatile than before. In

1978, the government also decided to transfer the accumulated HK dollar fiscal surplus
to the Exchange Fund, which has since then become the government’s de $acto savings

account.

    During the initial phase of the free-floating period, the HK dollar was very strong.

However,       from 1977 onwards, it was subject to considerable         downward    pressure.

Trade deficit was growing. Money supply, M2, increased at the rate of almost 25

percent a year, mainly because of even faster growth in bank credit. The start of the

Sine-British     negotiations    over the future of Hong Kong in 1982 led to a series of

financial crises: stock market crash, real estate price collapse, runs of small banks, and

rapid depreciation of the HK dollar. On October 17, 1983, the government decided to

abolish interest withholding tax on HK dollar deposits and more importantly,            to go

back to the currency board system again. The exchange rate was fixed at US$ 1 = HK$

7.8. Banks issuing notes had to purchase CIS with US dollar at this rate from the

Exchange Fund. The reserves accumulated were invested mairdy in interest-bearing

U.S. government        securities.     Table 1 summarizes the historical evolution   of Hong

Kong’s monetary institutions.




           Several new changes to the currency board system of Hong Kong, or now

popularly known as the “linked exchange rate system,” were introduced. In 1988, the

Exchange       Fund established        the new “Accounting    Arrangements”   which in effect

empowered        it to conduct       open market operations. Legislative changes also allowed

the government to have more flexibility in manipulating the interest rates Since March

1990, the Fund was permitted to issue several kinds of “Exchange Fund Bills,” which

were similar to short-term           Treasury bills. In 1992, a sort of discount window was

opened to provide liquidity to banks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)




                                                   5
was established         in December    1992 to take over the power of the Exchange Fund

Office and the Commissioner             of Banking. The HKMA has since been active in

adjusting interbank liquidity in response to changes in demand conditions.

     Several remarks should be made here. First, the monetary institution in Hong Kong

has not been a static system. In less than half a century, it has evolved from the silver

standard to a currency board with sterling being the reserve currency, and then to a

free-floating regime, and finally back to the currency board with a US dollar link. More

recently, as Schwartz          (1993) has observed, there has been some “dilution” of the

features that distinguish a currency board. Given historical hindsight, one can hardly

believe that the present system will last forever, despite the persistent assurance by the

Hong Kong Government              that the linked exchange rate is there to stay permanently.

This view is supported           by the observation that historically     all fixed exchange rate

regimes could not be sustained for very long periods.5 This motivates us to simulate in

Section 4.4 the conditions under which the Hong Kong currency board may collapse.

       Second, from 1974 to now, Hong Kong has used two polar cases of monetary

systems, namely, free-floating (1974-83) and currency board (1983-now).                  There have

been no other economic institutional changes of comparable order of magnitude. The

government          still adopts the “active non-interventionism”   policy formulated more than

two decades ago. It has been persistently keeping the size of the government small and

leaving small budgetary surpluses in most fiscal years. It has also refrained from using

fiscal policy as a fine-tuning tool. The legal system has remained intact and Hong

Kong’s economic freedom has always been rated at the highest level by international

      Eichengreen (1994) casts doubt on the future of any pegged exchange rate regime in the 2 1st
    century. He predicts that only the two extremes of flexible exchange rate and monetary unification
    will survive.

agencies.      These    similarities   in the   two       periods   provide   us with        a relatively

homogeneous        setting to conduct      a natural controlled        experiment     to compare       the

implications of the two systems.

       Third, while structural homogeneity is needed for the controlled experiment on the

one hand, sufficiently rich data variation is necessary for statistical                   purpose on the

other. If the economic conditions          of the two periods had remained perfectly stable,

then     the    data    would    hwdly     contain        enough    information     for    inferring   the

macroeconomic          performance     of the two systems. We need to observe how the two

regimes respond to external shocks. Indeed Hong Kong as a small open economy is

extremely sensitive to external shocks which may overshadow the “treatment effect” of

a currency board system. Fortunately,            by adopting the approach            in Blanchwd       and

Quah (1989), it is possible to isolate the supply and demand shocks during the two

periods. Counter-factual         simulations can be performed to identify the effects of the

change in monetary regime.

       Fourth, Hong Kong has gone through a number of major economic shocks from

1974 to now. This period covers the time span of several business cycles. There have

also been big swings in real estate and stock markets. The quarterly data available are

reasonably rich in variations which allow us to make meaningful inferences.

          Lastly, the economic health and significant financial strength of Hong Kong

provide an almost ideal situation to test the vulnerability of a currency board system

when it is confronted with a crisis. At the end of 1995, foreign currency assets in the

Exchange Fund amounted to US$ 57,2 billion, which was the world’s seventh largest.

The ratio of foreign currency assets in the Exchange Fund to currency in circulation

was bigger than five. The value of the government’s                  accumulated     fiscal reserve was




                                                      7
also substantial.   In fact, it was contributing to one-third of the Exchange Fund (see

Hong Kong Monetary           Authority   (1996)). If simulations    show that Hong Kong’s

currency board has to face a crisis when it is subject to shocks of specified magnitude,

then it is hard to imagine that the currency board in a country with poorer economic

health can survive under the same scenario.




3. Empirical Model

        In this Section,     we discuss a framework      that will be used to compare the

macroeconomic        performance    of the flexible and linked exchange rate regimes when

they are subject to exogenous shocks. To properly take into account the heterogeneity

induced by these shocks, we adopt Blanchard and Quah’s (1989) approach to identify

them explicitly.

       Our empirical framework is the structural vector autoregressive           (VAR) model

initiated     by Blanchard   and Watson     (1986),    Sims (1986),    and Bernanke         (1986).

Following Blanchard and Quah (1989) and Bayourni and Eichengreen                 (1993, 1994),

we formulate a bivariate model in output growth and inflation rate to identify two

series of structural shocks: (1) those whose effects on output level are only transitory,

and (2) those that have permanent effects on the output level. Shocks of the first type

are interpreted     as demand shocks originated from innovations         in the components       of

aggregate       demand,   while    the second   type   are supply     shocks   originated     from

innovations      in productivity   and other factors    that affect aggregate      supply. This

distinction     is crucird for solving the identification problem discussed below.     We now

briefly describe the model and refer the reader to the above references and the surveys

in Giannini (1992) and Watson (1994) for details.



                                                8
       Let X, = (Ay, , Apl )’, where y, and p, denote the logarithm of output and price

level, respectively.       X, is assumed to be covariance       stationary    and have a moving

average representation       of the form

          Xl – p = BOe, + Ble,_l + B2et_2+... = B(L)el                                            (1)

where e[ = (edt , est )’ is a bivariate series of serially uncorrelated shocks with zero mean

and covariance matrix Q, B(L) = B. + BIL + B2L2 +.., is a short-hand notation for the

matrix polynomial in backshift operator L, and p is the mean of Xl. ( 1) is taken to be

structural in that ed[ and esl have a behavioral interpretation      of being the demand shock

and    supply     shock,    respectively.    The coefficient   matrices      in B(L)    capture    the

propagation      muhanism        of the dynamic system. In particular, the (i, j) element of Bk is

the k th step impulse response of the i th endogenous variables with respect to a one

unit increase in the j th shock.

      Equation (1) is not directly estimated. We proceed in the following steps. First, we

estimate a VAR in Xl :

        A(L) (Xt - ~) =     U,                                                                    (2)

where { U(} is a bivariate series of serially uncorrelated          errors with zero mean and

covariance      matrix Z, and A(L) is a matrix polynomial          in L. Second,       we invert the

estimated     autoregressive       polynomial   in (2) to obtain the Weld         moving     average

representation,    which is the reduced form to (l).

          x,–p      = U, + C1u,_l + C2U,-2+...= C(L)U,                                            (3)

Again, C(L) = I + CIL + C2L2 + ... is short-hand for the matrix polynomial as stated.

In our implementation        the reduced form VAR is estimated with six lags and the Weld

representation     in (3) is expanded up to 200 lags which is more than adequate. Given

estimates of the reduced form parameters, C(L) and Z, and the reduced form residuals


                                                    9
uI, is it possible to recover the structural parameters, B(L) and Q, and the structural

residuals et? This is a classical identification problem in simultaneous equation models

and the answer is yes provided that enough a priori restrictions              have been placed on

the structural parameters.        Comparing (1) and (3) it can be checked that the structural

and reduced form are related by the following relationships:

         BOe, = Ut      Vt.                                                                       (4)

         Bj =Cj BO,          ~=0,1,2,...                                                          (5)


         BOQBO’= x.                                                                               (6)

Equations (4) and (5) imply that the structural form in (1) can be recovered from the

reduced form in (3) once BO isdetermined. Thus, the identification problem boils down

to imposing sufficiently many restrictions so that         BO   can be solved from (6).

         In our bivariate system, there are seven structural parameters in BO and Q, but

ordy three reduced form parameters in Z; we thus need four restrictions to just-identify

the structural     model. The first three restrictions ‘come from assuming S2 to be the

identity matrix. The zero covariance restriction dictates that the two structural shocks

are uncorrelated, implying that any cross-equation interaction of the two shocks on the

dependent variables are captured by the lag structure in B(L). The two unit-variance

restrictions    imply that    BO is   identified up to multiple of the two standard deviations.

Thus Bj has the interpretation         of being the j th step impulse response with respect to a

one-standard-deviation         innovation in the structural shocks. The last restriction comes

from Blanchard        and Quah’s (1989) idea of restricting             long-run   multiplier.   Since

demand       shocks   are assumed to have no permanent               effects on output     level, this

translates     into the restriction        that the long-run multiplier (i.e. the sum of impulse

         To see how (7) can be translated into a restriction on Bo, let .J be the lower

Thus B. can be determined from J up to an orthogonal transformation                 S, i.e.

          BO = JS,       SS’ = I.                                                                 (9)

Bo, the structural parameters and the structural shocks can then be recovered from the

series exhibit strong seasonality and they are deseasonalized before use by a spectral

method by Sims (1974) and implemented in Dean (1992, section 11.7). The full sample

is divided into two halves corresponding      to the two exchange rate regimes: the free

float period straddles 1975:1 to 1983:3 and the currency board period covers 1983:4

to 1995:3.




4.     Results and Interpretations

       In this Section, we present the empirical results and interpret them, In particular,

we use these results to compare the macroeconomic         performance of the free-floating

and currency board regimes from several perspectives.




4.1.    Institutional   Effect or Environment Effect?

        Figures 1a and lb display the data for the full sample period, covering both the

free-floating and currency board regimes. It can be seen that both inflation and output

growth are somewhat          more stable during the currency board years than the free-

floating years, More precisely, the standard       deviation of output growth rates during

the free-floating and currency board yems are 2.94 and 2.23, respectively, and that of

the inflation rates are 1.55 and 1,05, respectively,




       What is behind the observed reduction in volatility in both output growth rates and

inflation rates?        Some believe that this is simply because     of a more congenial

international     environment   during the 1980s than the 1970s. On the other hand,

advocates       of fixed exchange rate and currency board, including the Hong Kong

government,      sometimes argue that this is due to the inherent superiority of the linked



                                              12
exchange rate regime over the free-floating system (e.g., see Sheng (1995)).                    Granted

that both arguments           are reasonable and neither can be rejected a priori,             it is then

necessary to disentangle the “institutional effect” from the “environment effect.” In our

structural VAR model, the structural parameters, Bj‘s, play the role of institution and

the structural      shocks,     u, , represent    the external environment.      By estimating       two

separate structural models for the two exchange rate regimes, we obtain two sets of

structural      parameters     representing      the two institutions    and two      sets of shocks

representing      two different external environments.           We show below that both the

parameters and the shocks have changed.




         Table 2 reports the summary statistics of the estimations               for equation      (1) in

Section 3 under free-floating           and currency board.         It can be seen that they are

statistically    significant    at the 0.01 and 0.001 levels, respectively.               The estimated

parameters for the structural equation (1) are different across the two regimes. This is

evident from a likelihood-ratio            version of the Chow test, which rejects the null

hypotheses       of no structural change at the 5 percent level.7 The result supports                 the

Lucas Critique. We need to use a different set of structural parameters to capture the

institutional effect due to a change in the monetary regime.                It is assumed, however,

that these parameters are invariant to the exogenous shocks.




7
       The likelihood ratio statistic LR = - 2(lnh - lItLI - fnLz) = -2(699.76 -291,85-     428,66) = 41.5
    rejects the null hypothesis of no structural change at the 5 percent level according to a chi-squared
    distribution with 26 degrees of freedom. lnh , lrrLI , and ln~ are the log likelihood values of the
    VARS estimated by using the full sample (75:1 - 95:3), the free float period (75:1 - 83:3), and the
    currency board period (83:4 - 95:3), respectively.


                                                      13
       Figures 2a and 2b present the quarterly demand and supply shocks (1975-95) that

are identified by using the econometric framework in Section 3. Table 3 reports the

summary statistics of the shocks. By the skewness and kurtosis tests, one can observe

that both types of shocks during the free-floating               period exhibit substantial     non-

normality which can be attributed        to a few large negative shocks. The skewness of the

shocks can be clearly discerned from their empirical distributions,            depicted in Figures

3a and 3b.8 Shocks during the currency board period, on the contrary, show no strong

evidence against normality, as is clear from the skewness and kurtosis tests and their

empirical distributions.




       This indicates that the two exchange rate regimes are subject to exogenous shocks

of different characteristics.     Simply comparing the macroeconomic           performance     in the

two periods without properly controlling for the environment effect can be misleading.

This forces us to use better methods.




4.2.    Variance Decomposition         and Impulse Response Functions

       The relative importance of demand and supply shocks changes dramatically across

the two exchange         rate regimes. This is demonstrated          by the results     on variance

decomposition       of the shocks and the estimated values of the impulse responses.




8
       The empirical distribution is obtained by matching the first four sample moments with a Gram-
    Charlier expansion. See Johnson and Kotz (1970), p. 15-20.


                                                   14
     Table 4 shows the percentages of variance in output growth rate and inflation that

can be explained       by the demand shocks in the last n quarters,                where n is the

corresponding      number in the extreme left column. The percentages             explained by the

supply shocks are given by 100 minus the table entries. Table 5 is similar to Table 4,

but shows the variance in output level and price level explained. As can be readily seen,

during the free-floating      regime, demand shocks explain little the variations in output

growth and level, but a substantial fraction of inflation or price movements.9                On the

other hand, supply shocks can account for most of the output changes, but little of the

price fluctuations.     In the currency board regime, the results are different. Demand

shocks can explain much of the variations in the output and price series, at least in the

short run. The movements        explained   by the supply shocks are also substantial.




        The dynamic impulse responses of            output and price with respect to demand

shocks are consistent with the vaiance decomposition             results above. In Figures 4a and

4b, the impulse responses, or cumulative effects of demand shocks on output and price

during the last n quarters are plotted against n. 10 The response                of output is both

smaller and shorter in duration under the flexible exchange regime. On the other hand,

the response of price level under the currency board regime is smaller than that under

free-floating.




9
      The values in the second and third columns of Table 5 decline when n becomes larger, This is
    because the variance of output level explained by the demand shocks must converge to zero in the
    long run. Readers are reminded that in Section 3, we have built in the identifying restriction that
    demand shocks have no long-term effects on output level.

10 The magnitude of the demand shock in each period is one standard deviation.

                                                   15
            Figures 5a and 5b depict the impulse responses of output and price to supply

shocks,       respectively.     The effects of supply shocks on price level across the two

regimes are negative, a result consistent with simple economics.                          The impact of supply

shocks on price level in the currency board regime appears to be bigger than that under

free-floating. Supply shocks, however, has smaller effect on output during the currency

board        years.    These     results     are    also    consistent     with    the    patterns   in   variance

decomposition,

             What     can we draw          from    the variance decomposition            and impulse response

exercises? In fact, the results can be interpreted in a convenient way. The aggregate

supply curve during the free-floating                      years is very steep. It has flattened            in the

subsequent period, The aggregate demand curve, on the other hand, has a relatively

flat slope under free-floating.              It has steepened in the currency board regime. These

changes in the slope explain why the Chow test detects structural shift in the model.

     Why has the aggregate supply curve, or more properly, the short-run supply curve,

flattened over time? Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1994) has discovered a similar pattern

for the industrial countries over the last one hundred years. The explanation does not

necessarily lie in the adoption of the currency board. After all, during part of the

sample period studied by Bayoumi and Eichengreen, the countries were moving from

fixed exchange to free-floating, while in the case of Hong Kong, it was heading in the

opposite        direction. The flattening of the short-run aggregate supply curve indicates

that there are more nominal rigidities. Probably the latter are due to the increases in

labor legislation and union influences in Hong Kong since the 1980s.11




II
        A   numberof laws on labor protection have been introduced since the 1980s. These range from long-service
  payment, severance compensation,         leaves for pregnant female workers and so forth.



                                                             16
       The steepening     of the aggregate demand curve under currency board can be

usefully analyzed by a simple textbook model (Sachs and Larrain, 1993, Chap. 13 and

14). In a fixed exchange rate regime, an increase in the domestic price will hurt export

and increase import. The underlying IS curve of the economy will shift to the left.

Since a small open economy has to face a given world interest rate, the LM curve will

have to adjust endogenously      so that it intersects the IS curve at the level equal to the

world interest rate. The decline in output due to the increase in price, and hence the

slope of the aggregate       demand curve, is therefore        completely     determined     by the

magnitude of the movement of the IS curve. In the case of free-floating, an increase

in price causes the LM curve to move to the left. The changes in the exchange rate and

price will then lead to an adjustment of the IS curve so that it intersects the LM curve

at an interest   rate equal to the prevailing world interest rate. This time the slope of the

aggregate demand curve depends on how responsive the LM curve is with respect to

an increa-se in price. In general, the slope of the aggregate               demand curve under

currency board can be either steeper or flatter than that under free-floating, depending

on the relative responsiveness      of the IS and LM curves to a change in price level. It

appears that the IS curve in Hong Kong is not as sensitive to price change than the LM

curve. Thus the aggregate demand curve is steeper under currency board. 12

       We can draw the following conclusions from the results above. The output in

Hong Kong under a currency board seems to be less susceptible                  to supply shocks,

which are usually not induced by government short-term policies. However, demand

shocks do cause greater short-term           volatility in output under the currency board




12
     It can be shown by a simple calibrated model that the IS curve in Hong Kong is not as
  responsive to price changes as the LM curve.


                                                 17
system, If a government with a currency board is able to discipline itself to pursue a

stable and predictable fiscal policy, the volatility of the economy may be lower than

that under free-floating. An explanation of why Hong Kong’s economy has been less

volatile after the adoption of the linked exchange rate is that stable fiscal policy has

always been the philosophy of the financial branch of its government.




4.3.     Counter-factual     Simulations

        As discussed in Section 4.1, the two periods under consideration      are subject to

shocks with different properties.      One way to compare the performance       of the two

regimes is to consider the following two cases:

Case 1: What would have happened to the economy if the currency board system

were adopted from 1975 to 1983?

Case 2: What would have happened to the economy if the free-floating system were

adopted from 1983 to 1995?

       To answer the question in Case 1, we apply the demand and supply shocks of 1975

to 1983 to equation (1) which has been estimated for the currency board regime, and

compare      the simulated    results with the actual time path. To answer” the second

question, we do the simulations in a similar way, but this time we apply the shocks of

1983 to 1995 to equation(1)       for the free floating regime. The approach is based on the

assumption that the supply and demand shocks identified in the estimation procedure

of Section 3 are invariant to the change in exchange rate regime.          This erogeneity

assumption makes a lot of sense for Hong Kong. In this small open economy             whose


external sector is much larger than its GDP, most of the supply and demand shocks are

external. The government has been following the same stable fiscal policy throughout




                                               18
the two periods under consideration.      Moreover, there is no central bank in Hong Kong

to determine     the money supply, which is largely rule-based       in both regimes and

automatically    adjusts to external shocks. Thus, there is no a priori reason to believe

that the supply and demand shocks are regime dependent.

      The counter-factual       exercise amounts to replacing the structural residual e, in

equation (1) by a hypothetical       residual e~* and then simulating a new data path X,*,

given structural parameters & and B(L), For example, in Case 1, e,, W,and B(L) are the

residual and structural parameters for the free-floating regime, while et* is taken to be

the residual for the currency board regime. In practice, however, the moving average

representation    in equation    (1) is difficult to work with. We instead perform the

simulation by equation (2) with a reduced form residual u~* constructed        from et* via

equation (4). It is straightforward     to check that our two-step procedure is equivalent

to a direct simulation of equation (1).




       Summaries of these counter-factual       simulations are presented   in Table 6. The

results show that if the currency board system were adopted in the first period, then

the average growth rate would have declined, but inflation would have gone down

also. Since the standard deviations are also lower, we can say that both output growth

and inflation would have been more stable.          The patterns for the second period are

similar, The cost of a currency board system is lower output growth. However, there

are also benefits. Inflation rate decreases and the economy is less volatile. The tradeoff




                                               19
is transparent when the comparison is in terms of levels (rather than growth rates) as

depicted in Figures 6a, b, and 7a, b.

      The counter-factual    simulations disentangle the effects of regime shift and changes

in the external environment.     AS an example, consider the reduction in output growth

volatility when the monetary system changes from free-floating to currency board. The

standard deviation of output growth rates goes down from 294 to 2.33, a roughly 32

percent reduction in volatility. From simulation case 1, we see that if the currency

board    system were adopted to the environment of the 1970s, output volatility would

have declined to 2.46, a 20 percent reduction from 2.94. This implies that 62.5 percent

of the reduction in output volatility that we actually observe from the data is due to the

adoption of the currency board, while the remaining 37.5 percent is due to a more

tranquil external    environment    in the 1980s. Similarly, the marginal     effect of the

currency board on inflation volatility is to reduce it from 1.55 to 1.21, or about 28

percent reduction. The observed reduction, however, is from 1.55 to 1.05, or a decline

of 48 percent. One can then have the following decomposition.             The difference in

external environment        during the 1970s and 1980s accounts      for 42 percent of the

reduction in inflation volatility, while the change in the monetary regime explains the

remaining 58 percent of the reduction.




4.4     Currency and Banking Crises

        The Hong Kong government has been vehemently claiming that the Exchange

Fund is finmcially strong and the linked exchange rate will be defended. As can be

seen from the balance sheet of the Fund in Table 7, Hong Kong           indeed owns one of

the largest foreign reserves in the world. Does it mean that the HK$ 7,8 link is immune




                                               20
from acnsis?In      theory, a crisis does not occur even when people exchange all the

currency for foreign assets because of the 100 percent back-up. However, one should

note that in mid-1995, total M3 equals to HK$ 2244 billion, which is more than five

times bigger than the assets in the Fund. 46.2 percent of this M3 is in bank deposits

denominated in foreign money. 13Suppose people decide to change the portfolio of M3

by exchanging    HK dollar deposits for foreign money. If the change is big enough, the

banking sector must sell its domestic assets for foreign money to avoid bank runs. It is

not clear whether the Fund is willing to buy these domestic                assets. However,      the

Exchange Fund Ordinance does allow the Financial Secretary the flexibility to do so

even though      Hong Kong’s moneta~         institution is a currency board. 14 Suppose the

Exchange Fund will indeed provide the foreign liquidity to avoid bank runs. If people

decide to increase their foreign exchange holdings from 46.2 percent to 53 percent of

M3, the accumulated earnings in the balance sheet of the Fund will disappear. If the

foreign deposits ratio goes up further to 59.4 percent, dl the fiscal reserve will also be

used up,




      These rather simplistic calculations tell us that a run on the Hong Kong dollar

could occur even when the change in people’s portfolio holdings is not exceptionally

big. We do not have an estimate of the portfolio holdings as a function of other

vmiables. However, one can reasonably speculate that the confidence in the HK dollar

14
     The Exchange Fund Ordinance, Section 3 (2), states that “The Fund, or any part of it, may k
  held in Hong Kong currency or in foreign exchange or in gold or in silver or may be invested by the
  Financial Secretary in such securities or other assets as he, after having consulted the Exchange
  Fund Advisory Committee, considers appropriate.” (Hong Kong Monetary Authority (1994), p, 5 1).

                                                 21
will suffer significantly and the link will face a crisis if the fiscal reserve is completely

used up.

     The amount of fiscal reserve is affected by shocks to the economy. Since the Hong

Kong government      has been following a reasonably stable fiscal policy, we focus oLlr

attention on supply shocks here. How big are the supply shocks if the fiscal reserve is

to be eliminated?    This can be answered by making use of the empirical estimates in

this paper.

      The long-run impulse response of the logarithm of y(t) with respect to a supply

shock of one standard deviation is 0.0143. This means that a one-standard-deviation

shock will reduce output permanently by 1.43 percent, other things being equal. Thus,

we can calculate the post-shock output level y(t)* by the formula

     y(t)* = (1 - 0.0143X) y(f)

for a supply shock of x standard deviations. Similarly for K periods of negative supply

shocks, each of size x, the post-shoc,k output level should be

     y(t) * = (1 - 010143X)Ky([)




     In Table 8, we calculate the percentages, 100 (y(t)*/ y(t)), for x = 1,2,3,4 and K =

1,2,...,.8. From data of 1985-1994, the average ratios of total government expenditure

and revenue to GDP are 16 percent and 16.8 percent, respectively. 15We assume that

the revenue ratio is fixed. Post-shock revenue is

     0.168y(t)* = [0.168 (1 - 0.0143x)~] y(t).

Thus, the effect of the supply shock on revenue is equivalent to a “tax-cut” with the

new, effective tax rate being      the term inside the square brackets above. These are

                                               22
shown in Table 9. From GDP data, we can infer that each percentage point decline in

the revenue-output   ratio will reduce revenue by HK$ 12 billion. Making use of Table

8, one can come up with results in different scenarios. For example, if there are

negative 3-standard-deviation    supply shocks lasting for two years, then the loss in

revenue every year will be approximately     HK$ 51.6 billion. It only takes about three

years for the fiscal reserve to be completely depleted if political pressures prohibit the

government from reducing its expenditures accordingly. Since major historical changes

in Hong Kong’s future are upcoming,        large negative supply shocks or perhaps even

significant structural shifts in the transition period cannot be ruled out. The stability of

the currency board system in the future has yet to be tested.

     Currency crises can lead to bank runs. But bank runs can occur because of other

reasons too. Since the typical currency board does not provide a lender of last resort,

bank runs are often regarded as the Achilles Heel of the system. Indeed banking crises

did occur in Hong Kong a number of times, all during the currency board years. The

government and the banking system resorted to several ways to deal with them.

     In 1994 there were 180 licensed banks in Hong Kong, 16 of which were owned

mostly by local shareholders     (Hong Kong Monetary         Authority,   1994, p. 90-91).

Government policies towards runs on local and foreign banks seemed to be different. It

did not attempt to support the Citibank in 1991 when rumors caused a short-lived run,

nor did it try to rescue the Bank of Credit and Commerce International’s       Hong Kong

branch before its collapse in the same year. However, it moved to take over two small

local banks in the mid 1960s and three more in the period of 1982-86. It also provided

some emergency funds to support five banks in the same period, four of which were

later acquired by others. The note-issuing        banks also played an important     role in




                                             23
cushioning the shocks from the runs. They supported one bank in 1961, three in 1965-

66, and took over three more in the same period.           Thus, in the 1960s, the government

was relying mainly on the financially strong note-issuing banks to either lend to or take

over the troubled local banks. In more recent years, the government seemed to have

resorted to the Exchange Fund for playing the role of lender of last resort. ]GThis is

another reason to say that some of the features of a currency board have been diluted

in Hong Kong.




5. What Can We Learn From Hong Kong’s Experience?

     The performance       of the currency board in Hong Kong has not been bad so far.

Although it may have lowered output growth, inflation has also gone down. In fact,

the more revealing results from the counter-factual          exercises concern stability. When

both regimes are subject to the same exogenous shocks, output and prices are less

volatile under currency board.

      The stability result is not general. Simulations on impulse responses show that

output is less sensitive to supply shocks under currency board than under free-floating.

On the other hand, demand shocks can cause stronger short-term volatility in output in

a currency board system. The relative stability in output in Hong Kong to a large

extent must have come from the government’s self-discipline in fiscal policy, which is

based on two rules: balanced budget or small surplus, and keeping government                     size




16   See Jao (1993, Chap. 13) and Ho et al (1991, Chap.1) for more details about banking crises in
  Hong Kong.


                                                 24
small. Other countries      without a stable rule-based fiscal policy may not do well to

reduce output volatility even if they have currency boards. *7

     The fiscal restraint not only affects output stability, but also the credibility of the

exchange rate system. A weakness of the currency board system is that people may

doubt     the determination       and capability     of the government          to maintain     perfect

convertibility at the specified rate. The conservative fiscal policy has been instrumental

in creating surpluses for almost every budgetary year. Without the significant fiscal

reserve, confidence in the Hong Kong dollar may suffer. In recent years, since the

Exchange Fund has been acting as if it could be the lender of last resort, its financial

strength which is partly supported by a large fiscal reserve is all the more important.

Perhaps a reason why fiscal policy in Hong Kong is coordinated                    with its monetary

system is that the Financial Secretary has the authority to control both.

        Despite the financial strength of the Exchange Fund, the Hong Kong dollar has

occasionally been subject to considerable speculative pressure. For example, in mid-

Janu~        1995, the Hong Kong dollar depreciated              0.4 percent briefly. In all such

occasions,     the speculations    have been effectively countered          (Hong Kong Monetary

Authority     (1995)).   Given     the excellent      track   records,   do people      have    enough

confidence     in the Hong Kong dollar? As mentioned           in Section   4.4, 46.2 percent       of M3

is in deposits   denominated      in foreign   currency.   This large portion    is an indication     that




17
        The Financial Secretary of Hong Kong last year articulated his commitment to the non-
  interventionist rule-based fiscal policy by referring to a story in Greek mythology. The half-bird
  half-lady Sirens sang so beautifully that all sailors who heard them would dive into the sea and try
  to swim to them, only to drown and die at their feet. He said that he would tie himself to the mast of
  the ship when he heard them singing. See Tsang (1995).


                                                    25
people only have limited confidence in the future of the Hong Kong dollar, in spite of

all the assurance that the government has provided.

      Should other countries adopt the currency board system? The above analysis

indicates that the decent performance in Hong Kong has been due to a combination of

favorable factors, and yet, the possibility of monetary collapse cannot be ruled out.   It

is doubtful that too many countries have equal or better conditions.
