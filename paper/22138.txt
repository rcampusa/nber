                                          ABSTRACT

A large and growing number of countries participate in multiple preferential trade agreements
(PTAs), which increasingly entail broad cooperation over policies extending far beyond trade
barriers. I review the traditional and non-traditional motives for PTAs and their empirical
determinants as well as their impacts on trade and on multilateral liberalization. I argue that the
broad nature of modern PTAs, their substantial creation of bilateral trade and their modest effects
on members’ tariffs, require us to augment the economic and policy structure of traditional
models of PTAs as a static preferential tariff reduction. Throughout I draw lessons from the
existing literature and point towards many interesting paths for future research, to advance our
understanding of the causes of modern PTAs and their impacts on trade related outcomes and
beyond.

1. Introduction

        In 2010 the number of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) in force was four times higher than in
1990. The participation in PTAs is widespread: in 2010 each member of the World Trade Organization also
participated in an average of 13 PTAs, up from only 2 in 1990 (WTO, 2011). This trend, the negotiation of
mega-agreements by the U.S. and Europe and the evidence discussed below, indicate that PTAs are the most
important source of trade policy reform in the last 20 years for most countries.
        In figure 1 we see that the proliferation of PTAs has continued after the creation of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in a period when non-preferential MFN tariffs were declining. Some of the largest
growth has occurred in the last five years even though average MFN tariffs are at their lowest, averaging
less than 8% in 2009. The traditional Vinerian view of PTAs, and most of the economic analysis, treats them
as a static reduction in tariffs with respect to a preferential partner. But if the initial tariffs are already low
then so is the preferential tariff margin, which raises two basic questions. What explains the formation and
proliferation of so many PTAs and what are their basic trade and welfare effects on members?

        To answer these two questions I first provide some stylized facts about the importance and
evolution of trade between PTA members. Their share of world trade almost tripled between 1965-2010,
with “deeper” PTAs becoming increasingly more important. A detailed examination of the provisions of
modern PTAs in 2011 reveals policy cooperation far beyond reductions in applied tariffs. I provide a
taxonomy of PTAs in terms of policy depth and breadth, where the latter includes economic and non-
economic provisions. Some of these provisions also evolved over time in the context of the GATT/WTO and
others go far beyond it.
        Despite the diverse nature of these agreements, they share one common feature, a policy that aims
to increase market access for at least one member. Therefore in section 3 I examine if PTAs cause increases
in bilateral trade between members. After discussing the methodological issues associated with these
                                                    1
estimates I conclude that, when properly estimated, these effects are large on average; possibly too large
to be explained by the observed preferential tariff reductions on final goods. Moreover, the effects are
heterogeneous across PTAs, even after controlling for tariffs, and increasing up to 10 years after the
agreement, suggesting a gradual or dynamic effect. From the perspective of the traditional view of PTAs as
static tariff reductions these facts appear puzzling since the observed tariff reductions are modest, as the
evidence shows for PTAs since 1990. I describe what features of a richer economic and policy setting would
explain the “puzzle”, including some that generate a trade elasticity that varies with the policy.
         In section 4 I examine specific economic motives and effects of deeper PTAs, which address trade
policies beyond tariffs and aim to integrate production structures across countries. These features of recent
deeper PTAs augment the economic and policy structure relative to the traditional view in a way that can
help to explain the estimated aggregate trade effects. I argue the trade policy structure should be
augmented to incorporate current non-tariff barriers and also uncertainty about future policies, where the
latter is particularly important in the context of dynamic models with export investments. I then review
recent evidence that shows PTAs continue to serve an important market access role even if current tariffs
and non-tariff barriers were zero. The evidence suggests that certain PTAs can credibly secure market
access relative to that obtained in the context of WTO and thus serve as insurance against trade wars during
large crisis. The trade elasticity with respect to uncertain preferences on the other hand is negligible, which
can partly explain the heterogeneous trade effects of PTAs.
         Another insight from section 4 is that certain important dimensions of deeper trade policy
cooperation are measurable and contain sufficient variation to identify interesting impacts of PTAs. 1 Doing
so helps bridge the extreme gap between most of the current theory (and quantitative work), which models
only applied tariff changes and constant trade elasticity, and the empirical research that estimates average
treatment effects using a PTA dummy.
         A substantial fraction of trade takes the form of intermediate goods. Moreover, one stated reason
for PTAs is to allow members to re-organize the production process across countries more efficiently. In
section 4 I discuss recent empirical work on PTAs where intermediate good linkages can generate
additional trade effects relative to the traditional view that focuses on final goods. This occurs for example
due to multiple border crossings, which translate into higher trade elasticities when protection is low.
         In section 5 I address two questions. First, what are the motives for PTAs and the evidence for the
mechanisms underlying them? Second, what are the empirical determinants of the formation of PTAs and
their policies? I start in section 5.1 by reviewing the standard trade off in the context of traditional PTAs
and the evidence on the mechanisms behind them: trade creation, diversion and terms-of-trade effects. I
then describe some non-traditional motives for PTAs. These motives reflect political-economy
considerations and international bargaining externalities, as well as some provisions in PTAs documented
in section 2, both economic (e.g. FDI, technology diffusion) and non-economic (e.g. environment, human
rights, conflict, democracy). I describe the still scant evidence for some mechanisms underlying these non-
traditional motives.

         In section 5.2 I review the empirical determinants of (i) PTAs between pairs of countries and (ii)
endogenous preferential tariff levels. The potential for bilateral trade plays an important role in the
probability of PTA formation, which confirms the importance of addressing endogeneity in gravity
estimates. There is suggestive evidence that trade diversion also plays a role but causality is not yet
established; this and other aspects of the determinants of PTAs remain fertile ground for research. One
promising avenue is to explore preferential tariffs and other product level policy data. This may allow us to
test sharper predictions, establish causal effects and identify certain structural parameters that may be
used to quantify interesting counterfactuals.
         In Figure 1 we see not only that PTAs continued to proliferate after the creation of the WTO but also
that no major multilateral trade negotiation has succeeded since. The Doha Round was launched six years
after the creation of the WTO and it is yet to be concluded. WTO membership has continued to expand and
this along with the expansion of PTAs implies that a large fraction of trade between WTO members is
between preferential groups. The fraction of country pairs in the WTO that also belong to PTAs increased
by a factor of 10 in that period and in 2010 they accounted for over 50% of trade between WTO members,
even if not all is done under preferential tariffs. This raises the question of how preferential and
multilateral agreements and policies interact, which I analyze in section 6.
         A similar interdependence question arose in the early 1990’s when PTAs started to proliferate
while the Uruguay Round stalled. This generated a number of important theoretical insights. Some have
implications for the equilibrium structure of agreements, which are hard to test empirically. An alternative
approach focuses on estimating the implications of the theory for preferential tariffs and how they change
the incentives to apply tariffs against non-members. I conclude that the existing empirical research has
provided important insights on the effects of preferences on protection against non-members. This should
be complemented with further analysis of the incentives to change deeper policy cooperation, e.g.
uncertainty and non-tariff barriers. These deeper policy dimensions are increasingly important
determinants of trade and thus of the potential of PTAs to affect non-members.
         The long-standing importance of PTAs in the trading system has generated a number of important
contributions that review them. Baldwin and Venables (1995) provide a comprehensive analysis of the
allocation, accumulation and location effects of regional integration. Some of their insights from economic
geography models are still relevant and I will not attempt to update them. They also discuss some
systematic implications of PTAs for the multilateral trading system but since then there have been
considerable theoretical and empirical advances---some reviewed by Freund and Ornelas (2010) and also
in this chapter. Krishna (2008) reviews the theoretical literature focusing on static impacts of PTAs, mostly
in a Vinerian setting, which I do not address except to place more recent work in context. WTO (2011)
provides interesting analysis on the nature and motives of recent PTAs. Bagwell et al (Forthcoming), Maggi
(2014) and Grossman (2016) review the literature on trade agreements more generally with some
reference to PTAs as well but do not address some of the core issues in this chapter, such as the trade effects
and empirical determinants of PTAs.
         Given the breadth of the chapter and diversity of agreements considered several conclusions are
qualified. But there are some important lessons and guidance for future research, which I highlight
throughout the chapter and in the final section. Befitting this interesting and important topic the main
conclusion is that we have learned much about PTAs from recent research but many interesting questions

                                                      3
remain to be addressed using existing and new theoretical, empirical and quantitative approaches. The
online appendix describes the data and programs available to replicate and extend the empirical analysis. 2

2. Stylized Facts and a Taxonomy

         We start by defining a PTA and providing some stylized facts about them based on a common
classification that emphasizes differences in the extent of trade preferences. We then analyze a rich dataset
of characteristics of modern PTAs. We use it to propose two key dimensions along which to classify these
agreements: policy depth and breadth, where the latter includes economic and non-economic issues. We
argue that these dimensions are salient and useful in framing and organizing the current analysis discussed
in this chapter and in pointing the way for future research.

2.1    A definition
        The nature of PTAs’ membership, issue areas, policy coverage and depth is diverse and rapidly
evolving. Therefore any attempt at a taxonomy requires a broadly defined domain under which existing
agreements fit and flexible sub domains to accommodate any new PTAs. Accordingly, I will use the
following definition:

      A PTA is an international treaty with restrictive membership and including any articles that (i) apply
      only to its members and (ii) aim to secure or increase their respective market access.

         The requirement that some articles of the treaty apply only to the members emphasizes the
discriminatory nature of PTAs. The requirement that the aim of some of those policies is to improve market
access for goods or services excludes agreements with policies that affect trade but do not aim to improve
market access (e.g. the Montreal Protocol and its ban on products containing CFCs; or bilateral agreements
focusing solely on investment or intellectual property rights). The definition allows for agreements that
include non-trade related policies provided they also include policies aimed at improving market access for
at least one member.
         The restrictive membership requirement reflects accession constraints and excludes agreements
with open membership rules, such as the WTO. 3 The nature of accession restrictions that characterizes
PTAs is varied. In some cases the restrictions are regional (e.g. European Union, North American FTA) but
increasing numbers of PTAs are transcontinental. In other cases they are related to income, e.g. concessions
under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) apply only to developing countries. In contrast, any
state or independent customs territory is eligible to accede to the WTO (Article XII, WTO) and a similar rule
applied under GATT. While eligibility does not guarantee membership in the WTO, no other international
treaty that satisfies the rest of the definition above has this type of open membership; and if any were to
adopt it then eventually it may no longer be able to discriminate (e.g. if it achieves universal membership)
and thus it should not be defined as preferential. 4

3 There are other differences between the WTO and PTAs but also similarities, which we discuss in the appendix.
4 Some agreements such as APEC have considered but not adopted open membership (cf. Bergsten, 1996).

                                                        4
       Our definition encompasses the narrower view of a PTA as an exception to WTO’s Article I---MFN-
--whereby a WTO member is expected not to discriminate against others (cf. Bagwell and Staiger, 2002).
PTAs are then defined as exceptions to MFN allowed by either Article XXIV, which allows subsets of
countries to reciprocally set tariffs below MFN values if they are set to zero on substantially all trade, or the
enabling clause, which does not place those restrictions on developing countries.
       Our definition encompasses a broader set of agreements that include (i) policies regardless of their
MFN status, which is useful because PTAs address policies not negotiated in the WTO, and (ii) countries
regardless of their GATT/WTO membership, which is useful because that membership is only recently
becoming universal and even in 2010 about 10% of trade between PTA pairs included at least one non-
WTO member. 5

2.2   Common classification of PTAs and their evolution over time
       Our definition encompasses the common sub classifications of PTAs proposed by Frankel et al
(1997), which are commonly used to code such agreements, e.g. by Baier et al (2014), into the following
mutually exclusive groups: 6
      Non-reciprocal PTAs (NRPTA), providing one way preferential tariffs, e.g. the GSP.

        Reciprocal PTAs (RPTA) providing two-way preferences on only part of the trade, e.g. the Latin
       American free trade area started in 1960.
        Free trade areas (FTA), providing two-way preferences and eliminating tariffs on a substantial
       part of the trade, e.g. NAFTA.
        Customs Unions (CU), which are FTAs with common external tariffs , e.g. Mercosur, Turkey-EU.
        Common markets (CM) such as the European Union, which adds freer movement of capital and
       labor to a CU.
        Economic Unions (EU), which are CM with additional monetary and fiscal policy coordination
       such as the Economic and Monetary Union of Central Africa (1999) and the Euro area countries.
         This classification was constructed in a way that suggests increasing economic integration as we
progress from non-reciprocal or shallow reciprocal agreements to FTAs and CM. We can then calculate the
share of world trade accounted for by the bilateral pairs in each type of agreement. Given the small number
of agreements in the last three categories I follow Baier et al (2014) for now and aggregate them into a
single group. The share of world trade between pairs of countries that had any of these PTAs rose from
around 22% in 1965 to 60% in 2010. The breakdown for each of the four sub-categories is shown in figure
2 at 5 year intervals. I note the following key points:




5 In the online appendix we show the evolution of trade shares by PTA and WTO membership. In 2010 trade between
pairs of countries with a PTA was 55% if both were WTO members and 5% otherwise.
6 The latest version of that data, which is used below is at www3.nd.edu/~jbergstr/DataEIAsSeptember2015 .

                                                       5
        Non-reciprocal PTAs’ trade increased in the 1970’s, partially as a result of Special and Differential
       treatment (cf. Ornelas, 2016), declined in the 1980’s and stabilized since the 1990’s around 10%. 7
        Reciprocal PTAs’ trade is small throughout and its relative importance declines between 1980-
       2000, and increases since then, partly due to an increase in their number.
        FTAs’ trade shows a large increase from 3.5% in 1965 to 22.5% in 2010.
        CU-CM-EU has the largest share through the whole period, partly due to the large amount of intra-
       EU trade. That share increased from about 14 to 24%.
        Based on trade shares, it is clear that since the mid 1980’s there has been a sharp increase in the
relative importance of “deeper” PTAs. This increase is at least partially due to the fact that FTAs have
become more prevalent and membership in CM has expanded. At the start of our sample the European
Union included only the six founding members, by 1995 it included 15 and then 27 in 2010. More generally,
the fraction of country pairs with any PTA that have either an FTA or CM has increased substantially: from
about 1/8 in 1985 to 1/3 by 2010. 8

        Using this data we can start to classify PTAs along their policy depth and breadth. The trade policy
that defines depth in this data is almost solely applied tariffs and whether they are applied only to one
member (NRPTA) or both (RPTA); whether that tariff is zero on most goods (FTA) and whether members
set a common external tariff (CU). This reflects the traditional Vinerian view of PTAs. These are useful
measures of depth but they are increasingly insufficient as MFN tariffs are lowered and the focus switches
to other policies. There are many aspects of a common market, some of which I will classify under deeper
cooperation (e.g. behind-the-border policies that affect trade), and others as broader cooperation, e.g. the




7 These values include all exports that the beneficiary country makes to the preference granting country, regardless
of whether they obtain a preference so it overestimates the share of preferential trade.
8 We could further summarize the evolution of PTAs by economic development of partners, location, participation in

other agreements, colonial or language ties, etc. For these and other interesting facts pertaining to the characterization
of PTAs, we refer the reader to WTO (2011). We will examine the determinants of PTA formation in section 5.
                                                               6
movement of factors. An increasingly large number of agreements that fall between the common
classification of an FTA and a CM and sometimes beyond them and thus below I propose augmenting this
common classification along the depth and breadth dimensions.

2.3     A taxonomy of “modern” PTAs
        I now use data on different provisions contained in modern PTAs to provide a more detailed
taxonomy and identify the prevalence of certain features that may warrant future research.
        The data were originally compiled by Horn et al (2010) to analyze the precise content of 28
agreements that either the US or EU signed with WTO members up to 2008 that fell under Art. XXIV of the
GATT or Art. V of GATS. The data were subsequently extended by the WTO to cover 100 agreements
including non-WTO members through 2011. 9 The 52 types of provisions identified by the authors are listed
in Table A1 of the appendix. Horn et al classified the policy areas as already included in the WTO in some
form (WTO+) or qualitatively new (WTO-X) and then according to their legal enforceability. These are
useful classifications given the extensive research on the WTO and can help to highlight what its members
may be looking for in PTAs. However, for the purposes of the chapter and future research I have grouped
the policy areas into different depth and breadth classifications that I will describe and use.
        In generating the taxonomy from this rich set of variables, I was broadly guided by the following
considerations. First, the evolution of the GATT/WTO in terms of policy depth and breadth described in
detail in the online appendix; second, my own reading from this data and other information about
important developments in recent PTAs; third, the economic similarity and relevance of different
dimensions; and fourth, an attempt to encompass the traditional classification of PTAs and to extend it in
terms of finer depth categories and broader policy cooperation.
        An agreement is defined as a PTA if a subset of its policies affects the market access of either
country. So the first step, and main focus below, is to argue for the economic relevance of each level of policy
depth and breadth in affecting market access.
    •    Depth in economic policy cooperation
        The most obvious element of policy depth that affects market access is tariffs---the lower they are
the deeper the level of bilateral economic cooperation. This is the reasoning behind separating reciprocal
PTAs and FTAs. While trade agreements typically start by addressing applied tariffs, they eventually tackle
other policies (as was the case with GATT). To characterize the depth of cooperation we divide policies into
four groups, πd= {τ, ν, γ, o}, where

anatomy_ptas_e.xls. Dür et al (2014) provide an even more comprehensive coverage of agreements, including their
features and sector coverage.

       τ import tariffs: applied or bindings

       ν non-tariff barriers

      - contingent protection: e.g. anti-dumping, countervailing measures, export taxes

      - other: product standards, customs procedures and other technical barriers.

       γ gov’t policies behind the border not included in ν that may invalidate national treatment

      - state aid, procurement, competition policy

       o other policies that may affect market access but can also have direct effects
      - regional, industrial, agricultural cooperation, financial assistance

         Is there a meaningful way in which these policies can be ranked in terms of depth of cooperation?
In some cases the answer is clearly yes. Cooperation is deeper in an agreement that not only specifies a zero
tariff today but also binds it at a maximum level forever. In other cases it is less obvious so we now provide
some discussion of this point.
         How prevalent are the non-tariff barriers (NTBs) included in ν and do they represent deeper
cooperation? As tariffs fall, other barriers become more salient, so if PTAs also tackle certain NTBs, then it
is reasonable to claim they involve deeper policy cooperation. Among the easiest of the NTBs to identify
and address are customs procedures for shipment inspection, which can explain why 93% of the PTAs in
the sample explicitly addressed it. Others, such as different types of contingent protection, may not be as
simple. Still 86% of PTAs address AD in some way and 72% address the use of duties to countervail
subsidies.
         Countries can also use product standards as non-tariff barriers to trade. Countries often have
different product standards, e.g. criteria for a particular classification of a good, health safety requirements,
etc. Some are designed for consumer protection but they can also be used to discriminate against foreign
producers either explicitly or implicitly (e.g. by requiring additional testing). Countries can thus decide to
harmonize or mutually recognize their standards, which is a central issue in the TTIP negotiations. 10 Doing
so is harder than reducing tariffs both since different standards can reflect different preferences (e.g.
genetically modified food in US vs. EU) and because it is harder to verify if a standard is enforced differently
on domestic and foreign goods. This may explain why only 60% of PTAs in 2011 addressed any standards.
         After a foreign product crosses the border government policy may still treat it differently from
national products. One obvious policy would be differential enforcement of a product standard, which we
include in ν. In γ, we include other policies that may also impair national treatment and market access.
Some of these reduce expected trade costs, e.g. establishing/maintaining non-discriminatory competition
policy, possibly by an independent authority, as done in 63% of PTAs. Others increase expected demand by
providing information on state aid (59%) to enterprises and regulating public procurement (53%). Some




10 This can reflect both gains from cooperation (reduce protection substitution) and coordination (minimize

duplication of costs to meet similar standards in the markets). See Ederington and Ruta (2016) for a detailed analysis.
                                                          8
 of these provisions may also reflect a commitment motive by governments attempting to address time-
 consistency or political economy constraints, as we discuss in section 5.1.
         Cooperation along other dimensions may also affect market access or government objectives
 directly. We include these in the “other” category, o, (e.g. regional, industrial and agricultural cooperation
 and financial assistance). Their prevalence is still relatively low ranging from 1 to 32% of PTAs depending
 on the policy.

              Notes: Share of agreements that address different combinations of depth and breadth.
              Author's calculations from data in World Trade Report (2011).


          To summarize the current prevalence of each of these four groups of policies we need a metric to
 aggregate the categories. In the first column of Table 1, rows 1-4, we ask what fraction of PTAs address
 tariffs and at least one of the policies in each of the other categories. So, 100% of the PTAs address at least
 one tariff related policy, 98% address tariffs and any of the policies in ν, 89% address tariffs and any of the
 policies in γ, and 60% tariffs and policies in o. The last row shows that 56% of PTAs addressed tariffs and
 at least one of the policies in each and every one of the subgroups. 11
          Within each of the policy groups there is an additional dimension of depth worth noting: whether
 the PTA addresses only the current or also the expected policy. Certain PTAs not only reduce current tariffs
 they set them to zero in all goods, which may reduce uncertainty about future protection. Constraints on
 certain NTBs, e.g. contingent protection, may also be motivated by concerns with reducing future policy
 uncertainty. The same can be said of procurement and competition policy since the agreements don’t
 specify that specific current government procurement contracts must be directed to a member but rather
 set out rules for how to address such situations in the future. The impact of deeper PTAs that can credibly
 reduce uncertainty about future policy is examined in section 4.
        •      Breadth in economic policy cooperation
               To span the breadth of economic policy cooperation I divide policies by their impacts on:




 11   The reader can use the online data to calculate the average prevalence of other groups of policies in PTAs.
                                                               9
          Type of trade: Goods and services.

          Technology: Innovation and diffusion, Intellectual property.

          Factors of production: Investment/capital and labor.
         PTAs have historically liberalized trade in goods first, as did the GATT/WTO. 12 But currently both
the WTO and 63% of PTAs include provisions for expanding market access in services.
         Broadening PTAs to include trade in services has clear implications for market access. The
implications of including policies relating to technology and the factors of production are less obvious. But
it is conceivable that they affect market access, and since they can also have other direct effects on
members’ economies we believe they are important dimensions of the breadth of cooperation.
         About 79% of PTAs include some provision regarding technology, which I divide into intellectual
property and innovation/diffusion. Among the prominent examples of the latter are provisions that
promote technology transfer; joint research projects; exchange of researchers and development of public-
private partnerships. About 43% of the PTAs include at least some innovation and diffusion provision so
one could explore this variation to examine if those agreements tend to generate stronger dynamic gains
in the form of increases in R&D and/or productivity. Intellectual property right protection clauses are now
part of 61% of PTAs either in a form similar to the WTO or beyond it. 13
         The factor of production categories capture either investment or labor provisions. Currently, 76%
of PTAs include at least one provision related to investment such as (i) the liberalization of capital
movement and prohibition of new restrictions (58%) and (ii) requirements for local content and export
performance of FDI (45%).
         Only 58% of PTAs address labor market provisions, which include any of the following: illegal
immigration (9%) or labor market regulations, visa and asylum, coordination of social security, each
included in around 25% of PTAs.
         The final column of the table shows that 42% of PTAs in 2011 addressed at least one of the policies
in each one of the groups: goods, services, technology, investment and labor.
     •    Complementarity of depth and economic breadth
        An interesting question related to our taxonomy is how economic depth and breadth interact. In
particular, is policy cooperation depth as we define it shallower if the agreement is broader? This is possible
if negotiation and enforcement resources are scarce for example. The data suggests that the opposite is
true. The probability that an agreement addresses services issues increases steadily from 63% as we move
down to include additional depth in policies, all the way to 73%. This complementarity is present for each
of the breadth categories. Overall the unconditional probability of the broadest agreement is 42% but it
increases to 55% if we condition on it being deepest.




12In specific agreements, e.g. the EEC, we also know that industrial goods are covered before agriculture.
13The impact of IPR on market access as measured in terms of export value is typically ambiguous. But from the
perspective of a developed exporting country with large number of firms with patented products, IPR protection in
the foreign market is valuable. For a detailed discussion of IPR see chapter 16.
                                                       10
        It would be interesting to have a theory of the design and evolution of cooperation in agreements
that explains the interaction between these dimensions of economic depth and breadth.
     •    Breadth in non-economic policy cooperation
          Using this data we also obtain the prevalence in PTAs of the following “non-economic” issues:

          Environmental laws (46%) and health (10%)

          Human rights (14%) and political dialogue (14%)

          Illicit drugs (13%), money laundering (12%) and terrorism (6%).

         The exact description of each of these categories is provided in Table A1 where we also show
whether those provisions are legally enforceable. 14 Provisions on environmental laws are enforceable in
35% of the cases where they are included but those on human rights, health or illicit drugs are not.
Moreover, the US is involved in all the agreements that have legally enforceable environmental provisions.
In contrast to these, provisions on the movement of capital and investment are legally enforceable in 98%
of agreements where they are included. Whether a clause is legally enforceable is not a necessary or
sufficient condition in determining if the agreement affects the relevant issue. So, given the potential
importance of these non-economic issues, future research should examine if they are affected by PTAs.
         In contrast to the complementarity we observed between depth and economic breadth, we find
some substitutability between depth and non-economic breadth. The unconditional probability of a PTA
including non-economic areas in 2011 is 56% but it drops on 23% if we condition on policy being deepest
(i.e. on agreement addressing tariffs, non-tariff, government policies on procurement and other). In section
5.1 we discuss how issues with non-pecuniary externalities, such as the ones above, may provide a rationale
for trade preferences.

2.4      Trends in modern PTAs
        We provided a snapshot of PTAs in 2011. In the online appendix we graph the evolution of the share
of PTAs with different provisions since 1991. Here we point to a few key points. In terms of the depth the
most important trend is the increased prevalence of provisions addressing contingent protection, product
standards and public procurement. In terms of economic breadth, since 2000 there has been an increase
in service provisions and labor market regulations. Finally, in terms of non-economic areas we see
increases in environmental laws from less than 30% to almost 50% and also in human rights and illicit
drugs.
     •    Emerging dimensions and complementary data
       The data we explore in this section is rich and allows for an improved taxonomy relative to the
common classification. Our understanding of PTAs will be further improved if the data is extended to more
PTAs and complemented with information about current and emerging important dimensions in PTAs.




14 For example, environmental laws include: development of standards; enforcement of national laws; establishment
of sanctions for violation of environmental laws; publications of laws and regulation.
                                                       11
        First, we can complement this with data on common currency to include an additional dimension
of breadth. We can also complement the depth dimension and further refine the tariff classification
according to whether the agreement is reciprocal, an FTA or Customs Union.
        Second, the policy depth of trade policy focuses on measures affecting final goods. Going forward,
it is important to collect data on policy breadth related to trade in intermediate goods. The continuing
slicing of the production chain to take advantage of economies of scale and/or cost differentials is a
potentially important motive for PTAs. Thus incorporating policies that affect trade in intermediates is
important. Some such data is available: rules of origin can affect whether a good is eligible for a preference
and variation in such rules (such as ability to accumulate value added shares across members) can be used
to explore the impact of these agreements. We return to this in section 4 15
        Additional information would also be useful on policies that affect multinational investment and
incentives for arms-length trade. These include any rules on transfer pricing and taxation of profits as well
as on investment dispute systems, which are controversial items proposed in the TTP and TTIP.

2.5     Stylized facts
In this section we provided a few stylized facts, some of which help guide subsequent analysis, namely:

      1. The large and growing trade share of bilateral “deeper” PTAs in world trade. The growing number
         of bilateral PTAs has translated into an increase in the share of world trade between their members
         from 22% in 1965 to 60% in 2010. Moreover, FTAs and customs and economic unions have become
         relatively more important, particularly since the mid 1980’s.
      2. The large and growing interdependence across agreements. The share of WTO country pairs with
         PTAs rose from 2% in 1965 to over 25% in 2010 and their corresponding trade share within the
         WTO rose from 30% to 60% in that period. Moreover, there has been an increase in the overlap of
         PTA memberships for any given country.
      3. The deep, broad and heterogeneous cooperation in modern PTAs. Most recent PTAs go far beyond
         applied tariff reductions on goods. Policy depth tends to be higher in agreements with broader
         cooperation in economic issues but not in non-economic ones. Moreover there is heterogeneity
         across and within PTAs in the legal enforceability of different provisions.

         Fact 1, along with the primacy of preferential market access in the definition of PTAs, explains the
main focus in section 3: to identify if PTAs increase bilateral market access. Most research focuses on
identifying an average trade effect, but Fact 1 suggests this effect is heterogeneous across agreements. The
traditional/Vinerian view of PTAs predicts that any trade effects and any heterogeneity in these is caused
by differences in applied tariffs, so section 3 also examines if these can explain the full trade effect of PTAs
or its heterogeneity.
         Fact 3 points to the many other policy dimensions in modern PTAs. In section 4 we study how some
of the deeper policy cooperation affects firm decisions to trade. In section 5 we discuss some evidence of




15 Other instruments may not yet be used but could in the future. For example, the increased data on value added trade

may eventually lead governments to consider charging tariffs on net rather than gross value.
                                                         12
the effects of PTAs on certain non-trade outcomes. The taxonomy I provide may also help group provisions
to characterize why PTA have heterogeneous trade effects, as we discuss in section 3. The rich set of
provisions and their enforceability may also be useful in future research to test sharper predictions about
the effects of PTAs on outcomes beyond aggregate trade including innovation, FDI, labor outcomes.
        Fact 2 provides one motivation for studying the determinants of the formation of PTAs in section 5
and the interdependence between agreements in section 6.
        This section highlights one additional feature worthy of future research: the expansion and
evolution of cooperation in trade agreements. Both multilateral agreements (WTO) and PTAs, e.g. the EU,
have experienced significant increases in membership; policy depth; and breadth. Similar evolution in the
depth and breadth of policy are present in PTAs signed by the US over time. To my knowledge there is no
theory of the evolution of cooperation along these dimensions, e.g. why are applied tariffs tackled first, then
NTBs and eventually broader policies. Such a theory could help us understand (i) the limits of cooperation
within the WTO and thus some of the incentives to form PTAs as well as their key features, which could also
help explain facts 2 and 3. 16

3. Trade and welfare effects on members

        A central feature of a PTA is that certain policies aim to increase market access between its
members. Therefore our starting point is to examine estimates of the trade effects of PTAs on their
members. I start with ex-post estimates of bilateral PTAs that rely on gravity estimation and highlight two
apparent puzzles generated by them. First, why did PTA formation explode in the last 20 years when until
the early 2000’s the estimates of trade effects were very heterogeneous and in some cases modest---the
PTA formation puzzle. 17 I discuss how the econometric resolution of this puzzle generated long-run
estimates that are in some cases so large that they raise a different one: whether PTAs can create so much
bilateral trade given the observed levels of trade barriers---what I refer to as the PTA trade elasticity puzzle.
        I discuss evidence that the PTA effect is particularly large for a certain class of deeper and broader
agreements, suggesting it captures more than a standard static tariff reduction. Novel evidence indicates
that controlling for bilateral tariff changes only reduces PTA effects slightly and that PTAs themselves have
only a modest effect in reducing applied tariffs for member countries. I then discuss additional mechanisms
that may be able to explain the PTA trade elasticity puzzle. Section 4 examines some of these mechanisms
in detail.
        I provide gravity estimates for PTAs in 1965-2010 within a unified data set where we can examine
the importance of alternative econometric approaches and assumptions. I do so while controlling for WTO
membership and also discuss the WTO estimates in the literature, which are interesting in their own right
and also a reference point for the effects of PTAs. The data and programs are available for the reader to
explore and test alternative hypothesis.
        I conclude the section by briefly reviewing structural general equilibrium estimates of PTAs on
trade and welfare of its members from new quantitative trade models and traditional CGE applications.




16   One interesting path is to model agreements as endogenously incomplete contracts as done by Horn et al (2010).
17 This is only a puzzle if the objective of policy makers is market access and they are influenced by academic research!

                                                           13
3.1       Ex-post trade effects: naïve gravity and a PTA formation “puzzle”
      •    Gravity approach
        Since Tinbergen (1962) the gravity equation has been used to estimate the effects of bilateral PTAs
on aggregate trade between its members. The empirical success of the gravity approach and its theoretical
underpinnings make it a potentially useful tool for this purpose… provided it is correctly used. To interpret
the evolution of PTA estimates we start with the formulation of a gravity equation in a cross section; 18

                                                        𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑥𝑥 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 𝜙𝜙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥                           (1)

where 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 represents the value of exports from x to importer m; 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 captures the supply “capabilities” of x
to any m; 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 captures any importer market characteristics that affect its demand from any x. The term
𝜙𝜙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 ∈[0,1] is a general measure of bilateral market access; a is a constant.
          Before discussing how gravity has been used and the interpretation of different estimates, we define
what effects we are interested in. Let 𝝅𝝅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
                                             𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 denote the set of potential policies that change depending on
whether PTAxm={0,1}. Depending on the set of policies and economic structure we would have a particular
mapping from 𝝅𝝅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
                    𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 to the equilibrium value of each variable on the right side of (1) (more on this below).
We define the general trade effect of a PTA between x and m as
                                                          𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔
                                                        �𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥             �𝑚𝑚 +𝜙𝜙�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
                                                        T      = 𝑋𝑋�𝑥𝑥 + 𝑀𝑀                                   (2)

where 𝑀𝑀 �𝑚𝑚 ≡ ln 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚
                    1     0
                       /𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚       𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
                             and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚     represents the equilibrium value depending on the existence of PTA;
similarly for the remaining variables. The PTA can affect policies that enter directly into X and M and thus
affect all partners regardless of membership but here we focus on bilateral policies that apply differentially
to members. So (2) represents the total growth in member exports caused by their PTA, while holding any
other policies constant but, allowing for any general equilibrium effects of bilateral policies that can
magnify or counteract the partial trade effect of a PTA via the bilateral market access function, which we
define as:

                                                        �𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝜙𝜙�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
                                                        T                                                     (3)

        Nearly all ex-post gravity estimates attempt to estimate either this partial effect for a specific
agreement or its average across agreements. If we believe the PTA is essentially a reduction in bilateral
costs then the partial effect should be positive regardless of the exact economic structure that generates
the gravity structure. That structure will be important in determining the general effect, which we discuss
at the end of the section.
      •    Average partial effects and selection bias
       The structure of gravity equations is conducive to estimating the average partial effect of PTAs as
an average treatment effect (cf. Baier and Bergstrand, 2007). Doing so helps unify our understanding of
problems with earlier estimates as different sources of selection bias.




18   This corresponds to definition 1 in Head and Mayer (2014), which I follow for ease of comparison.
                                                           14
         What are the basic conditions for obtaining a consistent estimate of the average partial effect over
all PTAs, 𝜙𝜙� ? To answer this and the different sources of bias we first note the following property of gravity
models. The bilateral market access between any xm pair has no direct effect on exports from the rest of
the world to m (or any other countries) if we condition on 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 . This suggests we can estimate 𝜙𝜙� as
an average treatment effect under the standard condition that the treatment, PTA membership, satisfies
the conditional independence assumption. That is, conditional on (i) the relevant additive determinants of
the exporter and importer characteristics and (ii) the determinants of bilateral access, the PTA treatment
is “random” so we can obtain T       � as the conditional average difference in lnT between pairs of countries in a
PTA and those outside.
         While the conditional independence can’t be directly tested, we can examine how the results change
as we move towards meeting it in terms of the econometric and economic model. To do so let us write the
true value of the (log) 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 , 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 and 𝜙𝜙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 each as a (different) function of some vector of observable variables,
summarized by 𝐙𝐙𝑖𝑖 = {𝐙𝐙𝑥𝑥 , 𝐙𝐙𝑚𝑚 , 𝐙𝐙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 }, and an error term for each, {ϵ𝑥𝑥 , ϵ𝑚𝑚 , ϵ𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 } . Using this we write log exports
in its conditional expectation form, where 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 is a random error.

                                                  ln 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝜙𝜙�𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝐙𝐙𝑖𝑖′ 𝛃𝛃 + ϵ𝑥𝑥 + ϵ𝑚𝑚 + ϵ𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥                                                (4)

        Most gravity estimates adopt some form of (4) with different control variables or fixed effects, for
different country and time samples. Moreover, the large majority adopts ordinary least squares in which
case the estimated parameter on the PTA variable, 𝜙𝜙�, is equal to the average partial effect and a PTA
selection bias term: the difference across members and non-members of the error terms for exporter
capabilities, importer demand characteristics and bilateral market access.

where 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 ≡ ϵ𝑥𝑥 + ϵ𝑚𝑚 + ϵ𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 . I wrote the partial effect as an average over all PTAs but several studies focus on
specific PTAs or allow for heterogeneous effects in the estimation. This is reasonable since some PTAs may
be deeper or broader than others. The approach in (5) extends to these cases, if we take the expectation
over each of the relevant PTAs, but at the potential cost of small sample bias.
        In implementing this approach we require a random sample from the population over which we
want to estimate the effect. I would argue that the relevant population is typically bilateral pairs with
positive trade in the period under study since countries with no trade generally have no PTA and are
unlikely to gain from and thus ever forming one. If positive trade pairs are the relevant population then
the only sample selection issue is due to the availability of covariates. If the population were any bilateral
pair then there would be a selection bias due to the omission of zeros in the log linear approach, which we
will discuss as well.
        In sum, the discussion below will refer to selection bias arising from three potential sources

         1. Small PTA sample size.
         2. Choice of controls and estimation approach.
         3. Sample selection




                                                                              15
     •    Naïve gravity
        I now discuss estimates that follow what Head and Mayer (2014) define as the naïve gravity
approach, which is characterized by using GDP to proxy for 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 . The early literature is too long to
summarize and we now understand that much of it suffers from basic estimation problems. Therefore, I
just highlight the heterogeneity and fragility of some results and how they are subject to different types of
selection bias. The following section evaluates the importance and solution of each source of bias.
        Until recently most gravity estimates used GDP to proxy for 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 and included bilateral
distance and a PTA dummy as part of the bilateral market access. The remaining controls vary across
different studies. The results were mixed. Frankel et al (1997) considers a number of different agreements
and time periods. He finds small or insignificant effects for the EC in several time periods (and reports
similar results by others) but strong effects for agreements such as Mercosur (p. 62).
        The estimates found were heterogeneous across the type of agreement examined, the time period,
country sample and controls. So much so that different authors could, and did, cite the same paper for
finding either a strong effect or none for the same PTA. 19 In the presence of numerous and sometimes
contradictory estimates, meta-analysis can provide a useful measure of their robustness and variability.
World Bank (2005) reports the results from 362 estimates of 𝜙𝜙� in 17 studies that span different
agreements, time periods and specifications. One third of the estimates is statistically insignificant, 12
percent are negative and significant and only 54 percent are positive and significant. The mean estimate is
0.79 but the standard error is 1.3. 20
          Small PTA sample size
        Many of the studies suffer from a small PTA sample, as they rely on cross-sectional data or use data
available only through the mid-1990s. In particular, these studies either focus on a single agreement or
attempt to estimate separate effects for multiple ones using aggregate trade, often defined as the sum of
imports and exports, so there is a single observation per country-pair in a given year.
          Choice of controls
       The second issue with earlier estimates is their reliance on proxies for exporter and importer
characteristics that fail to account for systematic determinants of trade. To see the importance of this point




19 In explaining why no results are found for the EC Frankel et al (1997, p.87) notes that Bergstrand (1985) also finds
none. Ghosh and Yamarick (2004, p.370) claim that Bergstrand (1985) provides evidence that “European trade blocs
increased trade during the 1960’s and 1970’s” and cite it as an example of an emerging consensus that PTAs are trade
creating, which they then go on to challenge. Baier and Bergstrand (2007) claim that Bergstrand (1985) finds an
insignificant effect for the EC and proceed to show how their approach provides larger robust estimates. The results
in Table 2 of Bergstrand (1985) show significant effects for EFTA in the 60’s and 70’s and for EC in 60s but not in 70’s.
It also shows the number of observations in each cross section: 210, because the study uses total trade by only 15
developed countries.
20 The study also reports the average over 254 estimates that attempt to estimate an “overall” impact of PTAs: the sum

of the member effect and any trade diversion effect with non-members. In this case 42% of the overall impact
estimates are negative and significant and only 34% are positive and significant. To do so those studies include a PTA
variable equal to 1 if x is a member of any PTA, which after controlling for PTAxm, is meant to capture if there is less
trade with non-members. The sum of these effects is the overall impact, which as we will see is not identified once we
fully control for the exporter and importer characteristics. We discuss trade diversion in section 5.
                                                           16
consider the core determinants generally used: distance, importer and exporter GDP. Suppose that a
specific group of countries in a region is pursuing unilateral liberalization, for instance Brazil and other
Latin American countries in the early 1990’s. This unilateral liberalization implies their average trade is
higher than predicted by the standard gravity variables and the same is true of their bilateral trade. If those
countries also have a PTA, say Mercosur, then the earlier gravity studies would estimate a large effect.
Clearly there is an omitted variable, unilateral liberalization, which can be a source of selection bias,
essentially the exporter and importer errors in (5) are higher for certain PTA members. Conversely those
errors may be lower for countries that have already liberalized unilaterally or have trade below what they
would like or expect based on their characteristics and are trying to boost it via PTAs.
         Partly as a recognition of this potential problem, several researchers used a large set of covariates
that include income per capita, geographic features, historic ties (colony, language), exchange rate
measures (float vs. fixed, volatility, currency unions) and in one case aggregate trade policy. The recognition
that gravity could also be derived from comparative advantage models also led some to include factor
endowments. However, more is not always better. There are three potential pitfalls of using multiple
typically atheoretical controls.
         The first potential pitfall is the possibility that one can find at least a combination of covariates,
accidentally or by design, that is particularly good at explaining trade for a particular set of countries. Ghosh
and Yamarick (2004) argue that this can lead researchers to report only the results that accord with their
own priors. To analyze this systematically they perform an extreme bound analysis. They take data for 186
countries and six 5 year periods from 1970-1995 and regress trade on the core variables: GDPs and
distance as well as PTA effects and time dummies. They then consider the estimated effects of PTAs under
different combinations of 16 other possible determinants. When all these determinants are included they
find positive and significant effects for eight out of 12 PTAs and negative effects for the EU and NAFTA (the
latter is significant). When they calculate the extreme bounds of those estimates under alternative
combinations of covariates they find that the range for each of the PTAs always includes zero and is
extremely wide, e.g. 𝜙𝜙�𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 ∈ (−2.2,2.5). 21
         The second concern with multiple atheoretical controls, is the interpretation of the resulting
estimate. Suppose that PTAs affect trade solely via changes in trade policy and that we control for a country
specific trade policy openness index. We may then find that the PTA has no impact, which can either be due
to the fact that the index captured the PTA policy change or the fact that the country underwent unilateral
liberalization. 22
        Sample selection
       The third type of selection suffered by early econometric exercises relates to sample selection; a
problem that can be exacerbated by the use of multiple atheoretical controls. For example, in Ghosh and
Yamarick (2004) there are over 31,000 observations with positive trade and information for the core



21 Eicher etal (2012) argue this type of analysis is too extreme and argue instead for Bayesian model averaging, which
weights the models according to their ex-post explanatory power, whereas extreme bound analysis provides equal
weight to all models. Their Bayesian approach generates results closer to the OLS estimates.
22 A more subtle example is if PTAs affect trade by affecting bilateral exchange rates (e.g. the volatility or whether they

subsequently form a currency union) then controlling for the latter will affect our estimate of the former.
                                                           17
variables but less than half of it is used because of missing data on the multiple covariates. Data collection
and quality is not random across countries and can thus result in selection bias. Moreover, this and most
other initial estimates use only positive trade, which in this case means discarding 2/3 of the potential
country pairs. This may not be as severe an issue if we believe that most countries that never trade would
also never have a PTA and thus our target population excludes them.
        In sum, not controlling for key determinants of trade generates a selection bias, which can be
particularly problematic in a small PTA sample setting. However, multiple combinations of atheoretical
determinants are not necessarily an improvement. In fact, the conditional independence assumption of
PTAs may hold with one set of covariates but not another, particularly if they include outcomes that are
affected by the PTA 23 and affect the sample.

3.2       Ex-post trade effects: theory consistent estimates
           The preceding discussion suggests that we require
        1. a clearer theoretical guidance of trade determinants in gravity models and a more robust way
            to control for them;
        2. explicit mechanisms for formation and impacts of a PTA to better justify conditional
            independence and;
        3. larger PTA samples, either by estimating average effects over similar agreements or using more
            disaggregated data.
        Several of the recent developments in gravity estimation and their application to PTAs address
these issues, which we now discuss in turn.
      •    Structural gravity and multilateral trade determinants
        The general formulation of gravity in (1) arises from a variety of different models (cf. Costinot and
Rodriguez-Clare, 2014). Those models can provide alternative interpretations for the multilateral trade
determinants, 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 , but regardless of their micro foundation, we can account for them in an
econometrically robust way by using importer and exporter specific effects. If in addition we specify a
bilateral market access function with constant trade elasticities, 𝛃𝛃𝑻𝑻 , (across countries) then we do not
require any additional structure to obtain estimates of the partial PTA effect where the multilateral terms
are consistent with theory. Doing so implies estimating

                                      ln 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝜙𝜙�𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝐙𝐙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
                                                                    ′
                                                                         𝛃𝛃𝑻𝑻 + 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚 + ϵ 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥   (4a)

        ′
where 𝐙𝐙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 can include distance and other structural determinants of bilateral trade frictions. All importer
and exporter specific variables are captured by their respective fixed effects, 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚 and 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥 , which eliminates
any country specific sources of selection bias in (5).
       We now provide a structural interpretation of 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚 and 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥 and explain a potential source of bias
when instead of controlling for these effects we use a proxy such as GDP. To do so consider the following
Monte-Carlo experiment in Head and Mayer (2014). They generate data from a gravity consistent




23   Imbens (2004) makes this point more generally for estimation of average treatment effects.
                                                                 18
framework and impose ln 𝜙𝜙 = 0.5𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 − 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + ϵ 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , so the true partial effect assumed is 𝜙𝜙� = 0.5;
 ϵ 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 is the only source of error in the data generating process and has a normal distribution. Using the
approach in (4a) with distance and fixed effects as controls they recover the true partial effect of 0.50
whereas the OLS estimate obtained from replacing the fixed effects with GDPs is only 0.28.
           To interpret the downward bias in the estimates without fixed effects we need to understand the
theoretical model used to generate the data. In it the exporter and importer characteristics are given by
𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 = 𝑌𝑌𝑥𝑥 ⁄Ω𝑥𝑥 and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 = 𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚 ⁄Φ𝑚𝑚 where 𝑌𝑌𝑥𝑥 ≡ ∑𝑚𝑚 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 represents total value of production and thus income
for the exporter; and 𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚 ≡ ∑𝑥𝑥 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 the total expenditure by the importer. These terms are adjusted by the
                                                 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗                     𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗
multilateral resistance terms, Ω𝑥𝑥 ≡ ∑𝑗𝑗 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗       and Φ𝑚𝑚 ≡ ∑𝑗𝑗 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , which are expenditure weighted
                                                 Φ𝑗𝑗                      Ω𝑗𝑗

measures of average market        access. 24   Therefore when we use OLS and GDP the error will reflect the
                                                                           𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗                   𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗
importer and exporter multilateral resistance terms, − ln �∑𝑗𝑗 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗             � �∑𝑗𝑗 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗          �. All else equal this term
                                                                           Φ𝑗𝑗                    Ω𝑗𝑗

is lower for the PTA countries (since 𝜙𝜙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 and 𝜙𝜙𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 are higher), which offsets the true partial effect. One
interpretation is that the PTA lowers the importers’ price index, which reduces its imports from other
sources and the OLS estimates will capture the net effect.
         In practice, the country effects can also capture other factors that generate selection biases in
different directions. For example, if a unilateral liberalization coincided with the PTA then the fixed effect
estimates should be lower. On the other hand if the PTA led to higher protection against non-members then
the fixed effects estimates would be higher. The net effect likely depends on the sample. What do the data
say?
         In Table 2 we employ the data used in section 2 and estimate partial PTA effects using different
approaches on data from 1965-2010 at 5 year intervals. Column 1 uses the OLS naïve approach controlling
for GDPs and their deflators and year effects whereas column 2 controls for country-by-period fixed effects;
both columns 1 and 2 control for common border and language. In this sample the estimated PTA partial
effect is smaller after we control for country-by-period effects. 25
         It is important to understand the interpretation of the PTA coefficient after accounting for
multilateral resistance in this way. The average change in the exports of x to all its trading partners after a
PTA is reflected in its multilateral resistance term. Thus the PTA effect reflects only the differential trade
with the PTA member relative to non-members, so it can reflect creation of trade with this member or
diversion away from non-members. We may compute the effect of PTAs on non-members by combining the
estimates with a specific theoretical model, as we discuss at the end of this section.
     •   Endogenous PTAs and bilateral trade determinants
       The structural gravity approach in (4a) is still potentially subject to selection bias arising from any
systematic differences in unmodelled bilateral trade determinants between PTA and non-PTA pairs. Let’s
consider what these may be and how they have been addressed.




24 As Head and Mayer (2014) show this derivation requires only that expenditure shares over different export sources

are independent of income and uses market clearing conditions.
25We obtain a similar result if we omit the deflators in the panel and also for individual year cross sections.
                                                           19
         Consider applying OLS to (4a) in a cross-section with a PTA indicator but no other bilateral
determinants. It should be clear that the partial effect estimated is identified only from countries that have
PTAs and is equal to the average exports with a PTA partner minus the average of the same exporter to
non-PTA partners. Therefore any bilateral characteristic that is correlated with having a PTA will be
reflected in that estimate. If that characteristic also affects trade independently then the estimate will be
biased. So if countries that are contiguous, closer or share a language, are more likely to form PTAs and we
fail to control for these variables then we overestimate the partial effect. All three of these variables can be
and have been controlled for.
         After controlling for basic bilateral trade determinants we are left with two potential sources of
bilateral bias. First, determinants that we may consider a priori important but are currently unobservable
(or poorly measured), e.g. certain non-tariff barriers or other measures of policy depth. Second, bilateral
controls that are potentially observable but not typically included in the earlier studies, e.g. potential for
conflict can be a motive for PTAs and independently affect trade.
         One approach to this problem is to control for a wide range of bilateral trade determinants. This is
subject to the issues we discussed under “choice of controls”. Another alternative is to use matching
estimation, which generates a control group of untreated pairs that has the same predicted probability of a
PTA as the treated observations. This requires a first stage probability model of PTA formation. 26 A similar
model is also required by the third alternative, IV estimation, where the latter also requires the standard
exclusion restriction.
         Both matching and IV estimates treat PTA formation as endogenous from an econometric
perspective. This is also the only reasonable approach from an economic perspective but raises the
question of why PTAs form in the first place. We defer detailed discussion of this point until section 5 when
we will have a better understanding of various effects of PTAs. But we can discuss some potential
determinants of PTAs and difficulties in addressing endogenous PTA formation.
         There is currently no widely accepted model of PTA formation. Moreover, it is doubtful any such
single model exists given the large diversity of agreements and policies covered in PTAs. Therefore the
initial approaches to this issue have sensibly used a variety of economic and political variables as
determinants of PTAs. Magee (2003) for example uses 2SLS in a panel with the following instruments to
identify the PTA effect in the trade equation: log difference in GDP, the intra-industry trade, bilateral trade
surplus, capital-labor ratio similarity, and a joint democracy dummy. These are assumed to be excludable
from the trade equation but there is no test of it. The impact on the estimated trade effects of treating the
PTA as endogenous is very sensitive to the exact specification leading him to conclude that “we should be
cautious in using gravity equation estimates to draw strong conclusions about the effect of PTA formation
on trade”.
         More recent work by Egger et al (2011) pursues the IV approach in a cross section of 126 countries
for 2005. Relative to Magee (2003) they include a broader set of political similarity variables, potential
bilateral costs (e.g. similar language, colonial history) and control for structural multilateral terms. Egger
et al (2011) further assume that three indicators are excludable from the trade equation, former colony,




26   Egger et al. (2008) use this approach to examine the effect of new agreements between OECD members.
                                                         20
common former colonizer and former country (1 if a current pair of countries was once united). These
factors are significant in determining the PTA and not significant in the trade equation conditional on the
remaining regressors. The authors thus estimate a partial effect of PTAs between members of 𝜙𝜙� = 1.15.
This is substantially larger than the 55 log points estimate they obtain if the PTA is treated as exogenous.
         A final approach, used by Baier and Bergstrand (2007), is to explore panel data and assume that the
main source of bilateral bias is time invariant. More specifically, they consider the following extension of
(4a), which adds a time dimension to the country effects and a bilateral fixed effect:

                                     ln 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝜙𝜙�𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + ϵ 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥   (4b)

            Their fixed effects estimate is 𝜙𝜙� = 0.46, when only contemporaneous PTA effects are included,
which is higher than the effect they obtain in the pooled sample with only time effects (0.27). This again
suggests that controlling for endogeneity increases the estimated effect. However, this increase reflects
both the inclusion of country-by-time effects and the bilateral effect, they have no specification that adds
only the latter. To capture this we can compare columns 3 and 4 of Table 2, which show that including the
bilateral effect actually reduces the PTA partial effect to 0.37. 27
            Relative to the cross-section, the approach in (4b) has the advantage that it controls for any fixed
bilateral characteristics. However, it does not eliminate the concern with potential selection bias, it simply
moves it to the time-varying bilateral effect. To understand this note that the identification now relies solely
on countries that entered (or left) PTAs at some point in the sample. In essence we are comparing the
change in exports over a 5 year period between a pair that enters a PTA and the same countries’ change in
exports in that period relative to non-members. The question then becomes why the same country entered
a PTA with m but not j in that period.
            To address this concern with the timing of PTAs and whether they are correlated with factors in
 ϵ 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 that independently raise trade we could employ IV in this panel setting. Ideally these time-varying
bilateral instruments would be suggested by theory. Until this is done we can’t be completely certain about
the exact interpretation of these particular estimates. 28
     •   Sample issues and heterogeneous PTA effects
        One advantage of structural gravity and its parsimonious panel specification in (4b) is to minimize
the need for covariates that may induce non-random sample selection. In terms of selection due to zero
trade there are different approaches that have been used. This is not an issue if we are interested only on
the impact of PTAs on the treated and believe that non-traders will never form a PTA. Evidence from meta-
analysis indicates no significant differences between estimates that address the zeros issue.



27 Their sample comprises 96 countries in 5-year periods between 1960-2000 whereas ours is a non-balanced panel
from 1965-2010 and uses a more comprehensive PTA list. For summary statistics see Table A2 in the Appendix. The
meta-analysis in Cipollina and Salvatici (2010) finds that estimates are on average higher in specifications that include
the bilateral effect. Our sample extends to 2010 so beyond any of the studies they include.
28 The approach in (4b) would yield consistent estimates if the gain to join an agreement was log separable into a time

invariant bilateral effect and country-by-time effects. For example, if Poland is a “natural” PTA partner for Germany
but not for Japan then a shock that increases Poland’s gain from a PTA with any country in the world will generate a
PTA with Germany but not Japan. This type of separability may not be satisfied in domino theories of regionalism
where the bilateral component of this value can be inherently time varying. We discuss this further in section 5.
                                                                  21
         The recent estimates described above address the small PTA sample issue by using a large number
of agreements and focusing on estimating an average effect. This is reasonable conditional on focusing on
aggregate data. On the other hand we expect agreements to have heterogeneous effects e.g. certain
agreement reduce tariffs reciprocally, others eliminate them altogether while others have common tariffs
and/or a common market.
         At one extreme there are studies that estimate PTA-specific effects and find they are heterogeneous,
e.g. Eicher and Henn (2011). 29 One potential downside of doing so with aggregate data is the small PTA
sample bias. An alternative is to focus on average effects for broad groups of agreements. Baier et al (2014)
do this using the common classification in section 2.2 and find stronger effects for deeper PTAs, namely CU
and FTA. We find a similar pattern when the data is extended to 2010 both for the contemporaneous effects
and when we account for lagged effects (column 6 Table 2). The average contemporaneous effect for
reciprocal PTAs is 0.37 (column 4), which is between the effect for non-FTAs, 0.27 and FTAs, 0.42, but is
substantially lower than for customs unions and common markets, 0.9, whereas non-reciprocal preferences
have no significant effect.
         In section 2 we described the variation in PTAs along policy depth and breadth. That data can be
used to examine the source of heterogeneous effects. Given the large number of provisions and correlation
between some of them there are two possible approaches. One is to use principal component analysis. The
other is to make use of an ex-ante grouping of provisions to test which are important, the taxonomy in
section 2 may be useful in guiding such groupings. The data to do so is available online for the interested
reader. 30
         Another alternative to estimate heterogeneous effects with aggregate data is to rely on theory to
motivate interpretable parsimonious interactions of the PTA dummies with relevant country and/or
bilateral characteristics. For example, interactions with indicators of the depth of policy such as the average
level of MFN tariffs and NTBs against non-members.
         A complementary approach to minimize the small PTA sample problem while allowing for
heterogeneous effects is to use disaggregated data and specific agreements, as we will later describe. 31 This
will be useful when we are trying to explain the magnitude and mechanism that generates the most recent
PTA estimates. Before doing so we discuss the magnitude of these effects and whether they can simply be
explained by tariff reductions in standard models.
     •   Summary
         In sum, the partial PTA effect estimates from naïve gravity approaches were heterogenous in terms
of magnitude and statistical significance, which raised the question of why countries increasingly pursue
these. I argued these estimates were fragile due to different biases. Some biases were common to all gravity
estimates, e.g. omiting multilateral resistance, and others were specific to the topic, e.g. PTA endogeneity.
More recent estimates that address these and other econometric issues are more consistent in terms of
their positive and significant effect and can thus better explain the fast rate of PTA formation.



29 Vicard (2009) on the other hand does not find significant differences across different types of PTAs.
30 Egger and Wamser (2013) find that trade is increasing in the breadth of integration agreements: from those that
include only goods to services then investment and then double taxation. Not all of these are PTAs as we defined them.
31 An early example that illustrates the value of doing so is Clausing (2001), which we discuss in section 5.

                                                         22
        I highlight a few key issues from the prior discussion. First, any gravity estimate must start from a
well-defined theoretical model such that the identification assumptions and interpretation of the PTA effect
are clear. Second, aggregate gravity estimates should focus on average effects rather than individual PTA
effects---the latter require more detailed data. Third, the panel results in Table 2 indicate that controlling
for multilateral resistance and bilateral fixed effects reduces the magnitude of the PTA effect. Moreover, as
we now discuss, the recent evidence points to dynamic trade effects of PTAs that are stronger for deeper
agreements.

3.3      A PTA trade elasticity puzzle?
        The theory consistent estimates of the average PTA effect that address the key econometric issues
we discussed are robustly positive. If PTAs reduce bilateral trade costs then this positive partial effect is
not surprising and rules out few, if any, PTA theories. For example, a positive effect is consistent with the
standard static view of PTAs as a reduction in a preferential tariff. However, the standard static models are
unable to explain other important pieces of evidence. First, in section 2 we described the recent emphasis
on negotiating policies other than tariffs. Second, the finding above that customs unions and common
markets have substantially stronger trade effects indicates other policies may play a role.
        In this section we discuss the plausible range of magnitudes of long-run PTA effects from recent
estimates and argue that accounting for them in a standard static model would require an implausibly large
(i) trade elasticity or (ii) reduction in preferential tariffs. We then provide direct evidence that neither of
these two conditions are present in this data and that the PTA effect remains even after tariff reductions
are taken into account.
     •    The magnitude and timing of aggregate PTA effects
        PTAs are highly persistent and thus it is important to understand their long-run impact. The fact
that cross-sectional estimates are larger than the panel ones indicates that the trade effect of PTAs may be
larger in the long-run. Two plausible motives would be that policies are phased-in over time and/or there
may be dynamic effects that build up gradually.
        Baier and Bergstrand (2007) capture the long-run effects by re-estimating (4b) including not just a
contemporaneous PTA effect but also an indicator if the PTA is present for at least 5 years and at least 10
years. They find the PTA effect doubles after 5 years (from 0.28 to 0.55) and is triple the short-run effect
after ten or more years. Their long-run estimate is 0.76, which is higher than the average effect when lagged
terms are omitted. 32
        In column 5 of Table 2 we include a similar lag structure and find a similarly large increase in the
average PTA effect in the data for 1965-2010. A similar increase is present for each of the separate types of




32This difference may be due to the substantial number of new PTAs in the latter part of the sample such that the
average estimate without lagged terms reflects their short-run effect. The lagged effect could also reflect positive
correlation in the error term, which in some cases can be ameliorated by first differencing, but applying the latter
yields similar estimates.
                                                        23
reciprocal PTAs (column 6). Thus panel analysis with only a contemporaneous PTA effect may generate a
downward biased estimate of the long-run effect, particularly in short panels. 33
       In sum, recent estimates of the average PTA effect that are consistent with the structural gravity
requirements and take long-run effects into account are fairly high. This is true for panels, with both Baier
and Bergstrand, 2007 (table 5) and Anderson and Yotov (forthcoming) finding a value of around 0.76, and
even higher in a cross section, 1.15, (Egger et al, 2011 table 2).
     •   Puzzle: definition and existing evidence
            Given the high estimates just described we now ask two related questions. First, at a given trade
elasticity, what is the maximum that observed tariffs can explain of the PTA effect? Second, at the current
observed MFN tariffs, how high would the trade elasticity have to be in order to fully explain that effect?
We find that observed tariffs can only explain a fraction of the PTA effect if we use a standard value of the
trade elasticity and that to fully explain the PTA effect requires an elasticity considerably higher than
standard estimates, hence the elasticity puzzle.
            Traditional theories of PTAs focus on its role in reducing tariff barriers between members. If that is
all a PTA did then given a log change τ�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 in the ad valorem tariff factor we would obtain T     �𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝜙𝜙�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 =
−𝜀𝜀τ�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , where 𝜀𝜀 > 0 is the absolute value of the variable trade cost elasticity. We say there is an elasticity
puzzle if the estimated effect, 𝜙𝜙�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , can only be reconciled with the prediction from such a model by using
an implausible trade cost elasticity.
            In standard models that yield a gravity equation this elasticity is a parameter. In a single sector
Armington model it is proportional to the constant elasticity of substitution across varieties, 𝜀𝜀 = 𝜎𝜎 − 1. In
a Melitz-Chaney framework 𝜀𝜀 = 𝑘𝑘, the Pareto productivity dispersion parameter. 34 The estimated ad
valorem trade cost reduction of PTAs is then defined as
                                                       � 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 ≡ 𝜙𝜙�/𝜀𝜀
                                                      PTA                                                         (7)

         The trade elasticity plays a key role in recent quantifications of welfare effects of trade and there is
a range of estimates for it. Most estimates fall in the 3-7 range and for this discussion we follow Costinot
and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) and Head and Mayer (2014) and focus on an intermediate value, 𝜀𝜀 = 5. At this
                      � 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 =1.15/5. That is the partial trade effect from a PTA is equivalent to eliminating
elasticity we obtain PTA
a 26% ad valorem tariff (exp(1.15/5)-1). For the panel estimate it is 16%.




33 This is clearly reflected in the higher value of the full panel estimate in column 5, 0.6, with either of the
corresponding coefficient estimates for alternative sub-periods, e.g. 1990-2010 and 1965-1985, which are presented
in columns 2 and 3 of Table 3. Thus the dynamic effects introduce an additional potential cost of any sample selection
that shortens the length of the panel, e.g. due to missing data.
34 This mapping assumes that tariffs are imposed as export costs. If we impose them on the consumers then the

formulas must be adjusted, for example 𝜀𝜀 = 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘/(𝜎𝜎 − 1).
                                                         24
         Kee et al (2009) calculate the trade restrictiveness of MFN tariffs for each country, the average of
this measure across countries in the world in 2009 was about 7.4%. 35 So even full elimination of MFN tariffs
between PTA members is unable to account for its partial trade effect. 36
         In practice, how large are the actual changes in tariff barriers between members after a PTA? The
surprisingly little systematic research on this point shows that it is considerably less than what would be
implied by a complete removal of tariffs. The WTO’s (2011) report finds that a large share of trade in PTAs
occurs in tariff lines that already have zero MFN tariffs and that a number of products where the MFN tariff
is high are excluded from PTAs. Overall it calculates a preferential margin of 2.1 percentage points for
tariffs. This margin is higher for countries with higher MFN tariffs such as Mexico (9.3), it is 4.9 within the
EU and only 0.7 for the US. Recent work by Hayakawa and Kimura (2014) finds that on average PTAs lead
                                                                                                  � 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 .
to reductions of 2% for tariffs. So these tariff reductions can only explain a small fraction of PTA
         What alternative values of the trade elasticity are required in order to account for the PTA effect?
Under a full removal of the average observed MFN tariffs, 7.4%, the required elasticity is between 10 for
the panel estimate and 15 for the cross-section. The required elasticity is substantially higher if we employ
the measured preferential tariff liberalization of 2%.
     •   Puzzle: novel evidence
         We now ask if the puzzle persists in a more recent sample. More importantly, we use tariff data to
(i) estimate the relevant trade elasticity and (ii) directly control for this channel of PTAs. This allows us to
answer how much larger the tariff reduction and/or trade elasticity have to be to explain the PTA effect
while using a unified dataset and methodology instead of piecing together estimates from different studies.
         In column 1 of Table 3 we replicate column 5 of Table 2 for comparison, which estimates the long-
run effects of the reciprocal PTA variable for 1965-2010. The tariff data is available after 1988 so the second
column re-estimates over the 1990-2010 period. We see a pattern similar to the full sample but with
smaller effects. 37 The estimate for the subsample of countries with available tariff data is in column 4 and
implies a PTA effect of 0.26. Our objective is to determine if this PTA effect, which is smaller than the ones
using the longer panels, can be explained by preferential tariff reductions.
         Not all PTAs eliminate tariffs fully; and even FTAs that aim to do so include provisions, such as rules
of origin, that must be satisfied for a good to be eligible for the preference. To capture the change in tariffs
due to an agreement we must therefore control for the effectively applied tariff faced by an exporter x,
which is the average duty it paid when selling to m at time t , τ𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 . This measure varies bilaterally and over
time and thus its effect, the trade elasticity, can be identified using the augmented version of (4b) shown
below. This specification includes lagged PTA effects and controls for changes in tariff protection, so the
remaining PTA effect, denoted by 𝜙𝜙 �
                                      −𝜏𝜏,𝑖𝑖 , reflects everything except applied tariff barriers.




35 Using the July 2012 version of the data available at <siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRES/ Resources/469232-
1107449512766/OTRI2009.xlsx>
36 Head and Mayer (2014, p. 165) reach the opposite conclusion because they use a substantially lower 𝜙𝜙      � = 0.28,
which is the median from their meta-analysis that includes studies subject to the biases previously discussed.
37 This reduction in the average effect is also present if we use the subsample 1960-85, in column 3, and suggests that

the shorter panels are unable to capture longer run effects.
                                                          25
                            ln 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = ∑𝑖𝑖=0,5,10 𝜙𝜙�−𝜏𝜏,𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀τ𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + ϵ 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥   (4c)

          In column 5 we find that, after controlling for tariffs, PTAs continue to increase bilateral trade
significantly after at least 10 years. The effect is about 5.5 log points lower than the estimate in column 4,
over the same sample but without tariffs. This difference is consistent with our estimated tariff elasticity,
𝜀𝜀̃=3.1, provided the preferential tariff reduction is around 1.7 log points. 38
          We can verify the reduction in preferential tariffs generated by PTAs directly in our data by using a
specification similar to (4c) with τ𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 as a dependent variable. In column 8 we do so and find an average
preferential reduction of almost 1.7 log points. 39 In sum, given our estimated elasticity, the tariff reduction
would need to have been about five times larger than observed to account for the PTA effect in this sample.
Alternatively, given the observed preferential tariff reductions, the trade elasticity would have had to be
about five times larger than what we estimate it to be, i.e. over 15, which is considerably higher than the
standard values.
          In column 6 we disaggregate the reciprocal PTA variable into the 3 common categories previously
described and find a positive and significant effect for each in the 1990-2010 subsample; controlling for the
tariff in column 7 reduces their magnitude but does not change their sign or standard error. The tariff
reduction is largest for CU but it still only explains less than one fifth of the CU partial trade effect. The
average tariff change in FTAs explains around a third of the effect. Note also that even though non-
reciprocal PTAs experience a significant tariff decrease there is no significant PTA effect, which may be due
to the uncertain nature of those tariffs.
          In sum, the PTA effect is not fully explained by preferential tariff reductions. This justifies the
widespread use of dummies in the gravity approach to capture other channels through which PTAs can
increase bilateral trade, but it also begs the question of what those channels are. Moreover, we estimate
that recent PTAs have very modest effects on tariff reductions, which reflects the fact that MFN tariffs are
already low, as noted in the introduction.
     •   Features of possible explanations for the elasticity puzzle
        The last results suggest that either PTAs increase the trade elasticity with respect to tariffs and/or
they reduce trade costs beyond tariffs. Our objective here is not to list explanations and resolve the puzzle
but to highlight important features of potential explanations. In sections 4 and 5 we analyze the deeper and
broader economic cooperation in modern PTAs and will point out which aspects of a richer economic
and/or policy structure can contribute to explain the elasticity puzzle.
            Recall that we defined the elasticity puzzle by comparing the magnitude of the estimated effect,
𝜙𝜙�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , and the prediction arising from a class of models. What are the characteristics of the models where
there is an elasticity puzzle? First, these models generate a structural gravity equation, so we can estimate




38 There is a potential endogeneity concern arising from the tariff. But, similarly to the PTA, this concern is at least
partially addressed by two controls. First, the importer-time effects, which control for any aggregate reform. Second,
the bilateral fixed effect, which among other things controls for the composition of bilateral trade and resulting
differences in average tariffs between countries that eventually form a PTA.
39 This allows for phase-in effects. Hayakawa and Kimura (2014) find a similar effect using a yearly sample starting

in 1995. Their specification does not control for importer-year and exporter-year effects as we do.
                                                                      26
the partial PTA effect using 𝜙𝜙�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 as described in (4b). Second, they assume a particular economic and policy
structure such that this effect is linear in the trade elasticity and tariff change:
                                                         𝜙𝜙��𝝅𝝅𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷
                                                               𝒙𝒙𝒙𝒙 � = −𝜀𝜀τ
                                                                           � 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 .                                      (8)

         More specifically, this structure requires (i) constant trade elasticity (over goods, policies and time),
(ii) trade only in final goods (otherwise τ�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 would have to reflect some weighted average); (iii)
deterministic policy, and (iv) tariffs as the only instrument affected by PTAs.
         Thus in order to explain the puzzle we should consider models that still generate a gravity structure,
such that the estimate of 𝜙𝜙�𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 as an average effect is still valid and feature any combination of (a) additional
reductions in policy frictions and/or (b) a tariff elasticity function, 𝜀𝜀�𝝅𝝅𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷
                                                                               𝒙𝒙𝒙𝒙 �, that is higher than the average
in the literature. 40

         In subsequent sections we examine how important each of the assumptions listed in (i)-(iv) are and
what may be relevant additional frictions and sources of higher trade elasticities. Briefly, we may obtain
higher trade elasticities if we relax the economic structure constraints (i) and (ii) by allowing for trade in
intermediates and certain export investments (section 4) or FDI (section 5) for example. In section 4 we
also relax (iii) and (iv) and allow for additional policy frictions in the form of observable NTBs and trade
policy uncertainty. We also show that policy uncertainty combined with export investments can generate
higher elasticities, which along with lower expected protection, implies larger trade effects of PTAs.

3.4     Ex-post estimates of WTO trade effects
        In the introduction and in section 2 we noted that a substantial fraction of PTAs are between WTO
members. Thus to identify the partial effect of PTAs it is important to control for participation in the WTO,
which has not always been the case in the literature but is what we do in Tables 2 and 3. We briefly discuss
the partial trade effect of GATT/WTO membership, which is interesting in of itself and as a reference point
for the effects of PTAs. The basic approach is the one we outlined for PTAs. To distinguish between
estimates we refer to the partial effects for the WTO as 𝜙𝜙� 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 and continue to use 𝜙𝜙� for the other agreements.
        Rose (2004) first examined the WTO trade effect. His conclusion was that joining or belonging to
the GATT/WTO did not have a significant impact on bilateral trade. His baseline approach falls under the
naïve gravity group, he uses total trade, focuses on pooled data with time effects and country controls such
as GDP. In the one specification with country fixed effects the results are actually positive and significant
but modest (𝜙𝜙� 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 = 0.15). But these are not time varying and so do not fully account for the multilateral
terms. In another specification Rose controls for country pair effects (table 3), again the estimates are
higher on average, particularly for earlier rounds (from start of GATT up to Kennedy round the effect is
0.24 to 0.76) but because they are separately estimated for each round, there is variation across the
estimates and at least one is negative.




40The non-tariff barriers can also include measures that affect fixed costs. Thus we could alternatively ask what the
percent reduction in those costs, 𝑓𝑓̂𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , would have to be to explain a given PTA effect. This requires a specific model
                                                                              𝜀𝜀
and elasticity, in a Melitz-Chaney framework the relevant elasticity is          − 1. After tariffs the unexplained effect is
                                                                              𝜎𝜎−1

                                                            27
         Subramanian and Wei (2007) also use a gravity approach but conclude that the GATT/WTO
promoted trade strongly, by about $8 trillion in 2000 alone, and unevenly. I highlight the following factors
contributing to the difference in the results relative to Rose (2004). The authors’ use of (i) country by year
effects to control for the structural multilateral terms and (ii) imports instead of trade to capture potential
asymmetries in the effects of developed and developing countries. This is important because developing
countries have traditionally liberalized less during trade rounds and the authors find that the WTO effect
is in fact insignificant for them but positive and significant for developed countries. Another difference is
these authors’ different definition of WTO and PTA membership whereby if a country pair is a member of
the WTO and a PTA then they code the former as 0 and the latter as 1, i.e. they are mutually exclusive. Their
argument for doing so is that it identifies the “pure” WTO effect without confounding it with that of potential
future PTAs. Under this definition they find a large average PTA effect and also a WTO effect for developed
countries.
         Eicher and Henn (2011) point out an issue that has important implications for the interpretation of
the earlier estimates. They show that if we include a separate developed country PTA effect then the
Subramanian and Wei (2007) classification for this and developed WTO member is perfectly collinear with
the country-year effects. This arises because developed countries first enter the WTO and only then join
PTAs with each other, thus they argue the developed country WTO effect is really a PTA effect. They then
reclassify the variables and estimate the following effects {(PTA, non-WTO)=0.7, (PTA, WTO)=0.52, WTO=-
0.07}. Thus PTAs have positive and significant effects for WTO and non-WTO pairs alike but conditional on
them there is no additional average WTO effect. They find heterogeneity in the WTO effect but not along
the developing, developed margin. For example, there are modest effects of WTO accession for countries
that had higher imports upon accession and thus higher potential market power and initial tariffs.
         We use the data for the WTO in Eicher and Henn (2011) extended to 2010 and also allow for
membership in the WTO and PTAs not to be mutually exclusive. In Table 2, we can see how various
econometric concerns affect 𝜙𝜙� 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 : controlling for bilateral effects (column 4) substantially reduces the
effect, but it remains positive and significant. It is also worth noting that, similarly to PTAs, the WTO effect
is significantly larger after at least 10 years of membership, 𝜙𝜙� 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 =0.2. This effect increases further if we
disaggregate the PTAs by depth and control for non-reciprocal preferences, such as GSP, as we see in
column 6. If we were to ignore dynamic effects and restrict the sample to end in 2000, as in Eicher and Henn
(2011), then we also find an insignificant WTO effect. This points to the importance of accessions under
the WTO period, which required additional commitments, and possibly the dynamic effects of the full
implementation of the Uruguay Round by the late 1990’s.
         One possible reason for the difficulty in identifying robust average WTO effects is their
heterogeneity. For example, upon accession some countries may not have liberalized, or may have
liberalized unilaterally. In Table 3, column 8, we find that the average tariff in 1990-2010 does not change
significantly between new pairs of WTO members. Subramanian and Wei (2007) already provided some
evidence for heterogeneous effects. Chang and Lee (2011) go one step forward and show that interacting
the WTO membership with a variety of covariates (income, geography, etc.) yields significant effects. 41 Dutt



41 Thus they argue for a more flexible non-parametric approach that matches treated pairs and compares their mean

trade with untreated ones. In a sample similar to Rose (2004) they find stronger and more robust average WTO effects.
                                                         28
et al (2013) also find that the WTO effects are heterogeneous along the intensive margin (negative) and
extensive margin (positive).
        Another difficulty in identifying an average WTO effect is that the standard estimation approach is
based on accession and thus excludes the original GATT signatories, i.e. several large industrialized
countries. Pre-GATT data would circumvent this issue. An alternative avenue is to explore disaggregated
data and estimate the impact of specific policies such as tariff bindings, discussed in section 4.

3.5   General equilibrium trade and welfare effects of PTAs
         Our focus on the partial trade effects is driven by two factors. First, it has been the focus of much of
the research. Second, the recent estimates are robust to alternative modelling assumptions. However, given
the prevalence of PTAs and the large partial effects found it is important to examine their general
equilibrium effects. Early work using CGE models did precisely this with mixed success (cf. Hertel et al,
2007). Here we focus on recent approaches using new quantitative trade models.
                                   𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔
                                 �𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
         We are interested in T         in (2), which requires us to go beyond the partial effect and compute the
effects on 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 . While different models generate the same structural gravity in (1) they differ in their
implications for the exporter and importer terms, and thus yield different GE estimates. The basic approach
is to take the estimated change due to a PTA and translate it into an ad valorem equivalent using a particular
trade elasticity and then ask what the counterfactual values of 𝑋𝑋𝑥𝑥 and 𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 would be. In practice this entails
using the structure of the chosen model to calculate the impact of this cost change on income, production
and the multilateral resistance terms defined in section 3.2 to derive new trade flows.
         Egger et al (2011) estimate a partial effect and use it to compute the counterfactual trade outcomes
without PTAs in the context of an Armington model. The difference between the counterfactual and
observed trade yields an average increase in trade of 102% between PTA members. While the partial effect
                                                                    𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔
                                                                   �𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
is estimated to be the same, the general equilibrium effect, T           , is quite heterogeneous because countries
have different characteristics such as size and openness, the standard deviation is 95, but nearly all pairs
have positive effects. Given this heterogeneity it would have been useful to calculate the aggregate trade
effect of PTAs, since some of the larger percent increases could apply to pairs with small amounts of trade.
         It is also important to note that this approach allows us to quantify the impact of PTA on trade with
non-members, which falls by 9% on average with declines for about two thirds of the pairs. Thus PTAs not
only create trade between members but also divert some away from non-members. We return to the issues
of trade creation versus diversion and third country externalities in sections 5 and 6.
         This analysis can in principle be extended to analyze other counterfactuals, e.g. the impacts of
removing specific PTAs. Moreover, the class of model estimated has a simple measure of welfare change
that depends only on the change of trade openness, which can be computed from the counterfactual, and
the partial trade elasticity. It would be interesting to calculate these and examine if particular PTAs
generate higher welfare for a country than others. For example, some models predict higher welfare gains
from regional PTAs, which may be less prone to trade diversion if most of the trade is regional. Krishna
(2003) examines this question using a different approach. He estimates a demand system resulting from a
general equilibrium perfect competition model to obtain the price effects of a US preferential tariff
reduction and does not find evidence that the welfare gains are larger if the PTAs are with closer countries.


                                                        29
        Caliendo and Parro (2015) evaluate the impact of a specific agreement, NAFTA, using a multi-sector
Ricardian model that incorporates sectorial linkages and intermediates goods’ trade. They also find very
heterogeneous trade effects for members ranging from 118% for Mexico to 11% for Canada. These
translate into modest welfare increases for Mexico, 1.3%, and small changes for the US and Canada. As
Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) notice the quantitative trade predictions are better aligned with the
data than the predictions of earlier CGE models, but the reason for this is unclear. 42 Further quantitative
work will likely bridge some of the gap between the parsimony and clear micro foundations of these new
quantitative approaches and the level of detail in typical CGE approaches. 43
        Caliendo et al (2016) use a framework similar to Caliendo and Parro (2015) to quantify the trade
welfare gains of the Uruguay Round (UR) and PTAs in 1990-2010. They find the welfare effect of PTAs was
very small, 0.3%, particularly when compared to the almost 6% increase found for the UR. Underlying the
small welfare gains for PTAs is the small trade effects of these agreements in their model. How can these
small trade effects consistent with the earlier evidence we provided? I believe this is due to their
measurement of PTAs as simply a tariff reduction. As our evidence in Table 3 shows, PTAs had small effects
on applied tariffs in 1990-2010 and when these small changes are applied to a trade elasticity of 5.5 (their
measure for manufacturing) the predicted PTA effect in their model is very modest. 44
        Anderson and Yotov (forthcoming) provide comprehensive estimates of the GE effects of all PTAs
in 1990-2002. They find large trade and welfare effects of PTAs in contrast to Caliendo et al (2016). The
difference in the results is at least in part driven by their distinct approaches in capturing the magnitude of
the PTA shock. Anderson and Yotov retrieve the PTA effect from a structural gravity estimate rather than
using only the part that is implied by observed tariff changes. This reinforces the importance of expanding
our view of PTAs beyond changes in applied tariffs.



4. Economic effects of deeper PTAs

        To understand the effects of recent deeper PTAs we must augment the policy and economic
structure relative to the traditional view. Here I focus on augmenting policy to include current non-tariff
barriers and uncertainty about future policies. The economic structure is augmented to consider
investments in export activities and intermediate goods. I highlight how these features contribute to
understanding the magnitude of the estimated trade effects and their heterogeneity across types of PTAs.
Moreover, I argue that to better understand and quantify the impacts of deeper PTAs we must model and
estimate the effects of specific policies at a disaggregated level and describe how this has been done in a
specific context: trade policy uncertainty.



42 Kehoe (2005) argues that the earlier CGE models can only deliver the observed aggregate effects of NAFTA if we
assume that trade elasticities are unreasonably high and in the “wrong’’ sector.
43 Levchenko and Zhang (2012) use a related approach to compute the welfare gains of Eastern European integration

with the EU. They find Eastern European country welfare increases over 9% on average, with the largest gains going
to those with comparative advantage and technology most different from countries in Western Europe, which are
barely affected (0.16% change in welfare).
44 See also Spearot (Forthcoming) who quantifies the effect of multilateral liberalization and uses the structural model

to evaluate the prospective effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

4.1    Non-tariff barriers

         Section 2 describes how a large fraction of PTAs also aim to reduce NTBs. The NTB policy vector, ν,
includes barriers that are currently applied, e.g. costly customs procedures, import licenses and
harmonization of product standards, as well as rules about contingent protection, e.g. anti-dumping and
countervailing measures. These are diverse in terms of their mechanism and different subsets of them are
included in different PTAs; so any definitive answer on the motives for their inclusion and their impact on
trade requires detailed studies of specific PTAs. Here we ask two narrower questions. 45 First, how much
do PTAs reduce current NTBs? Second, how can the aggregate trade effects of PTAs via NTBs be estimated
and to what extent can they account for the elasticity puzzle?
         If we had a time-varying ad valorem equivalent measure of bilateral NTBs, 𝝊𝝊𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎      𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , then we could
apply an approach similar to the one used to determine the effect of PTAs on tariffs in Table 3. There are
three important measurement issues in obtaining such a measure. First, information about many NTBs are
recorded simply as binary variables. Second, it is not obvious how to aggregate the effects across disparate
NTBs and goods. Third, some NTBs are not measured and/or do not vary bilaterally and others may not
even be recorded.
         Kee et al (2009) address the first two measurement issues. They regress aggregate imports for each
country on a dummy variable equal to unity in the presence of a core NTB. They do this separately for each
good to obtain the trade effect of core NTBs and then divide it by an estimated import demand elasticity to
obtain an ad valorem equivalent. 46 These estimates can be consistently aggregated to compute the uniform
tariff ad valorem equivalent that would generate the same aggregate imports. They combine this and MFN
tariffs to calculate their aggregate impact on trade, which is about 12% on average in 2009, whereas the
corresponding number for the MFN tariff alone was 7.4%. Thus on average if PTAs eliminated all applied
tariff and core NTBs then their ad valorem equivalent reduction would be at most twice as high as if they
eliminated only tariffs.
         An alternative approach is to further explore the predictions of models to infer all applied ad
valorem bilateral trade costs. Novy (2013) shows that different trade models that generate a structural
gravity equation imply that changes in a country’s trade with a partner relative to its domestic trade will
reflect changes in bilateral trade costs. These costs can then be translated into an ad valorem equivalent
using a particular trade elasticity. After netting out the observed bilateral tariffs we obtain an ad valorem
equivalent of all non-tariff bilateral trade costs. These reflect both the NTBs we are interested in as well as
any behind the border policies, changes in transport infrastructure, information costs, etc. More
                                                                           −𝜀𝜀
specifically, when there is a constant trade elasticity we have 𝜙𝜙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 where 𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 is the unobserved total
ad valorem bilateral cost. We can then use the structural gravity equation (1) and trade data to compute
the      following      relative     geometric       average      of     all      bilateral         trade       costs: 47




45 Ederington and Ruta (2016) provide a comprehensive analysis of non-tariff measures.
46 They include price control and monopolistic measures, technical regulations and quantity restrictions.
47 We can see this using the standard gravity framework section 3. Solving equation (1) for the bilateral market access
                                                                        𝜙𝜙 𝜙𝜙     𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇

flows between and within countries we can compute the geometric average of bilateral access between a pair x,m
relative to their internal market access.

and find it is 2.1 log points lower for countries that enter a PTA, slightly more for WTO members. 48 The
corresponding effect for tariff reductions due to a PTA was 2 log points. They do not examine the trade
effect of PTAs in their sample or estimate the trade elasticity directly. So at most we can say that at the
elasticity used, 7, the estimates imply PTAs increase trade by 28 log points, roughly half of it due to tariff
reductions. The other half is accounted by reductions in all applied bilateral trade costs, of which NTBs as
we defined them earlier are only a fraction.
         The evidence above suggests that incorporating applied NTBs can contribute to but not fully
account for the trade impacts of PTAs described in section 3. Recall that our estimates in Table 3 required
a preferential reduction in protection at least five times higher than observed. But incorporating the ad
valorem equivalent of NTBs leads to at most a doubling of protection. This is true whether we define NTBs
narrowly, as in Kee et al (2009) or broadly, as in Hayakawa and Kimura (2014).
         The NTB related effects of PTAs have attracted particular interest in the context of TTIP. Francois
et al (2013) estimate this agreement can increase EU exports to the US by 28% and increase EU GDP by
0.5% with up to 80% of this arising from a reduction of 25% in non-tariff barriers. Ex-ante estimates of
such trade effects require us to specify at a minimum (i) a particular model, (ii) a channel through which a
specific NTB operates and (iii) a trade elasticity and associated ad valorem change. Francois et al (2013)
use a version of GTAP with a rich economic structure and assume the 25% NTB reduction takes the form
of a marginal cost reduction (implemented as an iceberg trade cost or a tax). But it is also reasonable that
NTBs take the form of a fixed cost in which case the implied trade elasticity would be different. The
magnitude of the NTB reduction is guided by firm survey data on perceived costs of exporting to different
markets, which are combined with gravity estimation to generate an ad valorem equivalent.
         A useful approach to measuring the impact of NTBs is to focus on a subset and examine
disaggregated data as done by Chen and Mattoo (2008). They explore industry data for a panel of 42
countries over 1986 to 2001 and find that agreements including harmonization and mutual recognition of
product standards increase bilateral trade between members. 49 Additional work along these lines but that
would simultaneously include tariff barriers to estimate trade elasticities can generate credible ad valorem
equivalent measures of changes in NTBs.
         In sum, incorporating NTBs explicitly in PTA models can contribute to explain their trade impacts,
even if only partially. Doing so requires careful modelling and measurement of the type of barrier and the
channel(s) through which it affects trade. This is fertile ground for future work. Reducing non-tariff
barriers can be particularly important when firms rely heavily on intermediates and/or can re-arrange
their production structure across borders, an issue to which we now turn.




48 The result is obtained by regressing the measure on lagged PTA indicators, a bilateral fixed effect and time effects
for a sample of up to 158 countries yearly from 1995-2010.
49 They find it may divert it from non-members if there are strict rules of origin. The effect of NTBs on non-members

is an important area for research as we discuss in section 6.
                                                                     32
4.2      Intermediates and vertical integration

         A substantial fraction of trade takes the form of intermediate goods. Moreover, a frequently cited
reason for PTAs is to allow members to break up production to either explore economies of scale or reduce
production costs by setting up labor intensive activities in lower wage countries (WTR, 2011). 50
         The impact of a tariff reduction on intermediate goods can easily be magnified when they crisscross
borders at different stages of production. Yi (2003) shows how vertical integration can magnify the impacts
of tariffs, particularly at low protection levels (when there is already a reasonable amount of specialization).
To my knowledge there is no direct empirical test of this channel in the context of PTAs. Doing so requires
us to consider an economic structure that augments the traditional models used to evaluate PTAs to
incorporate intermediates and allow for non-linear trade cost elasticities with respect to trade costs such
as tariffs. I conjecture that two basic predictions would result from such a model and support for them
would be consistent with the magnification hypothesis. The first prediction is that trade elasticities are
decreasing in trade costs such as tariffs and the one is that PTAs would increase trade by more in industries
where intermediates are more important.
         Using the aggregate data from section 3 we find some support for the first prediction. More
specifically, we re-run the specification in (4c) including a quadratic tariff term and obtain the following
                   𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
marginal effect:                = −5.8 + 11𝜏𝜏, which is precisely estimated. This implies the elasticity at zero tariffs
                       𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
is greater than its value at the sample median tariff of 4.5 log points, i.e. 𝜀𝜀(𝜏𝜏 = 0) =5.8> 5.3 = 𝜀𝜀(𝜏𝜏 = 4.5).
At the 75th percentile of tariffs the elasticity is 4.5 with a 95% confidence interval that does not overlap with
the estimate for 𝜀𝜀(𝜏𝜏 = 0). The estimated PTA indicator coefficient is now smaller, indicating that it was
accounting for some of this non-linear tariff effect. This may be consistent with the intermediates
magnification channel, but it is also consistent with PTAs increasing trade elasticities due to a different
channel, e.g. by reducing uncertainty about future tariff changes.
         Orefice and Rocha (2014) examine the trade effect of 66 PTAs via a gravity equation between 1980-
2007 estimated separately for final goods and intermediates (i.e. parts and components). They find nearly
the exact same effect for each type of industry. They also test and find that deeper PTAs, which address
issues that could promote the integration of production, do not have a stronger effect on intermediates than
on final goods. 51 Moreover, those effects are similar in more recent subsamples. While the effects of deeper
PTAs are similar across the types of trade, the authors find that the probability of their formation is higher
between countries with a larger share of trade in parts and components, particularly if one country is low-
income. Thus the potential to share production networks may influence the selection of PTA partners.
         The presence of intermediates that can be sourced internationally complicates the measurement of
the effects of PTAs. For example, the magnification hypothesis arises in part because trade flows are
measured in terms of gross values. The magnification effect of a tariff reduction would not necessarily be
present if we measured the value added in production by the PTA partner. Johnson and Noguera (2014)
construct bilateral measures of value added trade for 42 countries and document its evolution between
1970-2009 and across countries.



50   Blanchard et al (2016) provide evidence that supply chain linkages affect trade policy, as discussed in section 5.
51 The PTA depth measure for 66 agreements is based on the principal components of the WTO+ and WTO-x categories

described in section 2.
                                                            33
         They find an average PTA effect of 0.5 for gross exports, similar in approach and magnitude to what
we report in column 5 of Table 2. When they instead use value added exports as the dependent variable
the average PTA effect is 0.39. The difference between gross and value added exports is statistically
significant and indicates that PTAs lead to an increase in the share of trade that embodies intermediates
sourced from another country. This could be because country x is now sourcing more intermediates from
m and then selling the final good to m. But it is also consistent with a third country setting up new
production in x to assemble the good and x as an export platform to m. We would need additional
information about the full supply chain of the product to distinguish between these alternatives and
determine if the evidence supports the magnification hypothesis. Johnson and Noguera (2014) also provide
evidence that in the context of their model PTAs reduce ad valorem bilateral trade costs and tend to do so
by more for trade in intermediates, 20-25%, than in final goods, 12-21% (after 15 years). 52
         In order to understand the economic mechanism and role of specific policy changes in PTAs it is
useful to consider specific agreements. This permits a more detailed production and policy structure where
key parameters such as trade elasticities can be consistently estimated and then employed for
quantification. A recent example of such an approach is Caliendo and Parro (2015). They report that in
1993 between 72% and 82% of imports of NAFTA countries from each other took the form of intermediate
goods. They build a multi-sector model with intermediates and estimate heterogeneous trade elasticites
across sectors. They find that incorporating intermediates increases the aggregate trade effects of NAFTA’s
tariff reductions. It would be interesting to isolate the importance of intermediates in other agreements
and incorporate changes in NTBs as well.

4.3      Trade policy uncertainty as a motive for trade agreements
         In section 2 we described the depth of policy cooperation in PTAs goes beyond currently applied
tariffs and non-tariff barriers. It also includes provisions about future policies such as tariff bindings and
contingent protection. In this section we review recent theory and evidence that suggests that PTAs reduce
expected protection and uncertainty about future policy and that by securing future market access PTAs
increase current trade-related investments and trade volume. I will also argue how certain types of trade
policy uncertainty (TPU) models can help explain the heterogeneous trade effects of PTAs.
         To understand the impacts of deeper PTAs we must model and estimate the effects of specific
policies at a disaggregated level. This subsection describes how this has been done in the context TPU.
     •    Sources of trade policy uncertainty (TPU)
       A reasonable starting point for examining the motives for deeper PTAs is to ask what their stated
goals are. One of them is for PTAs to `ensure a predictable environment for business planning and
investment’; as stated in several agreements undertaken by the US, EU and several developing countries. 53
This motive is present in other trade agreements, for example the WTO states that "Just as important as



52 The basic approach is to attribute the purely bilateral trade differences predicted by the model relative to the data
to a trade wedge, converted to an ad valorem equivalent using a trade elasticity, 4, (so similar in spirit to what is
discussed in the NTB section). This measure is then regressed on PTA indicators, a bilateral pair and country by year
effects, as we did in Table 3 for tariffs.
53 For examples see the texts in Global PTA Database at <wits.worldbank.org/GPTAD>.

                                                          34
freer trade -- perhaps more important -- are other principles of the WTO system. For example: non-
discrimination, and making sure the conditions for trade are stable, predictable and transparent." Despite
these stated objectives, until recently the literature on agreements mostly treated trade policy as
deterministic. It is thus important to understand why and to point out some potential sources of TPU.
         One possible reason why TPU has been under-researched is the perception that trade policy is not
very volatile; after all statutory tariff rates are legislated at most on a yearly basis. However, this perceived
low volatility in statutory tariffs is a misleading guide for the degree of TPU for two reasons. First, even if
statutory trade reforms are infrequent when they occur the changes can be quite large and persistent, as
documented by Bown and Crowley (forthcoming). Second, applied trade policy is more volatile than
statutory tariff rates due to NTBs that are not strictly regulated by the WTO. While some of these are meant
to be "temporary" they can remain in place for months or years (cf. Bown, 2011).
         The ability to use unregulated trade policies can interact with macroeconomic or political shocks to
generate considerable uncertainty. For example, there was widespread fear that the 2008 economic crisis
would result in a substantial increase in protectionism. This included the possibility of anti-dumping
measures, increases in developing country tariffs from their applied level to the maximum allowed under
the WTO, and the use of government procurement measures to favor national firms. These fears were
reasonable since there is evidence that protection responds to a variety of economic shocks such as
aggregate downturns (cf. Bown and Crowley, 2013). Even though the worst fears of a trade war were not
realized, its possibility created uncertainty, as evidenced by governments repeated assurances that they
would not resort to 1930's type protectionism.
         The possibility of a rare event such as trade war should only be a concern if it leads to very high
protection. That was clearly the case in the 1930’s and a clear example remains in the form of US column 2
tariffs that are applied to certain non-WTO members and are on average 35%. Moreover, there is evidence
that countries have substantial import market power and explore it when they are not bound by
agreements such as the WTO (Broda et al, 2008); this incentive is less pronounced when they accede
(Bagwell and Staiger, 2011) but does not disappear (Ludema and Mayda, 2013). Finally, Ossa (2014)
estimates optimal tariffs for individual countries in 2007 and the median is about 60%. 54
         Another possible source of TPU is domestic political shocks, e.g. due to changes in government or
lobbying pressures. Amador and Bagwell (2013) show that if governments have private information about
those shocks, there are contracting imperfections and terms-of-trade externalities then it would be optimal
for an agreement such as the WTO to impose tariff bindings. Such an agreement lowers TPU and increases
trade. More broadly, agreements such as the WTO can also increase transparency and thus the degree of
trade policy cooperation in a repeated game. 55




54   Authors calculations based on the median estimate across all industries and countries.
55 Beshkar and Bond (2012) show how uncertainty coupled with contracting imperfections can explain the use of tariff

bindings. Beshkar et al (Forthcoming) model the relationship between tariff bindings and applied tariffs in the
negotiation of agreements and study their empirical relationship with importer market power. In certain cases it may
be optimal for the agreement to allow for policy variability as a way to sustain cooperation in periods when the
incentive to defect in a repeated game is high, e.g. if there are terms-of-trade motives for protection and import
volumes increase (cf. Bagwell and Staiger, 1990). These studies typically focus on the optimal policy response to
shocks and uncertainty so we briefly return to them in the context of endogenous policy formation in section 5.
                                                           35
        While WTO accession may lower uncertainty about future protection, it does not eliminate it. There
are ongoing negotiations, as described in section 2 and when negotiations are finalized there is uncertainty
in terms of implementation and the possibility of substitution towards unregulated policies, particularly in
times of economic crisis. Moreover, there are issues on which its members have not agreed and have the
potential to trigger disputes and high protection. These include (i) quality and safety concerns that raise
the possibility of product bans, e.g. genetically modified foods in the EU; (ii) the US threat of import duties
to counter Chinese currency manipulation; (iii) the possibility of using "environmental" duties at the border
to offset differences in carbon emissions in production.
        Deeper PTAs can reduce TPU arising from some of these sources. First, to the extent that certain
barriers are eliminated and bound at zero there is less risk of future renegotiation. Second, countries with
more similar preferences may be able to agree on standards and various non-economic policies and include
mechanisms for cooperating in them and reduce the risk of them triggering future protection. More
generally, it seems plausible that certain PTAs can reduce TPU by securing low (often zero) tariff rates that
are fixed over time and less subject to being eroded via policy substitution (either temporary, e.g. anti-
dumping, or permanent, e.g. product standards) and (ii) integrating the economies to make a trade war
extremely costly. We now discuss whether there is evidence for these hypotheses.
   •    Direct evidence of TPU reductions via agreements
        There are different dimensions of TPU. Some of these are directly observable, e.g. tariff volatility
over time, how frequently contingent policy is used, how frequently a policy regime is reviewed and/or
cancelled. In this section I review the evidence of the impact of PTAs on each of these dimensions. Other
dimensions of TPU are harder to detect and measure and addressed in the next subsection.
        Two pieces of evidence suggest that agreements lower volatility in trade policy. First, tariffs in
developed countries may not be very volatile simply because they have long been members of trade
agreements or because their tariffs are never volatile. To address this issue Limão and Maggi (2015)
examine the average US tariff over pre and post agreement years, namely from 1860-1960. The standard
deviation of that policy (over time) before 1934 is at least twice as high as during 1934-61 -- a period
marked by the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act (1934) and the signing of GATT (1948). They note that the
higher volatility of US trade policy before 1934 reflects the Smoot-Hawley tariff hike of 1930 but also
several prior major changes in the tariff code. Second, Cadot et al (2010) provide econometric evidence of
the impact of PTAs on policy volatility. They use a panel of changes in price distortions introduced by
agricultural trade policies and find that the absolute value of that change falls when countries enter PTAs.
        As countries lower tariffs in PTAs they may use contingent protection to deal with particular shocks.
By this measure PTAs could increase TPU towards members. Prusa and Teh (2010) examine this question
and find the opposite. They estimate that anti-dumping provisions in PTAs lowered AD cases between
members by as much as 55%. But they find PTAs increased AD towards non-members, which suggests a
TPU externality that we discuss in section 6.
        An alternative to examining the impact of accessions to an agreement is to examine if adoption of
specific parts of it affect TPU. Groppo and Piermartini (2014) for example examine the impact of WTO tariff
bindings on the probability of MFN tariff increases. Using HS-6 data from 1996-2001 for all WTO members
they find that bindings reduce the probability of increases in the MFN applied rate.


                                                      36
        It is important to note that not all PTAs reduce TPU and in fact some may increase it. For example,
unilateral preferences such as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provide recipients with tariffs
below MFN but these are subject to renewal and cancellation risk by the "donors" (the US, EU and other
developed countries). Temporary and permanent cancellations do occur and have negative impact on
recipient exports. 56 This has been recognized and one of the objectives in the recent reform of the GSP by
the EU was to put it in force for a longer period, 10 years instead of 3, to `enhance stability and
predictability’ and `improv(e) certainty for business operators’”. This type of change provides an example
of an increase in PTA depth that reduces TPU. Ornelas (2016) provides additional discussion of GSP
uncertainty for its recipients.
        Similarly to GSP, other unilateral preferential programs are subject to renewal and cancellation.
This has lead countries to seek deeper, reciprocal agreements to extend and secure pre-existing
preferences. Two examples are Peru and Colombia, which sought and obtained reciprocal PTAs with the
US and argued this security would be important for export investments (cf. USITC, 2008). There are other
examples for the EU, one of which we will examine below.
        A final point to note is that even if we do not observe any volatility in a given policy over a certain
period this does not imply there is no TPU. If exporting firms believe that a sufficiently large shock would
change future trade policy they will take this information into account. Whether and how exactly they do
so depends on the mechanism linking TPU and their investment decisions, which we now describe.

4.4    A trade policy uncertainty-investment mechanism

   •    Mechanism
        One obvious channel through which future trade policy can affect current trade values is via firm
investments in the tradable sector. However, whether foreign TPU increases or decreases a country’s
exports to that market is not obvious. We briefly describe why and then focus on an option value
mechanism that generates a negative impact of TPU on export investments and trade. The mechanism is
tractable and seems to capture the concerns voiced by businesses in the context of trade policy.
        Limão and Maggi (2015) use a standard general equilibrium model and ask under what conditions
governments would choose to form an agreement to reduce TPU. They show that TPU lowers investment
and trade only if there is sufficient income risk aversion. This is a necessary condition to overcome a basic
force present in most standard models when agents make ex-ante decisions based on expected values.
Suppose for example that a firm must make a once and for all decision on whether to invest in an export
related activity based on its expected value. A mean preserving spread of the product price increases that
expected value if the firm can adjust any of its inputs ex-post to take advantage of a price change. This
convexity of profits with respect to product prices implies that increases in foreign tariff risk can actually
increase exports unless there is sufficient income risk aversion.
        Handley and Limão (2015) explore an alternative mechanism that generates a negative relationship
between TPU and exports. There is evidence that exporting requires sunk investments that are at least




56 See trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib /docs/2013/december/tradoc_152015.pdf, which also notes that in 2014 the EU

cancelled 86 of the 176 GSP beneficiaries.
                                                      37
partially irreversible. If policy is sufficiently persistent then firms can wait to observe the policy conditions
and invest only if they are sufficiently favorable. Thus TPU generates an option value for export related
investments and reduces the mass of exporters and export value. Handley and Limão (2013) extend the
mechanism to productivity enhancing sunk cost investments and show that TPU can thus also reduce
exports of incumbent firms.
        To understand some of the evidence below it is useful to outline the basic elements of their model.
After any export related investments, firms choose production to maximize operating profits subject to a
CES demand as in a Melitz-Chaney model with heterogeneous productivity. Thus the export investments
are the only decisions made under uncertainty. To do so firms observe current policy and the policy regime
(the probability it will change and the distribution of values if it does) and invest if the present discounted
value of doing so net of the sunk cost exceeds the optimal value of waiting until the foreign barrier is lower
or less uncertain. The optimal stopping problem generates the following marginal cost cutoff below which
all firms from x enter m at t,
                                           𝑢𝑢                                    ℎ𝑖𝑖          𝑑𝑑
                                         𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝑈𝑈�𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 � ∗ 𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
            𝑑𝑑
where 𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥  is the cutoff in the absence of TPU and 𝑈𝑈 < 1 is the uncertainty term, which implies less entry
under uncertainty.
           The uncertainty term reflects the exporting firms’ belief that with probability 𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 the current
                                                                        ℎ𝑖𝑖
policy in the export market, 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , will increase to some value 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 . An increase in uncertainty measured
by higher probability that the policy will increase or decrease relative to the current value implies a higher
𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 and a lower expected value of current entry even if the expected value of the tariff is unchanged. This
is an example of the bad news principle and reflects the fact that if conditions improve the firm can enter
and take advantage of it, but if it is already in and conditions deteriorate it suffers a profit loss.
           The model generates a functional form for 𝑈𝑈 that reflects the proportional profits lost conditional
                                                                                                       ℎ𝑖𝑖
on a bad shock, which is a function of the current tariff and a counterfactual value 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥              . Since the
deterministic cutoff takes a form similar to Chaney (2008) we can combine these to write a TPU augmented
gravity equation.
   •    TPU augmented industry gravity
        This mechanism allows us to study the impact of TPU and PTAs that may affect it on different
measures of exports and related investments. Here we briefly discuss how two of them can be analyzed
using an industry gravity approach. We first focus on export values to easily build on and compare with
section 3. We will then point out the relationship with number of firms and resulting entry investments.
        Export values
        Since the TPU mechanism provides an expression of the marginal firm in terms of TPU we can use
a particular productivity distribution, say Pareto, to aggregate firm export sales for a given industry V and
derive a theory-consistent TPU augmented gravity equation. Using the structural gravity notation in section
3 we can write it as follows:

                                        ln 𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = ln 𝜙𝜙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥                                (9)

                                                                                     ℎ𝑖𝑖
                                ln 𝜙𝜙𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 ≡ 𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈 ln 𝑈𝑈�𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 � − 𝜀𝜀𝜏𝜏 ln 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 − 𝜀𝜀𝑑𝑑 ln 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 +𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥


                                                                        38
            There are two basic differences between (9) and the aggregate specification in (4b). First, (9)
applies to each industry so there is an additional dimension of variation. The model imposes some structure
and yields multilateral terms, 𝛼𝛼.𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼.𝑉𝑉 , that are log separable into aggregate and industry specific
components. 57
            The more fundamental difference between (9) and (4b) is the bilateral market access function.
Instead of estimating the partial PTA effect as an average treatment (9) models changes in current and
future policy. In principle we can use any observable policy with bilateral effects, but the existing research
has focused on different types of tariffs and thus so will we. In the absence of policy uncertainty (or
conditional on it) the partial elasticity of trade with respect to applied tariffs is 𝜀𝜀𝜏𝜏 > 0. If exporters believe
there is a risk, measured by the probability 𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , that protection will increase from its current level to 𝜏𝜏ℎ𝑖𝑖
                                                                                                                  𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
then there will be lower investment in export related activities and ln 𝑈𝑈 < 0 so exports are lower, so 𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈 >
0. Note also that if ln 𝑈𝑈 = 0 then (9) reduces to a standard industry gravity equation, hence the TPU
augmented gravity.
            The bilateral access function also controls for trade costs not included in the policy terms. Namely,
it includes observed changes in trade costs (insurance and freight in 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 ) as well as unobserved factors,
𝛼𝛼𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 . The latter avoids the type of bilateral selection bias discussed in section 3 and implies that the
identification is obtained from changes in applied policy and uncertainty surrounding it. How we measure
uncertainty depends on the specific setting as described below.
            In section 3 we provided evidence that at reasonable values of current estimates of trade elasticities
𝜀𝜀̃ the observed tariff changes in PTAs were typically too low, or alternatively, the required elasticity given
those tariffs, too high. From (9) it should be clear that one way that TPU can help explain this is by taking
into account changes in future protection, i.e. adjusting for the fact that exports before the PTA were
depressed. A second and less obvious implication is that if TPU is present but ignored then estimates of the
tariff elasticity are biased downwards. This attenuation effect is simply due to the fact that under
uncertainty some of the current tariff change is expected to be reversed. Thus if ex-ante we used such tariff
elasticity estimates to predict the impact of a given tariff change in a PTA we would under predict the true
outcome if the PTA also lowered uncertainty. To the extent that countries with lower tariffs may also have
lower uncertainty, our earlier finding that the tariff elasticity is higher at lower levels may reflect an
uncertainty effect. But we can test the mechanism directly.
        Firms/varieties
        If we are interested in the impact of the PTA on export investments or the number of exporting
firms (or varieties) we can also employ the approach just outlined by using the number of firms (or
varieties) as a dependent variable. Moreover, under a Pareto distribution the interpretation of the
parameters is unchanged except that the structural interpretation of 𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈 is different, and we expect it to be
smaller in the export equation because entering firms are smaller on average.

4.5    Ex-post trade and firm/variety entry investment estimates of deeper PTAs




57 These capture exporter aggregate cost shocks and productivity parameters, importer expenditure shocks and

changes in multilateral resistance terms
                                                           39
       We now describe the application of this framework in different settings. To illustrate the main
points we focus on a specific application and then briefly list the others.
   •     Expanding and securing existing preferences
            Some PTAs that involve non-reciprocal and/or temporary preferences can leave exporters with
considerable uncertainty about future market access. We discuss examples in the introduction of this
section. One other example was Portugal’s access to the EC and Spanish markets prior to 1986. As part of
EFTA Portugal enjoyed duty-free access to the EC in industrial products since 1977 and faced Spanish tariffs
that were about half of that country’s MFN tariff since the early 1980’s. After accession these tariffs went
to zero and importantly were no longer expected to change.
            Handley and Limão (2015) show that even focusing on the years immediately after accession there
was extremely strong entry of Portuguese exporters to serve those markets. Using Portuguese exports and
the aggregate gravity approach in (4b) they estimate a partial effect, 𝜙𝜙� of 23 log points for the EC and 115
for Spain. The EC tariff reductions were minimal so clearly something else must explain the effect. Spain’s
tariff reductions were on average 6.6 log points, which requires a tariff elasticity of 17.4 to account for the
effect---a clear example of the elasticity puzzle.
            These authors then analyze to what extent the puzzle can be explained by the reduction of TPU, i.e.
the fact that accession may have permanently secured pre-existing preferences and/or reduced applied
protection. To do so they apply the approach in (9) and measure the proportion of profits lost for any given
                                                                                 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 )𝜎𝜎
firm in industry V conditional on losing the preferences as 1 − (𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 /𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚       where x is Portugal, 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 is
                                                                                         𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
the applied tariff it faces in market m=Spain or any of EC-10 countries and 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is the counterfactual that
it would face if it lost the preferences, which they take to be those countries MFN tariffs on GATT members.
For a given 𝜎𝜎 we can construct this measure and estimate (9) where the parameter on this variable is time
varying only to the extent that firms change their belief about the probability of losing the preferences. So
if 𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 > 0 prior to the agreement and it falls or is zero after this indicates that the PTA reduced TPU.
            Using firm-level exports they estimate the effect of accession on industry net entry by Portuguese
firms and their total exports to the EC and Spain. They find evidence of a positive probability of reversal
before 1986 but not after. The combined policy effect on firm entry growth is 61% and on export growth it
is 87%. Even though these are calculated using only applied tariffs and their potential future changes, they
account for a large fraction of the values actually observed.
   •     Average treatment versus policy effects
        To understand the relation of the TPU gravity with the aggregate partial effect we consider the
findings for exports to Spain. Recall that the aggregate partial effect for Spain was , 𝜙𝜙� = 1.15 .In any given
industry the combined policy effect if TPU is removed is given by
                                               � 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡
                                               ϕ 𝑉𝑉 =−𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈 ln 𝑈𝑈𝑉𝑉 − 𝜀𝜀𝜏𝜏 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑉𝑉 .

        So the average aggregate effect is simply a weighted average of these, which is equal to 85 log points
for Spain. If tariffs had not changed then the only contribution would come from the uncertainty term, i.e.




                                                             40
from securing pre-existing preferences, which is estimated to be 20 log points. 58 A less obvious impact of
eliminating TPU is that it increases the elasticity of any given tariff change by ensuring that it will not be
reversed. They estimate that if tariffs had been reduced but uncertainty had not then exports would have
grown by 45 log points. Thus the remaining 20 log points represent the role of TPU reduction in locking-in
those tariff reductions. In sum, if the accession had only lowered Spanish tariffs then we would be able to
account for less than 40% of the average treatment effect (45/115) and accounting for TPU brings this
number up to about 75%.
     •   PTAs as insurance against trade wars
         After the 2008 financial crisis, trade fell much faster than income worldwide, a puzzle for standard
trade models and typical estimates of the income elasticity of trade. The current explanations for this
episode can account for some of the trade decline but ignore the subsequent fast recovery. More
importantly they are silent about the impacts of the potential trade war that was feared by policy makers.
         To place this event in perspective, note that in 2009, word trade fell by 12%, the largest decline
since the great depression (10%), but income fell only 2.7% vs. 20% for industrial output in depression
Eichengreen & O’Rourke (2009). Moreover, the WTO (2011) shows that applied trade barriers affected only
1% of trade and Kee et al (2013) estimate these accounted for less than 2% of the collapse. In contrast,
trade barriers in the great depression increased by as much as 35% for US, Germany and France and
accounted for large fraction of decline according to Madsen (2001).
         One important difference relative to the Depression is the current network of trade agreements.
These include the GATT/WTO, which was created in response to the 1930’s trade war to prevent a re-
occurrence and this role was noted during the crisis. 59 While this institution did not fully eliminate the
possibility of a trade war its monitoring mechanism may have helped prevent it from realizing. It is also
possible that the extensive network of PTAs may have reduced the probability of a trade war between
partners. The question is whether and how we may test these hypothesis and quantify their implications.
         Carballo, Handley and Limão (2015) examine the role of PTAs as insurance against trade wars. They
extend Handley and Limão (2015) to encompass an exit margin and allow for demand uncertainty both
from policy and income shocks, and they further allow for policy uncertainty to increase as a result of higher
income uncertainty as suggested by the great trade collapse (GTC). The model has several predictions. The
key ones are that if a PTA reduces TPU then
(i)     the increase in income uncertainty during the GTC would have lowered exports to non-PTA markets
by relatively more (since in PTA markets there would not been much of an increase in TPU) and this effect
is stronger for the extensive margin, i.e. relatively more net exit of firms/varieties from non-PTA markets.




58 Evaluating this change at the long-run mean tariff yields the pure mean risk reduction effect, which is estimated to
be about 73% of the uncertainty reduction at initial tariffs.
59 In 2009 its Director General Pascal Lamy stated that “Today as the economic crisis bites into our economies, and as

protectionist pressures knock on our doors, we must recall the importance of the insurance policy against
protectionism that the WTO offers through 60 years of global rule-making, and its dispute settlement system.”

                                                          41
(ii)     in non-PTA markets the effects in (i) are stronger in industries where market power is higher so
exporters fear higher losses in case of a trade war. But in PTA markets there should be no differential effect
across industries if there is no probability of a trade war.
        To test these predictions they use US firm-level data. They first establish that the extensive margin
accounts for 43% of the collapse in US exports to non-PTA but only 28% for PTA (in Q3-08 to Q3-09). They
then construct measures of income uncertainty in export markets and estimate if these had differential
impacts on US exporters’ entry and exit over time, PTA membership and market power. They find this
measure of uncertainty leads to a reduction in varieties that was 10 percentage points higher for non-PTA
markets than PTAs between Q4-08 and Q3-10. This differential disappeared after Q4-10 when it was
apparent that no trade war was imminent. Furthermore, the reduction in varieties exported to non-PTA
was larger for relatively higher market power industries.
        The relatively lower net exit from PTA markets caused by economic uncertainty translated into
relatively higher exports during the crisis. 60 Thus the current evidence suggests PTAs can play an important
role in insuring against potential trade wars. Further analysis would be important in estimating and
quantifying this channel in other settings.

4.6   Other evidence and future work
         There is also evidence that the WTO increases trade via reductions in TPU. Handley (2014) uses
panel data for Australia and finds that higher uncertainty, as measured by the gap between applied MFN
and bound tariffs lowers the probability of importing an HS-8 product. Deason (2014) applies his
methodology to a broad cross-section of countries at the HS-6 level and finds similar results for the typical
country in the sample.
         TPU also provides a possible explanation why PTAs can have heterogeneous effects. If firms do not
believe the current policy changes are credible then their response will be attenuated. Therefore, the depth
of PTAs, as measured by the credibility of the provisions and the presence of enforcement mechanisms is
critical in generating investment and trade effects.
         The potential heterogeneity in PTAs indicates there is a high value for future research of specific
agreements, which should take into account actual policies and their potential worst case counterfactuals.
Doing so with aggregate data is not feasible because of aggregation bias and the small sample issues
described in section 3. However, we can explore detailed product and firm level data and a particular
framework to aggregate the results if so desired. This section also highlights the importance of using
dynamic models to better understand and estimate the impacts of PTAs both their formation and how they
transmit shocks. 61
         One important policy implication of the research on TPU is that PTAs can have large trade effects
even if tariffs and NTBs are relatively low. The WTO (2011) pointed that only 16% of world trade took place
under positive preferential margins and interpreted this to mean that the motive for current PTAs must no




60 This can help to explain why the share of US exports to PTAs, which had declined almost 5 percentage points
between 2005 and the start of the crisis, stabilized and increased moderately since 2009.
61 Ruhl (2004) argues that PTAs can generate export entry by permanently lowering trade frictions, which

strengthens response to future macro variable shocks.
                                                     42
longer be tied to reducing tariff barriers. This ignores the fact that PTAs can reduce uncertainty about future
protection and act as an insurance against trade wars. Thus even if current tariffs are low PTAs can still
have important discriminatory effects against non-members, which we discuss in section 6.

5. PTA Formation and Policies: Motives and Determinants

        Thus far we summarized key features of PTAs and their effects on trade and related policies. In the
process we discussed some of the stated objectives of PTAs and how accounting for their endogenous
formation affects the estimation of their impacts. This section focuses on the determinants of the formation
of PTAs and of preferential tariffs.
        The starting point is the motives for traditional static PTAs and the evidence that focuses directly
on the mechanisms behind them: trade diversion and terms-of-trade effects. I then describe some non-
traditional motives for PTAs and evidence for some mechanisms underlying them, which have received less
empirical attention. In section 5.2 I discuss the empirical determinants of (i) PTAs between pairs of
countries and (ii) endogenous preferential tariff levels.

5.1       Motives and Mechanisms
      •    Traditional
        Most empirical work on the economic determinants of PTAs focuses on trade related motives. We
start by describing the traditional motives for forming a PTA and the evidence for the mechanisms behind
them such as trade diversion and price effects of PTAs.
           Trade creation and diversion
        The main question that the traditional analysis of PTAs asks is if exogenously lowering tariffs
between a pair of countries increases the social welfare of members and non-members? 62 The answer
depends on the economic structure as well as the pattern of initial and final tariffs. The possibility that the
elimination of distortionary tariffs between two members may reduce their own welfare would appear to
be a special case. But due to Lipsey and Lancaster (1956-7) we now understand it is a basic example of the
principle of the second best: if the initial tariffs are not at their unilateral optimum then an exogenous
change in them will generally have an ambiguous welfare effect.
        One of the contributions of the traditional analysis of PTAs is to show under what conditions
exogenous PTAs generate net welfare losses for members and non-members. The resulting insights have
provided a guide for the initial empirical analysis of the economic determinants of PTA formation. The basic
trade off that arises in many of these models is that a PTA lowers the cost and distortion from the PTA
member and in doing so leads to trade creation, but it can also generate trade diversion: a substitution away
from the non-member. Viner (1950) shows that if the non-member is the lower cost supplier then the trade
diversion cost can offset the gain from trade creation.
        In section 3 we provided evidence of positive partial PTA effects between members. What do those
theoretically consistent gravity estimates by themselves tell us about diversion vs. creation? Not much.



62   See Krishna (2008) for a review of the related literature.
                                                             43
Recall from equation (5) that the partial PTA estimate identifies the increase in member trade relative to
non-members. So the 60 log point increase in Table 2 may be all due to creation and no diversion or the
opposite or any combination of the two. If in addition we could estimate the aggregate impact of the PTA
for a given importer we could determine diversion but that aggregate impact is subsumed in the importer
fixed effects. 63
         We describe two approaches to explore bilateral trade flows to determine the extent of trade
diversion. The first takes advantage of a structural model to disentangle the two effects. Egger et al (2011)
estimate the average partial PTA effect, translate it into an AVE and implement the counterfactual of no
PTAs in the context of an Armington model. They compute the general equilibrium trade of PTA members
with non-members, which falls by 9% on average with declines for about two thirds of the pairs. This is a
modest decline relative to the average trade creation between members of 102%. This suggests that on
average PTAs are creating more trade than they divert. However, given the heterogeneity of effects across
countries it would be interesting to calculate this net trade effect by country as well.
         The second approach is to explore additional sources of data variation. Clausing (2001) finds little
effect of CUSFTA on US-Canada trade using an aggregate gravity approach but finds significant increases in
US imports from Canada when using detailed commodity data and tariff changes and using year dummies
to control for aggregate effects. There is no evidence of diversion: the US import share from the rest of the
world does not fall by more in products with higher preferential reductions. 64 In contrast to Clausing
(2001), Romalis (2007) does find substantial trade diversion due to the CUSFTA (and NAFTA). The main
methodological distinction is that the latter study uses differences-in-differences: it examines US imports
from non-members relative to those of the EU and finds larger relative import reductions in HS-6 goods
that obtained larger preference margins. Trefler (2004) also employs disaggregated tariff changes but
focuses on Canadian imports and finds trade diversion.
       Price effects
        We now turn to an alternative outcome---price changes--- which can be informative about the net
changes in trade and welfare due to a PTA. We first describe the link between trade diversion, prices and
welfare for a small country and then consider more generally the role and evidence of terms-of-trade effects
in the context of PTAs.
        How much diversion is required to generate welfare losses for members? In a setting where trade
diversion from a non-member is necessary for a member to lose from a PTA then if they don’t trade there
can be no diversion or net cost from the PTA. This extreme case of no trade with non-members is the basis
for the natural trading partner hypothesis (cf. Krugman, 1991) that claims that the welfare gains from PTAs
are expected to be higher if the partners are “natural” i.e. trade mostly with each other before the PTA.
         Krishna (2003) examines if there is direct evidence for the natural trading partner hypothesis by
exploring price data. He estimates the welfare effects for the US of a unilateral preferential tariff reduction
towards alternative countries. Assuming the US is small and there is an Armington structure the welfare



63 Recall that these are used to control for multilateral resistance---something that is omitted in earlier studies that
attempt to estimate trade diversion, thus we do not discuss those studies.
64 Magee (2015) follows a similar approach and finds that Turkish imports did not exhibit much trade diversion as a

result of its customs union with the EU.
                                                          44
effect is equal to a weighted average of the bilateral trade created with the PTA member and the amount
diverted from non-members, where the weight is the initial tariff faced by each. 65 In this simple setting, if
initial tariffs are identical, we could add up the estimated trade effects to determine welfare for the member.
Instead Krishna (2003) estimates the relevant own and cross price import demand elasticities. The
preferential reduction reduces the US consumer price for the PTA import and the own price elasticity
estimates imply this creates trade but the cross-price elasticities also show there is substitution away from
the non-members (so diversion). The cross-price effects are sufficiently small that US welfare would
increase if it reduced its tariff preferentially with respect to any one of the 24 countries considered. These
ex-ante gains from potential PTAs are not correlated with distance and thus he concludes there is no
evidence for the natural trading partner hypothesis.
          One of the most commonly examined sources of economic policy externalities in the trade setting
is the terms-of-trade externality. Such an externality is present if the price that exporters from x receive in
m, 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 (𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , . ), depends on the latter’s tariff. When the initial tariff is not set cooperatively there will
                            ′
generally be some 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚      that improves the objective in country x so x has a bilateral policy externality motive
for a PTA with m. When there are only two countries this is not only one of, but often the only externality
that standard agreements over tariffs address (cf. Bagwell and Staiger, 2016). 66
           The bilateral terms-of-trade motive for trade agreements is well understood in the context of two
countries. The marginal gain for an exporter x from facing lower tariffs in m reflects increases in its export
price from increased market access to m. The potential cost of the agreement for x (if its initial unilateral
tariff is optimally set) reflects its terms-of-trade motive for a tariff, which when reduced increases its
bilateral import price, i.e. deteriorates its bilateral terms-of-trade. If we only have two countries then any
bilateral terms-of-trade gain by x impose larger losses on m and so some bilateral tariff reduction between
them would be optimal. Thus, all else equal, the bilateral TOT motive predicts PTAs are more likely between
countries with relatively higher bilateral import market power. To my knowledge this has not been directly
tested as a PTA determinant but below we provide a suggestion for doing so.
          We can also relate the terms-of-trade externality to the trade diversion effects of PTAs. Consider a
preferential tariff reduction between x and m while keeping other policies fixed. Assume some substitution
in consumption between member and non-member goods. With three countries we need to consider how
the bilateral tariff affects the multilateral terms-of-trade. The bilateral tariff reduction generates
substitution and thus increases the share of imports from the PTA partner (as estimated by the partial
average PTA effect); moreover if the PTA member is less efficient than the rest-of-the world then this
reallocation towards the relatively more expensive good implies a deterioration of home’s terms-of-trade. 67
           The explanation above provides a basic rationale for a terms-of-trade interpretation of the trade
diversion effect, which has two advantages. First, to determine the welfare effects of PTAs based on a trade
diversion criterion we need to estimate if it occurred, which is not straightforward as discussed above, so




65   Trefler (2004) applies this criteria to argue Canadian welfare increased due to its tariff reductions on US goods.
66 That is the case not only in settings where the government objective reflects social welfare in a perfectly competitive

setting but also when it reflects political economy considerations and in certain non-competitive environments.
67So even if home is small so it does not affect the price received by other countries, the tariff reduction can still
increase its pre-tariff average import price if it shifts demand to the costlier supplier.
                                                             45
having another measure to examine this potential cost of PTAs is useful. Second, even if diversion is present
it is not sufficient to infer welfare effects whereas in certain models we can directly relate price changes to
welfare. For non-members a decline in their terms-of-trade will often be a sufficient statistic for whether
they are harmed (cf. Winters, 1997). For members, if their terms-of-trade relative to the rest of the world
improve then this is an additional benefit to internalizing their bilateral terms-of-trade externality. Some
of these points can and have been formalized and we return to them in section 6.1 when discussing the
existence of necessarily-welfare-enhancing PTAs.
      There is both direct and indirect evidence for the impact of tariffs on prices. The direct evidence
                                                                   𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝
examines the impact of tariffs on either (i) the same good’s price, 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , or (ii) on the price received by a
                                                                         𝜕𝜕𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
               𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤
non-member                . The first effect is the standard tariff pass-through effect and evidence for it was
               𝜕𝜕𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
pioneered by Kreinin (1961), which finds that US reductions in its multilateral tariffs lead to increases in
                                                                        𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝
the prices received by exporters to the US in two thirds of products, so 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 < 0.
                                                                                𝜕𝜕𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
         Chang and Winters (2002) provide evidence for PTA price effects on non-members. They examine
the impact of Mercosur’s preferential tariff reductions on the relative prices received by non-member
countries exporting to Brazil. They derive a pricing equation from a Bertrand game between non-member
and member firms similar to the one Feenstra (1989) uses to study US tariff pass-through. In this setting a
reduction in Brazil’s tariffs on Argentina shifts demand away from non-members’ firms and leads them to
adjust the price down if their perceived demand becomes more elastic. This is what they find using unit
values for detailed product data. Similarly, Chang and Winters (2000) find that when Spain enters the EU
the relative price received by non-EU exporters to Spain fell. So, both studies provide direct evidence that
PTAs generate a negative terms-of-trade externality for non-members.
         The indirect evidence of PTAs on terms-of-trade infers price and/or welfare changes after using
bilateral trade flows to estimate price elasticities and then evaluating the effect of tariff changes or PTAs in
the context of a model. We discussed these briefly at the end of section 3, here we expand on the findings
of Anderson and Yotov (Forthcoming). 68 They provide a variety of counterfactual effects from removing all
PTAs that took place in 1990-2002. They calculate the AVE of PTAs as defined in (7) from their gravity
estimates and use this as the shock in a multi-country Armington model with eight manufacturing sectors.
They compute terms-of-trade effects as the ratio of a country’s aggregate seller price index relative to the
country’s import price index. The latter reflects trade costs so it is possible for terms-of-trade to increase
for all countries. Relative to a counterfactual with no PTAs they find that PTAs improved the TOT for most
of the countries with the few losers experiencing small losses. The import price index fell for all countries,
particularly small eastern European countries integrating with the EU. The export price effects of PTAs on




68 Romalis (2007) also evaluates aggregate effects of NAFTA. He estimates an average import and export supply
elasticity for the US and uses them to simulate a welfare change due to the observed tariff changes based on an
aggregate CES price change for given production net of tariff revenue. He finds that the aggregate price gains for
members are almost fully offset by lost tariff revenues, an indication of the diversion effect this same paper finds.
Because he focuses only on applied tariff changes in NAFTA the estimates only capture a fraction of the trade effect.
                                                         46
the other hand were more variable---falling in about half the countries---with larger losses for non-PTA
countries. This highlights the multilateral externality of PTAs in lowering non-member export prices. 69
        Anderson and Yotov also perform alternative counterfactuals eliminating a couple of specific PTAs.
It would be interesting to compute counterfactual effects of PTAs for all bilateral pairs (one at a time or in
different combinations) whether or not they had a PTA. This could then be used to evaluate if the PTAs that
did form were the ones that yielded higher bilateral welfare.
     •    Non-traditional
        The traditional view of PTAs as an exogenous preferential tariff reduction is a modelling
abstraction, as is clear from the variable depth and breadth of economic policies that modern PTAs address.
Focusing solely on the social welfare costs relevant in the traditional view and ignoring non-traditional
motives and economic structures for PTAs has two potential costs. First, we may miss important outcomes
of PTAs, not just on trade (as shown in sections 3 and 4) but on FDI, and other outcomes. Second, the
traditional view restricts our attention to a single binary policy outcome: an exogenous tariff reduction
between a pair of countries. If we do so then we fail to explore a rich set of alternative PTA policy outcomes,
including endogenous tariff variation, and also ignore or misinterpret the empirical effects of determinants
of the probability of a PTA forming.
        There is an extensive set of non-traditional settings to consider that reflect both economic and non-
economic objectives. Our goal here is to highlight a few and describe what if any evidence there is
suggesting their potential importance. Let us first more precisely define the “traditional view of PTAs” and
then characterize the alternatives to it as deviations either in terms of the objective or economic setting.
PTAs are inter-governmental agreements and so their formation depends on what we specify as the
government’s objective, 𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥 . The traditional view effectively places three restrictions on 𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥 : (R1) it is a
measure of social welfare; (R2) it depends only on applied tariffs and (R3) policy levels are exogenously
given in an agreement. In contrast, the non-traditional motives discussed below allow 𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥 to reflect
redistributive or other political economy considerations over many policies that it sets endogenously.
Moreover, the traditional view focuses on restricted settings that: (R4) allow only for trade in goods; (R5)
are static; (R6) exclude bargaining or enforcement considerations and (R7) ignore non-pecuniary
externalities. Different non-traditional settings relax these restrictions as follows.
          Endogenous trade policy
         There is substantial evidence that tariffs and other trade policies are endogenous to political-
economy and economic factors and many of these are incorporated in the PTA research since the 1990’s. 70
In the context of PTAs the WTO members do face some constraints on preferential tariff levels, but there
are numerous exceptions that countries can and do build into PTAs (cf. WTO, 2011, and Bown and Crowley,
2016). Even if the WTO enforced the Article XXIV constraint that PTAs set most preferential tariffs at zero,
the initial tariff could still reflect terms-of-trade and political-economy motivations.




69 The overall TOT gains are an overestimate of the income effect in this setting because they ignore tariff revenue;
the authors argue the latter diminishes but does not overturn the conclusion.
70 The political economy of protection is reviewed by Mclaren (2016) and by Grossman (2016).

                                                         47
        There are two basic implications of relaxing the exogenous tariff assumption, R3, even if 𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥
represents social welfare. First, when governments can choose policy levels optimally they may choose a
PTA that they would otherwise have not. Second, the preferential tariff itself is now an endogenous object
that can be used empirically to learn about the determinants of a PTA such as the degree of import market
power (section 5.2).
        If in addition we relax the social welfare assumption, R1, then the government may have
redistributive or other political-economy motives for a PTA, which generates new predictions. First,
political determinants such as the factor endowments of the median voter may become relevant (cf. Levy,
1997). Second, economic determinants may have a different interpretation. For example, a government that
values redistribution to its exporters may prefer partners with high external tariffs because this provides
additional protection to its export industry. These agreements are more likely to be trade diverting and
thus without R1 governments may support such agreements while the opposite is predicted by the
traditional view (cf. Grossman and Helpman, 1995; Krishna, 1998).
        Relaxing R1 and R3 also opens up the possibility that PTAs have a commitment value. This value
may be due to the ability of the government to commit to liberalization and thus solve a time inconsistency
problem relative to its import competing industry (Staiger and Tabellini, 1987; Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare,
1998). If we relax R2 to allow for other policies, e.g. non-tariff barriers, then the PTA also provides a way
for the government to commit to its optimal redistribution policy when bargaining with lobbies, as shown
in Limão and Tovar (2011). 71
       Deeper trade policy cooperation and bargaining externalities
         Deeper trade policy cooperation is important in explaining the trade effects of PTAs. We provided
some evidence for this in section 4 for NTBs and trade policy uncertainty (so relaxing R2 and R5
respectively). These other policy dimensions may generate additional trade for members, but also
additional diversion from non-members. There is some evidence that PTAs affect both NTBs and TPU and
it would be interesting to systematically test if the propensity of certain countries for this type of policies
affects the probability of PTA formation.
         Recent work on endogenous trade policy in the context of trade agreements incorporates policy
uncertainty caused by either political shocks (cf. Amador and Bagwell, 2013, and Beshkar and Bond, 2012)
or political and economic shocks (Limão and Maggi, 2015). It would be interesting to apply these to a setting
with multiple countries where PTAs are explicitly modelled.
         Some of the gains from a PTA, e.g. commitment and reduction in TPU, would seem to be achievable
through multilateral agreements as well. However, countries increasingly pursue them via PTAs. Perhaps
there are additional considerations that favor PTAs that the traditional view ignores such as bargaining and
enforcement (R6). Let us consider bargaining first. Customs unions set a common external tariff so groups
such as Mercosur can both explore their import market power (Olarreaga et al, 1999) and negotiate better
terms with the rest of the world than any of its individual members. Moreover, in a world where other




71 More broadly, the PTA can generate gains for a set of domestic agents that allows the government to commit reforms

that would otherwise be blocked (cf. Fernandez and Portes, 1998).
                                                         48
countries form PTAs it may be optimal for certain countries to respond by doing the same. In section 5.2
we discuss how this interdependence affects the empirical approach to PTA formation.
        Another bargaining advantage in PTAs is that it is not subject to the MFN free riding problems that
plague multilateral negotiations (Ludema and Mayda, 2009). Deeper trade policy cooperation may also be
easier to enforce in PTAs because (i) there is higher incentive to verify (less free riding) and (ii) there are
potentially more policies available to enforce cooperation. 72
       Broader economic motives
         Many PTAs aim to promote investment, not just domestic but increasingly foreign. About 58% of
the agreements discussed in section 2 included clauses for the liberalization of capital movement and 45%
included requirements for local content and export performance of FDI. Moreover, there has also been an
increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties.
         The PTA may increase FDI across members, as they take advantage of vertical specialization
possibilities within the PTA. It may also generate FDI from non-members to serve the integrated market,
i.e. export-platform FDI. However, some investment benefits may be offset by local content requirements,
which limit the degree of vertical specialization that firms can explore relative to non-members.
         Is there evidence that PTAs increase FDI? Blomstrom and Kokko (1997) analyze case studies and
argue there was little for Canada during CUSFTA but a significant amount for Mexico from non-NAFTA
countries and for Argentina and Brazil in Mercosur. Levy-Yeyati et al (2003) apply a gravity-type approach
to bilateral outward FDI from the OECD to 60 countries in 1982-1999. They find that PTA membership
increases FDI by about 27% and generates some FDI diversion. Other work analyzing the impact of PTAs
on aggregate FDI includes Baltagi et al (2008).
         Recent work employs firm level data. Chen (2009) also applies a gravity type approach to US
multinational sales to its affiliates in manufacturing. After taking PTA endogeneity into account she finds a
rise in export-platform FDI but not in FDI between members. Osnago et al (2015) use firm data and find
that vertical FDI increases with the depth of PTAs. Depth includes the capital movement provisions using
the data described in section 2, so this paper provides a good example of how the rich variation across PTAs
can be used. Tintelnot (2105) also explores firm data to quantify the role of multinationals in transmitting
technological improvements across countries and the role of trade and investment agreements, e.g.
between the EU and Canada, in potentially diverting investment of EU multinationals from the US to Canada.
         These estimates indicate the importance of relaxing R4 to evaluate the welfare effects of PTAs in
settings with FDI and trade in intermediates. In section 5.2 we discuss the (yet scarce) evidence of the direct
effect of FDI on the probability of bilateral preferences and whether their value across industries depends
on the fraction of a country’s imports produced using FDI owned by its nationals (Blanchard, 2007).
         Certain PTAs explicitly aim to increase productivity and innovation. This objective can be directly
seen in the data in section 2 where 43% of the PTAs include at least some innovation and diffusion provision
that promotes technology transfer; joint research projects; exchange of researchers and development of




72On the other hand, Maggi (1999) provides a model where multilateral institutions have an advantage over bilateral
ones by verifying violations and informing third parties. On the role of policy linkage in enforcement see Limão (2005)
and Maggi (2016).
                                                          49
public-private partnerships. It would be interesting to test if PTAs with such provisions do lower
information and technology diffusion costs and generate higher rates of innovation. Over 60% of the PTAs
also include intellectual property right protection clauses. These can increase innovation incentives and
spur additional innovation for at least some the PTA members, but not necessarily all, and may depend on
the relative level of development of the members (see Saggi, 2016).
        There are other mechanisms through which PTAs may increase productivity. First, FDI may
increase technology transfer. Second, through economies of scale and/or a reallocation of production
towards more productive firms (cf. Head and Ries, 1999, for Canada). Third, by generating incentives for
exporting firm investments that may increase plant productivity (Trefler, 2004) and innovation (cf. Lileeva
and Trefler, 2010, for Canada and Bustos, 2011, for Argentina due to Mercosur).
        In sum, PTAs reduce trade costs for goods and include provisions for broader economic cooperation
that can also lower the costs for FDI and innovation. To understand if these cost reductions and the change
in investment incentives in PTAs translate into important innovation and productivity gains we need
additional research, which could follow the recent firm level work cited in this section.
        Future work should also examine if services trade expands when related provisions are included in
PTAs and if so then whether determinants of services trade increase the likelihood of these provisions.
        As noted in section 2 PTAs also include labor related provisions. There is interesting work
examining the wage effects of certain PTAs (cf. Hakobyan and McLaren, 2010, and Trefler, 2004). Much
more could be done to explore the impact of PTAs not just on wages and employment but also on whether
relevant provisions have any impact on the outcomes they target such as labor standards.
       Non-pecuniary international externalities
        There is a long history of preferential trade integration (cf. Machlup 1977) and in several important
instances it was succeed by economic and political unions, e.g. the Zollverein between German states, the
custom union between Italian states. In agreements such as the European Community there is an explicit
objective to reduce the probability of conflict via economic integration and accession is conditional on
democratization and cooperation in many issues with non-pecuniary externalities. 73
        More broadly, the EU and US commonly provide trade preferences in exchange for cooperation in
issues such as the environment, human rights, illicit drugs and terrorism. 74 As we discussed in section 2
cooperation in some of these issues is not legally enforceable, but in several cases it does carry a cost.
Failure to comply has led certain GSP countries to lose preferential access to the U.S. At one point the EU
implemented “special incentive arrangements” whereby developing countries could apply for additional
preferential tariff reduction if they satisfied certain labor, environmental, or drug combat criteria.
        There is some evidence of the impact of PTAs on cooperation on a subset of the issues discussed
above. Mansfield and Milner (2012) argue that domestic politics is a critical factor in the decision to join
PTAs and democracies are more likely to join. Liu and Ornelas (2014) provide evidence that PTAs increase

strengthen peace and liberty’ and ‘to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious

the probability of survival for democracies. Hafner-Burton (2013) finds human rights improvements in
countries with which the US and EU have PTAs with relevant clauses.
        Martin et al (2008) find that multilateral trade openness increases the probability of conflict by
decreasing bilateral trade and thus the cost of a bilateral conflict. This suggests a positive role for PTAs in
reducing conflict. Vicard (2012) estimates that customs unions and common markets reduce the
probability of war between members but shallower PTAs do not. Both he and Martin et al (2012) find that
countries with higher frequency of past wars are more likely to sign PTAs.
        The increasing number of PTAs with non-economic provisions and the rising evidence for their
impacts suggests it is important to incorporate them in standard models of policy determination. This
would seem to be difficult given the diversity of the issues considered above until we note that several have
one common feature: a non-pecuniary international externality. Limão (2007) incorporates that feature in
a trade model to derive the incentives for PTAs. He shows that non-pecuniary externalities may facilitate
the formation of PTAs for two reasons. First, it increases the set of issues over which they can bargain,
which is particularly important between countries of asymmetric economic size. Second, this issue linkage
improves the ability to enforce cooperation. The model provides predictions for the formation of
agreements and the interaction of preferential and multilateral policies. For example, to the extent that
these non-pecuniary externalities decay with distance the model provides a non-trade related explanation
for why many PTAs are regional.

5.2    PTA and Preference Determinants
        Most empirical work on the economic determinants of bilateral PTAs focuses on trade related
motives, typically trade creation and diversion effects highlighted by the traditional PTA literature. First,
we focus on explaining the determinants of the choices made by pairs of countries to form PTAs. We do so
both in a setting where the potential agreements are taken as given and independent from each other and
then in a setting when some types of interdependencies are controlled for. We argue that interdependence
generates strategic incentives that are important in shaping the equilibrium network of agreements and
pose a challenge for simple choice based estimation methods. Second, we consider how richer settings with
endogenous tariff levels provide additional determinants and an alternative to the choice based approach
to understanding the motives for the formation of PTAs.
   •    Economic determinants of PTAs under exogenous tariffs: binary choice approach
        Independent bilateral PTAs

        Sovereign countries can choose whether to accept a particular PTA depending on whether the
payoff is higher than under some feasible alternative. If we restrict the choice to be binary: this PTA or not,
then a reasonable criteria for whether x and m implement a PTA is that the resulting change in the
government objective is positive for both, i.e. 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖 > 0 for i=x, m. That is the basic approach followed by
Baier and Bergstrand (2004) to motivate a probit estimation of the economic determinants of a traditional
PTA with exogenous tariffs. More specifically they use
                                                    �             � �
                                  PTA𝑥𝑥,𝑚𝑚 = �1 if 𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥,𝑚𝑚 ≡ min�𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥 , 𝐺𝐺𝑚𝑚 � > 0.                       (10)
                                              0 otherwise


                                                        51
They then rely on a specific economic structure to generate hypotheses and guide the choice of economic
determinants of PTAs in a cross section. They build on Frankel et al (1995), who in turn extend the
monopolistic competition model that Krugman (1991) used to argue for the natural trading partner
hypothesis. Using a simulated solution of the model with exogenous tariffs of 30% on non-members they
derive larger welfare benefits of an exogenous PTA that eliminates that tariff between pairs of countries
that are (i) closer, jointly larger and similar (in terms of GDP) and different in terms of relative endowments
and (ii) farther, relatively larger, and similar in terms of relative endowments relative to the rest of the
world. They interpret the factors in (i) as promoting trade creation and those in (ii) as minimizing diversion.
Using a probit for a 1996 cross section of PTAs between pairs of 53 countries they find the sign of these
determinants conform to the predictions in (i) and (ii).
        There are three important points to note. First, this parsimonious set of economic determinants can
correctly predict 85% of the 286 PTAs in place; this and the consistent sign predictions could be interpreted
as strong support for the underlying model. However, a large part of the variation is explained by distance
from each other and the rest of the world, which would be a basic prediction from a large set of models
where PTAs address a trade externality or other cross-border externalities. In fact, Magee (2003) finds that
the probability of a PTA in 1998 is higher between closer countries even after controlling for bilateral trade
(which he instruments). Second, the joint GDP of the PTA partners is correlated with a host of other possible
determinants so we should not make any causal inference, even if the explanatory variable is lagged. Third,
any interpretation and causal inference is further complicated by the absence of other controls or
alternative approaches that recognize the interdependence of agreements.
       Interdependent bilateral PTAs

         The formation of any given PTA depends on other existing and potential PTAs in at least two ways.
First, holding other agreements fixed, the welfare impact of a PTA depends on the trade that the two
members have with non-members and thus on any existing PTAs the non-members have between
themselves or with either of the members. Second, if externalities across PTAs are present and multiple
countries can choose multiple agreements then there is a strategic element that affects formation.
         How do existing PTAs affect the net benefits for any single new agreement? The marginal benefit
for x from lower protection in a PTA market m depends on its exports to m, which in turn depends on how
much protection its competitors in that market face and thus on any other PTA that m has. Similarly, the
marginal cost to x from deviating from its bilateral optimal policy and lowering protection against m
depends on whether x has PTAs with other countries. Finally, all of x and m trade flows also depend on
whether other countries in the world have PTAs.
         To translate the potential interdependence into testable hypothesis we need to model specific
channels. Alternatively, we can ask how the bilateral determinants of traditional PTAs are affected by
controlling for interdependence, which is the main question addressed by Egger and Larch (2008). They
extend the empirical choice model of Baier and Bergstrand (2004) to a panel setting and include more
countries but find similar results for the individual determinants and prediction success rate. They then
control for interdependence by including a bilateral distance (or trade) weighted measure of pre-existing
PTAs for each country pair and find it is positively correlated with the formation and enlargement of PTAs.
         The impact of bilateral economic determinants is not sensitive to the inclusion of the
interdependence control in Egger and Larch (2008). However, I would argue the existing work does not yet
                                                      52
fully establish causal effects due to the potential for endogeneity both for those economic determinants, e.g.
GDP, and now for the pre-existing PTA variable. The latter is assumed to be exogenous but we would expect
that the determinants for formation of bilateral PTAs in a region to be persistent and several of those
determinants are omitted, so there is potentially a form of lagged dependent variable bias. 75
         What specific channels may explain the positive correlation between PTA formation or enlargement
and pre-existing agreements? Baldwin (1995) proposes a domino theory of regionalism whereby an
exogenous integration between w and m diverts trade from x and increases its incentive to form a PTA.
Country x’s incentive to join is not sufficient to predict an enlargement---that will also require existing
members’ approval and thus gain from expansion. But in certain models an exogenous PTA reduces non-
member exports and thus welfare and a further expansion leaves the original members better off, e.g. by
increasing the market power of a customs union relative to the rest of the world and allowing for an
endogenous tariff (cf. Bond and Syropoulos, 1996, Bagwell and Staiger, 1997a).
         As discussed in section 5.1, if a PTA generates trade diversion from non-members then the latter
are likely to be hurt. Sapir (1997) provides evidence that trade diversion generated by the EU is associated
with subsequent enlargements. Baldwin and Rieder (2007) follow a similar approach where diversion is
inferred from a first stage gravity estimation and then used as a determinant of the probability of entering
the EU. Baldwin and Jaimovich (2012) argue this earlier study is ‘plagued by the endogeneity of the
membership’ and thus they follow the basic panel approach in Egger and Larch (2008) with a different
weighting matrix. The weights are motivated by a contagion model where a PTA between m and w diverts
trade from x and this increases the incentive of x to join a PTA with m. The measure suggested by their
                         𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇
model is Cont xm = ∑𝑤𝑤 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 PTAmw . Contagion from m to x is increasing in the importance of the market
                         𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥   𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚
access to m is (measured by its share of x exports) and the market access of its competitor, measured by
m’s import share from w. Their baseline estimates use the distance based weight of Egger and Larch (2008)
to control for interdependence and finds a positive result, but one that is weaker than that found in the
earlier study, perhaps because of the inclusion of a richer set of covariates---including bilateral trade, which
is highly significant, and the fraction of exports of a country to PTA partners. When they augment this
specification with their contagion-based weight they find only the latter measure of interdependence is
significant and conclude this provides support for the contagion/domino hypothesis.
         Using a theoretical model to motivate how interdependence works is a clear step in the right
direction. However, the interpretation of the interdependence coefficient in Baldwin and Jaimovich (2012)
is complicated by the fact that it is obtained after conditioning on many variables---it is not clear if after
conditioning on them the model predicts any additional effect for contagion. Moreover, those controls
include endogenous variables such as bilateral trade and GDP growth. Future work can provide
specifications that follow the theory even more closely and provide a careful identification strategy to
address endogeneity.
         In the context of interdependent PTAs there is a deeper empirical concern with the studies
described: whether the bilateral choice based estimation is valid. When we expand the set of possible




75 One way the authors address the potential endogeneity from the interdependence variable is to focus on a cross-

section and explore the spatial structure of the model to solve for the PTA as a function of economic determinants.
                                                        53
agreements to include more than two countries there are both additional strategic factors in the bilateral
decision and a much larger choice set to consider. We discuss this issue further in section 6. Fortunately, if
we consider endogenous policy settings then there are other approaches to learning about the
determinants of PTAs. We now examine these alternatives.
   •    Alternative determinants and approaches to PTA formation under endogenous tariffs

        As described in section 5.1 the traditional PTA literature treats the initial and final tariffs as given
and this is the approach of most of the choice based empirical PTA formation literature discussed above.
Allowing for endogenous policy levels provides alternative interpretations to existing findings and a richer
set of determinants. Moreover, it allows for additional tests of the determinants of PTAs.
        Alternative determinants and interpretations

         If we allow governments to optimally choose policy levels then the degree of change in the bilateral
tariffs due to a PTA reflects the incentives for the initial and final tariffs. In theory, WTO members are
subject to certain constraints on preferential tariffs, but there are numerous exceptions that countries can
and do build into PTAs. Even if the WTO enforced the constraint that PTAs under Article XXIV set most
preferential tariffs at zero, the initial tariff could still reflect terms-of-trade and political-economy
motivations. We consider each in turn.
         Magee (2003) empirically examines some political economy determinants of PTA formation. For
example, in Levy (1997) the median voter decides whether a PTA is formed, this model predicts that
agreements are more likely if partners have similar capital-labor endowments, which is the opposite of the
prediction tested by Baier and Bergstrand (2004) using welfare maximizing models. Mitra et al (2002)
provide evidence based on Grossman and Helpman (1994) that indicates democracies place higher weight
on social welfare than dictatorships. This suggests that welfare enhancing agreements are more likely to
be reached if both countries are democracies. Magee finds supporting evidence for both these determinants
of PTAs using a probit in a panel setting. He conditions on bilateral trade, which is instrumented, and even
then some of the distance and economic variables---meant to capture trade effects of PTAs in earlier work-
--remain significant, and some variables such as the capital-labor ratio, switch signs. This suggests caution
in interpreting the effects of those variables as purely economic determinants of PTAs signed by welfare
maximizing governments.
         The bilateral terms-of-trade motive for PTAs has not been explicitly tested. One way to do so would
be to use the country and product characteristics that Broda et al (2008) identify as determinants of import
market power. These include a large import share of a good relative to the non-members and the degree of
product differentiation. Another determinant of import market power is remoteness from other markets.
There is evidence of remoteness predicting PTA formation, which has been interpreted as capturing smaller
trade diversion potential. An alternative interpretation is that remoteness confers regional market power
and so an incentive for a PTA. Instead of using country characteristics that may capture other factors, we
could directly use the country-industry measures of market power estimated by Broda et al (2008) and ask
if PTAs are more likely between country pairs with larger share of trade in those industries and if
preferential tariff cuts are larger.
         It would also be interesting to understand why countries choose agreements with specific types of
policies, e.g. investment provisions. Only recently has this question started to be addressed. Orefice and

                                                      54
Rocha (2014) find that the probability of formation of deeper PTAs is higher between countries with a
larger share of trade in intermediate inputs, particularly if one country is low-income. Thus the potential
to share production networks appears to be one motive in the selection of PTA partners.
       Alternative approaches: determinants of votes and policy outcomes

        Endogenous tariff setting also opens up a broader set of approaches to study the determinants of
PTAs. First, we can consider the determinants of outcomes of votes. Baldwin and Magee (2000) find that
campaign contributions influenced US legislator votes on NAFTA and that certain economic conditions in
each member’s district affected the vote outcome. Conconi et al (2014) find that congressional term length
and election proximity affect the likelihood of support for trade liberalization bills such as NAFTA. Beaulieu
(2002) finds that both industry of employment and type of factor (skilled/unskilled) of individual Canadian
voters were significant determinants of their vote on whether to support that country’s PTA with the US.
        Another approach is to analyze the determinants of preferential tariff rates, which can vary
bilaterally and at the product level. We highlighted the bilateral terms-of-trade externality as a potential
motive for PTAs. While recent work has established the importance of this externality for unilateral and
multilateral tariffs much less is known about its role in shaping bilateral tariffs such as those governed by
PTAs. One exception is Olarreaga et al (1999) who find that Mercosur’s common external tariff is higher in
products where it had more import market power and this measure (Mercosur share of world imports in
each product) can explain up to 28% of the tariff variation. This indicates the potential terms-of-trade gain
from a customs union derived from setting tariffs jointly.
        More recently, Blanchard et al (2016) provide indirect evidence of the TOT motive for PTAs. They
introduce supply chain linkages into an endogenous trade policy model with TOT externalities. The model
predicts that the non-cooperative bilateral tariff decreases with the share of domestic value added in
imports. They find support for the prediction in countries without PTAs, by using bilateral product tariffs
in 14 economies in 1995-2009. If PTAs internalize the TOT externality then preferential tariff variation
within an agreement should not vary with domestic value added, and that is their finding. This paper
provides a good example of the type of detailed evidence guided by theory that addresses identification
concerns and can be used to learn about motives for the formation and shape of policy in PTAs, particularly
the role of supply chains.
        In section 4 we discussed how PTAs could affect the degree of vertical specialization. Blanchard
(2007) provides a theory where a country’s protection declines with the fraction of imports that are
produced using FDI made by its nationals. If a US tariff reduces the price received by a foreign exporter
then some of that cost translates into lower profits for any US multinational involved in the production of
that good abroad. This basic insight suggests an incentive for lower tariffs on partners where that FDI is
most prevalent and thus for PTAs. The panel evidence in Blanchard and Matschke (2015) for the US
between 1997-2006 supports this prediction. They find that a 10% increase in US multinational exports to
the US reduced its preferential tariff by about 4 percentage points.
        Another well documented determinant of unilateral trade policy is the role of lobbies. Less is known
in the context of PTAs even though the additional variation in preferential tariffs may be very informative.
Kee et al (2007) find that foreign lobbies’ contributions to the US affect the latter’s preferential tariffs to
countries in the Americas.

      •    Summary

        In sum, there has been some advance in empirically identifying the basic trade related mechanisms
that underlie the formation of traditional PTAs: creation, diversion and price effects. The research focusing
on the determinants of PTAs has confirmed the importance of bilateral trade and thus the importance of
the endogeneity concerns in gravity estimates. The evidence for other determinants of trade
creation/diversion in the formation of PTAs is suggestive but more work is required to establish causal
relationships. The same is true for the role of past PTAs by a country and its partners. A similar choice based
estimation could be used to explain the determinants of the type of agreement. However, in the presence of
interdependence of PTAs and multiple choices an alternative approach may be required.
        One promising avenue to understand the determinants of PTA formation and the depth of
cooperation is to explore preferential tariffs and other product level data. This may allow us to test sharper
predictions, establish causal effects and identify certain structural parameters that may be used to quantify
interesting counterfactuals. For example, whether uncertainty regarding multilateral tariffs or temporary
preferences, such as those developing countries receive via the GSP, makes it more likely to seek a
preference bound at zero.

6. Agreement and Policy Interdependence

        In the previous section we noted that interdependence between PTAs poses a challenge to
identifying their bilateral determinants using a choice based approach. We then argued that exploring the
determinants of endogenous preferential tariff levels within any given agreement could provide additional
insights about the incentives for their formation and policy depth. We now provide a brief discussion of the
basic issues when agreement decisions are interdependent and then turn to evidence that examines the
interaction between bilateral policy levels covered in a PTA and those not covered by that agreement.

6.1       Agreement Interdependence: approaches and open questions

        In the context of interdependent PTAs there is a deeper empirical concern with some of the studies
in section 5.2: whether the bilateral choice based estimation is valid. When we expand the set of possible
agreements to include more than two countries there are both additional strategic factors in the bilateral
decision and a much larger choice set to consider. We illustrate the issue and note how the theoretical
approaches addressing the equilibrium structure of agreements require us to consider additional empirical
approaches to study the formation of PTAs and the interdependence of policies.
        To illustrate the basic issue consider an example with four countries in two blocs, x and m; w and
w’. Suppose that w and w’ have a cost of forming a PTA that is sufficiently low between themselves that they
always form it but prohibitively high with either x or m. If x and m are deciding on PTA between themselves
after w and w’ have already formed one then the decision between x and m may be represented by the
bilateral choice equation (10). 76 The empirical work in section 5.2 that controls for interdependence can
address this specific case. But suppose now that each of the two blocs of countries is simultaneously




76   This presumes the costs of dissolving the PTA between w and w’ are high so it will persist regardless of others.
                                                            56
deciding between 3 possible outcomes: cooperation in (i) no policy, (ii) bilateral tariff with country in its
bloc or (iii) bilateral tariff with country in its bloc and multilateral tariff with the remaining. There are now
9 possible outcomes to consider and this number increases exponentially in the number of such blocs. The
choice set is even larger if we reduced the costs of PTA formation across blocs and allow for overlapping
membership in different PTAs.
         The interdependence between agreements raises three basic questions: what are the possible PTA
network outcomes; what theoretical criteria should we use to predict which will emerge; and how might
the network evolve. In settings with transfers between countries we have strong results on the existence
of necessarily welfare enhancing customs unions (Kemp and Wan, 1976) and free trade areas (Panagaryia
and Krishna, 2002), which leave non-members indifferent. One implication of this literature is that there
may exist a PTA path for welfare maximizing governments to expand a PTA until it includes all countries.
But transfers may not be available, governments are not welfare maximizers and even if they were the
strategic interaction between them they may generate suboptimal outcomes from the global perspective.
         At a broad level, there have been two theoretical approaches to address endogenous formation in
the presence of this type of bargaining externalities across PTAs. One approach restricts the set of possible
outcomes by considering a small number of countries and then considers alternative methods to select the
more “likely” outcome by determining which outcomes are in the core (Riezman, 1985) or are the
equilibrium of some game that can involve either sequential bargaining (Aghion et al, 2007) or the Nash
equilibria of a simultaneous game (cf. Saggi and Yildiz, 2010 and Saggi et al, 2013). 77 The simultaneous
game approach typically requires some mechanism such as coalition proofness to select between multiple
Nash equilibria. The multiplicity can arise because countries may prefer no agreement if no others have
them but are better off in a bloc if other blocs form. The second approach allows for a larger number of
countries and uses network theory to examine which bilateral networks are stable (Goyal and Joshi, 2006,
Furusawa and Konishi, 2007). The larger number of countries comes at the cost of focusing on pair-wise
stability, i.e. whether to form or sever a single PTA, holding all else constant.
         The theoretical approaches addressing endogenous formation provide a number of interesting
insights. The central implication I want to draw for the current discussion is that the choice set in the
bilateral criterion in (10) is restrictive. If the number of potential choices was sufficiently small we could
consider nested or multinomial approaches (e.g. for each pair model whether to have an agreement and if
so how many of which type). This type of approach is followed by Egger et al (2013) to examine the
determinants of the bilateral choice between mutually non-exclusive types of agreements (on goods,
services, taxation, investment or currency unions) and the resulting impact on outcomes such as trade and
FDI. They find that agreements on goods have a larger trade effect when combined with one on investment
and the same is true more generally of combining different types of agreements on any given outcome.
         In general, even multinomial approaches will be problematic given the large number of choices (e.g.
partners) and their interdependence. For example, in 2010 a bilateral country pair with a PTA had on
average 52 other bilateral links. It would be interesting to consider empirical approaches to related choice




77   Yi (1996) uses a non-cooperative approach for many symmetric countries.
                                                         57
problems used in other fields, such as the decisions of firms to enter multiple markets in the presence of
spatial competition (cf. Aguirregabiria and Suzuki, 2016).
        Fortunately, if we consider endogenous policy settings then there are approaches that do not rely
on choice based estimation to learn about how agreements interact, e.g. examining how preferential
policies affect the incentives for policy against non-members, which we examine next.
        The open questions that remain are not simply empirical. In section 2 and its online appendix we
noted the parallel between the evolution of cooperation within the WTO and the type of provisions that its
members now include in PTAs; we also noted that the latter go farther than the WTO in several respects.
This raises the question of whether and why there are limits to the depth and breadth of cooperation in the
WTO. If so, then is this because of higher heterogeneity in preferences, enforcement problems, free riding,
and the regional scope of externalities? Is it related to the more open membership that characterizes the
WTO? To properly address these questions we need a model of evolution of cooperation within agreements
that rationalizes what we observed in the GATT/WTO. This may point to any potential cooperation
constraints the WTO and provide insights on why its members increasingly pursue cooperation via PTAs.

6.2    Policy Interdependence

         As we discussed in the introduction PTAs have proliferated at the same time that WTO membership
expanded and MFN tariffs were declining. A large share of trade between WTO members is carried out by
groups that have bilateral PTAs. Thus we now examine the potential for policy interdependence. Theory
can provide some guidance regarding the set of policies that are likely to be interdependent, e.g. same
industry tariffs or NTBs against different partners, but predictions regarding the direction of causality and
the sign, e.g. do preferential tariffs raise or lower the multilateral tariff or vice versa, are more sensitive to
specific modelling assumptions and thus they are ultimately empirical questions. The clear potential for
two-way causality implies that identification issues are paramount and I discuss these as well in the context
of existing estimates.
         What do we mean by policy interdependence? Heuristically, we say that a PTA and a non-PTA policy
are interdependent if changes in the value of one affects the incentives for the equilibrium value of the
other. So naturally we are considering an endogenous policy setting. We distinguish between two types of
interdependence: multilateral, e.g. between preferential and MFN tariffs for a country, and bilateral, e.g.
between a cooperative tariff set between PTA partners and non-cooperative NTBs between them. Both
types can affect the decision to form agreements.
   •    Multilateral tariff interdependence

        More research has focused on multilateral interdependence because it can also directly affect the
protection faced by non-members. This research was motivated by the debate on the effects of PTAs on
multilateral liberalization triggered by the difficulties in completing multilateral trade negotiations in the
Uruguay Round. This generated a voluminous theoretical literature with arguments supporting the notion
that PTAs are a stumbling block to multilateral trade liberalization and others against it. We focus on the
more recent work that provides empirical evidence relevant to this question.
        Multilateral tariff interdependence refers to the relationship between preferential tariffs and non-
preferential ones that are applied to non-members. There is potentially two way causality since the optimal
preferential tariff depends on the value of the tariff on non-members and vice-versa as illustrated by the
                                                       58
following simple example. Suppose the initial multilateral tariff of a country x is zero, 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 = 0. If there is a
constraint that the multilateral tariff that x sets on w cannot be changed as a result of PTAs, i.e. 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 = 0,
then x is unable to offer any preferential tariff to m (unless it is a subsidy) so there would be no market
access value to this PTA for m. This example also illustrates how preferential tariffs can affect the incentives
for multilateral liberalization. If there was no multilateral constraint and the PTA was sufficiently valuable
to the members they would have an incentive so increase multilateral tariffs, i.e. set 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 >0.
        The empirical analysis has focused on the effect going from preferential to multilateral tariffs with
the goal of establishing whether 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 ≠ 0. We are also interested in the sign of this relationship: if 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 > 0
then the PTA may impose an additional cost of non-members in the form of lower export prices. There is
an additional source of interdependence relevant for the stumbling blocs question. Namely whether a non-
member, w, may respond by changing its tariffs on a country x when the latter forms a PTA with m. This
tariff response is harder to identify empirically, but it is more likely to be an increase in protection if 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 >
0 , a reciprocal response. So evidence for whether tariffs are raised against non-members is important both
through its direct and reciprocity effects on multilateral liberalization.
        Basic hypotheses
        Some theories predict 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 > 0 and others the opposite, as we may expect in a second best setting.
Our objective is not to lay out all possible theories but rather to ask what are some relevant general
conditions leading to either case and what if any insights there are for the estimation approach. 78
        To gain some insight about the determinants of tariff interdependence and the implications for
empirical testing we consider a simple setting. Suppose the government has an objective, 𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥 (𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , . ),
that is a function of its tariff on the PTA partner (𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 ) the non-member (𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 ) and the tariffs it faces
(omitted). If the government could unilaterally choose 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 after setting its preferential tariff then it would
                                             𝑁𝑁 ,𝜏𝜏
                                   𝜕𝜕𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥 (𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥  𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 ,.)
satisfy a first order condition,                              = 0. So a PTA, which leads to a lower 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 causes 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 > 0 if the
                                          𝜕𝜕𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤

tariffs are strategic substitutes in 𝐺𝐺𝑥𝑥 or the opposite if they are complements. This condition depends on
the political and economic structure and so it is model specific. In discussing the empirical results that find
a positive or negative relationship between tariffs we refer to specific theoretical models they are
consistent with. But we offer two observations that should be independent of that sign. First, strategic
interdependence is more likely between tariffs in similar goods, denoted by 𝑘𝑘 ∈ 𝐾𝐾, which suggests testing
the impact of some measure of 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑚𝑚,𝑘𝑘 on 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 . Second, if k is either not imported from the PTA or does not
receive a preference then we expect 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 = 0, or at least smaller than the effect on other goods in the same
industry imported preferentially.
            When we focus on interdependence at the good and/or industry level I would argue that there is
one force pushing towards substitution present across different models that gives rise to what I call the
preference erosion hypothesis. The market access gain from a PTA in a given good depends on the
preference margin relative to the non-member, which is simply 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 − 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑚𝑚,𝑘𝑘 . So if for an initial value of
𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 the optimal preferential tariff is positive there may be no need to increase 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 to increase the
preference margin. But if a country has already liberalized extensively then the preference margin

Freund and Ornelas (2010) and discussion in Bagwell et al (Forthcoming).
                                                                       59
constraint will bind. In a setting with multilateral negotiations this incentive translates into less multilateral
liberalization to avoid preference erosion. The preference erosion concern has often been voiced in the
WTO by developing countries afraid to have GSP preferences eroded. Its potential effect on multilateral
liberalization was anticipated by opponents of the GSP when it was originally proposed (cf. Johnson, 1967.
p. 166). It is important to notice that a similar logic applies to other types of preferences unrelated to GSP,
as subsequent evidence finds. The two testable predictions from the preference erosion hypothesis are
that 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 > 0 is more likely for (i) countries/goods with an initially low 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 and (ii) goods with a binding
preference margin, i.e. when 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑚𝑚,𝑘𝑘 = 0. 79
       Estimation

       To answer whether a country’s PTAs affect its non-preferential liberalization we require a
reasonable empirical counterfactual. The basic challenge is that the theoretical object of interest, 𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤 ,
compares protection relative to an unobserved counterfactual. One could compare how changes in the
number of a country’s PTAs affect its aggregate multilateral trade liberalization (MTL) over time. But, with
so many other possible determinants of aggregate MTL changing between trade rounds it would be hard to
convincingly attribute any differences in MTL solely to PTAs. A similar concern applies if we compare the
aggregate liberalization of countries with and without PTAs, as illustrated by the findings in Foroutan
(1998). She finds lower average MFN tariffs for Latin American countries with PTAs after the Uruguay
Round but notes that no causality can be drawn from such a correlation because those countries were
moving away from import substitution during the 90's, which implied considerable unilateral liberalization
independently of any effects from PTAs.
         Limão (2006) proposes a difference-in-difference approach where changes in non-preferential
tariffs for each good k in the US are a function on the status of the good changing from non-PTA to PTA
between the Tokyo and Uruguay rounds. By exploring variation in PTA status over time and across goods
he controls for any aggregate (and sector) unobservable heterogeneity. To compare this and other
approaches it is useful to consider the following basic estimation equation.
                                    △ 𝜏𝜏𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 = 𝛾𝛾𝑥𝑥 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥,𝑚𝑚,𝑘𝑘 + 𝐗𝐗 ′ 𝛃𝛃 + 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 ,   𝑘𝑘 = 1, … N     (11)

        Using changes in US bound tariffs where k is an HS-8 product Limão (2006) estimates a positive 𝛾𝛾𝑥𝑥 ,
so multilateral tariffs for PTA goods increased relative to non-PTA goods. He argues this represents a causal
effect once we control for various determinants of the multilateral tariff, such as reciprocity and bargaining
power measures, and instrument the PTA variable. A key concern is that countries seek preferences in
goods where they expect smaller multilateral reductions. To address this he provides and tests the validity
of alternative instruments for 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥,𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 . 80 He finds that the US would have cut multilateral tariffs by twice
as much in the absence of its PTAs.




79This effect should be stronger for those goods where the relevant NTBs are highly constrained by the WTO.
80In particular the instrument for whether the good is exported by the PTA partner and receives a preference is
whether the good is exported before the multilateral tariff changes, which is correlated with the variable but excludes
the potentially endogenous components, i.e. the preference. The author also uses other instrument such as transport
costs and world price variables.
                                                                  60
         Karacaovali and Limão (2008) find similar results for the EU. They also test and find support for
two situations where their model predicts no stumbling block effect: (i) in goods with positive preferential
tariffs and (ii) for customs unions. These are also consistent with a non-binding preference margin
constraint since in (i) the preferential tariff can still be reduced and in (ii) any “missing” margin can be
offset via direct transfers.
         Ketterer et al (2015) apply the same approach as Limão (2006) and find that preferences given by
Japan lead it to keep its multilateral tariffs 1.7 percentage points higher in the Uruguay Round. Ketterer et
al (2014) find a positive but insignificant effect of almost all of Canada’s preferences on its multilateral
tariffs in the Uruguay Round. The exception is NAFTA preferences, which they conclude generated a
reduction in Canadian multilateral tariffs. They interpret this as evidence for a rent destruction effect,
which is predicted by models such as Ornelas (2005). This is one possible interpretation but other models
also predict a complementarity of preferential and multilateral tariffs (cf. Bagwell and Staiger, 1997b). One
concern with the estimates for Canada is that none of the specifications control for all agreements
simultaneously, and, since 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑥𝑥,𝑚𝑚,𝑘𝑘 , is clearly correlated across agreements, we can’t be certain of what the
individual agreement effects are or whether any is significant when all are included.
          Ketterer et al (2014) argue that the difference between their result for Canada and the stumbling
bloc findings in earlier work for the US and EU is because the latter reflect agreements with small countries
from whom the US and EU are extracting non-trade benefits. But that is incorrect since those studies find
the stumbling bloc effect is present both for GSP recipients, agreements with small developing countries
and agreements with developed countries when using specifications that include all of the agreements
separately. 81 An alternative explanation for the difference in the results for Canada is that before the
Uruguay Round its multilateral tariff was considerably higher, about 12%, than that of the EU, 8%, the US,
or Japan (about 7%). Recall that one of the predictions from the preference erosion hypothesis was that a
stumbling bloc was less likely when the multilateral tariff is higher.
          Another strand of the literature has focused on unilateral (rather than negotiated) tariffs on non-
members. Tovar (2012) uses product data and finds evidence of higher external tariffs for El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in 2005-09 due to preferences they granted the US under an FTA.
Other studies for Latin America use industry data and find different effects. Bohara et al. (2004) estimate
that the Argentine unilateral tariffs were lower in industries with higher imports from MERCOSUR.
Estevadeordal et al. (2008) study ten Latin American countries between 1990-2001 and find that countries
reduced non-preferential tariffs by more in industries with larger preference margins. They acknowledge
the potential for endogeneity and argue that it is addressed by instrumenting the change in preference
margin given by a country with those of its PTA partners. They find no effect for customs unions.
          Crivelli (2014) uses the data and basic approach in Estevadeordal et al. (2008) with two key
differences: controlling for unobserved industry shocks and estimating heterogeneous responses. She first
replicates their building bloc effect but then shows it becomes insignificant after including industry-year
effects, which control for unobserved industry incentives to lower both preferential and non-preferential
tariffs. She then estimates a heterogeneous response and finds that a 1% preference margin is associated



81 For example, Limão (2006) the stumbling bloc effect for NAFTA and GSP is similar, Karacaovali and Limão (2008)
find similar effects for GSP as well as EFTA and central European countries.
                                                        61
with a 0.18% decrease in non-preferential tariffs for goods with initial MFN tariff higher than average but
no effect for the other goods. She concludes this reflects an incentive to minimize the PTA cost of lost tariff
revenue from non-members first proposed in Richardson (1993). 82
        In sum, there has been considerable progress in the estimation of multilateral interdependence.
There is still work to be done to establish causality in some settings and test alternative mechanisms.
However, there are two basic robust findings thus far. First, there is a stronger stumbling bloc effect for
countries and goods with lower initial multilateral tariffs. Second, there is no interdependence for customs
unions but beyond this there is yet no definitive evidence of different effects across types of agreements.
          Reciprocity and welfare effects

        To determine the effect of PTAs on worldwide liberalization we would ideally also like to determine
the non-member tariff changes in reaction to PTAs. This has only been indirectly analyzed by modeling and
estimating multilateral reciprocity effects in the framework of equation (11). Limão (2006) finds that the
US multilateral liberalization was reciprocal so the direct stumbling bloc effect estimated for the EU in
Karacaovali and Limão (2008) would have led to smaller reciprocal reductions by the US and vice versa.
        It would also be interesting to understand the welfare impacts of multilateral interdependence.
Limão and Olarreaga (2006) argue that import subsidies can eliminate the stumbling block effect of PTAs
that arises from concerns with preference erosion. 83 They then use the estimates in Limão (2006) to
compute the counterfactual welfare gains through the additional MTL resulting from switching away from
preferences to this subsidy scheme. They find non-negligible gains for countries that grant preferences,
those receiving them and outsiders even if the switch occurs only for the preferences given to least
developed countries by the US, EU and Japan.
     •    Additional dimensions of interdependence
          Non-tariff barriers against non-members

        PTAs can also change the incentive for NTBs against non-members. It is important to understand if
they do so since NTBs account for an increasing share of protection. Moreover, Article XXIV does not
prevent an increase in NTBs after PTAs, so it may be easier for countries to explore them, and thus for us
to detect these effects of PTAs. Bown et al (2014) discuss some case studies and the challenges to analyzing
this question more systematically.
        Prusa and Teh (2010) find that PTAs that include anti-dumping provisions reduce filings between
members by 33-55% but increase them against nonmembers by 10-30%. Limão and Tovar (2011) find that
the external tariff constraints that Turkey had to accept when it formed a customs union with the EU
increased the probability and AVE of Turkish NTBs. Further work on this topic is important.




82  Calvo-Pardo et al (2009) examine tariffs for Asean countries in 1992-2007 and conclude that “preferential
liberalization tends to precede external tariff liberalization”.
83 Import subsidies achieve this because, if they are set at fixed rate, they are independent of the MFN tariffs and thus

the latter can be reduced without any preference erosion.
                                                           62
       Received preferences

         To our knowledge there is no evidence on the effect of new preferences on the external protection
of the receiving country. In part this reflects an empirical identification challenge: the strategic
interdependence criterion indicated a clear path to relate preferences received in the same good to
different partners, which is not obvious for a preference received. However, Ozden and Reinhardt (2005)
find that the elimination of GSP preferences is correlated with subsequent aggregate multilateral
liberalization of that beneficiary country.
       Effect of multilateral tariffs on preferences

        At the start of this subsection we noted that multilateral tariffs can also affect preferential tariffs.
There is little evidence about this direction of causality, which is hard to establish. Fugazza and Robert-
Nicoud (2014) find that the US is more likely to extend duty free preferences in goods where it cut its
multilateral tariff the most in the Uruguay Round. It is not clear if this reflects any dynamic change in
incentives or simply the desire to maintain a fixed preference margin after the multilateral tariff is reduced.
       Bilateral interdependence

        What effect do cooperative preferential tariffs between two countries have on other policies
between them not covered in the agreement? Understanding this type of interdependence can help explain
the policy scope of agreements, e.g. if tariffs and certain NTBs are highly substitutable then an agreement
that only includes the former would be unraveled by the use of NTBs and thus have little value, which may
explain why almost all the agreements in Table 1 include both. It would be interesting to explore that
detailed database to determine the extent of substitution between policies included and those excluded
from agreements. It would also be interesting to test if such substitution increases the probability of
subsequent cooperation in those NTBs.

6.3   Wither multilateral tariffs, wither diversion and non-member discrimination?

         After the completion of the Uruguay Round the number of PTAs increased even further and the
“new” round started in 2001 is yet to be completed. But according to Baldwin (2016, p.112) “the global
tariff-cutting since the rise of regionalism has proceeded as quickly as ever, but outside the WTO [and] as a
result, the specter that regional trading agreements would inefficiently divert trade never really appeared”
and notes that the low MFN tariffs and small applied preference margins in PTAs, which we also noted
before, imply that “bilateral and regional trade agreements provide a relatively small incentive to divert
trade” and points to the building bloc evidence (cf. Estevadeordal et al., 2008) as an additional factor that
should ease concerns about diversion.
         My assessment of the evidence for the diversion potential of PTAs is less optimistic. First, the
evidence that various PTAs hinder tariff liberalization can’t be ignored and we still know little about the
impacts on NTBs. Second, the evidence in section 3 shows that the PTA trade effect on members relative to
non-members is large and not fully explained by tariffs, so even if applied tariffs are small and generate
small incentives for diversion, other barriers may not be. Third, in section 4 we provided evidence that the
trade elasticity is higher when tariffs are low and more certain. So, even if PTAs are simply removing small
applied tariffs and uncertainty about them, they can divert large amounts of trade towards members and
away from non-members. Moreover, the evidence shows the trade effects of PTAs increase over time
                                                        63
suggesting there could be investment and growth effects that amplify initially smaller effects. Fourth, there
is some evidence of PTA contagion (section 5) where a plausible underlying mechanism is trade diversion.
In sum, PTAs may have many positive effects but we should continue to investigate whether and how they
affect trade (and resulting welfare) of members and non-members. 84
         In section 5 we discussed various other motives for pursuing PTAs, So even if these agreements do
not divert trade they may divert FDI (as found by Tintelnot, 2015) and generate a host of externalities for
any countries excluded from the negotiations. One potential solution that has been advanced to minimize
the effects of PTA on non-members is to pursue an open membership policy. In principle this can internalize
the effects of a given PTA, but in practice it neglects the fact that the gains or ability to enforce cooperation
in certain PTAs may be due to their closed membership. Models of the evolution of cooperation may provide
some insight into this issue. It would also be useful to estimate if PTAs affect outcomes for non-members
beyond trade.

7. Lessons and future research

        Given the breadth of the chapter and diversity of agreements considered most conclusions are
qualified but there are some important lessons and guidance for future research in each section, some of
which I highlight here.
   •    Deeper and broader policy cooperation
         From the preamble of a typical recent PTA it is clear they address far more than tariff reductions.
This has long been obvious for agreements such as the European Union; section 2 shows these additional
policy dimensions are now widespread and that ‘’deeper’’ PTAs account for a large and growing trade share
of bilateral world trade. Moreover, the evidence in section 3 shows that PTAs in 1990-2010 had a very small
effect on tariffs applied between members, around 2 log points.
         These facts warrant a shift in research beyond the traditional view of PTAs as static tariff
reductions. Whether and how to do so lead us to systematically identify and group 52 policies along two
dimensions of cooperation: depth and breadth. Future research can pursue each of these dimensions in
turn to determine their importance not just on trade but also on other economic outcomes. One approach
is to explore the rich variation in policies across PTAs or the degree of their legal enforceability within PTAs.
Another approach is to model specific features and test them using detailed data, as illustrated by the work
on policy uncertainty in section 4. The next challenge is to explain not just the impacts of specific policies
in PTAs but also how they interact and what determines their inclusion in different agreements and how it
has evolved over time.
   •    Trade related effects on members
       A common important element across diverse PTAs is their aim to increase bilateral market access.
Do they achieve this aim? The first clear lesson related to the bilateral trade effects of PTAs is that these are




84 Also, the move in PTAs towards addressing “behind-the-border” policies may limit the ability to discriminate against

non-members in certain policies, as Baldwin (2016) points out, but not in others and these types of policies can have
trade impacts that exceed those of small tariff preferences.
                                                          64
large on average, increasing over time and heterogeneous across agreements. The second lesson is that
these effects cannot be fully explained by traditional models where PTAs amount to static preferential tariff
reductions. The third lesson is that trade policy cooperation in modern PTAs aims at lowering not simply
applied bilateral trade costs, e.g. tariffs and non-tariff barriers, but also their uncertainty. Recent evidence
indicates the uncertainty channel helps to explain large and heterogeneous PTA trade effects.
         Future research should explore additional mechanisms that explain the large and heterogeneous
PTA trade effects. One useful approach is to model deeper trade policy cooperation in richer economic
settings, e.g. with investment and intermediates, and estimating the effects on trade and related firm
decisions. Doing so can further bridge the current gap between theory and quantitative work, that focuses
on tariff changes under a constant trade elasticity, and empirical research that estimates average treatment
effects using a PTA dummy.
   •    PTA Formation and Policies

        There has been some advance in empirically identifying the basic trade related mechanisms that
underlie the formation of traditional PTAs: creation, diversion and price effects. The research focusing on
the determinants of PTAs has confirmed the importance of bilateral trade and thus the importance of the
endogeneity concerns in gravity estimates. The evidence for other determinants of trade
creation/diversion in the formation of PTAs is suggestive but more work is required to establish causal
relationships. The same is true for the role of past PTAs by a country and its partners. A similar choice based
estimation could be used to explain the determinants of the type of agreement. However, in the presence
of interdependence of PTAs and multiple choices an alternative approach may be required.
        One promising avenue to understand the determinants of PTA formation and the depth of
cooperation is to explore preferential tariffs and other product level data. This may allow us to test sharper
predictions, establish causal effects and identify certain structural parameters that may be used to quantify
interesting counterfactuals.
        There is still scant evidence on the mechanisms underlying non-traditional motives for PTAs. Some
of those motives are reflected in the broader dimensions of PTAs, described in sections 2 and 5. For
example, the empirical effect of PTAs on FDI is still mixed but there is some evidence that FDI affects the
degree of preferential treatment. We do not yet know if PTAs affect technology transfer or intellectual
property significantly. There are still only a few studies on the labor market impacts of PTAs. In terms of
the non-economic dimensions, there is some evidence of the positive effects of PTAs on bilateral conflict
but almost none addressing the environment, human rights or democracy. These are all interesting areas
for future work, whether to understand the motives for PTA formation or, more generally, to use these large
and frequent shocks as a way to identify the impacts of globalization.
   •    Interdependence

       The other central feature of the current trading system is the interdependence of agreements. The
share of WTO country pairs with PTAs was over 25% in 2010 and their corresponding world trade share
was 55%. Moreover, in 2010 a bilateral country pair with a PTA had on average 52 other bilateral links.
Understanding this interdependence is central to explaining the formation and the worldwide effects of
PTAs. There is evidence that past PTAs by a country or its partners are correlated with the probability of
current PTA formation. This remains an interesting area to explore but future work should tackle the

                                                      65
identification and conceptual challenges inherent in a world where the choice set of partners and policies
is so large and there are strategic interactions.
         Whether PTAs are a stumbling or building bloc to multilateral liberalization remains an important
question. The substantial theoretical literature with arguments in both directions paved the way for
empirical evidence. There has been considerable progress estimating the effect of preferential tariffs on
multilateral or unilateral tariffs from which I draw two robust findings. First, there is a stronger stumbling
bloc effect for countries and goods with lower initial multilateral tariffs. Second, there is no
interdependence for customs unions. But beyond these there is yet no definitive evidence of different
effects across types of agreements. Future work should analyze how PTAs affect the incentives to change
deeper policy cooperation, e.g. uncertainty and non-tariff barriers, towards non-members.
         Even if PTAs do not substantially divert trade they may divert FDI and generate other externalities
towards non-members. Modified rules that allow for more open membership can help internalize some
effects of a given PTA. But in practice such suggestions neglect that the gains or ability to enforce
cooperation in certain PTAs may be due to their closed membership. Models of the evolution of cooperation
may provide some insight into why countries increasingly move their cooperation beyond open
membership organizations such as the WTO and how any resulting negative externalities on non-members
may be minimized.
         In conclusion, PTAs have been, and are likely to continue being, a key source of trade policy reform
and an exciting area for research. Their estimated bilateral trade effects and their policy scope indicate the
value of augmenting the policy and economic structure of our models relative to the traditional view of
PTAs as static tariff reductions. Doing so is important to improve our understanding of the design of PTAs
and their effects. There is also enormous potential for new empirical research. The frequency of new PTAs
and the variation in their policies and enforceability across agreements are but a few examples of the shocks
that can be explored to examine the impacts of globalization on workers, firms, consumers and a variety of
less traditional outcomes. Given the breadth and depth of policies negotiated in PTAs and their far-reaching
effects it is expected and desirable that these agreements continue to be carefully scrutinized both by its
citizens and by multilateral organizations.
