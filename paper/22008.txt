                                             ABSTRACT

Credit booms are not rare and usually precede financial crises. However, some end in a crisis (bad
booms) while others do not (good booms). We document that credit booms start with an increase
in productivity, which subsequently falls much faster during bad booms. We develop a model in which
crises happen when credit markets change to an information regime with careful examination of collateral.
As this examination is more valuable when collateral backs projects with low productivity, crises become
more likely during booms that display large productivity declines. As productivity decays over a boom
as an endogenous result of more economic activity, a crisis may be the result of an exhausted boom
and not necessarily of a negative productivity shock. We test the main predictions of the model and
identify the component of productivity behind crises.

1       Introduction

The recent financial crisis poses challenges for macroeconomists. There is a need for
models displaying financial crises that are preceded by credit booms and that are not
necessarily the result of large negative shocks.1 In this paper we study 34 countries
over 50 years and show that credit booms are not rare; that some end in crises (bad
booms) but others do not (good booms).2 The natural question is whether these two
types of booms just differ on how they end or if there are more intrinsic differences
in their evolution that may determine how they end. We show that all credit booms
start with a positive shock to productivity, but that in bad booms this increase dies off
rather quickly while this is not the case for good booms.3 This suggests that a crisis
may indeed be the result of an exhausted credit boom.

We then develop a simple framework to understand how positive productivity shocks
can lead to credit booms that sometimes end with a financial crash and sometimes do
not. The model begins with the arrival of a new technology. Firms finance projects
that use such technology with short-term collateralized debt (e.g. repo). Lenders can
at a cost learn the quality of the collateral, but it is not always optimal to do this,
in particular when the loan is financing projects that are productive and not very
likely to default. If collateral is not examined over time there is a depreciation of
information in credit markets such that more and more assets can successfully be
used as collateral. This induces a credit boom in which more and more firms obtain
financing and gradually adopt new projects. So there is a link between the credit
boom and the productivity in the economy. We assume decreasing returns such that
    1
      There is now a rich body of evidence showing that credit booms precede crises. Jorda, Schular-
ick, and Taylor (2011) study fourteen developed countries over 140 years (1870-2008) and conclude
that ”...credit growth emerges as the single best predictor of financial instability.” Laeven and Valencia
(2012) study 42 systemic crises in 37 countries over the period 1970 to 2007 and conclude “Banking
crises are . . . often preceded by credit booms, with pre-crisis rapid credit growth in about 30 per-
cent of crises.” Desmirguc-Kunt and Detragiache (1998) obtain the same result using a multivariate
logit model in a panel of 45-65 countries (depending on the specification) over the period 1980-1994.
Other examples include Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012), Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2011), Schu-
larick and Taylor (2012), Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), Borio and Drehmann (2009), Collyns and Sen-
hadji (2002), Gourinchas, Valdes, and Landerretche (2001), Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), Hardy and
Pazarbasioglu (1991), Goldfajn and Valdez (1997), and Drees and Pazarbasioglu (1998).
    2
      We are not the first to note this. Mendoza and Terrones (2008) argue that “not all credit booms end
in financial crises, but most emerging markets crises were associated with credit booms.” This is also
highlighted by Dell’Ariccia et al. (2012) and Herrera, Ordonez, and Trebesch (2014).
    3
      In the case of the recent U.S. financial crisis, for example, Fernald (2012) documents a steady de-
cline in U.S. productivity growth after 2004, during the credit boom that preceded it.


                                                    1
the quality of the marginal project that is financed declines with the total level of
economic activity.
As credit booms evolve, the average productivity in the economy declines and lenders
have more and more incentives to acquire information about the collateral backing
the loan. If at some point the average productivity of the economy decays enough,
there is a change of the information regime in credit markets that leads to the exam-
ination of the collateral that is used to obtain credit; some firms that used to obtain
loans cannot obtain them anymore and output goes down – a crisis. Immediately
after the crash fewer firms operate, average productivity improves and the process
restarts - a sequence of bad booms. We characterize the set of parameters under which
the economy experiences an endogenous credit cycle, which is deterministic and not
triggered by any contemporaneous fundamental shock. Interestingly, in our model it
is the trend of productivity and not its cyclical component which determines the cycli-
cal properties of the economy. This is in contrast with most of the standard literature
on real business cycles.
We also show that, if the new technology keeps improving over time, as the credit
boom evolves, the endogenous decline in average productivity may be compensated
for by an exogenous improvement in the quality of projects such that the change of
the information regime is never triggered. If this is the case, the credit boom ends,
but not in a crisis – a good boom.
In our setting productivity has two components: the probability that a project suc-
ceeds and the productivity conditional on success. In the data productivity is usually
measured as a residual, such as total factor productivity (TFP), but the analysis sug-
gests that these two components have different implications for the generation of
crises. The component that induces information acquisition about collateral in credit
markets is the one that drives the probability that projects succeed, as this determines
the probability that firms default and that lenders end up owning the collateral. The
second component determines the surplus for the firms upon success and does not
affect lenders’ incentives to acquire information about collateral, consequently not
affecting the likelihood of a crisis.
While most of the macroeconomic literature implicitly assumes that firms always suc-
ceed and focuses on the second component, we explicitly differentiate between the
two. We show how the first component critically affects debt markets, while the sec-
ond is more relevant for equity markets. Based on these considerations we construct

                                           2
an index for the distance to insolvency (a proxy for the average default probability in
the economy - the first component) using the methodology developed by Atkeson,
Eisfeldt, and Weill (2013) for the U.S. to most countries in our sample. Using these
data we test two implications of the model in terms of the decomposition of pro-
ductivity. First, we complement our finding that bad booms are more likely when
productivity declines over the boom, showing that this effect comes mostly from an
increase of the probability of default over the boom – the relevant component of pro-
ductivity for credit markets. Then, we show that the average default probability is
indeed significant in explaining the dynamics of TFP.

Conceptually, the phenomena we find empirically suggests that viewing aggregate
fluctuations as deviations from a trend is too stark (see Lucas (1977)). As far as fluc-
tuations that involve financial crises are concerned, changes in the trend of techno-
logical change, credit booms and crises are intimately related. Financial crises are not
necessarily the result of negative productivity shocks around the trend, but the trend
itself determines the likelihood of crises and the cyclical properties of the economy.
Cyclical dynamics originate at a lower frequency than is typically studied.

Modeling financial crises as a change of the information regime in credit markets is
motivated by Gorton and Ordonez (2014), a macroeconomic model based on the mi-
cro foundations of Gorton and Pennacchi (1990) and Dang, Gorton, and Holmström
(2013). These authors argue that short-term debt, in the form of bank liabilities or
money market instruments, is designed to provide transactions services by allow-
ing trade between agents without fear of adverse selection. This is accomplished by
designing debt to be “information-insensitive,” that is, such that it is not profitable
for any agent to produce private information about the assets backing the debt, the
collateral. Adverse selection is avoided in trade, and in our model in credit.

We differ from Gorton and Ordonez (2014) in two very important respects. First, we
introduce decreasing marginal returns and changes to the set of technological oppor-
tunities. High quality projects are scarce, so as more firms operate in the economy
they increasingly use lower quality projects. This extension is critical to understand
the relation between the evolution of productivity and the generation of crises. Sec-
ond, in contrast to Gorton and Ordonez (2014) who focus on one-sided information
production (only lenders could produce information), here we allow two-sided in-
formation production: both borrowers and lenders can acquire information. This
extension is critical for generating crashes, not as a response to exogenous “shocks,”

                                           3
as in their case, but just as a response to endogenous productivity growth.

Our finding that positive productivity shocks occur at the start of the boom has been
already noted by economic historians and growth economists. Indeed, in the long-
term, technology such as the steam locomotive, telegraph, electricity or IT has played
a central role in understanding growth (see Kendrick (1961), Abramovitz (1956), Gor-
don (2010) and Shackleton (2013)).4 Here we show that these technological revolu-
tions can also play a critical role on shaping the cyclical properties and the recurrence
of financial crises in certain economies.

Our finding that credit booms average ten years is related to studies of “medium-term
business cycles.” Cao and L’Huiller (2014) also link technological change to crises.
They analyze three important crises: the U.S. in 2007-2008, the Japanese stagnation of
the 1990s and the Great Depression. They show that each of these was preceded by a
technological revolution and also find a ten year lag between the technological revo-
lution and the start of the crisis. Comin and Gertler (2006) find that TFP moves pro-
cyclically over the medium term (in U.S. quarterly data from 1948:1-2001:2 – a period
without a systemic financial crisis).5 They do not analyze credit variables however.
Drehmann, Borio, and Tsatsaronis (2012) use an analysis of turning points (as well
as frequency-based filters) to study six variables for seven countries over the period
1960-2011. Their main finding is the existence of a medium-term component in credit
fluctuations. Similar conclusions are reach by Claessens, Motto, and Terrones (2011)).
We show that there is a difference in productivity growth over credit booms that end
in a financial crisis and booms that do not end in a crisis, which is relevant for un-
derstanding the conditions under which these technological changes are related to
subsequent financial crashes.

A recent paper that revives the discussion of purely endogenous and deterministic
cycles, as we obtain in our setting, is Beaudry, Galizia, and Portier (2015). In their
case, cycles are determined by complementarities between aggregate employment
and consumption, which induce smooth deterministic cycles. In our case there are
complementarities between the volume of credit and the incentives for information
acquisition. Since this complementarity is not relevant unless information constraints
   4
     Field (2010), studying the period 1890 - 2004 in the U.S., argues that TFP growth rates are “consis-
tent with a view that the arrival of economically important innovations may be quite discontinuous
and cluster in particular epochs” (p. 329).
   5
     The U.S. S&L crisis never threatened the solvency of the entire financial system; it was costly, but
not systemic.


                                                   4
bind, our model displays deterministic cycles that are not smooth – long booms that
suddenly and dramatically end in crises.

In the next section we describe the data and analyze productivity growth, both factor
productivity (TFP) and labor productivity (LP), over credit booms, and crises. In
Section 3 we describe and solve the model, focusing on the information properties of
collateralized debt. In Section 4 we study the aggregate and dynamic implications
of information, focusing on endogenous cycles. We test the main predictions of the
model in Section 5. In Section 6, we conclude.



2        Good Booms, Bad Booms: Empirical Evidence

Not all credit booms end in a financial crisis. Why do some booms end in a crisis
while others do not? To address this question empirically we investigate productivity
(total factor productivity and labor productivity) trends during booms. We define a
“credit boom” below and analyze the aggregate-level relations between credit, TFP
and LP growth and the occurrence of financial crises. We do not test any hypotheses
but rather organize the data to develop some preliminary stylized facts.


2.1        Data

There are clearly important data decisions to make when studying credit booms. The
stylized facts of business cycles were developed by focusing primarily on the U.S.,
starting with Kydland and Prescott (1990) who looked at U.S. quarterly data over
1954-1989, using the Hodrick-Prescott (H-P) filter. While the literature by now is very
large, it continues to use the H-P filter and typically does not include credit variables.
Over the last 25 years or so, longer time series have been used. But, these are only
available for a smaller panel of countries. Backus and Kehoe (1992), for example,
study ten developed countries where there is at least 100 years of data. Stock and
Watson (2003) study seven developed countries over the period 1960-2002. Aguiar
and Gopinath (2007) study thirteen middle-income and thirteen developed countries
with at least 40 quarters of data. While the focus of this literature was not on credit
variables, this has changed since the recent U.S. financial crisis.6
    6
        Many of these studies were cited in footnote 1.


                                                      5
To focus on financial crises, however, requires facing a trade-off between breadth
of countries and length of series, as developed countries provides better data and
longer time series, but fewer events of financial distress (see the discussion in Ley and
Misch (2014)). We study a cross section that includes emerging countries at the cost
of time series length, as do Gourinchas, Valdes, and Landerretche (2001), Mendoza
and Terrones (2008) and Herrera, Ordonez, and Trebesch (2014). More specifically, we
analyze a sample of 34 countries (17 advanced countries and 17 emerging markets)
over a 50 year time span, 1960-2010. A list of the countries we use is in the Appendix
Table A.1.

For credit we use domestic credit to the private sector over GDP, from the World Bank
Macro Dataset. This variable is defined as the financial resources provided to the
private sector, such as loans, purchases of non-equity securities, trade credit and other
account receivables, that establish a claim for repayment. For some countries these
claims include credit to public enterprises. Gourinchas, Valdes, and Landerretche
(2001) and Mendoza and Terrones (2008) measure credit as claims on the non-banking
private sector from banking institutions. We choose domestic credit to the private
sector because of its breadth – it includes not only bank credit but also corporate
bonds and trade credit. Details about the definition of the variables and about the
data sources are provided in the Appendix Table A.2.

For total factor productivity, we obtain measured aggregate TFP constructed by Men-
doza and Terrones (2008) through Solow residuals. Mendoza and Terrones back out
the capital stock from investment flows using the perpetual inventory method, and
use hours-adjusted employment as the labor measure. For labor productivity we use
the hours-adjusted output-labor ratio from the Total Economy Database (TED).

For financial crises, we follow the definitions of Laeven and Valencia (2012). Their
database covers the period 1970 to 2011.7 They define a systemic banking crisis as oc-
curring if two conditions are met: (1) there are “significant signs of financial distress
in the banking system (as indicated by significant bank runs, losses in the banking
system, and/or bank liquidations)” and (2) if there are “significant banking policy
intervention measures in response to significant losses in the banking system.” Sig-
nificant policy interventions include: (1) extensive liquidity support (when central
   7
    There is a censoring problem at the end of our sample because in some cases the credit boom
continues in spite of the recent 2007 financial crisis in the U.S. and the wave of 2008 financial crises in
Europe. The results are robust to eliminating these crises from the sample.


                                                    6
bank claims on the financial sector to deposits exceeds five percent and more than
double relative to the pre-crisis level); (2) bank restructuring gross costs are at least
three percent of GDP; (3) significant bank nationalizations; (4) significant guarantees
are out in place; (5) there are significant asset purchases (at least five percent of GDP);
(6) there are deposit freezes and/or bank holidays.



2.2    Definition and Classification of Credit Booms

There is no consensus in the literature about the definition of a “credit boom.” A boom
is usually defined by the ratio of credit growth -to-GDP relative to a trend, so there
is the issue of how the trend is determined. This choice not only determines whether
booms are short or long, but usually discards the initial phase of a sustained increase
in credit, which is assigned to the trend. Theory is silent on this issue.

Hodrick and Prescott analyzed U.S. data over a period during which there was no
financial crisis in the United States. Separating the growth component from the devi-
ation led to the view that the growth component is driven by technological change,
while deviations are due to technological “shocks”. Prescott (1986) argues that tech-
nology shocks (measured by TFP) are highly procyclical and “account for more than
half the fluctuations in the postwar period.”8

Detrending raises the issue of whether all the data should be used, or only retro-
spective data. The H-P filter uses all the data. Instead, as we want to impose as
few preconceptions as possible, we propose a definition of a “credit boom” that is
more agnostic as it does not rely on future data. We define a credit boom as start-
ing whenever a country experiences three consecutive years of positive credit growth
that average more than xs . The boom ends whenever a country experiences at least
two years of credit growth not higher than xe . In our baseline experiments we choose
xs = 5% and xe = 0%. The choice of thresholds is based on the average credit growth
in the sample. Changes in thresholds do not alter the results qualitatively. We find 87
booms based on this definition, which are listed in the Appendix Table A.3.

There are several reasons for our approach. First, we do not want to implicitly set
an upper bound on the length of the boom. Using deviations from a trend implies
   8
    Band pass filters are an alternative to the H-P filter. See Baxter and King (1999) and Christiano and
Fitzgerald (2003).


                                                   7
that a boom has predetermined maximum length, as a protracted boom would be
included in the trend component. We want to avoid this so we do not impose a
trend-cycle decomposition on the data. The data will inform us as to whether crises
are associated with longer or shorter booms. Second, the data on credit exhibit very
large heterogeneity across countries. Sometimes there are strong increases in credit
that appear as structural breaks, while other times there are large sudden movements.
We do not take a stand on which of these events are more relevant for studying “credit
booms.”

We will then compare our results with those obtained by H-P filtering the credit series
and will show that indeed detrending misses important features of the data in the
larger, longer, sample.9 The phenomena of interest happen at lower frequencies and
it seems difficult to separate trend changes from fluctuations. Changes in technology
seem important for the gestation of a financial crisis, but not because of the traditional
contemporaneous negative shock but because the past trend affects the cyclical properties
of the economy.

Once we have identified these credit booms, we can classify them between bad or
good depending on whether they are accompanied by a financial crisis in a neigh-
borhood of three years of the end of the boom, or not, respectively.10 In our sample
there are 47 crises identified by Laeven and Valencia (2012). Table 1 shows that 34 of
those crises happened at the end of one of the 87 booms we have identified (hence we
have 34 bad booms in the sample). There were eight crises that did not occur at the
end of a boom (but occurred during a boom), and there were five crises that were not
associated with any boom. So, there are good booms and bad booms, but also crises
unrelated to the end of booms, or with no booms at all.

     As dating the start and end of a crisis is typically based on observing government actions it is
difficult to precisely date crises, so we use a three year window. See Boyd, De Nicolo, and Loukoianova
(2011). Our results are not significantly altered, however, if for example we look for crises within two
years of the end of the boom.

heterogeneity, which we exploit next when comparing these different booms.



2.3    Properties of Good Booms and Bad Booms

Table 2 provides an overview of the booms, with their average duration and average
growth in credit, TFP, LP, patents granted and investment. The last column shows the
t-statistic for the null hypothesis that the mean for each variable is the same for booms
that end in a crisis and those that do not. Our first result is that, given our definition,
booms are not rare. Of the 1695 years in the sample, 929 were spent in a boom, 55
percent of the time. On, average, over 50 years, a country spent 27 years in a boom
and, on average, 12 of those years were spent in a boom that ended in a crisis. Our
second result is that, while credit growth, on average, is the same for good booms
and bad booms, productivity growth is higher during good booms, both measured
by TFP and LP.11

Table 3 shows advanced economies and Table 4 shows emerging economies.12 Even
though it is still the case that TFP and LP growth are significantly larger during good
booms, in emerging economies the growth in credit is also significantly higher dur-
ing bad booms, but not in advanced economies. This difference is consistent with

     The subsamples for crisis and non-crisis booms are small, as shown in Table 2, so there may be
concerns about the power of the test. Resampling by randomly selecting pairs (a bootstrap) and re-
peating the test shows that the null is rejected with more confidence, confirming that the differences in
the data do indeed exist.

previous literature that finds an asymmetry between boom episodes in emerging and
advanced countries. Gourinchas, Valdes, and Landerretche (2001) find that emerg-
ing markets are more prone to credit booms. Mendoza and Terrones (2008) find that
countries with fixed or managed exchange rates are more subject to credit booms and
that in these countries credit booms are more likely to end in a crisis. Herrera, Or-
donez, and Trebesch (2014) find that in emerging economies credit booms are usually
accompanied by an increase in the government’s popularity.

Table 5 shows the same summary statistics for the first five years of booms, and in
addition to the previous results, we see a difference in patents granted over good
booms and bad booms.13 The growth of patents granted is positive in good booms
and negative in bad booms, with a significant difference between them, consistent
with technological change dying out over the bad booms, as reflected in lower TFP
and LP growth. This result suggests that a large component of the difference between
good and bad booms arises at the initial phase of the credit boom, the first five years.

Figure 1 shows plots of the average growth rates for TFP, LP, real GDP, and capital
formation, for both good booms and bad booms. Figure A.2 in the Appendix shows

the median growth rates for the same variables. The figure shows that a credit boom
starts with a positive shock to productivity, but then the paths of growth rates differ
for good booms and bad booms. In bad booms, the productivity growth rates die off
as do the growth rates for real GDP and capital formation. Our preferred measure of
productivity is labor productivity (it is measured with less error). Panel (b) makes the
point dramatically. In good booms LP growth is high and flat, while in bad booms it
nose dives by the fourth year the boom starts.

Next we confirm that the different patterns between good booms and bad booms
that are evident in panels (a) and (b) of Figure 1 are also significant. To do this we
ask whether the changes in TFP and LP predict the type of boom, by running the
following regression.

       Logit (BadBoomj,t |Boomj,t ) =      (↵ +     Xj,t ) .

BadBoomj,t is the odds ratio of being in a bad boom conditional on being in a boom
in country j at period t, defined by ln[P r(BadBoomj,t )/(1 P r(BadBoomj,t ))], where
P r(BadBoomj,t ) is the probability a boom in country j at period t has been identified
as bad. The variable X = { T F P, LP } represents the change in the respective
measure of productivity in country j at period t.

If the change in TFP, for example, is on average declining over the boom, then the
coefficient on the prediction of bad booms should be negative, i.e., a positive change
in TFP is making the boom less likely to be a bad boom.14 We see exactly this pattern
in Table 6, for both our measures of productivity change.15

The marginal effect in the table shows the change in the probability of being in a bad
boom given a change of one standard deviation in the relevant productivity variable.
The first column of Table 6, for example, shows that, conditional on being in a boom,
an increase of one standard deviation in TFP reduces the probability of being in a bad
boom (a boom that will end in a crisis) by 6%.16
The patterns for the change in real GDP and investment also significantly differ across
good booms and bad booms. Table 7 shows the results of the previous regression but
using investment and real GDP instead. On average a decline in investment and real
GDP also are more likely to happen during bad booms.

The results above show significant differences between good and bad booms, in par-
ticular at the initial phase of the boom. This was the reason we decided not to detrend
  14
     As we run the regressions conditional on being in a boom, positive changes in productivity should
predict good booms, and the coefficient should be the same but with the opposite sign.
  15
     Since introducing fixed effects into a logit model has well-known problems, such as the incidental
parameter problem (see Arellano and Hahn (2007) and Greene (2004)), we also run a linear probability
model (LPM) to assess the relevance of country fixed effects.
  16
     The marginal effects are the average change in the conditional expectation function implied by the
model. See the discussion in Angrist and Pischke (2009).

credit when defining a boom, as by construction this procedure tends to shorten the
length of the boom by excluding the initial increase of credit and assigning it to the
trend. Table 8 compares the results of using the H-P filter to detect booms (using a
smoothing parameter of 100 and following the Mendoza and Terrones (2008) defini-
tion that a boom occurs when credit to the private sector grows by more than a typical
business cycle expansion) to our results with the agnostic definition of a boom. The
first line of the table shows that of the 161 boom-years detected using the H-P filter,
80% of those boom years are in our sample of boom-years. Line 2 shows that of the
40 booms detected with the H-P filter, we detected 91 percent of those booms. The
bottom part of the table shows that 63 percent of the H-P filter booms starts more than
three years after booms start according to our definition. This, of course, is not sur-
prising because the H-P filter is constraining the data and pushing more of the boom
into the trend. So, the H-P filter booms are essentially occurring in the middle of our
booms. The average duration of our booms is ten years while the average duration
of an H-P filter boom is five years, also by construction.

Tables 9, 10 and 11 constitute a summary of the previous comparisons using this
boom definition. In this case, there are 44 booms, 21 of which end in a crisis. Of the
1651 years in the sample, only 202 are spent in a boom, 12 percent. From this point of
view, booms are not central to aggregate economic activity. Good and bad booms are
not statistically different in their evolution of productivity, and this is the case both
for advanced and emerging economies.

In the Appendix, Figures A.3 and A.4 are the counterparts to Figures 1 and A.2 with
credit booms determined by H-P filtering. Again, these figures do not display any

2.5   The Effect of Productivity Growth on Crises

We now turn to examining directly the effects of TFP and LP growth on the likelihood
of a financial crisis. Recent studies, such as Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2011), has
converged on the growth in credit as a key predictor of financial crises. We first
verify that this is also true in our sample by examining how lagged measures of credit
growth predict financial crises with a Logit model

      Logit (Crisisj,t ) =        (↵ +      Credj,t 1 ) .

Crisisj,t is the odds ratio of a crisis, defined by ln[P r(Crisist,j )/(1 P r(Crisist,j ))],
where P r(Crisisj,t ) is the probability of a crisis at period t in country j.

We follow the literature and examine two measures of lagged credit growth, the
change in credit over the previous five years (5Ychange) and the lagged five-year
moving average of credit growth (5YchangeMA). The results, with and without coun-
try fixed effects, are shown in Table 12 . Consistent with previous literature, the table
shows that both measures of credit growth are significant predictors of the likelihood
of a financial crisis, and that country fixed effects are not a critical determinant in
this relation. The marginal effect in the table shows the change in the probability of
a crisis given a change of one standard deviation in the credit. The first column, for
example, shows that an increase of one standard deviation in the volume of lagged
credit increases the probability of a crisis by 1%.

We now turn to asking whether changes in TFP and LP during the boom, measured
by the lagged five-year change and the lagged five-year moving average, reduce the
likelihood of the boom ending in a financial crisis, as suggested by Figure 1.

The results are shown in Tables 13 and 14. Growth in TFP appears unrelated to crises
although TFP growth is higher on average in booms that do not end in a crisis (as
seen in the previous Tables).17 Further, credit growth remains significant. Table 14

shows the results when growth in LP is used as a predictor. Here the results show
that growth in LP marginally reduces the likelihood of a crisis occurring at the end
of the boom. Tables A.4 and A.5 are the counterparts of Tables 13 and 14 showing
that productivity does not affect the likelihood of crises when credit is H-P filtered,
reinforcing our previous result that detrending misses all these findings.



2.6   Summary

We take the following points from this empirical study:

   1. Credit booms are not rare and occur in both advanced and emerging economies.

   2. Booms are ten years long in average.

   3. Booms start with a positive shock to TFP and LP growth. The subsequent dy-
      namics of productivity growth differ between good and bad booms, declining
      quickly in bad booms.

   4. Crises are less likely with larger productivity growth during the boom.

   5. These findings are not found when applying H-P filtering.

Point 1 emerges when we adopt the agnostic boom definition, without detrending
credit. The results then show that booms are an important part of aggregate economic
activity. Point 2 is the connection with the economic history literature which looks
at average TFP and LP growth over longer periods, usually ten years, which is the
average duration of a boom in our data. Point 3 suggests a link between technological
change and aggregate cyclical behavior, in particular financial crises, showing that
the paths of productivity differ over booms which end in a crisis and those that do
not. This is also reflected in the growth rate of patent activity, which declines during
bad booms and rises during good booms. Point 4 highlights that the likelihood of a
financial crisis is higher when LP growth is lower. H-P filtering misses these findings

We now turn to a model that captures these empirical findings.

3     The Model

3.1   Setting

The model builds on Gorton and Ordonez (2014). Time is discrete and denoted by
t 2 {0, 1, ....}. The economy is characterized by two overlapping generations – young
and old – each a continuum of agents with mass 1, and three types of goods – nu-
meraire, land and managerial skills. Each generation is risk neutral and derives utility
from consuming numeraire at the end of each period. Numeraire is non-storable,
productive and reproducible – it can be used to produce more numeraire, hence we
denote it by K. Land is storable, but non-productive and non-reproducible. Manage-
rial skills are non-transferrable and their use does not generate disutility.

We interpret the young generation as households and the old generation as firms. Only
firms have access to an inelastic fixed supply of managerial skills, which we denote by
L⇤ . These skills can be combined with numeraire in a stochastic Leontief technology
to produce more numeraire, K 0 .
             8
             <A min{K, L⇤ }    with prob. q
      K0 =
             :     0           with prob. (1       q).


The first important difference with Gorton and Ordonez (2014) is the following. The
quality of technology is given by q, which will be subject to exogenous shocks but
also driven endogenously by the size of the credit boom. We assume the technology
is determined by a limited supply of projects in the economy, also with mass 1. There
are two types of projects that are available: A fraction has high probability of suc-
cess, qH , and the rest have a low probability of success, qL . We assume all projects
are efficient, i.e., qH A > qL A > 1, which implies that the optimal scale of numeraire
in production is K ⇤ = L⇤ for all projects, independent of their success probability
q 2 {qL , qH }. For now we assume the average quality of the projects, , is fixed, but
later we allow for shocks to it. An increase in will be interpreted, for instance, as a
technological improvement.

Households and firms not only differ in their managerial skills, but also in their initial
endowments. Only households are born with an endowment of numeraire K > K ⇤ ,
which is enough to sustain optimal production.

                                           19
Even though non-productive, land potentially has an intrinsic value. If land is ”good”,
it can deliver C units of numeraire, but only once. If land is ”bad”, it does not deliver
anything. We assume a fraction pb of land is good. At the beginning of the period,
different units of land i can potentially be viewed differently, with respect to their
quality. We denote these priors of being good pi and assume they are commonly
known by all agents in the economy.

Privately observing the quality of land costs l units of numeraire to households and
  b units of managerial skills to firms. We assume households only have numeraire at

the beginning of the period and using l for monitoring diverts its use for consump-
tion. Similarly, firms only have managerial skills at the beginning of the period and
using b for monitoring diverts their use from production.

To fix ideas it is useful to think of an example. Assume gold is the intrinsic value
of land. Land is good if it has gold underground, with a market value C in terms
of numeraire. Land is bad if it does not have any gold underground. Gold is non-
observable at first sight, but there is a common perception about the probability each
unit of land has gold underground, which is possible to confirm by mining the land
at a cost b for firms, or l for households.

In this simple setting, resources are in the wrong hands. Households have numeraire
while firms have managerial skills but no numeraire that is essential to produce. Since
production is efficient, if output was verifiable it would be possible for households to
lend the optimal amount of numeraire K ⇤ to firms using state contingent claims. In
contrast, if output is non-verifiable, firms would never repay and households would
never be willing to lend.

We will focus on this latter case, in which firms can hide the numeraire. How-
ever, we will assume firms cannot hide land, which makes land useful as collateral.
Firms can credibly promise to transfer a fraction of land to households in the event
of not repaying numeraire, which relaxes the financing constraint from output non-
verifiability. Hence, since land can be transferred across generations, firms hold land.
When young, agents use their endowment of numeraire to buy land, which is then
useful as collateral to borrow and to produce when old. To guarantee feasibility we
assume K > C.

The perception about the quality of collateral then becomes critical in facilitating
loans. To be precise, we further assume that C > K ⇤ . This implies that land that

                                           20
is known to be good can sustain the optimal loan, K ⇤ . Contrarily, land that is known
to be bad is not able to sustain any loan. We refer to firms that have land with a posi-
tive probability of being good (p > 0) as active firms, since in contrast to firms that are
known to hold bad land, they can actively participate in the loan market and raise
funds to start their projects.18

We assume that active firms are randomly assigned to a queue to choose their project.
When a firm has its turn to choose its project according to its position in the queue,
an active firm naturally picks the project with the highest q among those remaining
in the pool. We assume that lenders know (or can infer in equilibrium) the mass of
active firms in the economy, which we denote by ⌘, but not each firm’s position in
the queue. This implies that only firms know their individual project quality, q, but
lenders just know the average productivity of projects among active firms, which we
denote by qb(⌘). Lenders’ beliefs of the probability of success for any single firm are
then
              8
              <         qH          if ⌘ <
      qb(⌘) =         ⇣     ⌘
              : qH + 1        qL if ⌘        .
                  ⌘              ⌘



This implies that the average productivity of projects in the economy weakly declines
with the mass of active firms, ⌘, and reaches the minimum when all firms are active
(i.e, when ⌘ = 1).

Remark on the interpretation of collateral: As in Gorton and Ordonez (2014), for
simplicity we abstract from including financial intermediaries in the model and in-
stead we have households lending directly to firms. The debt we have in mind is
short-term debt like sale and repurchase agreements (“repo”) or other money market
instruments. In these cases, the collateral is either a specific bond or a portfolio of
bonds and loans. The backing collateral is hard to value as it does not trade in cen-
tralized markets where prices are observable. But, we can also think of the debt as
longer term. For example, Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmar (2012) show that firms, in fact,
use land holdings as the basis for borrowing.19
  18
      The assumption that active firms are those for whom p > 0 is just imposed for simplicity, and
is clearly not restrictive. If we add a fixed cost of operation, then it would be necessary a minimum
amount of funding to operate, and firms having collateral with small but strictly positive beliefs p
would not be active either.
   19
      Firms use their land as pledgeable assets for borrowing. In 1993, 59 percent of U.S. firms reported


                                                   21
3.2     Optimal loan for a single firm

We first study the optimal short-term collateralized debt for a single firm with a
project that has a probability of success q, with a unit of land that is good with prob-
ability p, and when there is a total mass of active firms ⌘.20 Both borrowers and
lenders may want to produce information about the collateral type.21 Loans that trig-
ger information production (information-sensitive debt) are costly – either borrowers
acquire information at a cost b or have to compensate lenders for their information
cost l . Loans that do not trigger information production (information-insensitive
debt), however, may not be feasible as they introduce a fear for asymmetric informa-
tion – they introduce incentives for either the borrower or the lender to deviate and
acquire information privately to take advantage of its counterparty. The magnitude
of this fear determines the level of debt that can be information-insensitivity and,
ultimately, the volume and dynamics of information in the economy.


3.2.1    Information-Sensitive Debt

Lenders can learn the true value of the borrower’s land by using l of numeraire.
Borrowers can learn the true value of their own land by using b of managerial skills,
leaving only L⇤     b to be used in the project, which would generate A min{K, L
                                                                                 ⇤
                                                                                   b}

in case of success (with probability q), and 0 otherwise.

We assume lenders are competitive. If they are the ones acquiring information, as
they are risk neutral,22

                l
        p[b
          q (⌘)RIS + (1     qb(⌘))xlIS C] = pK + l ,
landholdings and of those holding land, the value of the real estate accounted for 19 percent of their
market value. Also, see Gan (2007) and Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmar (2012).
   20
      When no confusion is created we will dispense with the use of i and refer to p as the probability a
generic unit of land is good.
   21
      It may seem odd that the borrower has to produce information about his own collateral. But, in
the context of corporations owning land, for example, they would not know the value of their land
holdings all the time. The same would be the case if the collateral being offered by the firm is an asset-
backed security, as its value is not known because these securities are complicated and do not trade
frequently or on centralized exchanges where the price is observable and conveys information.
   22
      Risk neutrality is without loss of generality because we will show that debt is risk-free. Perfect
competition can be simply rationalized by assuming that only a fraction of firms have skills L⇤ , then
there would exist more lenders offering loans than borrowers requiring loans.




                                                   22
where K is the size of the loan, RIS
                                  l
                                     is the face value of the debt and xlIS is the fraction
of land posted by the firm as collateral. The subscript IS denotes an ”information-
sensitive” loan, while the superscript l denotes that lenders acquire information.

In this setting debt is risk-free, that is firms will pay the same in the case of success
or failure. Otherwise, RIS l
                             > xlIS C, firms always default, handing over the collateral
rather than repaying the debt. Contrarily, if RIS   l
                                                        < xlIS C firms always sell the col-
lateral directly at a price C and repay lenders RIS   l
                                                        . This pins down the fraction of
collateral posted by a firm, which is a function of p and independent of q:

      l                                       pK +      l
     RIS = xlIS C         )          xlIS =                   1.
                                                pC

Note that, since the fraction of land posted as collateral does not depend on q, firms
cannot signal their q by posting different fraction of land as collateral (or similarly,
by offering to pay different rates). Intuitively, since collateral completely prevents
default, the loan cannot be used to signal the probability of default.

Expected total consumption for firms is pC + p(qAK xlIS C). Then, plugging xlIS
in equilibrium, expected net profits (net of the land value pC from the first term) from
information-sensitive debt, conditional on lenders acquiring information, are

     E(⇡|p, q, IS, l) = max{pK ⇤ (qA     1)        l , 0}.


Intuitively, with probability p collateral is good and sustains K ⇤ (qA 1) numeraire
in expectation and with probability (1 p) collateral is bad and does not sustain any
borrowing. The firm always has to compensate lenders for not consuming l .

Similarly, we can compute these expected net profits in the case borrowers acquire
information directly at a cost b in terms of managerial skills. Regardless of what the
borrower finds, the firm will only have L⇤       b managerial skills remaining for using

in the project. If the borrower finds out that the land is good he will then just borrow
K⇤     b to operate at the, now lower, optimal scale.

In this case lenders also break even after borrowers demonstrate the land is good.

           b
     qb(⌘)RIS + (1    qb(⌘))xbIS C   K = 0.

Since debt is risk-free, RIS

                             = xbIS C and xbIS =     K

                                                       .     Ex-ante expected total consumption

                                              23
for the borrower is pC + p(qAK xbIS C). Then, plugging xbIS in equilibrium, expected
net profits (again net of the land value pC) are

        E(⇡|p, q, IS, b) = max{p(K ⇤         b )(qA     1), 0}.


Then, expected profits from information-sensitive debt effectively are

        E(⇡|p, q, IS) = max {pK ⇤ (qA        1)       , 0}                                           (1)


where

         ⌘ min{ l ,    b p(qA    1)}.


In the case of using an information-sensitive loan, firms choose to produce infor-
mation if b p(qA 1) < l , and prefer that lenders produce information otherwise.
When lenders produce information, borrowers compensate them for not consum-
ing l . When borrowers produce information, they divert resources away from the
project, which is costly, only if they find out the land is good (with probability p) and
cannot use b managerial skills for production.

In Figure 2 we show the expected information-sensitive loan for the case in which
  b p(qA   1) < l for all p. As can be seen the loan is declining in p as the project
is less likely to be financed when the collateral is less likely to be good, and it is
always below the optimal loan size, K ⇤ , as managerial skills are inefficiently wasted
in monitoring the quality of land.23


3.2.2    Information-Insensitive Debt

Another possibility for firms is to borrow such that there is no information acqui-
sition. Information acquisition is private, however, and there may be incentives to
deviate. We assume information is private immediately after being obtained and be-
comes public at the end of the period. Still, the agent can credibly disclose his private
information immediately if it is beneficial to do so. This introduces incentives for both

lenders and borrowers to obtain information before the loan is negotiated and to take
advantage of such private information before it becomes common knowledge.   1/1


As lenders break even in equilibrium

     qb(⌘)RII + (1     qb(⌘))pxII C = K,

subject to debt being risk-free, RII = xII pC. Then

             K
     xII =       1.
             pC

For this contract to be information-insensitive, we have to guarantee that neither
lenders nor borrowers have incentives to deviate and check the value of collateral
privately. Lenders want to deviate because they can lend at beneficial contract pro-
visions if the collateral is good, and not lend at all if the collateral is bad. Borrowers
want to deviate because they can borrow at beneficial contract provisions if the col-
lateral is bad and renegotiate even better conditions if the collateral is good.

Lenders want to deviate if the expected gains from acquiring information, evaluated
at xII and RII , are greater than the private losses, l , from acquiring information,

     p[b
       q (⌘)RII + (1    qb(⌘))xII C   K] >    l        )      (1   p)(1   qb(⌘))K >   l.




                                              25
More specifically, lenders’ benefits of acquiring information come from not lending
when the collateral is bad and making profits in expectation from lending when the
collateral is good. In this last case, if there is default, which occurs with probability
(1 qb(⌘)), the lender can sell collateral that was obtained at pxII C = K at a price
xII C, making a net gain of (1 p)xII C = (1 p) Kp . The condition that guarantees that
lenders do not want to produce information when facing information-insensitive debt
can then be expressed in terms of the loan size,

                       l
     K<                             .                                                     (2)
             (1    p)(1    qb(⌘))

Note that this condition for no information acquisition by lenders depends on the
lenders’ expected probability of success, qb(⌘). This is central to the dynamics we will
discuss subsequently.

Loans will never be larger than K ⇤ (as the optimal size of the project is L⇤ ) and the
lender will never lend more than pC, which is the expected value of the whole unit of
land. Given these two “technological” restrictions and the informational restriction
from equation (2), information-insensitive loans are such that

                                             (1   p)(1      qb(⌘))

As depicted in Figure 3, the region of information-insensitive debt that does not in-
duce lenders to privately deviate and acquire information is the one under the blue
solid curve.

Similarly, borrowers want to deviate if the expected gains from acquiring informa-
tion, evaluated at xII and RII , are greater than the losses b from acquiring infor-
mation. Specifically, if borrowers acquire information, their expected benefits are
p(K ⇤    b )(qA  1) + (1 p) min{K, K ⇤       b }(qA    1). With probability p land is good
and the firm borrows K   ⇤
                               b as there are only L
                                                     ⇤
                                                           b managerial skills remaining.

With probability 1 p land is bad and the firm borrows the minimum between the
original contract K or the optimum conditional on having used managerial skills to
acquire information, K ⇤    b . If borrowers do not acquire information, their benefits

are K(qA 1). Hence borrowers do not acquire information if

     p(K ⇤        b )(qA   1) + (1      p) min{K, K ⇤       b }(qA      1) < K(qA   1).


                                                  26
The condition that guarantees that borrowers do not want to produce information
under information-insensitive debt can also be expressed in terms of the loan size,

Combining the two conditions (3) and (4), information-insensitive debt is feasible
only when the loan is both above the red dotted line in Figure 3 (to avoid information
                                                                               1/1

sition by lenders). In other words, information-insensitive debt is feasible only for
relatively high beliefs p > p⇤ , where the threshold p⇤ is given by the point in which
K l (p⇤ ) = K b (p⇤ ) from equations (3) and (4). Then

It is clear from inspecting equation (5) that the region in which information-insensitive
debt is feasible widens with information costs (as p⇤ decreases with b and l ) and
shrinks with the mass of active firms (as p⇤ decreases with qb, which decreases with ⌘).

Lemma 1 The cutoff p⇤ is monotonically decreasing in                 b   and   l    and increasing in ⌘.


The optimal loan K ⇤ is feasible under information-insensitive debt when p > pH ,
where the threshold pH is given by the point in which (1 pH )(1l qb(⌘)) = K ⇤ from equa-

3.2.3    Loans With or Without Information?

Figure 4 shows the ex-ante expected profits in both regimes (information-sensitive
and information-insensitive debt) for a firm with private information about its own
probability of success q, net of the expected value of land, for each possible p, assum-

     The positive root for the solution of pC = /(1 p)(1 q) is irrelevant since it is greater than
p , and then it is not binding given all firms with collateral that is good with probability p > pH can

borrow the optimal level of capital K ⇤ without triggering information acquisition.

It is interesting to highlight at this point that collateral with large b and l allows for
more borrowing, since information production is discouraged, and both the optimal-

ity and feasibility of information-insensitive debt increase.

Notice that, as the mass of active firms, ⌘, increases, there is a reduction of the prob-
ability of success, qb(⌘). This has three effects that induces less credit in the econ-
omy. First, the information-insensitive region where firms can obtain the optimal loan
size (the first range) shrinks, as pH decreases with qb(⌘). Second, the loan size in the
information-insensitive region that is binding by information acquisition (the second
range) declines. Finally, the information-sensitive region (the third range) widens, as
p⇤ decreases with qb(⌘).



3.3   Aggregation

The expected consumption of a household that lends to a firm with land that is
good with probability p, conditional on an expected probability of default qb(⌘), is
K K(p|b   q (⌘))+Eq {E(repay|p, q, ⌘)}. The expected consumption of a firm that borrows
using land that is good with probability p and has a privately known probability of
success q is E(K 0 |p, q, ⌘) E(repay|p, q, ⌘) (recall this is 0 for inactive firms). Then, the
ex-ante (before observing its position in the queue for projects) aggregate consump-
tion of firms is Eq {E(K 0 |p, q, ⌘) E(repay|p, q, ⌘)}. Expected aggregate consumption


                                                   29
is the sum of the consumption of all households and firms. Since E(K 0 |p, q, ⌘) =
qAK(p|b q (⌘)), with K(p|b
                         q (⌘)) given in (8), then Eq {E(K 0 |p, q, ⌘)} = qb(⌘)AK(p|b
                                                                                    q (⌘)),

where f (p) is the distribution of beliefs about collateral types and, as shown above,
    q (⌘)) is monotonically increasing in p and decreasing in ⌘ (as a larger ⌘ implies a
K(p|b
lower qb(⌘)).
In the unconstrained first best (the case of verifiable output, for example) all firms
are active (i.e., ⌘ = 1), and operate with K ⇤ = L⇤ , regardless of beliefs p about the
collateral. This implies the unconstrained first-best aggregate consumption is

      W ⇤ = K + K ⇤ (b
                     q (1)A           1).                                               (10)

Since collateral with relatively low p is not able to sustain loans of K ⇤ , the deviation of
consumption from the unconstrained first best critically depends on the distribution
of beliefs p in the economy. When this distribution is biased towards low perceptions
of collateral values, financial constraints hinder the productive capacity of the econ-
omy. This distribution also introduces heterogeneity in production, purely given by
heterogeneity in collateral and financial constraints, not by heterogeneity in techno-
logical possibilities.
In the model, the state variable that evolves over time is the distribution of beliefs,
f (p). In the next section we study how this distribution evolves over time, affecting
the fraction of operating firms ⌘, that at the time determines the average probability
of success in the economy qb and the evolution of beliefs. Then, we study the potential
for completely endogenous cycles in credit, productivity and production.



4    Dynamics

In this section we follow Gorton and Ordonez (2014) and assume that each unit of
land changes quality over time, mean reverting towards the average quality of land
in the economy. We study how endogenous information acquisition shapes the dis-
tribution of beliefs over time, and then the evolution of credit, productivity and pro-
duction.

                                                    30
We impose a specific process of idiosyncratic mean reverting shocks that are useful
in characterizing analytically the endogenous dynamics of information production.
First, we assume idiosyncratic shocks are observable, but their realization is not ob-
servable, unless information is produced. Second, we assume that the probability that
land faces an idiosyncratic shock is independent of its type. Finally, we assume the
probability that a unit of land becomes good, conditional on having an idiosyncratic
shock, is also independent of its type. These three assumptions are just imposed to
simplify the exposition. The main results of the paper are robust to different pro-
cesses, as long as there is mean reversion of collateral type.

We assume that initially (initial condition) there is perfect information about which
collateral is good and which is bad, a situation that we denote by ”symmetric informa-
tion”. In every period, with probability the true quality of each unit of land remains
unchanged and with probability (1         ) there is an idiosyncratic shock that changes
its type. In this last case, land becomes good with a probability pb, independent of its
current type. Even when the shock is observable, the realization of the new quality is
not, unless managerial skills are used to learn about it.26

With this simple stochastic process for idiosyncratic shocks, the belief distribution has
a three-point support: 0, pb and 1. Since firms holding land that is known to be bad
(p = 0) are inactive, the mass ⌘ of active firms is the fraction of firms with beliefs pb
and 1. Then ⌘ = f (b
                   p) + f (1).



4.1    Deterministic Technology

Here we study a deterministic economy with fixed technology (the fraction of high
quality projects, ) and characterize the stationary equilibrium. Define by ⌘ pb +
(1    ) the fraction of active firms after a single round of idiosyncratic shocks starting
from a symmetric information situation. That is, a fraction (1      ) of all collateral suf-
fers the shock and their perceived quality, absent information acquisition, is pb while
a fraction of collateral known to be good (a fraction pb of all collateral) remain with
such a perception. These are the active firms, ⌘ = .
  26
   To guarantee that all land is traded, buyers of good collateral should be willing to pay C for
good land even when facing the probability that land may become bad next period, with probability
(1  ). The sufficient condition is given by enough persistence of collateral such that K ⇤ (b
                                                                                            q (1)A 1) >
(1    )C. Furthermore they should have enough resources to buy good collateral, this is K > C.

When ⌘ = , average productivity is qb( | ) = qH + 1                    qL . From equation
(5), given pb, there is a technology level such that pb = p⇤ (b q ( | )). Similarly, when
⌘ = 1 and all firms are active, average productivity is qb(1| ) = qH + (1         ) qL . From

The next Propositions characterize the stationary equilibrium of the economy in three
regions of , low technology ( < ), intermediate technology ( 2 [ , ]) and high
technology ( > ).


Proposition 1 Low Technology: Symmetric Information - Low Steady Consumption.

If < , the steady state is characterized by information acquisition about collateral and
constant consumption in every period at,

         p) = K + pb(K ⇤
      W (b                     b (1   ))(b
                                         q (b
                                            p)A     1) < W ⇤ .                          (11)


Proof In this case, as < then pb < p⇤ (b   q ( | )). If the economy starts from a sym-
metric information state ⌘ = after the first round of idiosyncratic shocks. Then
f (1) = pb, f (b
               p) = (1     ) and f (0) = (1 pb). Since pb is in the region where
information-insensitive debt is not feasible,

      WtIS = W (b
                p) = K + [ pbK(1) + (1            )K(b
                                                     p)] (b
                                                          q (b

as K(0) = 0, K(1) = K ⇤ and K(b  p) = pb(K ⇤   b ). Then consumption is constant at

the level at which information is reacquired every period (equation (11)), which is


                                             32
less than the optimal consumption from equation (10). The economy remains in the
symmetric information regime.                                           Q.E.D.

In words, when the technology is poor and the probability of default is large there
are high incentives for information acquisition about the collateral, even when there
are few active firms. The steady state is characterized by a continuous renovation
of information in the economy. In this case, as there are no exogenous shocks, the
economy does not face any fluctuations and consumption remains below its potential.

We say that there are “information cycles” if the economy fluctuates between booms
with no information acquisition and crashes with information acquisition. The next
Proposition shows this is the case when there is an intermediate technological level,
this is 2 [ , ]


Proposition 2 Intermediate Technology: Information Cycles - Sequence of Bad Booms.

If   2 [ , ] there is a deterministic length of the boom t⇤ ( ) at the end of which credit
and consumption crashes to the symmetric information consumption, restarting the cycle.
Furthermore t⇤ ( ) is increasing in .


Proof In this case, as 2 [ , ] then pb p⇤ (b            q ( | )) and pb  p⇤ (b
                                                                              q (1| )). Starting from
an initial condition with symmetric information about collateral, in the first period
⌘1 = , and there are no incentives to acquire information about the collateral with
beliefs pb. Then there is no information acquisition in the first period. In the second
period, f (1) = 2 pb and f (b     p) = (1        2
                                                   ), implying that ⌘2 > ⌘1 , which implies that
qb(⌘2 )  qb(⌘1 ) and p⇤ (b
                          q (⌘2 )) p⇤ (b
                                       q (⌘1 )).

Repeating this reasoning over time, information-insensitive loans become infeasible
when ⌘t⇤ is such that pb = p⇤ (bq (⌘t⇤ )). We know there is such a point because in this
region pb  p (b
              ⇤
                 q (1| )). As Wt⇤ > W0II , the change in regime implies a crash. This
                                II

crash is larger, the longer and larger the preceding boom.
                                                     ⇣      ⌘
Furthermore, as pb is given, then qb(⌘t⇤ ) = ⌘t⇤ qH + 1 ⌘t⇤ qL is also given. The larger
is the higher is ⌘t⇤ and the larger t⇤ ( ), which is the length of the boom.     Q.E.D.

The intuition for information cycles is the following. In a situation of symmetric
information, in which only a fraction pb of firms get financing, the quality of projects
in the economy, in terms of their probability of success, is relatively high and there


                                                 33
are no incentives to acquire information about collateral, and a credit boom starts.
As the boom evolves over time, information decays, more firms are financed and the
average quality of projects decline.

The reduction in projects’ quality increases both the probability of default in the econ-
omy and the incentives for information acquisition. At some point, when the credit
boom is large enough, default rates are also large and may induce information acqui-
sition – a change in regime from symmetric ignorance to symmetric information. A
crash is characterized by only a fraction pb of firms (those with good land) obtaining
credit. Then a new boom restarts.

The better the technology the longer is the period that a bad boom lasts until it
crashes. Note that there are no “shocks” needed to generate information cycles, as
the steady state of the economy displays deterministic cycles. Cycles are generated
by an endogenous evolution of the distribution of collateral beliefs in credit markets
as time goes on.

Finally, the next proposition characterizes the steady state when the technology is
high, this is > .


Proposition 3 High Technology: Symmetric Ignorance - High Steady Consumption.

If   > , the steady state is characterized by no information acquisition about collateral
                                                                H

all firms obtain a loan K ⇤ in steady state and consumption is at the unconstrained

In this last region, when technology is high, there are no incentives to acquire in-
formation about collateral. As over time all collateral looks alike, the economy con-
verges to a situation in which all firms obtain a loan and produces without spending

                                            34
resources on information acquisition. If technology is high enough, output is at the
unconstrained first best. This is because financial frictions are not operational given
the low expected default probabilities. This is naturally the optimal situation as the
economy is stable and with the maximum level of consumption. This suggests that
there are also reasons from a credit market perspective for which high productivity
and success probabilities are beneficial for the economy.



4.2   Stochastic Technology

The previous section describes the steady state of the economy when technology is
fixed. In this section we discuss how the economy reacts to sudden changes in and
then how our model also captures crises that do not happen during booms and crises
that may arise because of negative contemporaneous shocks to productivity, more in
line with standard views of crises.

If the economy experiences a technological improvement, the dynamics of the econ-
omy depends both on the size of the improvement and on the initial technological
condition. If the technology is low and increases dramatically (say to high) then the
economy transitions from a symmetric information regime to a symmetric ignorance
regime – a good boom. If the technological improvement is not as dramatic (say from
low to intermediate) the economy moves from a stable environment with low con-
sumption to a cyclical environment with higher output. If the initial condition of
technology is intermediate and improves (say to high) the economy moves from a
unstable cyclical situation to a stable economy with higher output.

If technology is high enough and the economy had experienced a good boom, it does
not imply that the economy cannot suffer a negative technological shock. In this
situation the model also generates interesting insights. A reduction in can always
induce a crisis, which is more likely if the shock is larger or if the economy has been
in a longer boom. Then, a negative shock can induce a crisis even in the absence of a
preceding boom. This type of crisis is more in line with standard real business cycles.
In our setting, however, this negative contemporaneous shock induces an otherwise
stable credit situation to collapse. This effect complements the ones highlighted by
the real business cycles literature since real negative shocks in productivity feeds back
into credit markets and causes a magnification of real shocks.


                                           35
Remark on Policy Implications: There is a clear externality in our setting. When
firms decide to take an information-insensitive loan, they do not internalize the effect
in reducing the average productivity in the economy and increasing the incentives
to acquire information. In other words, firms do not internalize the effect of their
loan on the feasibility of a ”symmetric ignorance” regime. A planner can take this
effect into consideration, avoiding average productivity to decline too much. More
specifically, a planner would never allow credit booms to exceed a fraction ⌘t⇤ of
firms to operate in the economy, for example by restricting credit or leverage, or by
producing extra information, but interestingly with the main objective of avoiding
too much information from being produced privately.



4.3   Numerical Illustration

In this section we illustrate how small differences in the exogenous process of pro-
ductivity can lead to large differences in the cyclical behavior of measured credit, pro-
ductivity and output. We assume an economy that is originally in an “information-
sensitive” regime, with low stable output (low technology state). We then introduce
an exogenous permanent productivity shock that increases the average probability of
project success. We show that if this shock is not large enough (from low to intermedi-
ate technology), the economy may enter in a regime with deterministic credit booms
followed by crises – a sequence of bad booms. When the shock is larger (from low to
high technology) the economy may experience a credit boom that drives the economy
towards the first-best, where the credit boom gets exhausted without experiencing a
crisis – a good boom. We then discuss how the same result arises from an initial shock
of the same size but with a different subsequent growth rate of technology. When the
initial shock is not sustained, then the economy is more likely to enter a regime with
deterministic cycles. Both cases are consistent with our empirical findings.

More precisely, we assume idiosyncratic shocks happen with probability (1       ) = 0.1
per period, in which case the collateral becomes good with probability pb = 0.88. We
also assume L⇤ = K ⇤ = 7, K̄ = 20 (the endowment is large enough to allow for
optimal investment) and C = 15 (good collateral is good enough to sustain an optimal
loan size). The costs of information are l = 0.35 for households in terms of numeraire
and b = 0.05 for firms in terms of managerial skills. With respect to the decreasing
expected productivity of projects, we assume a fraction = 0.3 of projects have a

                                           36
probability of success qH = 0.7 and the rest can only operate with a lower probability
of success, qL = 0.4. Finally, we assume an initial productivity of A = 15, which
grows exogenously at a 0.3% rate per period.

We simulate this economy for 100 periods. During the first 20 periods this set of pa-
rameters implies that the economy is in an “information-sensitive” regime, in which
every period there is information acquisition about the 10% of collateral that suffers
the idiosyncratic shock, and so all collateral is known to be either good or bad.

We assume that in period 20 the economy experiences an exogenous shock that in-
creases the probability of success of “good quality” projects from = 0.5 to a perma-
nently higher level, 0 > . We assume this shock is large enough for the economy to
initially escape the information-sensitive regime. More formally, we assume two pos-
sible shocks. One leads to 0 = 0.586 such that qb in the symmetric information state
goes from 0.5 to 0.6 (from low to intermediate technology). This is represented by the
lower curve in Figure 5. The other, slightly larger shock, leads to 0 = 0.645 such that
qb in the symmetric information state goes from 0.5 to 0.62 (from low to high technol-
ogy). This is represented by the upper curve in Figure 5. It is clear that the shocks are
very similar in terms of their impact to the expected probability of default. Yet, they
will have very different effects in terms of the cyclical behavior of the economy.

After the shock the economy experiences a credit boom, information decays, a larger
fraction of firms obtain funds and ⌘ grows. As there are more firms obtaining funds
during a credit boom, they have to operate with projects with a lower productivity

The dynamics of the fraction of active firms, ⌘, and the implied average productivity,
qb, are depicted in Figure 5. When the shock is not sufficiently large the economy
enters into a regime with deterministic boom and bust cycles, a bad boom. These
are the dynamics in blue. In this example, cycles last 28 periods from trough to peak
and during the boom ⌘ goes from 0.88 to 0.99 ( more than 90% of the firms that did
not get credit under symmetric information can obtain loans and operate). However,
the boom contains the seeds of the next crisis. As the average probability of success
drops from 60% in the troughs to 57% in the peaks, the incentives for information
acquisition and the fear of asymmetric information make the boom unsustainable.

In contrast, when the shock is large enough, the gradual increase of p⇤ (bq ) is never
strong enough to induce information-sensitive debt, even when all collateral gets
credit. In this situation the credit boom gets exhausted as it converges to the first-
best outcome, a good boom. These are the dynamics in red.

Figure 6 shows the evolution of output (and welfare in this economy) under the pres-
ence of both types of permanent shocks in period 20. The largest positive shock in-
duces a sustainable boom in the economy – a good boom. The slightly smaller pos-
itive shock induces the economy to enter into a deterministic regime of boom-bust
cycles – a sequence of bad booms.

Figures 7-8 conveys the same information as Figures 5-6, but assuming the same size

                                                                       38
of the productivity shock in period 20, but without further growth in one case (the
blue line) and with a sustained growth of 0.1% per period (the red line). In this ex-
ample, when the probability of success keeps growing over time, the credit boom
becomes more sustainable and is less likely to end in a crisis because the exogenous
growth in compensates for the endogenous decline in qb driven by the increase in
⌘, as depicted in red. When the increase in productivity does not compensate the en-
dogenous decline, then it is more likely to enter into a sequence of boom-bust cycles,
as depicted in blue.

to a higher level of stable output, without financial crises, which we have denoted as
“good booms”. It can also experience a movement from a low stable output level to
a sequence of booms and busts that exist even without fundamental changes, which
we have denoted as “bad booms”.



5        Testable Predictions

In this section of the paper we test two of the main predictions of the model.

The driving force of the model is the assumption that during booms firms are in-
creasingly using projects with a lower probability of realizing output. So, over booms
firms should be increasingly risky and firm failures should increase. That firms are
increasingly fragile, leading up to recessions and crises, has a long history, going back
at least to Burns and Mitchell (1946) who show that the liabilities of failed nonfinan-
cial businesses is a leading indicator of recession. Also, see Zarnowitz and Lerner
(1961).27 Further, Gorton (1988) using this variable shows that during the banking
panics of the U.S. National Banking Era, every time an unexpected increase in this
indicator exceeded a threshold there was a panic; there was never a panic without
the threshold being exceeded and the threshold was never exceeded without a panic.
The first prediction of the model is that firms are increasingly more fragile over bad
booms, relative to good booms.

The second prediction concerns the pro-cyclicality of TFP. Measured TFP is a residual
which can contain many factors, as has been argued in the literature. In our model
average TFP is qbA, hence a combination of the probability of success and the output
in case of success. We have deliberately constructed the model such that only qb, not A,
affects incentives to examine collateral in credit markets. Then our model highlights
that in our measure of TFP there is a component that drives the probability of default
and then affects debt markets, while there is another component that determines the
gains in case of success (and then repayment) which affects equity markets, not debt
markets.

    The financial press during the National Banking Era regularly discussed this statistic. See Gorton

Testing the first prediction that there should be more firms defaulting over a bad
boom is hard because we do not have bankruptcy data, nor do we have business fail-
ures, for our panel of countries. We can use, however, equity data to produce a mea-
sure of firm fragility recently introduced and studied by Atkeson, Eisfeldt, and Weill
(2013). As a measure of firm fragility, they introduce Distance-to-Insolvency (DI),
based on Merton (1975) and Leland (1994). DI measures the adequacy of a firm’s
equity cushion relative to its business risk. They show that this is a good proxy for
the probability of default and that can be measured with the inverse of the volatility
of a firm’s equity returns.

We construct vol1j,t for each country j and each year t, based on daily stock price data
for all listed companies for each country in our sample. The period for which these
data are available differs somewhat across countries. Also, the number of listed firms
changes over time. See Table A.6 in the Appendix. For a given country we calculate
the monthly volatility for each listed company based on daily data. We then take the
median of the monthly volatilities for each year. This is the annual measure of firm
fragility we use for each country.

Note that a decrease in vol1j,t corresponds to an economy becoming more fragile (as
volatility is larger). Atkeson, Eisfeldt, and Weill (2013) show that in the U.S. this mea-
sure for the entire economy was uniquely low for the Great Depression, the recession
of 1938-39, and the Crisis of 2007. Table 15 below shows that our first prediction is
borne out just comparing means. Firms are significantly more fragile, on average,
over bad booms compared to good booms.

              Table 15: Firm Fragility over Good Booms and Bad Booms

                                                                     Booms

We can formalize this with the following regression
                                        ✓                   ◆

Table 16 shows that the coefficient on this variable is significantly negative, mean-
ing that the likelihood of being in a bad boom, conditional on being in a boom, is

                                               41
increasing as the fragility of the firms in the economy increases.

The second prediction of the model is related to the composition of TFP. In our model,
as time goes on, bad booms are more likely when firms become increasingly prone to
default (that is, qb decreases) but not if the productivity conditional on success declines
(that is, if A decreases). We examine versions of the following regressions, with and
without fixed effects:

                                   1
       (T F P )j,t = ↵ +                       + ✏j,t
                                volj,t   i


In Table 17 the results are shown for changes in the variables over different horizons,
i.e., i = 1 year, 2 years, out to 5 years, confirming that a significant component of
estimate TFP is firm fragility (which differs over good booms and bad booms).

These results suggest that firms’ fragility, which is the productivity component that
we highlight in this paper affects credit markets the most, is an important part of TFP.

6    Conclusions

Financial crises and credit booms are inherent parts of macroeconomic activity. Fi-
nancial crises are typically preceded by a credit boom, but not all credit booms end in
financial crises. Credit booms are not rare. The average country spends over half its
time in a boom, with an average duration of ten years. The start of a boom is usually
preceded by a burst of innovation, but this positive productivity shock dies off faster
during booms that end in crises. The seeds of a crisis may be sewn long before the
crisis, so not all crises are the result of contemporaneous negative shocks.

We provided a model that relate productivity, credit booms and financial crises to cap-
ture these facts. A technological shock can induce investments based on information-
insensitive debt that have the potential to generate deterministic business cycles.
When technology is good enough there are no incentives to examine the collateral
that backs the debt. As information about collateral decays there is a credit boom
that endogenously reduces the quality of projects that are financed and increases the
incentives to acquire such information. Once this pressure is large enough, there is
a wave of collateral examination, which destroys credit and generates a crash (reces-
sion or depression). After this event, the cycle restarts.

The business cycle we obtain is a mirror image of what we call “information cycles” –
the transit of the financial system from a ”symmetric information” regime to a ”sym-
metric ignorance” regime. The growth of symmetric ignorance endogenously gen-
erates a growth in the incentives to generate information and then a decline in the
chances that ignorance is sustainable. Effectively the boom plants the seeds for its
own destruction.

In our setting the change of technological opportunities is exogenous for simplicity.
In reality innovation is an endogenous process, usually subject to sudden discoveries.
If the diffusion of technology takes time because firms need financing, as the credit
boom develops, more firms get financing and the technology diffuses, which would
endogenously increase productivity and compensating the effect of a decreasing pro-
ductivity of marginal projects. In this case, a crisis would occur if lower and lower
quality projects diffuse. The innovation runs out of steam (so to say). This endoge-
nous process is outside the scope of the paper, but a fruitful path for future research
to understand how endogenous growth and financial crises relate.

A    Appendix

Our analysis uses data on the countries listed in Table A.1. For each country we
use time-series data from 1960 to 2010. Table A.1 shows also the number of booms,
number of bad booms, the frequency of boom periods and the average time between
booms for each country in our sample. If there was only one boom, then the average
time between booms is not available (NA). Otherwise it is computed as the average
number of years from a boom end to the subsequent boom start.
Table A.3 shows the classification of the booms identified by our algorithm.
