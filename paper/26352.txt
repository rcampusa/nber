                                           ABSTRACT

Risk preferences play a fundamental role in individuals' economic decision-making. We examine
whether the historical macroeconomic environment shapes individuals' willingness to take risks.
Using nationally representative samples from Japan and exploiting regional variation in economic
conditions, we find that men who experienced severe economic conditions in youth are more risk
averse in adulthood and the effect is long-lasting. In addition, those men are less likely to be self-
employed and they have longer tenure, which are consistent with elevated risk aversion. This
study highlights the importance of experience at a critical period of life on the formation of risk
preferences.

1. Introduction
      This study investigates whether the historical macroeconomic environment shapes
individuals' willingness to take risks. We rely on the well-grounded "impressionable years
hypothesis" from socio-psychological literature, which suggests that individuals are highly
susceptible to attitude change during late adolescence and early adulthood (Krosnick and Awin
1989). Based on this literature, we examine whether individuals differ in their willingness to take
risks depending on the economic shocks they experienced at a critical period of life. Our main
risk-aversion measure is based on hypothetical job choice questions: whether to take a safe job
with guaranteed income or a risky job with a high chance of pay increases but a small chance of
downward pay risk. In addition, we examine real-world labor market outcomes associated with
risk aversion, such as self-employment.
      Risk preferences play a fundamental role in individuals' economic decision-making, such
as saving, investment, consumption, and migration decisions. In standard economic models, it is
assumed that individuals are endowed with stable risk preferences that do not change over time
(Stigler and Becker 1977). A few recent studies have suggested that individuals who have
experienced a financial crisis become risk averse (e.g., Necker and Ziegelmeyer 2016; Guiso et
al. 2018). 1 However, most of these studies investigate contemporaneous and short-term effects,
but are silent on how long-lasting the effect is.
      Our identification relies on regional variation in individual experience of economic shocks
during impressionable years. Using information on each respondent's location during
adolescence, we assign period- and location-specific economic shocks to the respondents. This
identification strategy overcomes the challenge in that each cohort shares many experiences
other than economic shocks, such as technological change. We include non-parametric age and
year dummies, and a host of current as well as retrospective individual characteristics.
      Our findings are summarized as follows. Using nationally representative samples from
Japan, we find that men who are exposed to severe economic conditions during late adolescence

 In laboratory experiments, Cohn et al. (2015) document that adverse financial shocks make financial
professionals more risk averse.
                                                     2
show elevated risk aversion in adulthood. In particular, experiencing local economic shocks at
least once during the ages of 18­21 years leads to a roughly 0.20 standard deviation (SD)
increase in risk aversion in adulthood. The effect is persistent: we observe elevated risk aversion
when men are well into their 30s and 40s. Since we find the same effect not only for college
graduates but also for high school graduates, it is probably not only job-searching experience at
the time of college graduation but the economic situation in general that drives our results.
Importantly, the exposure to harsh economic conditions at any other age range has no impact on
risk aversion, supporting the impressionable years hypothesis that susceptibility to attitude
change is greatest during adolescence and early adulthood, and substantially decreases thereafter.
      Our results are robust to several potential concerns. First, we verify that the results are not
driven by particular cohorts. The findings are robust to the inclusion of cohort dummies in
addition to age and year fixed dummies. Second, our results are robust to the inclusion of a
number of life-cycle related variables. Finally, our results are robust to different ways of eliciting
and constructing risk-aversion measures.
      We also show that men who are exposed to severe economic conditions in late adolescence
are less likely to be self-employed in adulthood, which is consistent with elevated risk aversion.
The magnitude is substantial. Experiencing economic shocks during formative ages leads to as
much as a 30% reduction in self-employment once men have reached adulthood. This result
suggests that a large negative economic shock can fundamentally alter an individual's risk
preferences and thus, may have a long-lasting impact on an individual's decision-making in the
real world.
      This study is most related to Malmendier and Nagel (2011), which shows that early-life
financial hardship is associated with conservative investment behavior in later life, whereas
recent life events have the largest impact. The important difference is that while the results in
Malmendier and Nagel (2011) are largely driven by beliefs rather than risk preferences, this
study directly examines the risk preferences per se measured through hypothetical choice
questions. This difference may explain why this study posits that experience at a critical period
of life has a substantial impact on risk preferences while Malmendier and Nagel (2011) show
                                                  3
that experience throughout history affects financial risk-taking behavior. Indeed, our results are
consistent with Giuliano and Spilimberg (2014) which shows that the macroeconomic shocks
during impressionable years affect preferences for redistribution in adulthood.
      This study is related to a growing number of works suggesting that individuals' risk
preferences can be altered by negative shocks, such as financial crises, conflict or violence, and
natural disasters (for a recent review, see Chuang and Schechter, 2015). While the literature on
the impact of non-financial negative shocks tends to produce mixed results regarding the
direction of change in risk preferences (Schildberg-Hörisch 2018), studies on the impact of
financial crisis are relatively more consistent: individuals who experience financial crisis become
more risk averse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows that experience
at formative ages is of particular concern and that such experience has a long-lasting impact on
the formation of risk preferences in adulthood.
      More generally, recent economics literature suggests that the economic and cultural
environment in which people grow up shapes their beliefs and attitudes, such as their trust in
financial institutions (Guiso et al. 2004; Osili and Paulson 2008), stock market participation
(Guiso et al. 2008), social policies (Alesina and Fuchs-Schundeln 2007), belief in the free market
(Di Tella et al. 2007), belief about future returns from the stock (Malmendier and Nagel 2011),
and preferences for redistribution (Luttmer and Singhal 2011; Giuliano and Spilimberg 2014).
This study adds to the literature by showing that risk preference is also affected by the
macroeconomic environment in which people grow up.
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, and Section 3
presents our econometric model. Section 4 reports our main findings on risk preferences, and
Section 5 examines labor market outcomes. Section 6 concludes.


2. Data
      The key variables for our analysis are historical economic shocks as explanatory variables
and measures of risk preferences as dependent variables. We elaborate on each variable in detail
in the following subsections.
                                                  4
    2.1. Economic shocks
      In order to obtain the longest possible time series, we construct a measure of regional
recessions using data on employment-to-job opening ratio at the prefecture level from the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. 2 The MHLW has provided monthly
estimates of the employment-to-job opening ratio since 1963. To avoid the influence of World
War II (WWII), we focus on cohorts born after 1945, the final year of WWII.
      Our dependent variable for economic shock is a dummy that takes one if the individual
experienced an economic shock for at least 1 year during his or her impressionable years. We
define impressionable years from the ages of 18 to 21 years. According to the impressionable
years hypothesis, individuals are highly susceptible to attitude change during late adolescence
and early adulthood, which is roughly the ages of 18­25 years (Krosnick and Awin 1989). 3
Giuliano and Spilimberg (2014) analyze the impact of macroeconomic shocks during the ages of
18­25 years on preferences for redistribution in adulthood. However, as shown in Figure A1, in
Japan, the fraction of individuals who live in the same prefecture at the age of 15 years sharply
drops by 25% at the age of 22 years, as many people graduate from college and start working in
different locations. Therefore, we define impressionable years in this study as the ages of 18­21
years. We also show the results for a subset of individuals who stay in the same prefecture, and
we show that other age ranges do not seem to influence the formation of risk preferences in
adulthood.
      Following Giuliano and Spilimberg (2014), we define an economic shock as a change in
the employment-to-job opening ratio below the lowest 10th percentile of the change in the
employment-to-job opening ratio for Japan's 47 prefectures from 1963 to 2010. We later change
the threshold to the 5th percentile as a robustness check, and the results are robust with different
thresholds.

2
  Giuliano and Spilimberg (2014) instead use change in the GDP growth rate. We do not use the GNP growth
rate, as it captures only recessions related to the burst bubble in the early 1990s. The unemployment rate was
not available at the regional level until recently. Furthermore, it is designed to capture the unemployment rate
at the broader regional level (not prefecture level).
3 See, for example, Spear (2000) for perspectives from literature on neurological development.

      Figure 1 displays the number of prefectures that experienced economic shocks from 1963
to 2010. There are three peaks: around the time of the oil crisis in 1973; in the early 1990s when
the asset bubble burst; and around the time of the Great Recession in 2009. Appendix Figure A2
shows how often each prefecture experienced economic shocks. There is substantial regional
variation in the labor market experiences of individuals living in different prefectures. For
example, even though Akita (#5) and Yamagata (#6) are adjacent prefectures in the Tohoku
region, Akita experienced no economic shocks during our sample period, while Yamagata
experienced at least four.


    2.2. Measures of risk preferences
      Our primary dataset is the Japan Household Panel Survey on Consumer Attitudes and
Satisfaction (JHPS-CPS), which is a nationally representative annual survey of Japan's resident
population. 4 The data are collected using self-administered paper questionnaires, which are
hand-delivered to and picked up from the houses of participating households. 5
      Our measure of risk preferences is elicited from hypothetical questions. In particular, we
have measures of risk preferences in two domains. The first is in the labor domain in which
individuals decide whether to accept a job offer (hereafter, referred to as "labor"), and the second
measure is in the finance domain in which individuals make a payment choice regarding the
lottery (hereafter, referred to as "finance"). In each domain, we pick questions that are asked for
at least 2 years from 2005­2011 in order to increase the statistical power. 6,7


4 Municipalities are classified into 40 stratums (10 geographical areas and 4 categories by population size). The
unit of sampling spot in each stratum is the census unit and is selected by random systematic sampling.
5 A JPY1,500 (US$15) cash voucher is provided to all respondents for completing the survey.
6 The JHPS-CPS was conducted in 2003­2016 (except for interruptions in 2014 and 2015). The first 2 years

(2003­2004) were pilots and many different questions were asked compared to later years. We also do not use
2012 onwards, as Hanaoka et al. (2018) show that the Great Japan East Earthquake in 2011 altered people's
risk attitudes.
7 While the same individuals answer the same questions across years, the correlation of responses between

different years is quite low. For example, for the Labor1 question, the correlation in responses in the first and
second years is only 0.33. This number is close to the case of the Health and Retirement Study, which reports
correlation of 0.27 (Kimball et al. 2008).
                                                       6
      Our main risk-aversion measures are those in the labor domain. We also examine the risk-
aversion measures in the finance domain to assess whether individuals who are risk averse in the
labor domain are also risk averse in another domain. If so, the economic shocks in the
impressionable years may have far-reaching consequences on the risk preferences of those who
are affected.
      In the labor domain, respondents choose between a safe job and a risky job in hypothetical
scenarios. The Health and Retirement Study asks a variant of this question to measure risk
preferences (e.g., Barsky et al. 1997; Kimball et al. 2008; Sahm 2012). We illustrate one
example from three labor-domain risk measures here.
      With equal chances, a risky job doubles monthly income or cuts it by a specific fraction
(downside risk). Varying the downside risk of monthly income in subsequent questions refines
the measure of risk preferences.
      Specifically, in 2005­2011, the JHPS-CPS poses the following scenario.
Which of the following two jobs do you prefer? Assume that the job contents are the same. The
first is a job that gives you a 50­50 chance of doubling your monthly income and a 50­50
chance of cutting your monthly income by 30%. The second is a job that will increase your
monthly income by 5%.
      On one hand, individuals who accept the risky job then consider a choice between two
jobs, one with even higher downside risk, as follows.
The first is a job that gives you a 50­50 chance of doubling your monthly income and a 50­50
chance of cutting your monthly income by 50%. The second is a job that will increase your
monthly income by 5%.
      On the other hand, those who initially decline the risky job then consider a choice between
two jobs, one with even lower downside risk.
The first is a job that gives you a 50­50 chance of doubling your monthly income and a 50­50
chance of cutting your monthly income by 10%. The second is a job that will increase your
monthly income by 5%.
      The other two questions in the labor domain vary either the amount of increases in monthly
                                                7
income for the risky job or the probability of downside risks for the risky job. Appendix B shows
the exact formats of the other two questions in the labor domain. The three questions in the labor
domain are labeled Labor1, Labor2, and Labor3.
        The upper half of Appendix Figure A3 displays the distribution of choices. The higher the
number, the more risk averse the choice is. For all the questions, the fraction of respondents who
choose the most risk-averse choice (#4)-- individuals who decline both risky jobs, and always
choose the safe job with guaranteed income amount--is the highest. Therefore, our risk-averse
measure is a dummy variable that takes one for the most risk-averse choice. As a robustness
check, we convert the hypothetical choices into the risk-aversion parameter () by assuming a
constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) function following Kimball et al. (2008). 8 The results are
robust even if we convert our ordinal measure of risk preferences into a cardinal measure, like .
In addition, the results are robust to ordered logit, in which the ordered choices are used as
outcomes (both results are shown later).
        In the finance domain, the JHPS-CPS asks respondents about their willingness to pay for a
hypothetical lottery. This approach to elicit risk preferences is also adopted in the past literature
(e.g., Cramer et al. 2002; Hartog et al. 2002; Guiso and Paiella 2008).
        We illustrate one of the three risk-aversion measures in the finance domain here
(Finance1). There is a 1% chance that the lottery wins JPY100,000 (US$1,000) and nothing
otherwise. Respondents are asked whether they would buy this lottery at a price of JPY200
($US2). Varying the purchase price of the lottery refines the measure of risk preferences.
        Specifically, in 2005­2008, the JHPS-CPS poses the following scenario.
There is a lottery with a 1% chance of winning JPY100,000 and nothing otherwise. Would you
buy this lottery at a price of JPY200?
        Individuals stating that they would buy the lottery at this price then consider higher prices
while those initially stating that they would not buy it then consider lower prices. The lower the


                                                              1-1/
8
    Specifically, we assume a CRRA utility function, ( ) =   (1-1/)
                                                                      , where the coefficient of relative risk
tolerance = -U/wU may differ across individuals. We examine relative risk aversion , which is 1/.
                                                     8
price individuals accept, the more risk averse they are.
      The second question in the finance domain (Finance2) varies the amount of winning the
lottery (JPY2,000) and the probability of winning (50%). The third question in the finance
domain (Finance3) instead asks respondents whether they would sell the lottery at this price,
assuming that the individual already possessed the lottery. Appendix B shows the exact formats
of the other two questions in the finance domain.
      The lower half of Appendix Figure A3 shows the distribution of choices. The higher the
number, the more risk averse the choice is; that is, individuals are willing to pay less (or sell at
the low price). To be consistent with the risk-aversion measures in the labor domain, the risk-
preference measure in the finance domain is also a dummy that takes one for the most risk-averse
choice. As robustness checks, we examine ordered logit, and convert the choices into risk-
aversion parameters. 9
      To make each risk measure comparable, we standardize each measure by subtracting the
mean and dividing by the SD so that each has a mean of zero and an SD of one. We later show
that raw data without standardization deliver qualitatively the same results.
      Appendix Table A1 provides summary statistics. Our cohorts are born between 1946 and
1989. The average age is 47 years. Slightly more than half (53%) is low educated (less than a
college degree), while 93% is employed, and 13% is self-employed.


    2.3. Validity of risk-aversion measures
      One concern of self-reported risk-aversion measures based on a non-incentivized and
hypothetical question is whether they indeed reflect an individual's underlying risk traits. Many
studies show that risk measures obtained through hypothetical survey questions are reliable
predictors of actual risk-taking behavior (e.g., Barsky et al. 1997; Donkers et al. 2001; Anderson


9
  We define the reservation price as the midpoint of the two prices at which respondents switch choices.
Following Cramer et al. (2002), we simply transform the reservation price () to a measure of risk aversion: =
1 - /E(X) where E(X) is the expected value of the lottery X (e.g., E(X) equals JPY1,000 for Labor1). Note that
the higher the number is, the more risk averse the respondent is.
                                                      9
and Mellor 2008; Guiso and Paiella 2008; Dohmen et al. 2011).
         To verify the validity of our risk measures, we run various tests. First, Appendix Table A1
shows that six different measures are positively correlated. In particular, they are strongly
positively correlated within the same domain (0.67­0.75 in the labor domain, and 0.28­0.70 in
the finance domain). Second, our risk measures tend to be correlated in expected ways with
classical covariates of risk preferences. For example, men are less risk averse than women, as
documented in Croson and Gneezy (2009) (not shown). Third, we document that our measures
have predictive power for individuals' risk-taking behavior. Appendix Table A2 shows that our
indicators for risk aversion are strongly negatively correlated with gambling (a dummy variable
equal to one if an individual gambles more than twice a week), possession of a financial asset (a
dummy variable equal to one if an individual owns stocks and corporate bonds in her/his
portfolio), and rare wear of seatbelts (a dummy variable equal to one if an individual does not
wear or rarely wears a seatbelt).


3. Econometric model
        We focus on men, as the employment rate for women in our sample is as low as 67% while
that for men is 93%. As we attribute the labor market experience in late adolescence to risk
preferences in adulthood, the inclusion of women with a low employment rate would introduce
substantial measurement errors. 10
        Our baseline specification is very similar to that of Giuliano and Spilimberg (2014):

           = 0 + 1  15,. + 2  +  +  +  + 15 + 15 
                                               +  ,           [1]

where  is the risk-aversion parameter for individual  in prefecture  surveyed at time .
 15,. is a dummy that equals one if an individual experiences an
economic shock during the impressionable years in his/her prefecture of residence at the age of
15 years asked in the JHPS-CPS, which we use as a reference prefecture for the whole of the

10
     The results for women are available in Appendix Table A14.
                                                      10
ages of 18­21 years.  is a vector of individual characteristics, namely, marital status,
employment status, and non-parametric dummies for age, education, and household income. We
also include information on the family background of the individual at the age of 15 years in
some specifications.

     The specifications include fixed effects for age, year, prefecture of residence at the age of
15 years, and prefecture of current residence. Age fixed effects ( ), and year fixed effects ( )
control the age-specific trend of risk preferences, and common shocks at the national level,
respectively. Prefecture of residence at the age of 15 years (15 ), and prefecture of current
residence ( ) control for the prefecture-specific risk aversion that could affect difference in risk
preferences (e.g., culture) both at the origin and later, respectively. We also include interaction of
prefecture at the age of 15 years fixed effects with linear in age (15  ) to help rule out the
possibility that our results are driven by prefecture-specific cohort effects. For example,
experience of earthquakes can differentially affect the risk preferences of different cohorts
(Hanaoka et al. 2018).
     We estimate equation [1] and its variant by ordinary least squares for ease of interpretation,
but qualitatively similar results are obtained with ordered logit, as shown later. Standard errors
are clustered at the prefecture of residence at the age of 15 years.
     The main concern for our identification strategy is omitted variable bias. We consider four
different types of potential bias, and we account for each as follows. First, our main explanatory
variable,  15,. , consists of two variations: variation across regions and
variation between cohorts. To control for cohort-specific effects, in the first robustness check, we
include each cohort dummy. For example, different education policies may have different
impacts on the formation of risk preferences for different cohorts. Second, our results could be
driven by prefecture-specific trends. In the second robustness check, we include a full set of
interactions between prefecture of survey and survey year to consider all possible prefecture-of-
residence and time-varying covariates.



                                                 11
     Third, our source of identification is that each prefecture experiences different economic
shocks over time. Since an economic shock is the only regressor that is time-varying at the
prefecture level during impressionable years, the concern is that it captures any other time-
varying prefecture factors. Inclusion of prefecture at the age of 15 years interacted with age
linear trend in all specifications partially mitigates this concern. Furthermore, in one of the
robustness checks, we include gross national product (GNP) per capita, which is prefecture-
specific time-varying controls. In this specification, our results capture the effect of the economic
shocks net of the overall macroeconomic level in the region. Fourth, while we exclude cohorts
born before the end of WWII, we nonetheless include war-related variables interacted with each
cohort to account for any influences of the war on the formation of risk preferences.


4. Results
      In Table 1, we report the results for risk preference in the labor domain (columns 1­3) and
those in the finance domain (columns 4­6). We also report the estimated average effect size
(AES) coefficients (columns 7­9). Following Kling and Liebman (2004), AES is computed as
follows. Let  and  indicate the estimated coefficient and its SD for the outcome variable .
                            1      
Then, the AES is equal to     
                           =1  , where  is the total number of outcome variables. Since
                                    

we already standardize each outcome, AES, in this case, is equivalent to the simple average of
each estimated coefficient.
      AES estimates have two advantages of reducing both Type I and Type II errors. On the one
hand, summary as an index reduces the possibility that the estimated coefficients are statistically
significant due to chance (Type I error), which is more likely to occur with a single outcome
measure. On the other hand, it reduces the error of weak statistical power (Type II error). We
report three set of AES estimates: one for risk preferences in the labor domain (the three
measures for risk preference in the labor domain combined); one for risk preferences in the
finance domain (the three measures for risk preference in the finance domain combined); and one
for all six variables together.

                                                  12
   4.1. Main results
      Table 1 reports the estimates from the baseline specification [1]. Columns (1)­(3) report
the estimates on risk preferences in the labor domain, which are our main outcomes of interest.
We code outcome in such a way that positive coefficients indicate elevated risk aversion. All
columns (1)­(3) show that individuals who experience an economic shock during impressionable
years are less likely to take the risk of changing jobs with potential high pay but some downward
risk. The estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level for Labor1, and Labor3, and at the
5% level for Labor2. In terms of magnitude, AES in column (7) indicates that experiencing an
economic shock during adolescence reduces the chance of taking new job opportunities by 0.18
SD (p<0.01). This result indicates that experiencing an economic shock during formative years
has a persistent negative effect on risk preferences in the labor domain in adulthood.
      Columns (4)­(6) of Table 1 show that those who experience an economic shock in
impressionable years are less likely to take risks in the financial domain too. While the results
are slightly weaker than those for the labor domain--which is plausible, as our economic shocks
are based on labor shocks--two out of three measures are statistically significant at the 5% level.
Column (8) shows that the magnitude of AES for the finance domain is two-thirds that for the
labor domain (p<0.05). These results suggest that even though economic shock is defined by
labor market outcomes, respondents exposed to negative economic shocks exhibit risk aversion
not only in the labor domain but also in another domain. Column (9), which takes the six
variables together, shows roughly a 0.15 SD increase in risk preferences (p<0.05).



   4.2. Robustness checks
      We subject the results in Subsection 4.1 to a series of other robustness checks. Table 2
summarizes these results. To save space, we present only the results for AES for all six variables
hereafter. The full results for each column of Table 2 are presented in Appendix Tables A3­A9.
For ease of comparison, column (1) replicates the baseline results from column (9) of Table 2.
                                                 13
         Column (2) of Table 2 adds cohort dummies to baseline specifications. The estimate is
slightly larger than the baseline estimate (0.172 vs. 0.151). Column (3) further adds all
interactions between the prefecture of survey and year effects as well as the two series of non-
parametric dummies for father's and mother's education at the age of 15 years. Column (3) is the
most stringent specification. The results are almost identical to those of column (2). Column (4)
restricts the sample to non-movers, whose current prefecture is identical to the prefecture at the
age of 15 years. While the sample size shrinks, the estimates remain statistically significant at the
5% level.
         The major concern in our identification strategy is that economic shock is the only time-
varying variable. Thus, we are afraid that it may capture something other than economic shock
specific to the prefecture at that time, which is correlated with risk aversion. To mitigate the
concern, we control the prefecture-level time-varying GNP per capita during impressionable
years in column (5). This specification identifies the effect of experiencing a severe economic
condition net of the level of the macroeconomic environment. We find that estimated coefficients
are rarely affected, suggesting that experiences of economic shocks (i.e., change) instead of the
overall macroeconomic level drive our results.
         While we focus only on cohorts born after WWII to mitigate the impact of war on risk
aversion, we include two war-related variables. Specifically, we interact the cohort fixed effects
with the number of deaths and missing people per capita, and the number of buildings collapsed
per capita due to WWII. 11 Column (6) shows that our results are robust to the inclusion of war-
related variables.
         We define economic shock as a change in employment-to-job opening ratio below the
lowest 10th percentile of the change in employment-to-job opening ratio for Japan's 47
prefectures from 1963 to 2010. Column (7) changes the threshold to the 5th percentile, but the
results are robust with different thresholds.
         Appendix Tables A10­A12 present other robustness checks, and our results are quite

                                                       14
robust to different ways of defining outcomes or different estimation techniques. Appendix Table
A10 shows the results before outcomes are standardized. Appendix Table A11 shows the results
when risk choices are converted to cardinal measures. Finally, Appendix Table A12 shows the
results of the ordered logit specifications.
      Thus far, we follow the socio-psychology (and also neuroscience) literature and focus on
the effect of impressionable years on the formation of risk preferences (e.g., Krosnick and Awin
1989). Here, we examine whether other age ranges have any impact on risk preferences in
adulthood. Table 3 shows the results for other age ranges. We repeat our baseline specification
(equation [1]) based on different 4-year range intervals (2­5, 6­9, ... and 50­53). 12 It is
reassuring that none of the other age ranges has any meaningful impact on the formation of risk
preferences. 13 In addition, the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients are economically small
compared to our main findings in Table 1.



     4.3. Heterogeneity
      We also examine heterogeneity by individual characteristics. The results are presented in
Table 4. Columns (1) and (2) examine heterogeneity by educational level. We find that while the
estimates for high-educated respondents are slightly larger than those for low-educated
respondents, the difference is not statistically significant. In Japan, the ages of 18­21 years
correspond to years spent in college. Thus, those who are low-educated (less than college) are
already working, while those who are high-educated (more than college) are not likely to be
working yet. It is reassuring that we find the same effect for both education segments, suggesting
that it is probably not only job-searching experience at the time of college graduation but the
economic situation in general that drives our results. 14 We also examine heterogeneity by



12
   Since the JHPS-CPS asks for prefecture residence at the age of 15 years only, the measurement error
becomes larger as the other age ranges deviate from 15 years.
13 See Appendix Table A13 for full estimates for each risk-aversion outcome.
14 Our results are robust to excluding the age of 21 years, which is the typical age 1 year before college

graduation, from the impressionable years (results are available upon request).
                                                        15
maternal education. Columns (3) and (4) show that individuals whose mothers are low educated
(less than high school) have double the impact than those whose mothers are highly educated. 15
Columns (5) and (6) show that low-income respondents are more affected by economic shock
than high-income respondents.
         Finally, we examine the effect by age in columns (7)­(10) of Table 4. We find significant
effects in the age range of the 30s and 40s, suggesting that the experience of formative years on
risk preferences is persistent. These age ranges roughly correspond to cohorts who experienced
the oil crisis of 1973, and the burst asset bubble of the early 1990s.


5. Labor market outcomes
         One potential explanation for our finding is that individuals who experience tough
economic situations themselves suffer in the job market and currently have low-paying jobs or
are unemployed. It is known that graduating during a recession leads to large initial earnings
losses in Japan (Genda et al. 2010). 16 We account for such endowment effects by controlling for
employment status, full sets of education, and income dummies in equation [1]. Furthermore, our
results are not only driven by college graduates seeking work at the age of 21 years the year
before graduating from college.
         Nonetheless, we directly consider the labor market outcomes in this section. In this
specification, to avoid endogeneity, we modify equation [1] by including only marital status, and
full sets of education dummies as demographic controls (i.e., no income or employment status
included). The results are presented in Table 5.
         Column (1) in Table 5 shows that the probability of employment is not different. Columns
(2) and (3) show no difference in hours worked and slightly higher income rather than lower
income. Columns (4) and (5) show that firm size and industry are also not statistically different.
         Interestingly, men who experienced severe economic shocks at the ages of 18­21 years are
less likely to be self-employed (p-value<0.01). Since more risk-averse individuals are less likely

15
     We obtain very similar results using the father's education.

to be self-employed (Dohmen et al. 2011), our results are consistent with elevated risk aversion.
The magnitude is substantial. Since the mean of the outcome is 12.6%, the magnitude of the
coefficients (0.037) indicates a 30% decline in self-employment among those men.
      In addition, the tenure of the men is slightly longer, suggesting that men do not change
jobs. In particular, once we exclude the self-employed, those who grow up in recessions in
impressionable years have roughly 1-year longer tenure, which corresponds to a 6.2% increase
from the mean.
      Taken together, these results indicate that exposure to a tough economic condition during
formative years has far-reaching consequences for labor market outcomes. Not only are those
men risk averse in hypothetical job scenarios, but indeed they are less likely to be self-employed
and have longer tenure, suggesting that they do not want to take risks in the real labor market.



6. Conclusion
      This study demonstrates that the historical macroeconomic environment shapes
individuals' willingness to take risks. We show that men who experience severe economic
conditions in late adolescence show higher aversion to taking risks in adulthood. The effect is
long-lasting. In addition, we show that those men are less likely to be self-employed and they
have longer tenure, which are consistent with elevated aversion toward taking risks. This study
highlights the importance of experience in critical years of life on the formation of risk
preferences. While our results are not driven by differences in endowment or other time-varying
regional characteristics, investigating the underlying mechanism (e.g., fear in switching jobs) is
left as an avenue for future research.

Notes: AES for all six risk aversion measures are reported. Column (1) replicates the baseline results from column (9) of Table 1. Column (2) add cohort dummies. Column (3)
further add year-by-prefecture at survey FE, and education of fathers and mothers at age 15. Column (4) restricts the sample to non-movers whose current prefecture is identical
to the prefecture at age 15. Column (5) controls the prefecture-level time-varying GNP per capita during impressionable years. Column (6) includes an interaction of the cohort
fixed effects with the number of deaths and missing per capita, and number of building collapsed per capita due to WWII. Column (7) uses the threshold of defining the
Economic shock to the 5th percentile instead of 10th percentile. The full results for each column of this table are presented in Appendix Tables A3­A9. Significance levels: ***

Notes: A gambling dummy takes one if the person is engaged in gambling twice a week. A possessing a financial asset dummy takes one if an individual owns stocks and
corporate bonds in her/his portfolio. A rarely wearing seatbelts dummy takes one if an individual doesn't wear or rarely wear a seatbelt. There is no overlap in years between
seatbelt dummy and four risk aversion measures.
