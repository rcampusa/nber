Job Satisfaction Over the Life Course
David G. Blanchflower and Alex Bryson
NBER Working Paper No. 28206
December 2020
JEL No. J28,J50,J51

                                           ABSTRACT

We examine the relationship between union membership and job satisfaction over the life-course
using data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) tracking all those born in Great
Britain in a single week in March in 1958 through to age 55 (2013). Data from immigrants as
well as non-respondents to the original 1958 Perinatal Mortality Study (PMS) are added in later
years. Conditioning on one's social class at birth, together with one's education and employment
status, we find there is a significant negative correlation between union membership and job
satisfaction that is apparent across the life-course. Lagged union membership status going back
many years is negatively correlated with current job satisfaction, though its effects become
statistically non-significant when conditioning on current union membership status. These results
provide a different perspective to longitudinal studies showing short-term positive responses to
switches in membership status. They are consistent with earlier work showing that this cohort of
workers, and others before them, have persistently lower job satisfaction as union members
compared to their non-union counterparts.

1. Introduction
For many decades the negative partial correlation between union membership and job
satisfaction was taken as a given. Together with a positive union wage gap (Lewis, 1963;
Freeman and Medoff, 1984 ­ F&M henceforward) and lower quit rates among union
members (F&M, 1984) it was regarded as one of the empirical regularities in labour
economics. It attracted much attention subsequently because the finding appeared at odds
with the objectives of trade unionism, which are to improve the terms and conditions of
their members relative to what they might have been offered in the absence of a trades
union.

Some studies indicated the partial correlation was biased by unobserved traits of workers
or their jobs that simultaneously affected membership status and job satisfaction. Most
notable were the studies indicating workers with a tendency towards job dissatisfaction
sorted into union membership, perhaps because they had character traits which meant they
were permanently less satisfied than non-members, and those studies suggesting union
dissatisfaction arose because the unionized were in poorer jobs, or experienced worse
working conditions, than their non-member counterparts, and thus sought union
representation to address their problems.

Both arguments garnered support from empirical studies. Some identified poorer working
conditions ­ such as a poor climate of industrial relations (Bender and Sloane, 1998) - as a
trigger to membership. Others found the negative partial correlation between membership
and job satisfaction became statistically non-significant, or even positive, when using
person fixed effects models which focused purely on the within-person variance in job
satisfaction associated with switches in union membership status. These studies provided
some support for the proposition that the negative partial correlation may have been driven
by innate, otherwise unobserved, dissatisfaction of workers who joined unions. However,
further investigation using event-study analyses revealed that, whilst those about to enter
membership did experience substantial job dissatisfaction, this switched around on joining
the union, such that they became more satisfied than they had previously been ­ albeit for
a limited period (Powdthavee, 2011).

This literature turned another corner recently when Blanchflower and Bryson (2020) found
the negative partial correlation between union membership and job satisfaction observed
in the early studies of F&M and Borjas was no longer apparent in recent surveys. Indeed,
the partial correlation had become positive and statistically significant. The authors
speculate about potential reasons for this turnaround but one, which is apparent in the data,
is that more recent entrants to union membership felt more positively about their jobs than
workers born some years ago who had entered union membership decades before. The
authors had no ready explanation for this switch in cohort effects underling the new-found
positive correlation between union membership and job satisfaction, but they did speculate
that, if the cohort trends were to continue, the correlation between membership and job
satisfaction may become more positive over time.

In this paper we revisit this issue by focusing on the relationship between union
membership and job satisfaction among a cohort of workers born in Britain in the same



                                             1
week in 1958. We track these individuals through to age 55 to examine the association
between union membership and job satisfaction over the life-course. In doing so we focus
on the birth cohort which would have been entering the labour market around the time
F&M (1984) and Borjas (1979) were conducting their studies. These are workers who, at
least in the early years of their lives, we might expect to exhibit a negative correlation
between their union membership and job satisfaction. Subsequent analyses by
Blanchflower and Bryson (2020) for the United States using cross-sectional data suggest
the link between union membership and job satisfaction remained negative for this cohort
of workers. Artz et al (2020) explore this issue using panel data for the United States and
the UK. We wish to establish whether this is indeed the case for workers from this British
birth cohort.

The rationale for our study has a second motivation: whilst others have used longitudinal
data on individuals over time to examine links between union membership and job
satisfaction, the focus has been either on comparing OLS estimates with worker fixed
effects models ­ to isolate the effects of changes in membership on job satisfaction within
individuals over time ­ or else to undertake event studies which estimate changes in job
satisfaction shortly before and shortly after a switch in union membership status. What is
lacking from the literature is an appraisal of the links between union membership and job
satisfaction over the whole life-course. This is something we offer for the first time in this
paper.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section Two discusses the previous literature
using panel data to investigate the links between unionization and job satisfaction, and
comments on the value of a life-course investigation of the issue. Section Three presents
the National Child Development Study (NCDS) data and the methodology used to capture
union effects on job satisfaction. Section Four presents results before we conclude and
comment on implications in Section Five.

2. Literature
The earliest studies on the relationship between unionization and job satisfaction used
annual panel data on individuals from household surveys to unpick the relationship
between changes in union status and changes in job satisfaction. There are a couple of
strands to this research. One strand considered the potential for omitted work-related
variables to explain the job dissatisfaction of unionized workers. A second considers the
types of individuals who become unionized and whether they differ in unobserved ways
from those who are not unionized. We take each strand in turn.

Recognizing that unions are more likely to be able to organize poorer jobs in poorer
working environments, and that unions seek to improve the wages and working conditions
of unionized workers, analysts have investigated whether unions do indeed organize
workers in poorer jobs and, having done so, whether they improve their working
conditions. The first to do this were Duncan and Stafford (1980). Using the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics (PSID) they examined changes in wages and working conditions for
those joining unions, those leaving unions, those remaining unionized and those who
remained non-unionized. They found those joining a union experienced a substantial wage



                                              2
hike compared to other workers, but a deterioration in their working conditions, results
which they thought were consistent with unions procuring a compensating wage
differential for union workers' exposure to poorer conditions. Although they don't
consider employee perceptions of their jobs, the implication is that, if unionized workers
are fully compensated for their poorer jobs through higher wages, their utility from the job
will be similar to that obtained from a `better' but less well-paid job. Consequently, their
job satisfaction ­ if treated as an indicator of the utility workers derive from their jobs -
would be unlikely to differ from those of similar non-unionized workers.

Their findings were immediately challenged by Leigh (1981). Using panel data from the
National Longitudinal Study (NLS) he investigated changes in employee perceptions of
their jobs, including "progress at work" which, he argued (p. 1051), was akin to a job
satisfaction metric, as well as pace of work, fatigue and job pressures. In contrast to
Duncan and Stafford (1980) he found little evidence that these changed with union status,
concluding that Duncan and Stafford's findings regarding unions procuring compensating
wage differentials did not generalize to the young men in the NLS. Leigh went further,
suggesting that perceived working conditions in the union sector were "at least equal to"
(p. 1054) those in the non-union sector "as would be expected if, despite their higher wages,
organized workers have a direct impact through their unions in altering disagreeable
working conditions".

Leigh underscores this point by noting a reduction in perceived job pressures among union
stayers, compared to non-union stayers, while holding wages constant, consistent with
union workers "[making] progress in their work" (p. 1054). His conclusion is that
"channels of collective voice encourage the expression of dissatisfaction while
simultaneously restraining dissatisfied workers from leaving their employers", giving
credence to the causal impact of unions in being able to extend worker tenure through the
expression of, and actions to address, worker dissatisfaction.

A slightly earlier paper by Borjas (1979) is also directly pertinent to this debate. It is largely
based on cross-sectional data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Men aged
between 50 and 64 years of age when the survey was conducted in 1971. It considered
union effects on job satisfaction directly, recognizing the possibility that the dissatisfaction
among union members could conceivably arise due to their organizing of poorer jobs.
Borjas addresses this reverse causality issue in two ways.

First, Borjas runs a simultaneous equation in which union membership and job satisfaction
are jointly determined, instrumenting for union membership with industry dummies.
Union membership is found to be associated with higher job dissatisfaction, even when
instrumented, a finding that is consistent with the proposition that unions do raise job
dissatisfaction and that they do so through a voice mechanism which politicizes workers
as they seek better terms and conditions. Exploring this further Borjas considers union
effects on job satisfaction for long- and short-tenure workers, arguing that voice effects
imply greater job dissatisfaction among longer-tenure workers. This is precisely what he
finds. He goes on to find that this effect is not compensated for by seniority pay. On the
contrary, it appears the union wage effect diminishes with tenure. In the one panel element



                                                3
in Borjas' study, he examines quit rates as a function of unionization over the period 1969-
1971. He confirms the negative effect of unionization on quits but notes that it is much
stronger at lower tenure levels, becoming weaker with seniority and even positive after 25
years of tenure (p. 35), consistent with unions flattening earnings profiles as workers
remain in the same job. Taken together Borjas's (1979) analyses are in line with those of
Leigh (1981) in supporting the exit-voice hypothesis and run counter to Duncan and
Stafford's (1980) finding that unions procure compensating wage differentials.

In his analyses for the United States using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(NLSY) 1979-2004, Artz (2010) emphasizes the importance of past union experience for
current job satisfaction, in addition to current membership status. Failure to account for
past union experience effectively means that all current non-members are treated the same
­ as if they had never experienced unionization. Accounting for past union experience
proves important empirically since the negative association between unionization and job
satisfaction increases with union experience. Conversely, as time since last unionization
grows, so job satisfaction rebounds, becoming more positive. Artz interprets the latter as
a fading of the politicization which, as Borjas (1979) notes, comes with union voice and
bargaining. In the analyses we present later we therefore incorporate lagged union status
to see what effect, if any, it has on job satisfaction.

There is a long-standing parallel literature for Britain using panel data. 1 Some of this has
focused on union coverage ­ that is, whether an individual is in a job whose terms and
conditions are set via union bargaining ­ whilst other papers focus on union membership.
The distinction is a potentially meaningful one for Britain because, unlike the United States
where there is a strong positive correlation between membership and coverage, the British
industrial relations system means many of those whose pay is set via union bargaining
(covered workers) may not be union members ­ that is, they `free-ride' on union
bargaining. Conversely, there are some members whose terms and conditions are not
subject to collective bargaining. 2


1
  There is also a literature for Britain which relies on cross-sectional data to investigate whether union effects
on job satisfaction persist when one accounts for unobserved worker or workplace effects. Bender and Sloane
(1998) find the association between unionization and job satisfaction becomes statistically non-significant
when they instrument for union status with perceptions of the climate of industrial relations at the workplace.
Bryson et al. (2004) obtain similar results using linked employer-employee data instrumenting for union
membership using employer perceptions of the climate of industrial relations. The distinction between union
coverage and union membership is found to be important in Bryson et al. (2010) who find that, having
instrumented for coverage using workplace age and the workplace belonging to a multi-site firm, the link
between membership and job dissatisfaction is confined to uncovered union members.
2
  In both countries, workers are protected from penalties associated with being, or not being, a union member.
However, in the United States, in all but the "right-to-work states", employees can be required to pay the
equivalent of union dues if they are employed in a workplace where a union is recognized for bargaining
purposes. In the United Kingdom, the closed shop (requiring an individual to be a union member in order to
perform a particular job) was only outlawed in the late 1980s (whereas it had been illegal in the United States
since 1947), such that union membership has only been an unfettered choice for all workers since the 1990s.
This is worth recalling when we come on to the empirical analysis presented later because employees in
NCDS may have been subject to the closed shop (depending on the industry and occupation they worked in)
up until the time shortly before the NCDS fourth survey sweep in 1991.



                                                        4
Bryson and White (2016a) examine associations between changes in employees'
satisfaction with various aspects of their job and changes in union coverage. Using panel
data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) (1991-2007) which follows up on
individuals annually they show that when employees move into a union covered job they
receive a wage mark-up and, perhaps unsurprisingly, report higher pay satisfaction.
Conversely, those moving from a union covered job on average lose any mark-up and have
significantly reduced pay satisfaction. Similar findings emerge for working hours which,
they show, are also often the object of union bargaining: workers prefer shorter hours and
achieve them with a switch into union coverage, resulting in higher satisfaction with
working hours. However, switching into union coverage lowers satisfaction with job
security, even though coverage has no effect on the perceived risk of unemployment. This
is because covered employees suffer greater costs of re-employment at any given level of
employment risk, partly due to the loss of the union wage mark-up. These findings are
consistent with unions' ability to improve employees' working conditions and wages,
resulting in improvements in those facets of the job where unions bargain successfully.

A second strand of the literature has examined the possibility that those workers who
unionize are different from those who do not in ways that affect their propensity to report
job dissatisfaction. If the difference is unobserved but fixed over time, then this differential
propensity for dissatisfaction among unionized workers will disappear with the
introduction of person fixed effects into the job satisfaction equation. Of course, as in the
case of the panel analyses seeking to account for differences in working conditions, the
identification of union effects is reliant on those switching union status. A series of panel
studies have regressed union status on job satisfaction, treating it as exogenous. They tend
to find a negative association between job satisfaction and unionization which falls and
becomes statistically non-significant, or even turns positive, when incorporating person
fixed effects which account for otherwise fixed unobserved differences across individuals. 3

This is the case, for example, in the study by Bryson and White (2016b) using 17 sweeps
of BHPS data for the period through to 2008: negative associations between union coverage
and satisfaction with pay and hours become positive and statistically significant with the
incorporation of person fixed effects. 4 Blanchflower and Bryson (2020) find similar effects
when comparing OLS and person fixed effects models for unionization effects on overall
job satisfaction over the period 1996-2014 using panel data combining BHPS with its
successor Understanding Society (USoc). 5 The implication is that, at least among
employees in the 1990s and 2000s in Britain, unionized workers had a higher propensity


3
  Not all effects move in the same direction. For example, in Heywood et al.'s (2002) study of the BHPS for
the period 1991-1994 a negative union membership coefficient in a pay satisfaction regression becomes
statistically non-significant with the incorporation of person fixed effects. However, negative associations
between membership and satisfaction with "relations with the boss" and "work itself" persist with the
incorporation of person fixed effects.
4
  In their study of BHPS data for 1995-2008 Green and Heywood (2014) find the introduction of worker
fixed effects systematically reduces the size of the negative regression coefficients for unionization with
respect to satisfaction with all aspects of the job.
5
  The results are robust to the use of union membership or a dummy variable where unionization is either
membership or union coverage.

for dissatisfaction than their non-union counterparts, a propensity which may have
influenced their union status in the first place.

Conscious of the potential endogeneity of switches in union coverage status, Bryson and
White (2016b) distinguish between different paths into coverage. They find union
coverage effects on pay satisfaction are strongest where coverage is extended to an
employee who remains in the same job, with the same employer. This, they argue, is likely
a more exogenous switch than those accompanying a job switch, thus providing further
weight to the proposition that unions may have a causal impact in raising employee job
satisfaction through pay bargaining.

Another important finding in the literature is that union-induced changes in job satisfaction
vary over time. This is what Artz (2010) found for the United States. It is perhaps best
illustrated for Britain in the paper by Powdthavee (2011) for private sector employees in
waves 5-15 of the BHPS. Using panel fixed effects estimates he shows job satisfaction
declines in the year prior to becoming unionized, relative to those who remain non-union
­ as one might expect if dissatisfaction with one's job triggered the desire to become a
union member. This is followed by an initial positive impact of being newly unionized on
several aspects of job satisfaction. However, this positive effect only persists in the case
of pay satisfaction, which is perhaps the issue which unions devote most time and effort to
in bargaining with employers. 6

This review suggests that unionization tends to be negatively correlated with job
satisfaction when treated as exogenous; the effects become non-significant and, in some
cases positive when instrumenting for unionization and when fixed unobserved differences
across workers are accounted for; and that unionization effects are most likely positive in
the case of pay satisfaction, reflecting the wage bargaining efforts of trade unions which
raise union workers' wages above those set in the market. However, there is some
uncertainty as to how long these union effects persist, and there may also be a causal impact
of unionization inducing job dissatisfaction through the politicizing effects of union voice
and bargaining.

The bulk of this literature focuses on short-run effects of unionization ­ usually change
over one year or, in some cases, a few years in succession. There is no literature
investigating union effects over the life-course, though there are suggestions in the work
by Borjas (1979) that union wage effects diminish with tenure, leading to greater job
dissatisfaction among older unionized workers. Furthermore, only recently in the work of
Blanchflower and Bryson (2020) has it become apparent that union associations with job
satisfaction differ markedly by birth cohort, as well as age. Among those cohorts born
more recently unionization is more positively associated with job satisfaction: unionized
employees born in the 1950s and 1960s have lower job satisfaction than their non-union
counterparts, a difference that persists over time.



6
  Bryson and White (2016b) also test for the persistence of union positive effects on job satisfaction and
find that the effects of union coverage on pay satisfaction do not persist over time.


                                                      6
In the remainder of this paper we turn to union effects on job satisfaction across the life-
course for a British birth cohort born in 1958 who were entering the labour market in the
late 1970s and who we track through to age 55 in 2013.

3. Data and Estimation
Our data are the British National Child Development Study (NCDS), a nationally
representative cohort study of all the people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a
single week in March, in 1958 (Pearson, 2016). In addition, 798 immigrants born in that
week but outside Great Britain and 345 who were born in Great Britain, but who were not
in the initial Perinatal Mortality Study (PMS) were later added. In total there are 18,558
study participants of whom 18,059 are white. There were 395 stillbirths and 278 neonatal
deaths in the first 28 days of life and by age 55, in NCDS9, there had been an additional
987 deaths. In addition, there was an attempt made in 2013 to contact those once in Britain
but now living abroad, to invite participation in a web-based follow-up at age 55 (Dodgeon
et al, 2014). At NCDS9 1,286 study participants had emigrated.

We track the job satisfaction and union status of those in employment at ages 23, 33, 42,
46, 50 and 55 ­ respectively sweeps 4 through 9 of the data. All but the telephone survey
at age 46 involved a home interview. The cohort started as the Perinatal Mortality Study
(PMS) with 17,415 births covering 98% of births in that week. Individuals frequently
disappear in one sweep and reappear in a subsequent one. In NCDS4 at age 23 there were
12,537 observations; 11,469 in NCDS5 at age 33, 11,419 in NCDS6 at age 42; 9534 in
NCDS7 at age 46; 9,790 in NCDS8 at age 50 and 9,137 in NCDS9 at age 55. At age 55
approximately 86% of the sample had responded to NCDS4.

Response rates to these surveys have been high. Below we tabulate percentage
distributions for all cohort members in 2013 based on the social class of the cohort
member's mother's husband in 1958 at the time of the respondent's birth (variable n492).
By 2013 there were 1,659 respondents who had died: they were disproportionately from
Social Class 5. Overall 1,286 had emigrated, disproportionately from Social Classes 1 and
2 and those who had not been in the original PMS file, presumably returning to their
country of origin outside the British Isles. Excluding those who had died and those who
had emigrated, the response rate at NCDS9 was 58.5%. The distribution of non-
respondents in column 5 is slightly more weighted to the lowest two social classes than
those who are present in NCDS9 (22.6% versus 17.6%), suggesting sample selection by
social class was not a major problem.

We present models estimating three sets of dependent variables. First, we estimate job
satisfaction equations at sweeps 4 (age 23), 7 (age 46), 8 (age 50) and 9 (age 55). In most
of the analyses the dependent variable is overall job satisfaction, but we also present
satisfaction with facets of the job at sweep 4 (age 23) which is the only age at which this
richer set of job satisfaction variables is available. We everywhere restrict the sample in
each sweep, including lagged values, to workers only. Although the satisfaction variables
are ordinal, running from very dissatisfied to very satisfied, we run OLS estimates. 7 The
models are run for single sweeps of data and incorporate the same set of controls
throughout, namely gender, region and education, together with employment status (part-
time employee, self-employed). We also present extended models which incorporate the
cohort member's social class, as indicated by the occupation of his or her father at birth.

Union status is captured by the cohort respondent's union membership status. We
experiment with contemporaneous union membership, together with lagged union
membership in previous waves to assess the persistence of union membership effects.
Throughout estimates are unweighted.

Second, we run log hourly wage equations for employees at sweep 4 (age 23) and sweep 8
(age 50) to establish the size of the wage gap between union members and non-members.

Third, when employees are aged 50 in sweep 8 they are asked a broader range of subjective
wellbeing questions, such as how much pain they feel at work, and whether they would
pack in their job if they disliked it. These models control for social class, region and
education, as well as the cohort member's gender and current employment status (part-
time, self-employed). These models capture the partial correlation between five wellbeing
metrics and contemporaneous union membership status.

4. Results
By age 23, of the 12,536 individuals who responded to the NCDS4 survey 73.6% were in
employment. Of these 44.3% were union members. Recall, this was 1981 when union
membership in Britain was close to its peak (Chart 1). Union membership was 13.2 million
in 1979; 12.6 million in 1980 and 12.3 million in 1981. It fell dramatically afterwards as
examined by Disney (1990) and Disney, Gosling and Machin (1995) such that, by 2013 ­
when we last see our birth cohort at age 55 ­ membership had dropped to 7.0 million. 8
This is reflected in the NCDS birth cohort: union membership had halved to 21.3% by 2008
when they were aged 50 (Appendix Table A1).

  It continued to fall until 2016 when it stood at 6.23 million, rising to 6.4 million in 2019 ('Trade Union

In addition, unemployment was rising quickly under Margaret Thatcher's
premiership. The UK monthly unemployment rate rose steadily during 1981 from 8.6% in
January through to 10.3% in December, a rate it has never reached since. 9

Table 1 recovers the partial correlation between union membership at age 23 and five
measures of job satisfaction using OLS estimates. The first is an overall measure of job
satisfaction (n4320). The four others relate to pay (n4313); physical conditions (n4316),
job organization (n4317), and interest in their job (n4319). They are taken from the
following question:

"I am going to read out some things which affect how people feel about their job. Can you
tell me how satisfied or dissatisfied you feel with each one in your present job - very
satisfied (=5); satisfied (=4); neither (=3); dissatisfied (=2) very dissatisfied (=1) - with
our codes in parentheses ­

Q1. Your usual take home pay?
Q2. Your physical working conditions?
Q3. The interest and skill involved in your job?
Q4. The way your firm is run?
Q5. Taking everything into consideration how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your
job as a whole?"

Each equation includes controls for gender, part-time and self-employed status, region and
education levels. (There is no age control since all are aged 23).

At age 23, 30% of employees reported being `very satisfied' with their current job, and
another half (49.8%) reported being `satisfied'. Only 3% were `very dissatisfied' Nearly
four-fifths of employees continued to report being either "satisfied" or "very dissatisfied"
with their jobs in the other three sweeps when job satisfaction is asked, namely at ages 46,
50 and 55 (Appendix Table A1).

We had anticipated that the partial correlation between union membership and overall job
satisfaction would have been negative and statistically significant given the earlier
literature identifying such a relationship for this birth cohort, albeit in the United States. In
fact, although the coefficient in column 1 of Table 1 is negative it is far from statistically
significant (with a t-statistic of 0.27). However, a clear pattern emerges in columns 2-5
when we consider the association between union membership and satisfaction with various
facets of one's job. Union members rate their jobs more poorly than their non-union

   Being part of a large cohort entering the world of work can reduce future prospects (Korenman and
Newmark, 2000). We looked at the UK mid-year population estimates and found that the number age 23 in
1981 was 1.48% of the population, which compares with an average from 1971-2014 of 1.42%. The size of
the age 23 cohort was on a rising trend from 1.36% in 1978 to a peak of 1.88% in 1988 before falling back
to 1.15% in 2000. This compares with 1.2% in 2020. The number age 23 in 1981 was greater than the number
in 2020 (833,717 versus 815,851) despite a rise in the population of by nearly 11 million from 56.3 million
to 67.2 million. Source: UK Population Estimates, 1851-2015, ONS July 2015 and Census Bureau

counterparts on all non-pecuniary components (physical conditions, job organization, job
interest) but express greater satisfaction with their pay. These results are very much in
keeping with the compensating wage differentials idea initially discussed by Duncan and
Stafford (1980). The final column lends further support to this proposition: the union
coefficient in the overall job satisfaction equation increases ten-fold relative to column 1
and becomes statistically significant (with a t-statistic of 2.37) when conditioning on log
hourly pay. This is reminiscent of Borjas' (1979: 31) analyses for the United States in the
early 1970s when he compared union effects on job satisfaction with and without a wage
control.

To establish the precise size of this union wage premium we ran some estimates of log
hourly wages in NCDS4 for workers aged 23 (Appendix Table A2). We find a union wage
premium of around 20% which hardly changes with the introduction of controls for
education, part-time status and region dummies (column 2 compared to column 1). 10 This
estimate is somewhat larger than found in 1980 in Blanchflower (1984) for all workers.

We examined the UK Labour Force survey which contains data on earnings and union
status from 1993-2019 which is the same survey (1993-2006) used in Blanchflower and
Bryson (2010). We estimated a series of log hourly earnings equations by four age groups
and three time periods controlling for year, region, age and its square, gender and age left
school (n=331,250). It is clear that union wage differentials were highest in the 1990s for
all age groups. In each time period, though, wage differentials were highest for the young.

As we see in columns 3 and 4 of Appendix Table A2 at age 50 the raw union wage premium
is 9% but it falls to zero with controls. Again, this is reminiscent of Borjas' (1979) analysis
for the United States which showed union effects on wages turned negative among men in
their 50s who had been in their jobs for some time. 11

Ideally, we would have assessed the partial correlation between union membership and job
satisfaction in all NCDS sweeps but, as we see in Appendix Table A1, job satisfaction is
not available in NCDS5 (age 33) and NCDS6 (age 42). It is available in NCDS7 when
cohort members were aged 46. It is notable that their job satisfaction in general rises
relative to the job satisfaction of those in employment at age 23: almost half (46%) report
that they are `very satisfied' with their job. Unfortunately, union membership is not
recorded in NCDS7. Instead, in Table 2 we consider the partial correlation between job
satisfaction and past union membership status among those at age 46, in 2004, in NCDS7.

10
   The union wage differential in percentage terms is obtained by taking anti-logs and deducting 1.
11
   Although among Borjas' survey of men in their 50s and 60s back in 1971 the average union effect on
wages having conditioning on tenure and other controls was nevertheless positive and statistically significant
(.0485, t-stat=2.02 from Table 5).


                                                     10
The motivation for doing so is to assess the persistence of union effects, as explored by
Artz (2010) for the United States.

The exact question (n7jbsatis) asked was very similar to Q5 above.

Q6. All things considered, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your present job- very
satisfied (=5); satisfied (=4); neither (=3); dissatisfied (=2) very dissatisfied (=1) once
again with our codes in parentheses.

As in the case of 23 year olds, we find 46 year olds in this cohort were more satisfied with
their jobs overall working as self-employed or part-time, when compared to working as
full-time employees, whilst men were less satisfied with their jobs than women (Table 2,
column 1).

If unionized in NCDS6, when aged 42, workers were likely to be less satisfied with their
jobs at age 46 than those who had been working but were not unionized at age 42 (column
2). Being unionized at NCDS5 when aged 33 was also negatively and significantly
correlated with job satisfaction at age 46 (column 3). Effects of union membership at age
23 were negative but non-significant (column 4). The implication is that duration of union
experience is strongly associated with lower job satisfaction, as Artz (2010) found for the
United States. That said, current membership is salient, as indicated when we condition
on both current membership status at age 46 and lagged membership when aged 42
(column 5) and when we include lagged union status at ages 42 and 33 (column 6).

We conduct a similar exercise in Table 3, but this time for job satisfaction at NCDS8 when
workers were aged 50. The exact question (n8jbatis) used was Q6 above. In this case, we
have contemporaneous union membership: this is strongly and negatively associated with
job satisfaction at age 50 (column 1). When entered alone, lagged union membership is
also partially correlated with job satisfaction at age 50, whether measured at age 42
(column 2), 33 (column 3) or 24 (column 4). Again, when entered together, it is
contemporaneous union membership status that remains negative and statistically
significant (columns 5 and 6).

A similar pattern of results emerges in Table 4 when we focus on job satisfaction in NCDS9
when workers are aged 55. The question used (jobsatis9) was Q6 above. When entered
separately lagged union membership is negatively and significantly associated with job
satisfaction at age 55 ­ even union membership some 22 years earlier when aged 33. (Union
membership at NCDS4 was excluded as it was always insignificant). However, once again,
contemporaneous union membership is negative and significant and substantially reduces
the coefficient on lagged membership such that membership at age 42 (NCDS6) becomes
non-significant when it is included in column 5. Finally, in column 6 we included lagged
job satisfaction at age 50: unsurprisingly it is very strongly correlated with job satisfaction
at age 55 but, even here, the partial correlation between membership and job satisfaction
at age 55 remains negative and statistically significant. The implication is that, even if one
partials out dissatisfaction with a job 5 years previously, union membership continues to
generate dissatisfaction with the job now.



                                              11
One possible hypothesis that can be tested in NCDS is that the association between union
membership and job dissatisfaction is actually driven by a third, usually unobserved, factor
namely one's family origins which potentially generate both a greater propensity for union
membership and job dissatisfaction. We know from other research that union membership
is passed inter-generationally (Bryson and Davies, 2019) but little is known about one's
social origins at birth and the propensity for job satisfaction. We can test for this in NCDS
because it contains data on the occupation of the respondent's father when they were born. 12
We plug this variable into estimates of job satisfaction at ages 23, 55, 50 and 46 in Table
5. We also include an (insignificant) control for whether the respondent was not in the
PMS which means no father's occupation was not reported, to maintain sample sizes. We
find that one's social class at birth, as indicated by one's father's occupation, does indeed
significantly impact one's own job satisfaction up to 55 years later. However, the negative
partial correlation with union membership remains negative and statistically significant in
all but NCDS4.

Blanchflower and Bryson (2020) reported that the partial correlation between unionization
and job satisfaction was positive in post Great Recession data, but so too was its partial
correlation with other well-being measures including life satisfaction, happiness and
lowered stress and worry. But they also found that unions entered positively in pain and
anger equations in the Gallup US Daily Tracker from 2008-2017.

With these findings in mind we repeated this exercise for a range of wellbeing metrics (Q6-
Q10) in NCDS which were collected in 2008 when cohort members were aged 50. Results
are reported in Table 6. We find union members at age 50 are likely to report more pain
(column 1) and more pain at work (column 2) than their non-union counterparts,
reminiscent of the Gallup Daily Tracker results mentioned above. In addition, union
members were more critical of management than non-members: they were more likely to
agree with the statement that managers always try and get the best of workers (column 3).

Of note is that in all three equations the occupation of the respondent's father when they
were born, as recorded in the 1958 PMS, has an impact on well-being fifty years later. The
final column indicates that, despite expressing greater dissatisfaction with their jobs and
management at age 50 compared to their non-member counterparts, they were nevertheless
more attached to paid work than non-members: they were less likely to agree that they
would pack up a job they disliked, even if they had no other to go to. Father's occupation
was not a significant influence in the final column so was omitted. These responses provide
some insights into why union members invest in unionization in the first place: they prefer
to voice to improve their job as opposed to simply putting up with a bad situation.

5. Conclusions
Using data from a cohort of 18,558 individuals born in a single week in March 1958, in
Great Britain or who were immigrants born in that week in another country, we examine
the relationship between union membership and job satisfaction over the life-course
through to age 55 (2013). We find a significant negative partial correlation between union

12
     The data actually refers to the occupation of the respondent's mother's husband.


                                                       12
membership and job satisfaction that is apparent at various points across the life-course.
Among those in their early 20s satisfaction with the union wage premium off-sets
dissatisfaction with non-pecuniary aspects of the job, acting as a compensating wage
differential. Furthermore, lagged union membership status going back many years is
negatively correlated with current job satisfaction, though its effects become statistically
non-significant when conditioning on current union membership status.

These results provide a different perspective to longitudinal studies showing short-term
positive responses to switches in membership status. They are consistent with
Blanchflower and Bryson's (2020) earlier cross-sectional analyses for the United States
showing that this cohort of workers, and others before them, have persistently lower job
satisfaction as union members compared to their non-union counterparts. This contrasts
with later cohorts where unionized workers actually have higher job satisfaction than their
non-unionized counterparts.

Why is it that, among this cohort, union membership is associated with lower overall job
satisfaction across the life-course? There are (at least) two possibilities. The first is that
the sorts of jobs organized by trades unions at that time were drawn from the lower end of
the job quality distribution, either because they were concentrated in heavy industry and
manufacturing, or in `dirty' or `dangerous' occupations. We get a hint of that from our
analyses of satisfaction with different facets of the job among those aged 23: union
members express greater dissatisfaction than non-members about all non-pecuniary aspects
of the job but are more satisfied about their pay than non-members. This is because, as we
show, unions are successful in procuring a compensating wage differential for the poor job
quality their workers face. Duncan and Stafford (1980) argued the situation was similar
among workers in the United States in the 1970s. That differential appears to have fully
compensated union members for their poor-quality jobs at age 23, but not subsequently.

But why has this association persisted, when later cohorts of union members express
greater satisfaction with their work than non-members? It may be that, despite the
changing composition of the unionised workforce associated with the decline in heavy
industry and its replacement by services and public sector work, this early cohort may have
become `stuck' in poor quality jobs, incapable of moving onwards and upwards to better
parts of the labour market? This is a distinct possibility, particularly in Britain because, as
we noted earlier, this cohort were facing a huge economic recession in their early careers.
We know that entering the world of work in a recession is particularly hard, potentially
limiting future career progression (Kahn, 2010).

A second possibility is that this cohort's experience of unionization is fundamentally
different from later cohorts, and that this experience was fashioned early on in their careers.
Recall, union density was at its peak in Britain when these workers entered the labour
market. And unions were militant. Union recourse to strike action was common and, often,
painful for union workers. The working days lost due to industrial action in the 12 months
to April 1980 was 32.15 million ­ the highest for any 12-month period since records began
in 1931 (Chart 2). It peaked again shortly afterwards, in 1984/85 with the Miners' Strike,
as Chart 2 shows. It is conceivable that these experiences accentuated the politicization



                                              13
effect of unionization, something which Borjas (1979) and Artz (2010) identified as
important in contributing to a union job dissatisfaction differential, which remained with
this cohort of workers through the remainder of their working lives. This might also
explain why it is that these workers continue to express dissatisfaction with their jobs, even
years later, after their union membership, as indicated by the significance of lagged
unionization in our estimates.

One final point is worthy of note. In the 1980s the closed shop was still legally enforceable
in Britain. 13 It meant that some workers were required to be union members prior the
entering specific occupations or work settings (a pre-entry closed shop) or on beginning
work in that setting (a post-entry closed shop). Twenty-three per cent of workplaces with
25 or more employees had a closed shop for at least some employees in 1980 (Millward et
al., 2000: 89). Thus, there were many circumstances in which workers wishing to
undertake certain jobs could not do so unless they were union members. This brought
many advantages to trade unions and their members, raising union density and thus union
bargaining power vis-à-vis employers, leading to a larger union wage premium than in
other settings (Stewart, 1987). But it also meant workers had no choice but to be union
members and pay union membership fees in many workplaces in Britain at the time. It is
possible that many would have chosen not to become unionized at the time if they had had
the choice, and that this may have contributed to their dissatisfaction with their working
environment.

The world of work had changed in many ways by the time our cohort had reached age 55
in 2013. As we have shown, union membership had fallen dramatically and, as others have
shown, those in the union sector had changed quite considerably both in terms of their
demographics (most are now women, for example) and in the jobs they undertake (with
the majority working in the public sector). Huge structural changes have swept through
the economy with the rise of services in place of manufacturing, and the globalization of
trade, with attendant implications for workers and their jobs. But this paper suggests that
there is some stability in the way in which cohorts of workers feel about their jobs, and the
factors influencing those feelings. It seems that these influences affect perceptions and
attitudes early in one's working life, and that these persist in the future. We only know this
because with birth cohort data we are able to track individuals across their life-course.

There may be lessons for the new generation entering the labour market today. Like their
counterparts in the early 1980s, they will be facing huge uncertainty and growing
unemployment ­ albeit for quite different reasons. Whether unions are part of the solution
as workers seek improvements in their pay and job quality remains to be seen, but it is
notable that in the past three years union membership and union density have been on the
rise in Britain, albeit from a low base ­ the first period of sustained growth since the late
1970s (Bishop, 2020). For this cohort born in a single week in 1958 unionization is
negatively correlated with job satisfaction across their lifespan.
