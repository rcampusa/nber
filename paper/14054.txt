We study the properties of the carry trade, a currency speculation strategy in which an investor borrows
low-interest-rate currencies and lends high-interest-rate currencies. This strategy generates payoffs
which are on average large and uncorrelated with traditional risk factors. We argue that these payoffs
reflect a peso problem. The underlying peso event features high values of the stochastic discount factor
rather than very large negative payoffs.

1     Introduction

The forward exchange rate is a biased forecaster of the future spot exchange rate. This fact

is often referred to as the ‘forward-premium puzzle.’ We study the properties of a widely-
used currency speculation strategy, known as the carry trade, that exploits this puzzle.
This strategy involves selling currencies forward that are at a forward premium and buying

currencies forward that are at a forward discount. Transaction costs aside, this strategy
is equivalent to borrowing low-interest-rate currencies in order to lend high-interest-rate
currencies, without hedging the associated currency risk. Consistent with results in the

literature, we …nd that the carry-trade strategy applied to portfolios of currencies yields high

average payo¤s, as well as Sharpe ratios that are substantially higher than those associated

with the U.S. stock market.

    The most natural explanation for the high average payo¤ to the carry trade is that it

compensates agents for bearing risk. However, we show that linear stochastic discount factors

built from conventional measures of risk, such as consumption growth, the returns to the

stock market, and the Fama-French (1993) factors, fail to explain the payo¤s to the carry

trade. This failure re‡ects the absence of a statistically signi…cant unconditional correlation

between the payo¤s to the carry trade and traditional risk factors. Our results are consistent

with previous work documenting that one can reject consumption-based asset-pricing models
using data on forward exchange rates (e.g. Bekaert and Hodrick (1992) and Backus, Foresi,

and Telmer (2001)). More generally, it has been di¢ cult to use structural asset-pricing

models to rationalize the risk-premium movements required to account for the time-series
properties of the forward premium (see Bekaert (1996)).

    The most natural alternative explanation for the high average payo¤ to the carry trade

is that it re‡ects the presence of a peso problem. We use the term ‘peso problem’to refer to
the e¤ects on inference caused by low-probability events that do not occur in sample.1 Peso
   1
     In related work Farhi and Gabaix (2008) and Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen (2008) emphasize the
importance of rare in-sample events. There are some moderately large negative payo¤s to the unhedged carry
trade in our sample. While these payo¤s a¤ect the pro…tability of the strategy, the average risk-adjusted


                                                    1
problems can in principle explain the positive average payo¤ to the carry trade. To under-
stand the basic argument, suppose that a foreign currency is at a forward premium so that

a carry-trade investor sells this currency forward. Assume that a substantial appreciation of
the foreign currency occurs with small probability. The investor must be compensated for
the negative payo¤ to the carry trade in this state of the world. So, the average risk-adjusted

payo¤ to the carry trade is positive in non-peso states.
   In this paper we address the question of whether or not the large average payo¤ to the
unhedged carry trade is compensation for peso-event risk. Our approach to answering this

question relies on analyzing the payo¤s to a version of the carry-trade strategy that does not

yield high negative payo¤s in a peso state. This strategy works as follows. When an investor

sells the foreign currency forward, he simultaneously buys a call option on that currency. If

the foreign currency appreciates beyond the strike price, the investor can buy the foreign

currency at the strike price and deliver the currency in ful…llment of the forward contract.

Similarly, when an investor buys the foreign currency forward, he can hedge the downside

risk by buying a put option on the foreign currency. By construction this ‘hedged carry

trade’is immune to large losses such as those potentially associated with a peso event.

   We use data on currency options to estimate the average risk-adjusted payo¤ to the

hedged carry trade. We …nd that this payo¤ is smaller than the corresponding payo¤ to the

unhedged carry trade. This …nding is consistent with the view that the average payo¤ to
the unhedged carry trade re‡ects a peso problem. Given this result, an obvious question is:

what is the nature of the peso event for which agents are being compensated? It is useful to
distinguish between two extreme possibilities. The …rst possibility is that the salient feature
of a peso state is large carry-trade losses.2 The second possibility is that the salient feature

of a peso state is a large value of the stochastic discount factor (SDF). A key contribution
of this paper is to assess the relative importance of these two possibilities. We …nd that a
payo¤ to the carry trade is positive.
   2
     See Bates (1996a) for a related argument that exchange rate jumps can explain the volatility smile
present in currency options.



                                                  2
peso event re‡ects high values of the SDF in the peso state rather than very large negative
payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade in that state.

   The intuition for why the losses to the unhedged carry trade are small in the peso state
is as follows. Any risk-adjusted payo¤s associated with the carry trade in the non-peso
states must on average be compensated, on a risk-adjusted basis, for losses in the peso state.

According to our estimates, the average risk-adjusted payo¤s of the hedged and unhedged
carry trade in the non-peso states are not very di¤erent. Consequently, the risk-adjusted
losses to these two strategies in the peso state cannot be very di¤erent. Since the value of the

SDF in the peso state is the same for both strategies, the actual losses of the two strategies

in the peso state must be similar. By construction there is an upper bound to the losses of

the hedged carry trade. This upper bound tell us how much an agent loses in the peso state

if he is pursuing the hedged carry trade. Since these losses turn out to be small, the losses

to the unhedged carry trade in the peso state must also be small.

   The rationale for why the SDF is much larger in the peso state than in the non-peso

states is as follows. We just argued that the unhedged carry trade makes relatively small

losses in the peso state. At the same time, the average risk-adjusted payo¤ to the unhedged

carry trade in the non-peso states is large. The only way to rationalize these observations is

for the SDF to be very high in the peso state. So, even though the losses of the unhedged

carry trade in the peso state are moderate, the investor attaches great importance to those
losses.

   A possible shortcoming of our methodology is that we can always produce values of
the SDF and the carry-trade payo¤ in the peso state that rationalize the observed average
payo¤s to the carry trade. The skeptical reader may conclude that we have documented

an interesting puzzle without providing a credible resolution of that puzzle. So, we bring
additional data to bear on the plausibility of our estimates. We consider two versions of an
equity strategy that involve borrowing one dollar at the Treasury-bill rate and investing it in

the stock market. In the …rst version the agent does not hedge against adverse movements


                                               3
in the stock market. In the second version the agent buys at-the-money put options which
compensate him for a fall in the stock market. We …nd that, in sharp contrast to the carry

trade, the hedged stock market strategy yields large, negative average payo¤s. Using the
average risk-adjusted payo¤ to the two stock market strategies we generate an independent
estimate of the value of the SDF in the peso state. Remarkably, this estimate is similar to

the estimate of the peso state SDF that rationalizes the average risk-adjusted payo¤s to the
carry trade. We interpret these …ndings as supportive of the view that the positive average
payo¤ to the unhedged carry trade re‡ects the presence of a peso problem.

    Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the carry-trade strategy and

discuss our method for estimating carry trade losses and the value of the SDF in the peso

state. We describe our data in Section 3. In Section 4 we study the covariance between the

payo¤s to the carry trade and traditional risk factors, using both time series and panel data.

In Section 5 we study the properties of the hedged carry trade. In Section 6 we report our

estimates of the payo¤s to the carry trade and stock market strategies in the peso state, and

our estimates of the SDF in the peso state. We also generalize the analysis to multiple peso

states. Section 7 concludes.


2     Peso problems and the carry trade

The failure of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) motivates a variety of speculative strate-
gies. We focus on the carry trade, the strategy most widely used by practitioners (see
Galati and Melvin (2004)). In this section we describe a procedure for analyzing peso-event

explanations for carry-trade payo¤s.
    The carry trade consists of borrowing a low-interest-rate currency and lending a high-
interest-rate currency. Abstracting from transactions costs, the payo¤ to the carry trade,

denominated in dollars, is:
                                               St+1
                                yt (1 + rt )          (1 + rt ) :                         (1)
                                                St
The variable St denotes the spot exchange rate expressed as dollars per foreign currency unit

                                                4
(FCU). The variables rt and rt represent the domestic and foreign interest rate, respectively.
We normalize the amount of dollars bet on this strategy to one. The amount of dollars

borrowed, yt , is given by:
                                             +1 if rt < rt ,
                                    yt =                                                  (2)
                                              1 if rt   rt .
   Consider the case in which St is a martingale:

                                           Et St+1 = St ;                                 (3)

where Et denotes the time-t conditional expectations operator. This martingale property
is not an implication of market e¢ ciency, but it is a reasonable description of the data.

Equation (3) implies that the expected payo¤ to the carry trade is positive and equal to the

di¤erence between the higher and the lower interest rate:

                                        yt (rt    rt ) > 0:

   The carry-trade strategy can also be implemented by selling the foreign currency forward

when it is at a forward premium (Ft         St ) and buying the foreign currency forward when

it is at a forward discount (Ft < St ). The value of wt , the number of FCUs sold forward, is

given by:
                                           +1=Ft if Ft St ,
                                 wt =                                                     (4)
                                            1=Ft if Ft < St .
This value of wt is equivalent to buying/selling one dollar forward. The dollar-denominated
payo¤ to this strategy at t + 1, denoted zt+1 , is

                                    zt+1 = wt (Ft       St+1 ) .                          (5)

Covered interest rate parity implies that:

                                                  Ft
                                    (1 + rt ) =      (1 + rt ) .                          (6)
                                                  St

When equation (6) holds, the payo¤s to the strategies de…ned by equations (4) and (2) are

proportional to each other. In this sense the strategies are equivalent. We focus our analysis

on strategy (4) because of data considerations.

                                                  5
The impact of peso problems Since the carry trade is a zero net-investment strategy,
the payo¤, zt , must satisfy:

                                               Et (Mt+1 zt+1 ) = 0.                                          (7)

Here Mt+1 denotes the SDF that prices payo¤s denominated in dollars. Equation (7) implies
that:
                                                       cov (Mt+1 ; zt+1 )
                                         E (zt+1 ) =                      .                                  (8)
                                                          E (Mt+1 )
In light of equation (8) a natural explanation for the positive average payo¤s to the carry

trade is that these payo¤s compensate agents for the risk resulting from negative covariance

between M and z. In our empirical work (see Section 4) we document that the covariance

between the payo¤s to the carry trade and a host of traditional risk factors is not statistically

di¤erent from zero.3 This …nding implies that traditional risk-based explanations are not a

plausible rationale for the positive average payo¤s to the carry trade.

       An alternative explanation relies on the existence of peso events. To pursue this expla-

nation we use the following notation. Let ! t 2                 denote the state of the world at time t,

let z(! t ) denote the payo¤ to the carry trade in state ! t , and M (! t ) denote the value of the

SDF in state ! t . We partition            , the set of possible states, ! t , into two sets. The …rst set,
  N                                                                                                           P
      , consists of those values of ! t corresponding to non-peso events. The second set,                         ,

consists of those values of ! t corresponding to a peso event. For simplicity, we assume that
                 P
for all ! t 2        , z(! t ) = z 0 < 0 and M (! t ) = M 0 .

       We denote by F N (! t+1 ) the unconditional distribution of ! t+1 in non-peso states. For
future reference we de…ne F N (! t+1 j! t ) as the conditional distribution of ! t+1 given ! t , where
                                  N
both ! t+1 and ! t are in             . To simplify, we assume that the conditional and unconditional
   3
    See Villanueva (2007) for additional evidence on this point. Lustig and Verdelhan (2007) argue that a
consumption-based SDF explains the cross-sectional variation in the excess returns to going long on currency
portfolios that are sorted by their interest rate di¤erential with respect to the U.S. Burnside (2007) challenges
their results based on two …ndings. First, the time-series covariance between the excess returns to the
Lustig-Verdelhan portfolios and standard risk factors, including consumption-based SDFs, is not signi…cantly
di¤erent from zero. Second, imposing the constraint that a zero beta asset has a zero excess return leads
to a substantial deterioration in the ability of their model to explain the cross-sectional variation in excess
returns to the portfolios.



                                                        6
probability of the peso state is p. The unconditional version of equation (7) is:

                                 (1    p)E N (M z) + pM 0 z 0 = 0,                       (9)

where E N ( ) denotes the expectation over non-peso states,
                                       Z
                            N
                           E (M z) =           M (! t+1 )z(! t+1 )dF N (! t+1 ).
                                           N



   Since z 0 is negative, equation (9) implies that the average risk-adjusted payo¤ over non-
peso states, E N (M z), is positive. This observation captures the conventional view that a

peso problem can rationalize positive average payo¤s to the carry trade.

   We focus on whether or not the existence of peso events provides a plausible rationale

for our estimate of the average payo¤ to the carry trade in non-peso states. To study this

question we develop a version of the carry-trade strategy that does not yield large losses

when a peso event occurs. We call this strategy the ‘hedged carry trade.’Below we describe

this strategy in detail.


The hedged carry trade We begin by de…ning notation for options contracts. A call

option gives an agent the right, but not the obligation, to buy foreign currency at a strike

price of Kt dollars per FCU. We denote the dollar price of this option by Ct . The payo¤ to

the call option in dollars, net of the option price, is:

                             C
                            zt+1 = max (0; St+1         Kt )   Ct (1 + rt ) .           (10)

A put option gives an agent the right, but not the obligation, to sell foreign currency at a

strike price of Kt dollars per FCU. We denote the dollar price of this option by Pt . The
payo¤ to the put option in dollars, net of the option price is:

                             P
                            zt+1 = max (0; Kt         St+1 )   Pt (1 + rt ) .           (11)

   Suppose that an agent sells one FCU forward. Then, the worst case scenario in the

standard carry trade arises when there is a large appreciation of the foreign currency. In

                                                    7
this state of the world the agent realizes large losses because he has to buy foreign currency
at a high value of St+1 to deliver on the forward contract. Suppose that the agent buys, at

time t, a call option on the foreign currency with a strike price Kt . So, whenever St+1 > Kt ,
the agent buys FCUs at the price Kt . In this case the minimum payo¤ to the hedged carry
trade is:

                (Ft     St+1 ) + (St+1    Kt )    Ct (1 + rt ) = Ft   Kt   Ct (1 + rt ) .   (12)

   Similarly, suppose that an agent buys one FCU forward. Then, the worst case scenario in
the standard carry trade arises when there is a large depreciation of the foreign currency. In

this state of the world the agent sells the foreign currency that he receives from the forward

contract at a low value of St+1 . Suppose that the agent buys, at time t, a put option on the

foreign currency with a strike price Kt . So, whenever St+1 < Kt , the agent sells FCUs at a

price Kt . In this case the minimum payo¤ to the hedged carry trade is:


                (St+1     Ft ) + (Kt     St+1 )   Pt (1 + rt ) = Kt   Ft   Pt (1 + rt ) .   (13)


In order to normalize the size of the bet to one dollar, we set the amount of FCUs traded

equal to 1=Ft . We de…ne the hedged carry-trade strategy as:


                If Ft      St , sell 1=Ft FCUs forward and buy 1=Ft call options,

                If Ft < St , buy 1=Ft FCUs forward and buy 1=Ft put options.


The dollar payo¤ to this strategy is:

                                                   C
                                H          zt+1 + zt+1 =Ft if Ft St ,
                               zt+1 =              P                                        (14)
                                           zt+1 + zt+1 =Ft if Ft < St ,

              C          P
where zt+1 , zt+1 , and zt+1 are the carry-trade payo¤s de…ned in equations (5), (10) and (11),
respectively.

   An alternative way to implement the hedged carry trade is to use only options, instead
of using a combination of forwards and options. Under this alternative implementation we
buy 1=Ft call options on the foreign currency when it is at a forward discount and 1=Ft put

                                                     8
options on the foreign currency when it is at a forward premium. Using the put-call-forward
parity condition,

                                         (Ct    Pt ) (1 + rt ) = Ft      Kt ,                      (15)

it is easy to show that this strategy for hedging the carry trade is equivalent to the one
described above as long as the strike price of the options is the same in the two strategies.
   The minimum payo¤ to the hedged carry trade, ht+1 , is negative. To see this property,

use the put-call-forward parity condition, (15), and equations (12) and (13) to write the
minimum payo¤s as follows:

                                                Pt (1 + rt )=Ft if Ft St ,
                               ht+1 =                                                              (16)
                                                Ct (1 + rt ) =Ft if Ft < St .

Since option prices are positive, ht+1 is negative.

   We summarize the realized payo¤s to the hedged carry trade as follows:

              H            ht+1                         if the option is in the money,
             zt+1 =
                           zt+1       ct (1 + rt )=Ft   if the option is out of the money.

The variable ct denotes the cost of the put or call option. Note that the option is in the

money in the peso state as well as in some non-peso states.


Using options to assess the e¤ect of peso problems Since the hedged carry trade is
a zero net-investment strategy, the payo¤, z H (! t+1 ), must satisfy:
                           Z
                (1    p)           M (! t+1 )z H (! t+1 ) dF N (! t+1 j! t ) + pM 0 h(! t ) = 0.
                               N



Taking expectations over all non-peso states we obtain:


                                    (1    p)E N (M z H ) + pM 0 E N (h) = 0.                       (17)


Using equation (17) to solve for pM 0 and replacing this term in equation (9), we obtain:

                                                            E N (M z)
                                            z 0 = E N (h)                .                         (18)
                                                            E N (M z H )



                                                         9
We can estimate the variables on the right-hand side of equation (18) and compute an
estimate of z 0 . In estimating z 0 we do not have to take a stand on the values of p or M 0 .

Given our estimate of z 0 and a value of p we can use equation (9) to estimate M 0 ,

                                                  (1   p)E N (M z)
                                          M0 =                     .                       (19)
                                                       p ( z0)

      There are two possible outcomes of these calculations. The …rst possible outcome is that
our estimate of z 0 is a large negative value, consistent with the conventional view about the
payo¤s to the carry trade in the peso state. The second possible outcome is that our estimate

of z 0 is a small negative value. In this case a peso event can still explain the average payo¤

to the carry trade but only if M 0 is large. So, in this case, the carry trade makes relatively

small losses in the peso event, but traders value those losses very highly.

      A natural question is whether the implied value of M 0 is empirically plausible. To answer

this question we consider an equity strategy whose payo¤ is also potentially a¤ected by the

peso event. Using hedged and unhedged versions of this strategy we obtain an alternative

estimate of M 0 . We then assess whether this estimate of M 0 is consistent with the one implied

by equation (19). The equity strategy involves borrowing one dollar at the Treasury-bill rate,

rt , and investing it in the S&P 100 index.4 We denote the ex-dividend price of the index

and the associated dividend yield by Vt and dt , respectively. The payo¤ to this strategy is

given by:
                                      xt+1 = Vt+1 =Vt + dt         (1 + rt ).

      Now consider the following hedged version of the equity strategy: borrow at the Treasury-

bill rate to invest in the S&P 100 index and buy at-the-money put options on the S&P 100
index. These put options compensate an investor for a fall in the S&P 100. It follows that,
any time the S&P 100 index falls, the payo¤ to the hedged equity strategy is the dividend

yield of the index minus the dollar interest rate and the price of the option, cxt (1 + rt ). By
assumption the stock index falls in the peso state as well as in some non-peso states. In
  4
      The choice of this index is driven by data considerations.



                                                       10
these states the payo¤ to the hedged stock strategy is dt             rt   cxt (1 + rt ). In summary, the
payo¤ to the hedged equity strategy net of the options cost is given by:

                                       xt+1 cxt (1 + rt )  if Vt+1 Vt ,
                         xH
                          t+1 =
                                       dt rt cxt (1 + rt ) if Vt+1 < Vt :

    The payo¤ to the unhedged equity strategy in the peso state is x0 . The payo¤s to the

unhedged and hedged equity strategies must satisfy:


                                  (1     p)E N (M x) + pM 0 x0 = 0:                                 (20)


                    (1    p)E N (M xH ) + pM 0 E N [d        r      cx (1 + r)] = 0.                (21)

Combining these two equations we obtain:

                                                                  E N (M x)
                           x0 = E N [d        r    cx (1 + r)]               .                      (22)
                                                                 E N (M xH )

                                          0   (1     p)E N (M x)
                                       M =                       .                                  (23)
                                                     p( x0 )
    Given estimates of E N (M x) and E N M xH              we can use equations (22) and (23) to

estimate M 0 and x0 . Given a value of p we then estimate x0 and M 0 . A test of the second

interpretation of the peso event is whether the value of M 0 that emerges from this procedure

is consistent with the value of M 0 implied by equation (19).

    The procedure just described assumes that a peso-based explanation of the positive av-

erage payo¤ to the carry trade is required. After describing the data we motivate this

assumption in Sections 4 and 5, at least in the context of linear asset pricing models. In
Section 6 we report the results of implementing the procedure described in this section.


3     Data

In this section we describe our data sources for spot and forward exchange rates and interest
rates. We also describe the options data that we use to analyze the importance of the peso
problem.


                                                    11
Spot and forward exchange rates Our data set on spot and forward exchange rates,
obtained from Datastream, covers the euro and the currencies of 20 countries: Australia,

Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Nether-
lands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK,
and the U.S.

   The data consist of daily observations for bid and ask spot exchange rates and one-month
forward exchange rates. We convert daily data into non-overlapping monthly observations
(see Appendix A for details).

   Our data span the period January 1976 to July 2009. However, the sample period varies

by currency (see Appendix A for details). Exchange rate quotes (bid, ask, and mid, de…ned

as the average of bid and ask) against the British pound (GBP) are available beginning as

early as 1976. Bid and ask exchange rate quotes against the U.S. dollar (USD) are only

available from January 1997 to July 2009. We obtain mid quotes over the longer sample

against the dollar by multiplying GBP/FCU quotes by USD/GBP quotes.


Interbank interest rates and covered interest parity We also collected data on in-

terest rates in the London interbank market from Datastream. These data are available

for 17 countries/currencies: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK,

the U.S. and the euro.
   The data consist of daily observations for bid and ask eurocurrency interest rates. We

convert daily data into non-overlapping monthly observations. Our data spans the period
January 1976 to July 2009, with the exact sample period varying by currency.
   To assess the quality of our data set we investigate whether covered-interest parity (CIP)

holds taking bid-ask spreads into account. We …nd that deviations from CIP are small and
rare. We provide details of our interest rate data and analysis of CIP in the online appendix
(www.duke.edu/~acb8/bekr_app.pdf).



                                             12
Option prices We use two options data sets. Our …rst data set is from the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME). These data consist of daily observations for the period January

1987 to April 2009 on the prices of put and call options against U.S. dollar futures for the
Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and the
British pound. Appendix B speci…es the exact period of availability for each currency. When

a futures contract and an option contract expire on the same date, an option on currency
futures is equivalent to an option on the spot exchange rate. This equivalence results from
the fact that the price of a futures contract coincides with the spot exchange rate at maturity.

In practice the expiration dates of the two contracts do not generally coincide in our data set.

In Appendix B we describe how to modify our hedging strategy to take this fact into account.

This modi…cation involves adjusting both the number of options purchased and their strike

price. Our modi…ed hedging strategy is exactly equivalent to the hedging strategy described

in Section 2 whenever interest rates are constant over the period between the expiration of

the option and the expiration of the futures contract.

   Since we compute carry-trade payo¤s at the monthly frequency, we use data on options

that are one month from maturity (see Appendix B for details). We work exclusively with

options expiring near the beginning of each month (two Fridays prior to the third Wednes-

day). We measure option prices using settlement prices for transactions that take place

exactly 30 days prior to the option’s expiration date. We measure the time-t forward, spot,
and option strike and settlement prices on the same day, and measure the time t + 1 futures

price on the option expiration date. To compute net payo¤s we multiply option prices by the
gross 30-day eurodollar interest rate obtained from the Federal Reserve Board. This 30-day
interest rate is matched to the maturity of the options in our data set.

   Our second options data set is from J.P. Morgan. These data consist of daily observations
of one-month at-the-money-forward implied volatility quotes and forward and spot exchange
rates for the following currencies: the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Danish

krone, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, the British pound, the New Zealand


                                              13
dollar, the Norwegian krone, and the Swedish krone. Our sample period is February 1995 to
July 2009. We convert the implied volatility quotes to option prices using the Black-Scholes

formula. Given the structure of this data set, we select monthly trades that mature on a
date near the end of the month and are initiated 30 days earlier. We select the last maturity
date which is a business day and for which the initiation date is a business day.


4     Payo¤s to the carry trade

In this section we study the properties of the payo¤s to the carry trade. First, we compute

the mean and variance of the payo¤ to the carry trade with and without transactions costs.

Second, we investigate whether the payo¤ distribution has fat tails. Third, we study the

covariance between the payo¤s to the carry trade and various risk factors using both time

series and panel data.

    We consider two versions of the carry trade. In the ‘carry trade without transaction

costs’ we assume that agents can buy and sell currency at the average of the bid and ask

rates. We compute St as the average of the bid (Stb ) and the ask (Sta ) spot exchange rates,


                                     St = Sta + Stb =2,


and Ft as the average of the bid (Ftb ) and the ask (Fta ) forward exchange rates,


                                     Ft = Fta + Ftb =2:


The ask (bid) exchange rate is the rate at which a participant in the interdealer market can

buy (sell) foreign currency from (to) a currency dealer.
    In the ‘carry trade with transaction costs’ we take bid-ask spreads into account when
deciding whether to buy or sell foreign currency forward and in calculating payo¤s. In this

case the number of FCUs sold forward, wt , is   given by:
                                 8
                                 < +1=Ftb          if Ftb =Sta > 1,
                            wt =      1=Fta        if Fta =Stb < 1,                      (24)
                                 :
                                    0              otherwise.

                                              14
The payo¤ to this strategy is:
                                           8
                                           < wt Ftb       a
                                                         St+1     if wt > 0,
                                  zt+1   =   wt Fta        b
                                                         St+1     if wt < 0,              (25)
                                           :
                                             0                    if wt = 0.

4.1       Characteristics of carry-trade payo¤s

We consider the carry-trade strategy for individual currencies as well as for portfolios of

currencies. For now we focus attention on the payo¤s to an equally-weighted portfolio of
carry-trade strategies.5 This portfolio is constructed by betting 1=nt U.S. dollars in each
individual currency carry trade. Here nt denotes the number of currencies in our sample

at time t. In the remainder of the paper, unless otherwise noted, we use the term ‘carry-

trade strategy’ to refer to the equally-weighted carry trade. Also, we report all statistics

on an annualized basis. Table 1 reports the mean, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio of

the monthly payo¤s to the carry trade, with and without transaction costs. We consider

two alternative home currencies, the British pound and the U.S. dollar. Using the British

pound as the home currency allows us to assess the importance of bid-ask spreads using a

much longer time series than would be the case if we used only the U.S. dollar as the home

currency.

      Consider the results when the British pound is the home currency. Ignoring transaction

costs, the Sharpe ratio of the equally-weighted carry-trade portfolio is 0:748. Taking bid-ask
spreads into account reduces the Sharpe ratio to 0:507. But the Sharpe ratio is statistically

di¤erent from zero with and without transaction costs. Next consider the results when the
dollar is the home currency. Ignoring transaction costs, the Sharpe ratio of the equally-
weighted carry-trade portfolio is 0:865. Taking bid-ask spreads into account reduces the

Sharpe ratio to 0:694. The impact of transaction costs is smaller when the dollar is the base
currency because bid-ask spreads are lower for the dollar than for the pound.
      Taken together, our results indicate that, while transaction costs are quantitatively im-

portant, they do not explain the pro…tability of the carry trade. For the remainder of this
  5
      In the online appendix we report results for individual currencies.

                                                       15
paper we abstract from transaction costs and work with spot and forward rates that are the
average of bid and ask rates.6 Given this decision we can work with the longer data set (from

January 1976 to July 2009) using the U.S. dollar as the home currency.
       Table 2 reports statistics for the payo¤s to the equally-weighted carry trade and summary
statistics for the individual-currency carry trades. We compute the latter by taking the

average of the statistics for the carry trade applied to each of the 20 currencies in our
sample. To put our results into perspective, we also report statistics for excess returns to
the value-weighted U.S. stock market. Two results emerge from this table. First, there are

large gains to diversi…cation. The average Sharpe ratio across currencies is 0:442, while the

Sharpe ratio for an equally-weighted portfolio of currencies is 0:911. This large di¤erence

between the Sharpe ratios is due to the fact that the standard deviation of the payo¤s is

much lower for the equally-weighted portfolio. Second, the Sharpe ratio of the carry trade

is substantially larger than that of the U.S. stock market (0:911 versus 0:373). While the

average excess return to the U.S. stock market is larger than the payo¤ to the carry trade

(0:058 versus 0:048), the returns to the U.S. stock market are much more volatile than the

payo¤s to the carry trade (0:156 versus 0:053).

       So far we have emphasized the mean and variance of the payo¤s to the carry trade. These

statistics are su¢ cient to characterize the distribution of the payo¤s only if this distribution

is normal. Table 2 reports skewness and excess kurtosis statistics, as well as the results
of the Jarque-Bera normality tests. It is evident that the distributions of both payo¤s are

leptokurtic, exhibiting fat tails.

4.2       The impact of the …nancial crisis on carry-trade payo¤s

Panel A of Figure 1 shows the cumulative payo¤s to investing one dollar in January 1976
in three di¤erent strategies. The …rst strategy involves investing in one-month Treasury

bills. The second strategy involves investing in a value-weighted index of the universe of
   6
   In an earlier version of this paper (Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski, and Rebelo (2006)) we present
a more comprehensive set of results for the carry trade payo¤s taking bid-ask spreads into account.



                                                   16
U.S. stocks in the CRSP database. In both strategies the monthly proceeds are reinvested.
The third strategy is the carry trade. Since this strategy involves zero net investment we

compute the cumulative payo¤s as follows. We initially deposit one U.S. dollar in a bank
account that yields the same rate of return as the Treasury bill rate. In the beginning of
every period we bet the balance of the bank account on the carry trade strategy. At the end

of the period, payo¤s to the carry trade are deposited into the bank account.
   Three features of Figure 1 are worth noting. First, the cumulative payo¤s to the carry
trade and stock market strategies are very similar. Second, the payo¤s to the carry trade

are much less volatile than those of the U.S. stock market. These two features account for

the Sharpe ratio of the carry-trade strategy being roughly 2:5 times higher than that of the

U.S. stock market. Third, in the recent …nancial crisis the carry trade strategy loses money,

but these losses are much smaller than those of the U.S. stock market. The U.S. stock

market cumulative return peaked at $44:32 in October 2007 and fell to a trough of $21:47

in February 2009, a decline of 51:6 percent. The carry trade portfolio cumulative return

peaked at $31:22 in July 2008 and fell to a trough of $27:87 in February 2009, a decline

of 10:7 percent. Both the cumulative payo¤s to the carry trade and the U.S. stock market

strategies have partially recovered from their trough values.

   The worst monthly payo¤s (i.e. the largest drawdowns) to the carry trade from February

1976 to July 2009 are:      8:9 percent (March 1991),       5:8 percent (October 1992), and        5:1
percent (June 1993). The three worst monthly payo¤s to the carry trade from July 2008

to July 2009 are:      4:2 percent (September 2008),        3:9 percent (August 2008), and         3:7
percent (January 2009).7 The three worst monthly payo¤s to the stock market strategy in
our sample are      23:0 (October 1987),      18:5 percent (October 2008), and          16:1 (August

1998). Note that the largest drawdowns of the carry trade strategy did not occur during
the recent …nancial crisis. In contrast, one of the three worst payo¤s to the stock market
strategy did occur during the recent …nancial crisis.
   7
     Because of data limitations we cannot compute the drawdowns on the carry trade strategy at a daily
frequency.


                                                  17
      It is worth emphasizing that, while there are some reasonably large negative payo¤s to
the carry trade in sample, the average payo¤ is still positive. We now turn to the question

of whether the payo¤s are correlated with traditional risk factors.

4.3       Risk factor analysis of carry-trade payo¤s

In this subsection we show that the covariances between the payo¤s to the carry trade
and traditional risk factors are not statistically di¤erent from zero. We do so using both
time-series and panel-data analysis. We consider data at both the monthly and quarterly

frequencies. When data on the risk factors are available at the monthly frequency, we de…ne

a 26     1 vector Rt containing the time-t nominal payo¤ to the carry-trade strategy and the

nominal excess returns of the 25 Fama-French (1993) portfolios of equities sorted by …rm

size and the ratio of book value to market value. When data on the risk factors are available

at the quarterly frequency, we de…ne a 26           1 vector Rt containing the time-t real quarterly

payo¤ to the carry-trade strategy and the 25 Fama-French (1993) portfolios.8 These payo¤s

or excess returns must satisfy:

                                          Et (Rt+1 mt+1 ) = 0,                                 (26)

where, when the data are monthly, mt+1 is the SDF that prices nominal USD-denominated

excess returns and, when the data are quarterly, mt+1 is the SDF that prices real USD-

denominated excess returns. We consider linear SDFs of the form:


                                       mt =     1    (ft       )0 b :                          (27)


Here      is a scalar, ft is a vector of risk factors,     = E(ft ), and b is a conformable vector.
To simplify our analysis we abstract from non-negativity constraints on mt (see Li, Xu and
Zhang (2010) for a discussion of the potential importance of this issue).

      It follows from equation (26) and the law of iterated expectations that:


                                             E (Rt mt ) = 0.                                   (28)
  8
      In Appendix C we show how we convert monthly payo¤s to real quarterly excess returns.


                                                    18
Equations (28) and (27) imply that:


                                         E(Rt ) =       ,


where


                                       = cov(Rt ; ft0 )Vf 1 ,                                   (29)

                                       = Vf b.


Here Vf is the covariance matrix of the factors,       is a measure of the systematic risk of the
payo¤s, and    is a vector of risk premia. Note that        is the population value of the regression

coe¢ cient of Rt on ft . Our time-series analysis focuses on estimating the betas of the carry

trade payo¤s for di¤erent candidate risk factors. Our panel analysis provides complementary

evidence on the importance of di¤erent risk factors by estimating alternative SDF models

using the moment condition (28). One of these models is the Fama-French (1993) model

that we later use to estimate M 0 .


Time-series risk-factor analysis We consider the following risk factors: the excess re-

turns to the value-weighted U.S. stock market, the Fama-French (1993) factors (the excess

return to the value-weighted U.S. stock market, the size premium (SMB), and the value

premium (HML)), real U.S. per capita consumption growth (nondurables and services), the

factors proposed by Yogo (2006) (the growth rate of per capita consumption of nondurables

and services, the growth rate of the per capita service ‡ow from the stock of consumer
durables, and the return to the value-weighted U.S. stock market), luxury sales growth

(obtained from Aït-Sahalia, Parker and Yogo (2004)), GDP growth, industrial production

growth, the Fed Funds Rate, the term premium (the yield spread between the 10 year Trea-
sury bond and the three month Treasury bill), the liquidity premium (the spread between

the three month eurodollar rate and the three month Treasury bill), the Pastor and Stam-

baugh (2003) liquidity measures, and three measures of volatility: the VIX, the VXO (the



                                              19
implied volatility of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 index options, respectively, calculated by the
Chicago Board Options Exchange) and the innovation to the VXO.

      To conserve space this paper reports results for the …rst four risk models listed above.
These results are representative of the results obtained using the broader list of factors (see
the online appendix). Table 3 reports the estimated regression coe¢ cients of the di¤erent

risk-factors. Panels A and B of Table 3 report results for factors that are available at a
monthly frequency and quarterly frequency, respectively. Our key …nding is that none of the
risk factors covaries signi…cantly with the payo¤s to the carry trade. Recall that the average

payo¤ to the carry trade is statistically di¤erent from zero (see Table 2). Factors that have

zero s clearly cannot account for these positive average payo¤s.


Panel risk-factor analysis We now discuss the results of estimating the parameters of

SDF models built using the monthly and quarterly risk factors detailed in Table 3. In

estimating the models we impose the null hypothesis that there are no peso events. We use

the estimated SDF models to generate model-predicated expected payo¤s to the carry-trade

strategy and the 25 Fama-French portfolios.9 We then study how well the model explains

the average payo¤ to the carry trade, as well as its overall ability to explain the cross-section

of average excess returns used in the estimation procedure.

      We estimate b and      by the generalized method of moments (GMM) using equation

(28) and the moment condition          = E(ft ). The …rst stage of the GMM procedure, which
uses the identity matrix to weight the GMM errors, is equivalent to the two-pass regression

method commonly associated with Fama and MacBeth (1973). Because, at this stage, we

are imposing the null of no peso events, all payo¤s should re‡ect covariance with risk factors,
so the …rst stage of the GMM procedure is equivalent to a cross-sectional regression with no

constant. The second stage of the GMM procedure uses an optimal weighting matrix. We

provide details of the GMM procedure in the online appendix.
  9
    The online appendix also reports results for a quarterly version of the Campbell and Cochrane (1999)
SDF. Verdelhan (2010) argues that open-economy models in which agents have Campbell-Cochrane (1999)
preferences can generate non-trivial deviations from UIP.


                                                  20
   It is evident from equations (27) and (28) that          = E(mt ) is not identi…ed. Fortunately,
the point estimate of b and inference about the model’s overidentifying restrictions are in-

variant to the value of , so we set     to one for convenience. It follows from equations (27)
and (28) that:
                                      cov (Rt ; mt )
                        E (Rt ) =                    = E Rt (ft        )0 b .                 (30)
                                        E (mt )
Given an estimate of b, the predicted mean excess return is the sample analogue of the right-
                                               ^ The actual mean excess return is the
hand side of equation (30), which we denote by R.
sample analogue of the left-hand side of equation (30), which we denote by R. We denote
   ~ the average across the elements of R. We evaluate di¤erent SDF models using the R2
by R

between the predicted and actual mean excess returns. This R2 measure is invariant to the

value of   and is given by:
                                             (R        ^ 0 (R
                                                       R)       ^
                                                                R)
                                 R2 = 1                            .
                                             (R        ~ 0 (R
                                                       R)       ~
                                                                R)
   For each monthly risk factor, or vector of factors, Table 4 reports estimates of b, the

R2 , and the value of Hansen’s (1982) J statistic used to test the overidentifying restrictions

implied by equation (28). In addition, we report the alpha of the carry trade portfolio, i.e.

the average payo¤ that is not priced by the risk factor.

   The results fall into two categories, depending on whether the model is rejected based

on the test of the overidentifying restrictions. For nine out of the 16 cases that we consider,

the model is rejected, and the alpha of the carry trade is statistically signi…cant. For the

other seven cases the model is not rejected. However, in these cases the b parameters are

estimated with enormous imprecision and the R2 is negative.

   To conserve space, here we report results for the four risk models for which we presented
estimated betas. We present the additional results in the online appendix. From Table 4,

Panel A we see that the CAPM and the Fama-French model are rejected at the one percent

level. In addition, the alpha of the carry trade portfolio is statistically signi…cant for these
models.

   We present results for the C-CAPM and the extended C-CAPM in Table 4, Panel B.

                                                  21
The b parameters of these models are estimated with enormous imprecision. Since there is
little information in the sample about the b parameters it is hard to statistically reject these

factor models. The R2 for both of these models is negative.
    We now provide an alternative perspective on the performance of the SDF models being
                           ^ the predictions of these models for E (Rt ) against R, the sample
considered. Figure 2 plots R,

average of Rt . The circles pertain to the Fama-French portfolios, and the star pertains to
the carry trade. It is clear that the three CAPM models (panels a, c and d) do a poor
job of explaining the excess returns to the Fama-French portfolios and the payo¤s to the

carry trade. Not surprisingly, the Fama-French model (panel b) does a reasonably good job

of pricing the excess returns to the Fama-French portfolios. However, the model greatly

understates the average payo¤s to the carry trade. The annualized average payo¤ to the

carry trade is 4:82 percent. The Fama-French model predicts that this average return should

equal 0:19 percent. The solid line through the star is a two-standard-error band for the

di¤erence between the data and model average payo¤, i.e. the pricing error. Clearly, we can

reject the hypothesis that the model accounts for the average payo¤s to the carry trade, i.e.

from the perspective of the model the carry trade has a positive alpha.

    In sum, this section provides evidence that it is di¢ cult to explain the positive average

payo¤ to the carry trade as compensation for exposure to conventional risk factors, at least

in sample.


5     Payo¤s to the hedged carry trade

In this section we analyze the empirical properties of the hedged carry trade. As discussed
in Section 3, our primary options data set from the CME covers six currencies and a shorter
sample period (February 1987 to April 2009) than our data set on forward contracts. For

comparability we also compute the payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade using the currencies
and sample period covered by the CME data set.
    We implement the hedged carry trade using strike prices that are close to ‘at the money’


                                              22
(see Appendix B for details). We choose these strike prices because most of the options
traded are actually close to being at the money (see the online appendix). Options that are

way out of the money tend to be sparsely traded and relatively expensive.10
       Table 5 reports the mean, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio of the monthly payo¤s
to the carry trade, the hedged carry trade, and the U.S. stock market. The average payo¤ to

the hedged carry trade is lower than that of the carry trade (1:58 versus 2:96 percent). Both
the average payo¤ and the Sharpe ratio of the hedged carry trade are statistically di¤erent
from zero.11

       Recall that we are abstracting from bid-ask spreads in calculating the payo¤s to the

hedged carry trade. In Section 4 we …nd that taking transaction costs into account reduces

the annualized average payo¤ to the unhedged carry trade executed with the U.S. dollar as

the home currency by 9 basis points on an annual basis. To assess the impact of transactions

costs on the hedged carry trade we compute average bid-ask spreads for puts and calls

against the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc. We base our

estimates on data from the CME that contains all transactions on currency puts and calls

for a single day (November 14, 2007). This data set contains records for 260 million contract

transactions. The average bid-ask spread in these data is 5:2 percent of the option price.12

This estimate is slightly higher than the point estimate of 4:4 percent obtained by Chong,

Ding, and Tan (2003) using the Bloomberg Financial Database for the period December
1995 to March 2000. To quantify the impact of transaction costs on the average payo¤s of

the hedged carry trade we increase the prices of the puts and calls used in our strategy by
  10
     See Jurek (2008) for a detailed analysis of the impact of hedging using out-of-the-money options. Jurek
…nds that the payo¤s to the carry trade hedged with these options is positive and highly statistically signif-
icant. See also Bhansali (2007) who considers hedging strategies in the course of investigating the relation
between implied exchange-rate volatility and the payo¤s to the carry trade.
  11
     The average payo¤s and the Sharpe ratios for both carry-trade strategies are higher when we exclude
the …nancial crisis period. Suppose that we compare a sample that stops on July 2008 to our sample period.
The average payo¤ to the unhedged carry trade falls from 3:48 percent to 2:96 percent, while the Sharpe
ratio falls from 0:586 to 0:476. The average payo¤ to the hedged carry trade falls from 1:80 percent to 1:58
percent, while the Sharpe ratio falls from 0:530 to 0:449.
  12
     The average bid-ask spreads for individual currencies are: Canadian dollar call 5:3 percent, put 4:4
percent, Euro call 4:3 percent, put 4:8 percent, Japanese yen call 5:3 percent, put 5:6 percent, Swiss franc
call 5:3 percent, put 6:4 percent, and British pound call 4:3 percent, and put 4:6 percent.


                                                     23
one half of the average bid-ask spread (2:6 percent). We …nd that the average payo¤ to the
hedged carry trade declines from 0:0158 to 0:0121 as a result of transaction costs. This result

suggests that transactions costs have a modest impact on the average payo¤s of the hedged
carry trade.
   The …rst panel of Figure 3 displays a 12-month moving average of the realized payo¤s for

the hedged and unhedged carry-trade strategies. The second panel displays a time series of
the realized Sharpe ratios over a 12-month moving window for both carry-trade strategies.
The payo¤s and Sharpe ratios of the two strategies are highly correlated. In this sense, the

hedged and unhedged carry trade payo¤s appear quite similar. For both strategies negative

payo¤s are relatively rare and positive payo¤s are not concentrated in a small number of

periods. In addition, there is no pronounced time trend in either the payo¤s or the Sharpe

ratios.

   There is an important dimension along which the payo¤s of the two carry-trade strategies

are quite di¤erent. As Figure 4 shows, the distribution of payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade

has a substantial left tail. Hedging eliminates most of the left tail. This property re‡ects

the fact that our version of the hedged carry trade uses options with strike prices that are

close to at the money.

   Panel B of Figure 1 shows the cumulative payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade, U.S. stocks

and Treasury bills as well as the cumulative payo¤ to the hedged carry trade, beginning
from a common initial date, December 1986. Two key features are worth noting. First, the

cumulative payo¤ to the hedged carry trade is somewhat lower than that of the unhedged
carry trade. This result re‡ects the cost of the options used in the hedged strategy and the
fact that there are no large negative payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade in sample. Second,

the hedged carry trade payo¤s are less volatile than those of the unhedged carry trade. This
result re‡ects the fact that the hedging strategy truncates a subset of the negative payo¤s
to the unhedged carry trade that occur in the sample.




                                              24
Time-series risk-factor analysis We now investigate whether the payo¤s to the hedged
carry trade are correlated with traditional risk measures. Table 6 reports our estimates of ,

the regression coe¢ cient of the carry-trade payo¤ on candidate risk factors, using the four
risk models we have been considering. Note that two factors display a signi…cant correlation
with the payo¤s to the hedged carry trade: the excess return to the value-weighted U.S.

stock market and the value premium. This …nding contrasts with our result that none of
the risk factors are correlated with the payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade.


Panel risk-factor analysis We now turn to a panel risk-factor analysis of the hedged

carry-trade payo¤s. We estimate the parameters of the same SDF models considered in

Section 4. Our estimation results are generated using a 26                    1 vector of time-t excess

returns to the hedged carry-trade strategy and the 25 Fama-French portfolios. We report

our results in Table 7. As before, our results fall into two categories, depending on whether

the model is rejected based on the test of the overidentifying restrictions. For the CAPM,

the Fama-French model, and the C-CAPM the model is rejected at the one percent level.

The extended C-CAPM model is not rejected because the b parameters are estimated with

great imprecision.

       Figure 5 displays the predictions of the CAPM, the C-CAPM, the extended C-CAPM

models, and the Fama-French model for E(Rt ) against the sample average of Rt . The …rst

three models do a very poor job at explaining the cross-sectional variation of excess returns.
Indeed, the cross-sectional R2 of these models is negative. The Fama-French model does a

reasonable job of explaining the average excess returns to the Fama-French portfolios and

the payo¤s to the hedged carry trade.13 Recall that the Fama-French model does a very
poor job at explaining the payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade (see Figure 2).

       In sum, this section, together with Section 4, indicates that it is di¢ cult to explain the
  13
    The use of options in the construction of the hedged carry-trade strategies can introduce non-linearities
in the portfolio payo¤s (see Glosten and Jagannathan (1994) and Broadie, Chernov and Johannes (2009)).
Following Glosten and Jaganathan (1994), we re-do the cross-sectional analysis allowing for quadratic terms
in the factors. Our results are una¤ected by this extension.



                                                     25
payo¤s to the unhedged and hedged carry trade as compensation for exposure to conventional
measures of risk. We now turn to the question of whether the payo¤s to the carry trade

re‡ect a peso problem.


6     Characterizing the nature of peso events

In this section we implement the strategy for assessing the importance of peso events dis-

cussed in Section 2. This section is organized as follows. In Subsection 6.1 we report
estimates of z 0 and M 0 =E N (M ). We compute these estimates using our benchmark CME

data set. In Subsection 6.2 we incorporate stock returns into our empirical analysis. We

assess the robustness of our results in Subsection 6.3 using data from J.P. Morgan. Finally,

in Subsection 6.4 we extend our analysis to allow for multiple peso events. Up to this point

we reported all statistics on an annualized basis. In this section we report monthly statistics

so that our calculations are easier to follow.

6.1    Benchmark estimates

Our estimates of z 0 and M 0 =E N (M ) are based on equations (18) and (19) which require

estimates of the risk-adjusted average payo¤s to the unhedged and hedged carry trade.

The estimates of these payo¤s reported in Sections 4 and 5 are generated under the null

hypothesis of no peso events. Since this null is inappropriate for the analysis in this section,

we re-estimate these payo¤s allowing for peso events. In practice this means allowing for a
constant in our linear SDF model which is based on the Fama-French factors (see the online

appendix).

    The …rst column of Table 8 reports our benchmark estimates which are based on the CME
data for the sample period 1987 to 2009. Note that the average payo¤s to the unhedged and

hedged carry trade are equal to 0:0025 and 0:0013, respectively. The mean minimum net

payo¤ to the hedged carry trade, E N (h), is equal to    0:0105.
    We use our estimated SDF model to generate a time series for Mt . We then use this time


                                                 26
series to estimate E N (M z) and E N (M z H ). The resulting point estimate of z 0 is   0:0216 with
a standard error of 0:0059. The implied two-standard-error band for z 0 is ( 0:033; 0:010).

The standard deviation of z in our sample is 0:018. So, our point estimate for z 0 is roughly
1:3 standard deviations below the estimated value of E N (z). The lower bound of the two-
standard-error band for z 0 ( 0:033) is only two standard deviations below the average payo¤

to the unhedged carry trade. Thus, we …nd little evidence to support the view that z 0 is a
very large negative value relative to the empirical distribution of payo¤s to the carry trade.
For robustness we calculated values of z 0 and M 0 under the assumption that the correlation

between the SDF and the hedged and unhedged carry trade payo¤s is zero in non-peso states.

As reported in Table 8 these estimates are similar to the results reported above. Viewed

overall, our results are consistent with Bates (1996b) who studies high-frequency data on

options prices for the Deutsche Mark and the Yen against the U.S. dollar over the period

1984 to 1992. He argues that peso events, de…ned as a large, negative, value of z 0 , cannot

account for the failure of UIP.

   Given an estimate of z 0 and a value of p we can estimate M 0 =E N (M ) using equation (19).

Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2010) provide a convenient benchmark value for

p. Using consumption data covering 24 countries and more than 100 years, these authors

estimate the annual probability of a disaster, thought of as a large drop in consumption, to be

0:017. Nakamura et al. (2010) argue that the frequency of disasters in the U.S. is statistically
consistent with their estimate of p. Motivated by their estimate we use a monthly value of

p equal to 0:0014. This value of p implies that a peso event occurs on average once every
700 months. Recall that our data cover a period of 268 months and we assume that there
are no peso events in sample. Our benchmark value of p implies that the probability of not

observing a peso event in a sample as long as ours is 68 percent. So, our assumption that a
peso event did not occur in our sample is quite plausible from a purely statistical point of
view.

   In conjunction with equation (19), our benchmark value of p yields an estimate of


                                                27
M 0 =E N (M ) equal to 92:9, with a standard error 47:5. This result supports interpreting
a peso event as primarily re‡ecting a high value of the SDF. That is, traders value losses

very highly in a peso state.
       There is clearly a great deal of uncertainty about the true value of p. But the basic result
that a peso event is characterized by a high value of M 0 =E N (M ) is robust for plausible values

of p. Higher values of p imply lower values of M 0 =E N (M ). Suppose, for example, that p is
equal to 1=268. In this case the probability of observing a sample of 268 months with no peso
events is roughly 37 percent. The implied value of M 0 =E N (M ) is roughly 35. Alternatively,

suppose we choose p = 0:0111, so that the probability of not observing a peso event in our

sample is only …ve percent. Even in this case the implied value of M 0 =E N (M ) equals roughly

12.

6.2       Incorporating stock-market data into our analysis

In this subsection we use stock market data to generate an independent estimate of M 0 .

We begin by contrasting the e¤ect of hedging in stock markets and in currency markets.

Hedging substantially reduces the excess return from investing in the stock market. As

Table 5 indicates, over the period February 1987–April 2009, the annualized rate of return

to the unhedged stock-market strategy is 6:87 percent versus               4:79 for the hedged stock-

market strategy. In sharp contrast, over the same sample period, the annualized payo¤ to

the unhedged carry trade is 2:96 percent versus 1:58 percent for the hedged carry trade.

       In section 2 we develop estimators of M 0 and x0 , the payo¤ to the stock market strategy
in a peso state. We base our estimators on equations (22) and (23). We use estimates of the
Fama-French (1993) model …t to the 25 Fama-French portfolios over the period February

1986–July 2009 to compute a time series for Mt . The options data we use to construct the
hedged equity strategy are available over this same time period. We use sample averages of

Mt xt and Mt xH              N           N    H
              t to estimate E (M x) and E (M x ), respectively.
                                                               14

  14
    The results reported in the text are based on a linear SDF. We …nd that the same implied values of x0
and M 0 =E N (M ) cannot be rejected when we use an SDF that includes quadratic terms in some or all of the


                                                    28
   Our estimate of x0 is      0:188. This value of x0 is roughly ten times larger in absolute value
than z 0 . By this metric the peso event has a larger impact on stock market payo¤s than on

carry trade payo¤s. Also x0 is more than four standard deviations away from our estimate
of E N (x). Using our benchmark value of p, our point estimate of M 0 =E N (M ) based on
stock returns is equal to 67:6. Recall that our estimate of M 0 =E N (M ) based on carry-trade

returns is 92:9. These two estimates are not statistically signi…cantly di¤erent from each
other. In this sense, the same value of M 0 =E N (M ) can account for the equity premium and
the observed average payo¤s to the carry trade.

   Taken together, the results of this subsection provide corroborating evidence for the view

that the hallmark of a peso event is a large rise in the value of the SDF. Sampling uncertainty

aside, this large rise is associated with large, negative stock market payo¤s and relatively

modest, negative carry-trade payo¤s.

6.3     Robustness analysis: J.P. Morgan data

To assess the robustness of our inference we begin by redoing our analysis using the six-

currency version of the J.P. Morgan data set. We report our results in Table 8. Our

estimates of E N (h), E N (M z) and E N (M z H ) imply an estimate of z 0 equal to    0:0386 with

a standard error of 0:0173. Table 8 also reports results based on the ten currency version of

the J.P. Morgan data set. These estimates imply an estimate for z 0 equal to         0:0438 with a

standard error of 0:0207. For both J.P. Morgan data sets, our estimate of z 0 is more negative

than for the CME data set and represents a payo¤ roughly three standard deviations below
the estimate of E N (z). Still, these payo¤s are not particularly large, and our estimates of

M 0 =E N (M ) remain large.

6.4     Robustness analysis: allowing for multiple-peso states

Under the assumption that there is a single peso state we …nd that the value of z 0 is a
relatively small negative number. Here we study the robustness of our results by allowing
Fama-French factors.

for a continuum of peso states. As above, we denote the set of peso states by                                        and
assume that the probability of the collection of peso states is p, both conditionally and

unconditionally. When the economy is in the peso state the value of ! t+1 is drawn from
an i.i.d distribution. We denote by F P (! t+1 ) the cumulative distribution of ! t+1 given that
           P
! t+1 2        . We let the functions M 0 (! t+1 ) and z 0 (! t+1 ) denote the values of the SDF and
                                                                    P
payo¤ to the carry trade for each ! t+1 2                               . The payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade must
satisfy:
                                                        Z
                                     N
                       (1       p)E (M z) + p                   M 0 (! t+1 )z 0 (! t+1 )dF P (! t+1 ) = 0.           (31)
                                                            P


Consider now the hedged carry trade strategy, where the hedging relies on at-the-money

options. Since these options are in the money in all peso states, it follows that:


                                     (1       p)E N (M z H ) + pE P (M 0 )E N (h) = 0                                (32)

                       R
where E P (M 0 ) =          P   M 0 (! t+1 )dF P (! t+1 ).

   Solving equation (32) for (1                    p)E N (M ) and substituting the result into equation (31)

we obtain:
                   Z
                                                                             E N (M z) P
                           M 0 (! t+1 )z 0 (! t+1 )dF P (! t+1 ) =                        E (M 0 )E N (h) .          (33)
                       P                                                     E N (M z H )
                       R
Letting E P (z 0 ) =        P   z 0 (! t+1 )dF P (! t+1 ) we can rewrite equation (33) as:

                       P         0   P    0       E N (M z) P
                                                      P         0       0
                    E (M )E (z ) + cov (M ; z ) = N      H
                                                           E (M 0 )E N (h) .                                         (34)
                                                 E (M z )

We assume that that there is a tendency for worse peso states (large values of M 0 ) to be
associated with worse payo¤s (more negative values of z 0 ) so that covP (M 0 ; z 0 )                         0. In this

case equation (34) implies that:

                                                                E N (M z) N
                                               E P (z 0 )                    E (h) .                                 (35)
                                                                E N (M z H )

   So, equation (35) implies that the expected value of z 0 across all peso states is greater

than or equal to the estimate of z 0 implied by equation (18). While there can be some
large negative values of z 0 , these values must have low probabilities. If we assume that

                                                                        30
covP (M 0 ; z 0 ) = 0, then equation (35) implies that the average value of z 0 is equal to that
implied by equation (18).

    We now consider the implications of this extension for the average value of the SDF
across peso states. Solving equation (32) for the average value of the SDF in the peso state
we obtain:
                                  P     0     1     p E N (M z H )
                                E (M ) =                           :                       (36)
                                                  p    E N (h)
Equation (19) is the analogue of equation (19). Furthermore, the two equations are equivalent
if equation (35) holds with equality.

    In sum, in the presence of multiple peso states our empirical results can be reinterpreted

as pertaining to the average value of payo¤s and the SDF across peso states.


7     Conclusion

Equally-weighted portfolios of carry-trade strategies generate large positive payo¤s and a

Sharpe ratio that is almost twice as large as the Sharpe ratio of the U.S. stock market. We

…nd that these payo¤s are not correlated with standard risk factors. Moreover, standard

SDF models do not explain the average payo¤ to the carry trade.

    We argue that the positive average payo¤ to the unhedged carry trade re‡ects peso event

risk. A peso event consists of a negative payo¤ to the carry trade and an associated value of

the SDF. We develop and implement a strategy to characterize the peso event. This strategy

uses the payo¤s to a version of the carry trade that employs currency options to protect
an investor from the downside risk associated with large, adverse movements in exchange
rates. By construction, this hedged carry trade strategy eliminates the large negative payo¤s

associated with peso events. Our key …nding is that a peso event is characterized by modest
negative payo¤s to the unhedged carry trade along with a large value of the SDF.
    It is important to emphasize that we base our results on an asset pricing framework that

is linear except for the peso state. So, we do not rule out the possibility that the payo¤s to
the carry trade can be explained using a non-linear SDF model.

                                              31
   Finally, we note that our analysis is based on unconditional covariances between risk
factors and carry trade payo¤s. It might be di¢ cult to detect non-zero covariances in samples

of our size when the conditional covariance is time varying. Suppose, for example, that the
covariance is zero in most states of nature but it is strongly negative in states that occur with
low probability. In this setting the sample size necessary to …nd a statistically signi…cant

covariance might be much greater than the size of our sample.

Notes: Payo¤s are measured in US dollars, per dollar bet. The payo¤ at time t to the US stock market is the
value-weighted excess return on all US stocks reported in Kenneth French’s database, divided by 1 + rt 1
(this normalizes the excess stock returns to the same size of bet as the carry-trade payo¤s). The carry-trade
portfolio is formed as the equally-weighted average of up to 20 individual currency carry trades against the
US dollar. The individual currencies are indicated in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity consistent GMM
standard errors are in parentheses, except for the Jarque-Bera statistic for which the p-value is reported in
parentheses. The mean payo¤ of the equally-weighted carry trade is not equal to the average mean payo¤ of
the individual-currency carry trades because the sample periods for which the currencies are available varies
(see Appendix A).

Notes: Part (A) of the table reports estimates of the equation zt = a + ft0 + t+1 , where zt is the monthly
nominal payo¤ of the equally-weighted carry-trade portfolio and ft is a scalar or vector of risk factors. The
CAPM factor is the excess return on the value-weighted US stock market (M kt Rf ), and the Fama-
French factors are the M kt Rf , SM B and HM L factors (available from Kenneth French’s database).
Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are in parentheses. Part (B) of the table reports estimates of the
equation Rte = a+ft0 + t+1 , where Rte is the quarterly real excess return of the equally-weighted carry-trade
portfolio and ft is a scalar or vector of risk factors. The C-CAPM factor is real per capita consumption
growth, the extended C-CAPM factors are real per capita consumption growth, real per capita durables
growth, and the return on the value-weighted US stock market. Details of the risk factors are provided in
the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: Part (A) of the table reports second stage GMM estimates of the SDF mt = 1 (ft              )0 b using the
moment conditions E(Rt mt ) = 0 and E(ft       ) = 0, where Rt is a 26 1 vector containing the nominal excess
returns of the Fama-French 25 value-weighted portfolios of US stocks sorted on size and the book-to-market
value ratio as well as the monthly nominal payo¤ of the equally-weighted carry-trade portfolio, and ft is a
scalar or vector of risk factors. Part (B) of the table uses the same moment conditions, but Rt is a 26 1
vector containing the real quarterly excess returns of the Fama-French 25 portfolios and the equally-weighted

Notes: Payo¤s are measured in US dollars, per dollar bet. The payo¤ at time t to the US stock market is the
value-weighted excess return on all US stocks reported in Kenneth French’s database, divided by 1 + rt 1 .
The carry-trade portfolio is formed as the equally-weighted average of up to six individual currency carry
trades against the US dollar. The individual currencies are the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the
Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, the British pound, and the euro. The hedged carry-trade portfolio combines
the forward market positions with an options contract that insures against losses from the forward position
(details are provided in the main text). Standard errors are in parentheses, except for the Jarque-Bera
statistic for which the p-value is reported in parentheses.

Notes: As in the text z and x denote, respectively, the unhedged payo¤s of the equally-weighted carry trade
and S&P 100 index portfolios. The hedged payo¤s of these portfolios are denoted, respectively, z H and
xH . The variables h and hx denote, respectively, denote the minimum payo¤s of the two hedged portfolios.
The payo¤s of the unhedged portfolios in the peso state are denoted, respectively, z 0 and x0 . The variable
M represents the stochastic discount factor, with M 0 denoting its payo¤ in the peso state. The operator
E N is the unconditional expectations operator that applies to non-peso states of the world. To compute
z H we use data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and J.P. Morgan. To compute xH we use
implied volatility data (VXO) corresponding to options on the level of the S&P 100 index. Our procedure for
constructing M and our data are described in the text and the the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity consistent
GMM standard errors are in parentheses.

Note: The …gure plots the cumulative returns of a trader who begins with 1 dollar in January
1976 (panel A) or January 1987 (panel B) and invests his accumulated earnings exclusively in
one of four strategies. For T-bills and US stocks we use the risk free rate and value-weighted
market return reported in Kenneth French’s database. For the carry trade strategies we
assume that the trader invests the initial dollar in T-bills and bets the future nominal value
of those T-bills in the carry trade. In each period all proceeds are deposited in the T-bill
account, and the future value of the T-bill account is bet on the carry trade. Details of the
strageties are provided in the text.

return is Ri = (1=T ) Tt=1 Rit . The blue dots correspond to Fama and French’s 25 portfolios
sorted on the basis of book-to-market value and …rm size. The black star represents the
carry-trade portfolio formed as the equally-weighted average of up to 20 individual currency
carry trades against the US dollar. The black vertical line extending above and below the
star is the actual expected return plus a two-standard error band for the pricing error of
the carry-trade portfolio. When it does not cross the 45 degree line, the pricing error is
statistically signi…cant at the 5 percent level. For models (a) and (b) the sample period is
1976M2–2009M7. For models (c) and (d) the sample period is 1976Q2–2009Q2. Expected
returns are annualized.

Note: Plot (a) shows the annualized average payo¤ from month t 11 to month t, in US
dollars, per dollar bet in the carry trade. Plot (b) shows the ratio of the annualized average
payo¤, to the annualized standard deviation of the payo¤, both being measured from month
t 11 to month t. The unhedged portfolio is the equally-weighted carry-trade portfolio,
described in the main text, formed by taking positions in the forward market currency-by-
currency. The hedged position is formed by combining the forward position on each currency
in the unhedged portfolio with a near-the-money option that insures against possible losses
from the forward position. The carry-trade portfolios are formed as the equally-weighted
averages of up to six individual currency carry trades against the US dollar.

Note: In each plot the red line indicates the histogram implied by a normal distribution with
the same mean and standard deviation as in the sampling distribution. The excess returns
are computed at the monthly frequency. The carry-trade portfolios are formed as the equally-
weighted average of up to six individual currency carry trades against the US dollar. The
unhedged portfolio is formed by taking positions in the forward market currency-by-currency.
The hedged position is formed by combining the forward position on each currency in the
unhedged portfolio with a near-the-money option that insures against possible losses from
the forward position.

hedged carry-trade portfolio formed as the equally-weighted average of up to six individual
currency carry trades against the US dollar. The hedged position is formed by combining
the forward position on each currency in the unhedged portfolio with a near-the-money op-
tion that insures against possible losses from the forward position. The black vertical line
extending above and below the star is the actual expected return plus a two-standard error
band for the pricing error of the carry-trade portfolio. When it does not cross the 45 degree
line the pricing error is statistically signi…cant at the 5 percent level. For models (a) and
(b) the sample period is 1987M2–2009M4. For models (c) and (d) the sample period is
1987Q1–2009Q1. Expected returns are annualized.

A: Spot and Forward Exchange Rate Data

We obtain our foreign exchange rate data from Datastream. They are originally sourced

by Datastream from the WM Company/Reuters. We use two data sets. The …rst data set
consists of spot exchange rates and one month forward exchange rates for twenty currencies
(Australian dollar, Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, Canadian dollar, Danish krone, euro,

French franc, German mark, Irish punt, Italian lira, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilder, New
Zealand dollar, Norwegian krone, Portuguese escudo, South African rand, Spanish peseta,
Swedish krona, Swiss franc, U.S. dollar) quoted against the British pound. The data series

begin in January 1976, with some exceptions (Ireland, April 1979; Japan, June 1978; euro,

December 1998; Australia, NZ and South Africa, December 1996) and end in July 2009,

with the exception of the euro legacy currencies (December 1998). The mnemonics for each

currency are indicated in the online appendix. With the exception of euro forward quotes,

each exchange rate is quoted as foreign currency units (FCUs) per British pound (GBP). To

obtain quotes in GBP/FCU we inverted the original quotes while swapping the bid and ask

prices (except for the Euro forward quotes).

   The second data set consists of spot exchange rates and one month forward exchange rates

for twenty currencies quoted against the U.S. dollar. The currencies are the same as above,

with the British pound replacing the U.S. dollar. The data series begin in December 1996,
with the exception of the euro (December 1998), and end in July 2009, with the exception of

the euro legacy currencies (December 1998). The mnemonics for each currency are indicated

in the online appendix. With the exception of the Irish punt, British pound, euro (forwards
only), Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar, each exchange rate is quoted as foreign

currency units (FCUs) per U.S. dollar (USD). To obtain USD/FCU quotes for the other

currencies we inverted the original quotes while swapping the bid and ask prices. We also
noticed a problem in the original Datastream data set: the bid and ask spot exchange rates

for the euro are reversed for all data available through 12/29/2006. We reversed the quotes

to obtain the correct bid and ask rates.

                                               48
   When we ignore bid-ask spreads we obtain a data set running from January 1976 to July
2009 with all currencies quoted against the U.S. dollar. We convert pound quotes to dollar

quotes by multiplying the GBP/FCU quotes by the USD/GBP quotes. The original data set
includes observations on all weekdays. In our analysis of the unhedged carry trade (Tables
1–4) we measure payo¤s using last business day of the month observations.


B: Options Data and Options-Based Strategies

CME Options Our …rst source of options data is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange

(CME). We obtained daily quotes for put and call options for six currencies against the

U.S. dollar. The currencies are available beginning on the following dates: Australian dollar

(January 1994), Canadian dollar (August 1986), euro (January 1999), Japanese yen (May

1986), Swiss franc (May 1985), British pound (January 1991). The data are available through

April 2009. Due to sparse coverage in the early part of the sample we begin our analysis no

earlier than January 1987.

   CME options are options against currency futures. The options themselves expire early

in each month (two Fridays prior to the third Wednesday in the month). The futures

against which the options are written expire on the Monday prior to the third Wednesday

(except for the Canadian dollar, for which expiry takes place on the Tuesday prior to the

third Wednesday) of March, June, September and December. When we construct hedged

positions using options, we use options written against the futures contract with the nearest
expiry date that is at least one month ahead. For example, if, in December, we take a bet

with a one month horizon the options we use are options on the March futures contract.

   We use the following notation for variables measured at time t: the spot exchange rate
(St ), the one month forward exchange rate (Ft ), the price of the futures contract with the

nearest expiry date that is at least one month ahead ( t ), the strike price on the options

contract, Kt , the settlement price of the call option (Ct ), and the settlement price of the put
option (Pt ). In the description that follows, the variables St , Ft ,   t,   and Kt are measured


                                               49
in USD/FCU, while the variables Ct and Pt are measured in USD per foreign currency unit
transacted. CME options contracts are quoted in the same units, and settlement prices on

the options are provided directly in the data set and do not have to be obtained by converting
implied volatilities.
       To be concrete about how we construct hedged and unhedged positions using the CME

data, consider the following example, where a trader takes a position in January 2006 that
expires in February 2006. In February 2006 the third Wednesday was February 15th. Two
Fridays prior to the third Wednesday was February 3rd. We therefore look for transactions

that were initiated on January 4th 2006 with expiry 30 days later on February 3rd 2006.15
Suppose we consider a currency for which Ft > St . In this case, a trader executing the

unhedged carry trade sells 1=Ft units of the foreign currency forward and obtains the payo¤

(Ft      St+1 )=Ft . In our example we measure St and Ft on January 4th and St+1 on February

3rd. We take the values of these variables from the Datastream data set described in Appen-

dix A.16 A trader executing the hedged carry trade takes the same position in the forward

market as the unhedged trader and in addition purchases Xt =Ft call options on the foreign

currency at strike price Kt . The hedged carry trade payo¤ gross of the cost of the option is,

therefore,
                                 Ft    St+1       Xt
                                              +      maxf   t+1    Kt ; 0g:
                                      Ft          Ft
To complete our description of the hedged carry trade we next specify the values of Xt and Kt .
We set Xt = (St =Ft ) where        is the number of months (unrounded) between the expiry date
of the option (February 3rd 2006) and the expiry date of the underlying future (March 13th

2006). We choose the call option with strike price, Kt , closest to Ft St1 . Our choices of Xt
and Kt are motivated by two considerations. Since the underlying asset is a futures contract,
  15
     The only exceptions to this rule for choosing dates is if date t or date t + 1 is a holiday with no data
available. In this case we shift both dates back one day at a time until the data are no longer missing.
  16
     Because we have CME options on the Australian dollar dating from 1994, and currency quotes on
the Australian dollar sources from WMR are not available on Datastream prior to the end of 1996, we
augment our forward and spot exchange rate data for Australia for the period 1994-1996 with data sourced
by Datastream from Barclay’s (BBAUDSP and BBAUD1F are the mnemonics for the spot rate and one
month forward rate).



                                                     50
not the currency spot rate, perfect hedging is not possible unless interest rates are constant
between date t and the expiry of the futures contract. However, if interest rates remained

constant over this period, covered interest rate parity would imply that (Ft =St ) St+1 =          t+1

and the hedged carry trade payo¤ gross of the cost of the option would be

                               Ft    St+1       1
                                            +      maxfSt+1       Xt Kt ; 0g:
                                    Ft          Ft

Thus, when the approximation of constant interest rates holds the hedge is perfect in the

sense that if the option is in the money the payo¤ does not depend on the realization of St+1 .
Second, if the strike price is exactly Kt = Ft St1           the payo¤ to the hedged carry trade gross

of the cost of the option is

              Ft    St+1       1                             1
                           +      maxfSt+1       St ; 0g =      maxfFt      St+1 ; Ft   St g;
                   Ft          Ft                            Ft

implying that the position in the option on the futures contract is equivalent to an option

on a spot contract whose strike price is St .

   We use one-month eurodollar deposit rates from the Federal Reserve Board interest rate

database (H.15) to compute the ex-post prices of the options.


J.P. Morgan Options Data Our second source of options data is J.P. Morgan. We

obtained daily one-month at-the-money implied volatility quotes, forward points, and spot

exchange rates, for ten currencies against the U.S. dollar. These data are available from
January 1995 until July 2009 for the following currencies: Australian dollar, Canadian dollar,

Danish krone, euro (beginning January 1999), Japanese yen, Swiss franc, British pound,
New Zealand dollar, Norwegian krone, and Swedish krone. In the J.P. Morgan data, “at-

the-money”one-month options are at the money forward.

   We convert the implied volatility quotes to option prices using the Garman and Kohlhagen
(1983) formula in combination with the forward points and spot exchange rate data contained

in the same data set. We use the last business day of the expiry month as t + 1, and 30 days

prior as date t to compute payo¤s. If this choice implies that date t is a Saturday, Sunday,

                                                    51
or otherwise missing observation in the data set, we shift both dates back one day at a time
until we have a valid pair of business day observations.


VXO Options Data We also use data on options on the S&P 100 index, referred to as

the VXO index. These data are available daily from Datastream (mnemomic CBOEVXO)
as implied volatilities. We use VXO data rather than VIX data because they are available
over a longer sample period (January 1986–July 2009), but the two series behave similarly

over the common sample. To generate our monthly data we look for a trade initiation date
within each month that is 30 days prior to the third Friday of the following month. We

translate implied volatilities to option prices using the Black-Scholes formula. The price of

a put option on the S&P 100 index is given by


                         Ptx = Vt [ ( D2t )=(1 + rt )          ( D1t )=(1 + t )]

                              1   2
                                            p                       p
where D1t = rt       t   +   24   t   =( t = 12), D2t = D1t        t=   12, Vt is the level of the S&P 100

index, the strike price of the option is Vt ,     t   is the dividend yield of the index (on a monthly

basis), rt is the one-month eurodollar rate (on a monthly basis), described above, and                   t

is the implied volatility quote (on an annual basis). We source daily S&P 100 index and

dividend yield data from the Global Financial Database (mnemonics OEX, SPY100W).

   We measure the unhedged excess return of the S&P 100 index using the total return on

the S&P 100 index minus the one-month eurodollar rate (on a monthly basis). We source
the total return from the Global Financial Database (mnemonic TRGSPOD). The hedged

excess return of the S&P 100 index is

                                      Vt+1 Vt      Dt                           Ptx
                             max              ;0 +            rt    (1 + rt )       :
                                         Vt        Vt                           Vt

Here Dt =Vt is the total return to the S&P 100 index minus the rate of change of the index.
That is, it is the component of the return due to the dividend.

C: Details of the Risk-Factor Analysis

Monthly Risk Factors When working with monthly data, we use nominal payo¤s to

strategies. The three Fama-French factors are from Kenneth French’s data library. The
three factors are Mkt-Rf (the market premium, which we also use to de…ne the CAPM
factor), SMB (the size premium) and HML (the book to market premium). Results for

additional monthly risk factors, and data sources, are described in the online appendix.


De…ning Quarterly Real Returns The monthly payo¤s to the carry trade, denoted

generically here as zt , were de…ned for trades where 1=Ft FCUs were either bought or sold

forward. This is equivalent to selling or buying one dollar. It is useful, instead, to normalize

the number of dollars sold or bought to 1 + rt 1 , where rt                         1   is the yield on a one-month

Treasury bill at the time when the currency bet is made. That is, we de…ne the monthly

excess return

                                                 Rte;m = (1 + rt 1 )zt :

To see that Rte;m can be interpreted as an excess return, consider the case where we buy

foreign currency forward, so: zt = St =Ft                   1    1. This value of zt implies that Rte;m =

(1 + rt 1 ) (St =Ft   1   1). Assuming that CIP (equation (6)) holds, Rte;m = (1 + rt 1 )St =St                        1

(1 + rt 1 ). So, when (1 + rt 1 )=Ft         1   FCUs are bought forward Rte;m is the equivalent to the

excess return, in dollars, from taking a long position in foreign T-bills.

    Let t index months, and let s = t=3 be the equivalent index for quarters. To convert the
monthly excess return to a quarterly excess return we de…ne:


                          Rse;q =   2
                                    j=0 (1   + rt    1 j   + Rte;mj )      2
                                                                           j=0 (1   + rt   1 j ):



This expression corresponds to the appropriate excess return because it implies that the agent
continuously re-invests in the carry trade strategy. In month t he bets his accumulated funds

from currency speculation times 1 + rt . To de…ne the quarterly real excess return in quarter

s, which we denote Rse , notice that this is simply Rse = Rse;q =(1 +                    s ),   where   s   is the in‡ation

                                                            53
rate between quarter s   1 and quarter s.
   To generate the returns we use the risk free rate data from Kenneth French’s data li-

brary: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html. These
data correspond to the one-month Treasury bill rate from Ibbotson and Associates (2006).
   We convert nominal returns to real returns using the in‡ation rate corresponding to the

de‡ator for consumption of nondurables and services found in the U.S. National Income and
Product Accounts and described below in more detail.
   When we work with currency options data, monthly payo¤s are realized early in each

month (the median day of the month is the 6th, with no payo¤s occurring before the 2nd of

the month, and no payo¤s occurring after the 9th of the month). Therefore, when de…ning

the returns for the …rst quarter we accumulate the monthly payo¤s (as described above) that

were realized early February, early March and early April. For the second, third and fourth

quarters returns are de…ned analogously.


Quarterly Risk Factors Real per-capita consumption growth (used for the C-CAPM

model) is from the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts which can be found at the

website of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): www.bea.gov. We de…ne real consump-

tion growth as the weighted average of the growth rates of nondurables consumption and

services consumption. The weights are the nominal shares of nondurables and services in

their sum. We compute the growth rate of the population using the series provided by the
BEA in the NIPA accounts. This series displays seasonal variation so we …rst pass it through

the Census X12 …lter available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov). The in-

‡ation series used in all our calculations is the weighted average of the in‡ation rates for
nondurables and services with the weights de…ned as above.

   The extended C-CAPM model adds two factors to the C-CAPM model: the real growth

rate of the per-capita service ‡ow from the stock of consumer durables, and the market return
(Mkt-Rf plus the risk free rate, Rf, in real terms). To estimate the former we proceeded as



                                             54
follows. Annual end-of-year real stocks of consumer durables are available from the U.S.
National Income and Product Accounts, as are quarterly data on purchases of durables by

consumers. Within each year we determine the depreciation rate that makes the quarterly
purchases consistent with the annual stocks, and use this rate to interpolate quarterly stocks
                     D                 D
using the identity: Kt+1 = CtD + (1        )KtD . Here KtD is the beginning of period t stock of
                                                         D
consumer durables, CtD is purchases of durables, and         is the depreciation rate. We assume
that the service ‡ow from durables is proportional to the stock of durables. We obtain Mkt
and Rf from Kenneth French’s data library. To obtain the quarterly real market return, we

proceed as described above for our currency strategies.

   Results for additional quarterly risk factors, and relevant data sources, are described in

the online appendix.
