We look at the effects of rainfall forecasts and realized rainfall on equilibrium agricultural wages
over the course of the agricultural production cycle. We show theoretically that a forecast of good
weather can lower wages in the planting stage, by lowering ex ante out-migration, and can exacerbate
the negative impact of adverse weather on harvest-stage wages. Using Indian household panel data
describing early-season migration and district-level planting- and harvest-stage wages over the period
2005-2010, we find results consistent with the model, indicating that rainfall forecasts improve labor
allocations on average but exacerbate wage volatility because they are imperfect.

       In (Rosenzweig and Udry 2013) we showed that investments by Indian farmers in the

July -August planting stage were significantly affected by the long-range kharif-season monsoon

rainfall forecast issued by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in late June. We also

found that the profitability of those investments were highly sensitive to the realization of rainfall

over the season, so that the forecasts enhanced average profits but contributed to profit volatility.

In this article we examine the effects of the forecast and rainfall on planting- and harvest-stage

agricultural wage rates. Prior research on the effects of rainfall on agricultural wage rates (e.g.

Jayachdran, 2006; Kaur, 20012) have examined the effects of rainfall on seasonal average wages

without attention to the timing of investment and labor-supply/migration decisions within the

season. This neglect is potentially important, as wages in the planting stage are relatively

unaffected by rainfall, but may be affected by rainfall forecasts, and the effects of rainfall

realizations on harvest-stage wage rates may be affected by whether or not the rainfall forecast

predicted good or bad weather for the season.

       To analyze the interactions between rainfall forecasts and weather realizations on wages

over the crop-cycle we first construct a simple general-equilibrium model of the agricultural

labor market which is attentive to the sequential nature of agricultural production. In the first

period prior to the full realization of rainfall, farmers choose agricultural inputs based on a

forecast of subsequent rainfall while landless households decide whether to remain in the village

or to out-migrate. We thus focus on the ex ante migration decision, in contrast to the prior

literature that has examined ex post labor supply (Kochar, 1997) and ex post migration responses

to rainfall shocks (Morten, 2013). In the second period of the model, the rainfall shock is realized

and farmers profit-maximize, hiring the labor that has remained in the village given their sunk

planting-stage investments. The model indicates that a positive rainfall forecast has an

ambiguous effect on planting-stage wages, depending on the strengths of investment and
                                                  2
migration responses, but can have a negative effect on harvest-stage wages if realized rainfall is

low.

        Based on the model, we estimate the effects of the IMD forecast on planting-stage

migration decisions using household panel data and the effects of the forecast and rainfall

realizations on planting- and harvest-stage wages using Indian district-level data on activity- and

month-specific wages and district-level monthly rainfall data covering the period 2005-2010. In

putting these data together, we uncover some of the pitfalls of using existing district-level wage

and rainfall data. The estimates indicate that a forecast of above-average rainfall leads to reduced

village out-migration, especially by men, and to a small but statistically significant overall

decline in planting-stage wages. The positive forecast, as indicated by the model, also

exacerbates the negative impact of adverse weather on harvest-stage wages. Thus, rainfall

forecasts appear to improve the allocation of labor across space when they are correct but also

increase inter-annual wage volatility as a result of being imperfect. We also show that the

National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), introduced in a limited set of districts in

2007 and then in all districts by 2010, helps moderate this volatility.

I. Rural Labor Markets with Forecasting

        In this section we provide a simple model of rural labor markets when informative

forecasts of seasonal weather are available. Consider a set of identical farmers. Farm output is

hs ( x0 , x1 ), where x0 is the quantity of planting stage labor, x1 is the quantity of harvest-stage labor

and s {g , b} is the weather realization. Planting-stage labor is chosen before s is realized;

harvest-stage labor after. We abstract from other inputs (and suppress the land input, since it is

                                                                             hb ( x0 , x1 ) hg ( x0 , x1 )
identical across farmers). Assume that hb ( x0 , x1 )  hg ( x0 , x1 ) and                                  for
                                                                                 xt             xt

t {0,1} . In addition, we assume that planting- and harvest-stage labor are complements and that
                                                       3
                                                             2 hg ( x0 , x1 )        2 hb ( x0 , x1 )
this complementarity increases is good weather                                                          0. A forecast
                                                                    x0x1               x0x1

F {G, B} is released before x0 is chosen. Farmers have access to savings/credit markets, but we

assume that there is no insurance available. After the forecast is made, farmers choose labor

inputs (x0, x1g, x1b) and saving/borrowing (a) to maximize

(1)                          u(c0 )  prob(b | F )u(c1b )  (1  prob(b | F ))u(c1g ).

Conditional on the forecast, the farmer’s budget constraints are

(2)                                            c0  Y  w0 ( F ) x0  a

(3)                                      c1s  hs ( x0 , x1 )  w1s ( F ) x1  ra,

where we have made the possible dependence of wages on the forecast explicit. Both output and

consumption are valued at price 1.

If state s is realized in period 1 after a forecast of F in period zero we have separability in the

choice of x1 which can be summarized by

(4)                           x1 ( x0 , s, w1s ( F ))  arg max hs ( x0 , x1 )  w1s ( F ) x1.
                                                           x1



The concavity of hs (.) implies that x1 ( x0 , s, w1s ) is decreasing in w1s. x1 ( x0 , g , w)  x1 ( x0 , b, w)

because the marginal product of harvest labor is higher in good weather. Complementarity

between planting- and harvest-stage labor implies x1 ( x0h , s, w)  x1 ( x0l , s, w), x0h  x0l , s {g , b}.

We have a mass 1 of identical farmers demanding labor, so the aggregate demand for harvest-

stage labor in the village is simply x1 ( x0 , s, w1s ( F )). Turning to the planting-stage, Rosenzweig

and Udry (2013) show that x0 (G, w0 , w1g , w1b )  x0 (B, w0 , w1g , w1b ). x0 is strictly declining in each

of the three wages. Farmers are identical, so aggregate planting-stage labor demand is simply

x0 ( F , w0 , w1g , w1b ).

                                                                4
        Labor is supplied by a mass 1 of landless laborers. After the forecast, the landless choose

to migrate out of the village or not ( m{0,1} ). If they choose to migrate, they earn the wage at

the place to which they migrate in both the planting and the harvest-stage; if they choose not to

migrate they supply 1 unit of labor to the village labor market. Landless choose m to maximize

(1) subject to

(5)                                  c0  Y  mwm  (1  m)w0 ( F )  a

(6)                                   c1s  mwm  (1  m)w1s ( F )  ra

where wm is the net wage from migration, which is known and the same in period 0 and any state

of period 1. The landless have a distribution of net wages from migration given by H ( wm ).

        There is a critical wm  ( F , w0 , w1g , w1b ) such that all landless with wm  wm migrate and

all others do not (in parallel to the cultivators, we are assuming that all landless have the same Y,

so we suppress the dependence of wm on Y).  is increasing in each of the wages. If in

equilibrium w1g  w1b then (G, w0 , w1g , w1b )  ( B, w0 , w1g , w1b ), because of the higher probability

of good weather occurring conditional on a forecast of good weather. Labor supply in the

planting-stage and in the good and bad states of the harvest-stage is identical and equal to

H ( wm ).

        The equilibrium set of wages w( F )  {w0 ( F ), w1g ( F ), w1b ( F )} satisfies

                                    H (( F , w ( F ))  x0 ( F , w ( F ))
(7)                                 H (( F , w ( F ))  x1 ( x0 , g , w1g ( F ))
                                    H (( F , w ( F ))  x1 ( x0 , b, w1b ( F ))




                                                         5
Equilibrium harvest-stage wages are always higher in good than bad weather: for F {G, B},

w1g ( F )  w1b ( F ). The complementarity between planting- and harvest-stage (which is stronger in

better weather) ensures that w1g (G)  w1b (G)  w1g ( B)  w1b ( B).

        The effect of the forecast on planting- and harvest-stage wages can be ambiguous

because of the potential migration response to a good vs. bad forecast. The reservation migration

wage increases with a forecast of good weather, because the local harvest-stage wage is higher in

good weather. Suppose that there is a small migration response to this change in the reservation

wage: H (( B, w( B)))  H ((G, w( B))). Then, because x0 (G, w)  x0 (B, w) and x1 ( x0 , s, w1s ) is

increasing in x0, equilibrium wages are higher with a forecast of good weather. But the reverse

can be true if the migration response to the forecast is sufficiently strong.

       The public works opportunities provided by NREGA are modelled as a wage floor. The

most interesting case is when equilibrium wages have the following pattern in the absence of

NREGA: w1g ( F )  w0 ( F )  w1b ( F ) . Now suppose NREGA introduces a wage floor ( w). Our

model implies that the effect of increasing w depends on when this floor binds. If it binds only in

the harvest-stage if the rainfall is poor, then, since out-migration declines as w increases and

planting-stage labor demand declines with harvest-stage wages, both the planting-stage wage and

the harvest-stage wage if there is good rainfall decline as NREGA comes into effect. In contrast,

if w is greater than the planting-stage wage, then the planting-stage wage increases with NREGA.

        In our empirical work, we examine four facets of this model. First, we examine the

migration response during the planting-stage to the IMD forecast. Second, we quantify the

equilibrium response of district-level planting-stage wages to the forecast. Third, we ask if the

effect of rainfall shocks on district-level harvest-stage wages varies according to the forecast. In



                                                    6
particular, is the negative effect of a bad rainfall shock particularly severe after a forecast of a

good monsoon? Finally, we look at the effect of NREGA on planting- and harvest-stage wages.

II. Data

       Analyzing stage-specific responses to forecasts and rainfall realizations requires data that

provide information by either agricultural production stages or by month. In Rosenzweig and

Udry (2013) we used the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics Village

Level Survey Data (ICRISAT VLS), which provides high frequency information on agricultural

inputs by date and operation for six villages over the period 2005-2011. These data also provide

information on the out-migration of household members included in the survey. For the purposes

here of studying ex ante out-migration, we focus on out-migration between July 1 and August 15

- after the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) June forecast but prior to the full realization

of rainfall. Unfortunately, the surveyors did not adhere to the monthly survey design in 2007 and

2008, so we have five years of migration information for the six villages. Out-migration in the

early months of the kharif (June-October) season is non-trivial for prime-age males. As seen in

the top panel of Table 1, almost 16% of males age 15-39 migrated in July-August. Female ex

ante migration is one-third that of male migration. The sample we use for the analysis of

migration includes all household members who participated in the labor market during the kharif

season. Because of the different migration rates of men and women, we also analyze the

determinants of migration separately by gender.

       For the empirical analysis of agricultural wage rates we also need wage rates by

operational stage. The Directorate of Economics and Statistics within the Indian Ministry of

Agriculture provides district-level daily agricultural wages by month, “activity,” and gender.

Three activities are relevant to our analysis - “sower” and “ploughman” for the planting stage

and “reaper and harvester” for the harvest stage. Our criteria for choosing wages was to select
                                                  7
male wages for sowers and ploughman in the month of June and July and male harvesters for

September and October for the years 2005-2010. Unfortunately, many of the districts had

missing information for these month and activity classifications. To maximize sample size, we

constructed June/July planting-stage wages by first selecting ploughmen wages in those months,

then if this category was missing selecting the wage rates of sowers and then if this category was

missing for the relevant months we used the wages for “other agricultural labor.” The majority of

wages for the planting-stage were for ploughmen. For the September/October harvest period, we

selected harvester/reaper wages as a priority and then the wages for other agricultural operations

in those months if wages were missing for that activity. 1 All wages are deflated by the CPI for

agricultural workers, using 2005 as the base year.

         The standard rainfall data set for monthly Indian district-level rainfall is the Terrestrial

Air Temperature and Precipitation compiled by Cort J. Wilmott and Kenji Matsuura, which

covers the period 1950-2010. While rainfall is provided for a 0.5 by 0.5 degree grid of points

across India, which can be matched to the centroid of each of over 600 Indian districts, the

source of the rainfall information comes from only 81 weather stations maintained by the

National Center for Atmospheric research (NCAR). The district-level rainfall data is thus

spatially interpolated. This interpolation introduces noise. To minimize the effects of

measurement error, we initially selected districts that were within 100 miles of the NCAR

weather stations (65 districts). However, because of the problem of missing wage information, to

increase the number of districts we added additional districts. The final data sets for analysis


1
 Jayachrandran (2006) and Kauer (2012) used the district-level male agricultural wage series assembled by Robert
E. Evenson and James W. McKinsey, Jr. from the same monthly wage data we use, and available in the World Bank
India Agricultural and Climate data. This series does not distinguish wages by stage of operation, providing only one
average wage observation per year that weights the months of June and August more heavily and also selects
ploughman as a priority activity. Because June operations and ploughing in particular cannot be affected by rainfall
over the full agricultural season, this wage series will be less sensitive to weather realizations than will a wage series
focusing on the harvest stage. In our analyses of planting-stage and harvest-stage wage rates we included dummy
variables indicating activity-type for the relevant months. These were not statistically significant.
                                                            8
consisted of 106 districts and 387 observations for planting-stage wages and 95 districts and 337

observations for harvest-stage wages.

         Using the rainfall data, we constructed for each district and year the ratio of actual

rainfall in the July-September period over its 60-year historic mean. We classify a bad rainfall

shock as one in which this measure is below one. We also appended to each observation the June

area- and year-specific IMD forecast and created a dummy variable for each district/year

indicating whether or not NREGA had been implemented in the district.

         The bottom panel of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for these data. As can be seen,

the average distance of an NCAR weather station to a district is over 82 miles. As a

consequence, in our wage specifications we examine whether the estimated rainfall shock effect

on harvest wages is attenuated by weather station distance. A key point of our analysis is that the

determinants of planting- and harvest-stage wages are not the same. In our data sets, while the

average levels of the harvest and planting-stage wages are similar, they display distinctly

different variability across years. This is indicated in Figure 1, which plots the ratio of harvest to

planting-stage wages by year for the districts and years in which both stage-specific wages are

available.

III. Results

         Table 2 reports village fixed-effect estimates of the effect of the IMD long-range forecast

on planting-season migration in the ICRISAT VLS survey. In column one, the point estimate

implies that a one standard deviation increase in forecasted rain leads to a 0.7 percentage point

reduction in migration, from a base level of 9 percent of the population. 2 Columns 2 and 3

provide estimates by gender. The responsiveness of migration to the forecast is stronger for men

than for women. A one standard deviation increase in forecasted rain leads to a decline of 1.1

  The effect of forecasted rain on migration is robust to controls for realized rainfall over the entire monsoon, or for
realized rain in June and July (not shown).

percentage points in male seasonal migration (from a base of 16 percent). Female seasonal

migration is insensitive to forecasted rain. Female seasonal migration is also not associated with

age, and female migration declines with education, in contrast to the pattern observed for men.

        In Table 3 we examine the relationships between the IMD forecast and realized rainfall

for equilibrium planting- and harvest-stage agricultural wages using the district-level data. The

district fixed effect estimates indicate that there is a small, but precisely-determined decline in

the planting-stage wage with increases in forecasted rainfall. A one standard deviation increase

in forecasted rainfall leads to a 2 percent decline in the planting-stage wage. This is consistent

with the migration response to forecasted rain that we observe in Table 2.

        The planting-stage wage also increases with rainfall shocks. A one standard deviation

increase in rainfall above the long-term average increases planting-stage wages by 5.6 percent.

However, this relationship declines in the distance between the district centroid and the nearest

NCAR weather station. The point estimates indicate that there is no correlation between the

rainfall shock and planting-stage wages for a district 100 miles from the nearest station. The

estimates also indicate that the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act

increased planting-stage wages by about 9.6 percent. Thus the NREGA wage is sufficiently high

that it binds in the planting-stage.

        The model suggests that harvest-stage wages are differentially sensitive to the IMD

forecast, depending upon realized rainfall. This is shown in column 2 of Table 3. On average,

harvest-stage wages move little with the IMD forecast, which is consistent with the migration

response to the forecast seen in Table 2. However, increases in forecasted rainfall lead to

declines in the harvest-stage wage if a bad rainfall shock is realized. This effect occurs both

because the forecast of more rainfall increases labor supply by reducing seasonal migration away



                                                10
from the village, and because the bad rainfall shock reduces harvest-stage labor demand by

cultivators.

As we observed with planting-stage wages, the estimated relationship between rainfall shocks

and harvest-stage wages declines with the distance between the district and the nearest NCAR

rainfall station. Implementation of NREGA is also associated with increases in harvest-stage

wages, particularly in years with bad rainfall shocks, as expected.

IV. Conclusion

        Informative rainfall forecasts permit welfare-improving anticipatory migration. This

complements the finding of Rosenzweig and Udry (2013) that forecasts improve average profits

of cultivators. The supply of and the demand for stage-specific agricultural labor depend on

forecasts of seasonal rainfall.        As a consequence, equilibrium stage-specific wages for

agricultural labor are sensitive to these forecasts. The response of harvest-stage wages to

forecasted rainfall, however, varies depending upon realized rainfall for the season. The

availability of rainfall forecasts creates a new risk for the landless, even if they have rainfall

insurance.3 A forecast of good rainfall (which reduces out-migration of labor from the village)

followed by a realization of adverse weather generates a sharper drop in the harvest-stage wage

than would be realized were no forecast available. Hence even if perfect (basis-risk free)

weather index insurance existed, there would still be a missing market for forecast insurance.

Our results indicate that NGEGA, in part, fills this function by raising harvest-stage wages

particularly in bad weather states.
