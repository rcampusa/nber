                                         ABSTRACT


       Foreign-owned establishments in the United States pay higher wages, on average, than

domestically-owned establishments, The foreign-ownedestablishments tend to be in higher-wage

industries and also to pay higher wages within industries. They tend to locate in lower-wage

states, but to pay more than domestically-owned finns within industries within states.

       Wages in general and wages in domestically-owned establishments tend to be higher in

states and industries in which foreign-owned establishments account for a larger proportion of

employment.

       Foreign-owned establishments that were new in 1990, mostly takeovers, had lower than

average wage levels in that year but larger increases between 1990 and 1991. Increases in sales

per worker and average wages were larger where employment growth was lower, possibly an

indication that lower-productivity, lower-wage workers were dropped by the new owners.

                                   Robert E. Lipsey*


        The purpose of this study is to compare compensation levels      in foreign—

owned establishments in the U.S. with those in domestically—owned

establishments and to try to understand the reasons for differences between

them.    In particular, it is to measure the role of differences between

foreign—owned and domestically—owned firms in the distribution of their

employment across industries, their geographical location within the United

States, and the skill levels of their employees, and, to the extent possible,

to assess the impact of inward investment on U.S. workers.

        It   has been known for some time     that foreign—owned firms in the United

States pay higher compensation per worker than domestically—owned firms.

However, until the Census—SEA and ELS—BEA matching of establishments, starting

with 1987, it was difficult to know whether the wage differences were genuine

or only      the consequence of disparities    in ways of reporting, in industry

definitions and in coverage between SEA reports for foreign affiliates and         81.5


or Census wage data for all U.S. establishments.

        The BEA—Census and BEA—BLS matches permit Census and SEA reporting

establishments to be tagged as foreign-owned (defined as a foreign equity

share of 10 per cent or more) or U.S.—owned. Establishments can thus be

compared for the two groups using common definitions of compensation,

industry, and establishment.

Industry Composition

         The   Census—flEA   match data CU.S. Department of Commerce, 1992), confirm

that, for all industries taken together, compensation in foreign—owned

establishments is higher than that in domestically-owned establishments by

over a quarter ($25,106 as compared with $19,416).            For manufacturing in the

                                                                  in
aggregate, foreign—owned establishments' wage levels exceed those

                                                      cent $27,983 compared
domestically—owned establishments by more than 10 per
                                                                                 is
with $24,886), and in non-manufacturing establishments the difference

 almost 30 per cent ($23,139 as compared with $17,966).            One can ask how much

 of these differences is "explained" by differences in the industry composition

                                                   flow   much difference would remain    if
 of foreign and domestically—owned plants.

 foreign—owned plants were in the same industries as domestically—owned plants
                                                                  in the same
 (domestic weights) or domestically—owned plants were distributed
                                                     —3—
way as foreign-owned plants (foreign weights), with no changes in their wage

levels?     An answer to that question is given by Table 1.                     For both

manufacturing and non—manufacturing industries, about half of the aggregate

differences in compensation per worker mentioned abo'e can be accounted for by

industry distribution. There remain some residual margins of higher pay for

employees of foreign—owned !5tab1i5temt5 within industries, amounting to 4 to

S per cent in manufacturing and 12 to 18 per cent in nonmanufacturing,                        the

precise amount depending on the weights used.

      The industry—mix effect can be measured in another way by asking how

average wages would compare if foreign and domestic plants paid the same

average wagea in each industry, at the rates actually paid in domestic plants,

but differed only in industry composition in the way that they do.             The effect

of industry composition is given directly in Table 2.           In both groups of


industries, the industry composition of employment led to higher pay in

foreign—owned plants,   by margins of about 7 per cent in both manufacturing and

non—manufacturing. However, foreign affiliates were much more concentrated in

the relatively high—wage manufacturing sector than were domestically—owned

firms (41 per cent as against 21 per cent).           That difference added another     7


per cent or so to the aggregate wage differential.           Thus,   this calculation

suggests that half of the industry—mix effect reflected differences in
                                            —5—
compensation within manufacturing and nonmanufacturing and half

the greater concentration of foreign affiliates       in manufacturing,    a fairly


high-wage sector.

        While the Census data do not include occupation, they do separate, at

the one—digit industry level, administrative and auxiliary establishments from

operating establishments.       Employees in administrative and auxiliary

estabLishments earned much more than those in operating establishments, about

$38,000 in manufacturing and $34,000 in non—manufacturing, but employees in

foreign and domestic units earned almost identical compensation.           However,

these high—paid, presumably high—skill, employees were a much larger component

of employment in foreign—owned establishments.        They accounted for over    11 per

cent of employment   in foreign and less than 7 per cent in domestic

manufacturing and over 3 per cent and about 1 1/2 per cent in foreign—owned

and domestically—owned nonnanufacturing firms respectively.         Although their

numbers were not large, excluding employees in administrative and auxiliary

establishments from the comparison raises the proportion of the compensation

difference attributed to industry mix, especially in manufacturing, from

something over 4 to over    5   per cent.

        The evidence up to this point,      if we interpret compensation

differentials within two digit industries as representing skill, suggests that

the foreign affiliate industry mix is biased toward higher than average skill,

including more administrative and auxiliary operations, and also toward higher

skill   levels within industries.     (Some of that within—industry difference

could turn into between—industry differences at a finer level of industry

detail, such as the three—digit SIC.)

        An analysis of differences between foreign—owned and domestically—owned
                                       —6—
plants at a much finer level of industry detail, was performed for

manufacturing plants in 1990 in Howenstine and Zeile (1994).        The analysis not

only used a finer level of detail, but also added information from the Census

Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufactures that permitted a comparison of hourly,

rather than annual, compensation, and the addition of detailed information on

scale of plants.     Tm addition, the definition of compensation was broader,

including not only payroll per employee but also employee benefits, not

available in 198?.

      Given the added infon%ation, Howenetine and Zeile concluded that there

was no effect of foreign ownership per    Se, on hourly earnings.    In a

regression across 312 industries with observations for foreign- and

domestically—owned plants in each, the dummy variable for foreign ownership

had a negative, but insignificant coefficient.     Physical capital intensity had
no significant influence and the only significant variable was plant scale,

which has been found to be positively associated with wage levels of

production workers in studies of domestic manufacturing.     Foreign—owned

manufacturing plants in the United States were, on average, much larger than

American—owned plants, because there are very few really small foreign

plants.'   The ratio of foraign to domestic plant size   in an industry, as

measured by value added per establishment, was strongly correlated with the

industry's foreign/domestic wage ratio.    When industries were arrayed by

relative wage levels, foreign—owned plants were larger than
                                                            domestically—owned

plants even in the industries in which foreign plant compensation levels were

lower than domestic, as can be seen in the following table:

It seems apparent that        the typical distribution   of domestically-owned plants


in   an industry has   a   long tail of small plants that have no counterparts among

the foreign—owned plants.

        In the aggregate, the more broadly defined manufacturing compensation
                                                    in domestically—owned
per worker in 1990 was about 16 per cent above that
                                                  30 per cent of the
plants (Howenstine and zeile, 1994, p. 45). About

difference was attributable to within—industry differences, about 60 per cent
                                                                         and
to industry mix (and the rest to the interaction between within—industry

between—industry differences).         That compares with a 12,4 per cent difference

                                                                       is
for the narrower measure of compensation in 1987, of which 50 per cent

                                                                            in
attributable to industry mix and 36 per cent to within industry differences
                                                                         in the
Table 2.    Thus the greater detail and the broader compensation measure

Ilavenstine—Zeile study do not seem to have strongly affected the results,

                                           more of the difference between
although they may have identified somewhat
                                                                 fron industry

     While we have,    for   the most part, relied on industry, rather than

individual firm, data because of the confidentiality of the latter, we do have

some information from a tabulation by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of

individual manufacturing affiliates for 1990, described in Table 4.

The average differences are somewhat larger than those in Table 1, reflecting

partly the skewness of the distribution of individual firm ratios.            The

exclusion of outliers tends to reduce the averages, and the median ratios show

foreign—owned establishments with a margin over domestic establishments of

only 2 per cent in payroll per employee.

     One way of describing the difference        in industry composition of

empLoyment by different countries is to list some of the major peculiarities

of each country's affiliate employment distribution.        Table   S   lists some of

the major differences between each country's affiliate employment and that of

U.S. domestic firms,

     While there are differences among the countries, especially in the

degree of concentration in each industry,     there is also a considerable degree
                                       —9—
of consistency.    Foreign shares in employment tend to be high relative to u.s.

domestic shares im administrative and auxiliary activities in manufacturing,

and in chemicals, and machinery among manufacturing industries; these are

industries in which U.S. direct investment abroad tends to be concentrated.

Foreign shares tend to be lower than domestic shares in trade other than

whoLesale trade in durables, in eating and drinking places, and in health and

social services; these are fields in which   11.5.   direct investment abroad is

also small.

      One interpretation of this evidence is that the propensity to produce

outside the home country is considerably influenced by the characteristics cf

particular industries as well as, possibly, by the characteristics of

particular countries or of their firms.    Another possible interpretation, that

wouLd have to be checked over a broad set of countries, is that      a   country's

comparative advantages that attract inward direct investment are correlated

with the comparative advantages of the country's firms that determine the

industry composition of its outward direct investment.

      The results to this point can be summarized by the statement that

foreign-owned firms in the United States pay higher compensation overall than

IJ.5.—owned   firms and that approximately half of that difference can be

ascribed to the fact that foreign—owned firms tend to be more concentrated in

higher-paid, presumably higher—skill, industries and in administrative and

auxiliary activities, also highly—paid.    The compensation differentials within

manufacturing, much smaller to begin with than those outside of manufacturing,

are associated with the larger scale of foreign manufacturing plants; foreign

and domestic nanufacturing plants of the    earns   size pay about the same wages.

Location   of Foreign Affiliates

      It is conceivable that differences in compensation rates could reflect

the geographical location of foreign affiliates.         If, for example, foreign

firms were more likely to be located in high—wage states within any given

                                                       on average even though
industry, they might pay higher wages in each industry

within each state they paid exactly the same amount as domestically-owned

firms and therefore were presumably hiring an equally skilled labor force.          Or

location in high—wage states might offset and obscure a tendency to hire less

skilled workers.    Thus, ignoring the location of foreign affiliatee might

mislead an observer into mistaking location effects for differences in the

average skills employed by foreign affiliates or the prices they pay for any

given skills.    There would be no such problem if labor markets were completely

                                                                but that would
integrated and perfectly competitive across states and regions,

be a strong assumption to make.

      To remove possible location effects, we have calculated ratios of

affiliate to domestic firm compensation per worker at the two—digit industry

level in each state, and then weighted these ratios by the state x industry

                                                                          That

                                                                        a
procedure can be interpreted as assuming, in effect, that each state is

competitive labor market.    these weighted wage ratios are shown in Table 6.

                                                                 individual
      Making the comparisons for the country as a whole from the

state by industry data does not change the results greatly.         Foreign firms pay

six or seven per cent more than domestic firms in manufacturing, as compared

with four or five per cent in Table 1, where no account was taken of the

 geographical location of establishments.         And they pay 12 to 15 per cent more

 in nonmamufacturing industries.   The   lower differential in Table 1 than in

Table 6 for manufacturing suggests that there was more of a tendency for

foreign firms than for U.S. firms to choose locations in lower—wage states

within each industry.   Ignoring location nay therefore result in some

understatement of the degree to which foreign affiliates pay higher

compensation to workers than domestic firms.

      Any conclusions from the state data must be taken cautiously because the

advantage of including location as a variable comes with some offsetting

disadvantages.   In particular, the state by state data are suppressed to a

much larger degree than the national data.      The result is that the industry

classification is coarsened, with many "all other" groups formed, not all

particularly homogeneous.   It would, therefore, be unwarranted to assume that

the geographical breakdown necessarily provides a closer match between the

foreign—owned and domestically—owned establishments being compared.

      Even if the geographical breakdown did not show results substantially

different from those using industry aggregates, it could show differences

among states or regions in the relation of foreign affiliate to domestic firm
                                       —   13 —


wages.     These might indicate that the entry of foreign firms had different

impacts on wages in different states or regions.

         The wage differences within manufacturing industries   for states with the


highest and lowest differentials, using affiliate industry weights, are shown

in Table 7.     There does seem to be some pattern to the geographical

differentials.     Five of the states in which the differentials were largest

were in the Southeast, a relatively low—wage region.      On the other hand, among

the states in which foreign firms paid lower compensation than domestic firms,

three were in the industrial Midwest and three in New England.

         The ranking of states by non-manufacturing wage differentials does not

show any obvious logic (Table 8).     The   range of the ratios is wider than for

the manufacturing industries, possibly a sign of a poorer match between

foreign—owned and domestically—owned establishments because of suppressions in

the data.     Another hint that mismatching may be a problem is the fact that

four of the ten states with the lowest differentials in nonmanufacturing

sectors, and in fact lower wages in foreign firms,     were among the ten with the

largest differentials in favor of workers in foreign firms within

manufacturing industries.

         One might suppose that the relatively high foreign manufacturing wages

in Southern states and low wages in foreign establishments in Northern states

might be a reflection of the avoidance of union organization by foreign firms.

The data are far from perfectly comparable, but what information we have on

unionization rates indicates that the rates in foreign firms in manufacturing

and   in goods production in general are almost identical to the average U.S.

level (Table 9).     outside of the manufacturing sector, unionization seems to

be considerably more prevalent in foreign—owned firms than in the U.S. private

sector, and that is also the case for all private industries conbined.

        If    the entry of foreign firms has    any effect on U.S. labor markets it

need not be confined to the direct enployment by the foreign firns.            It is


conceivable that the impact is felt in a rise in wages paid by both foreign-

owned and domestically—owned firms because the demand for labor in that

                                                                    if any,
industry in that state has risen, without any effect on the margin,

between wages in foreign—owned and domestic plants.

        flow   one should measure the foreign firm presence depends on one's views

as to   the integration or separation    of labor narkets.     If   one believed that

firms compete for labor only with other firms of the sane size in the same

                                                                      and the

domestic plant wage or the average          plant wage should be calculated at that

level.     If it is assumed that establishments of different sizes compete with

each other for labor within an industry and state, the shares and wage levels

should be calculated for industries within states, disregarding establishment

size.     That is the assumption implied by equation 1.              An alternative would be

that establishments in one industry compete for labor with those in other

industries, an assumption that would imply measuring foreign employment shares

and wage levels by state or locality, disregarding industry.

         In equation 1     the dependent variable       is   the average compensation in

docestically—owned manufacturing plants in an industry in a state.                  The two

independent variables are the average wage in the state, as a proxy for

regional or state differences in costs, and the share of foreign—owned

establishments in employment in an industry in a state.

The positive coefficient for the
                                 foreign share suggests that, given the

general level of wages in a state,          the presence of foreign—owned

establishments in an industry raises the average wage in domestic
                                                                  plants in
that industry.       However, another plausible explanation is that a high wage for

an industry in a state simply represents a
                                           higher than average skill level in
that industry and that foreign plants are attracted to

      The meaning    of     the state wage variables         is somewhat ambiguous.           The

average state wage is not purely a geographical influence because it reflects

the industry composition of employment in the state and, possibly, the foreign

firm presence     in that state.

      To eliminate this ambiguity we calculate a state wage index that is an

average across industries of the ratios of the state donestic plant wage in

industry   i   to the national domestic plant wage in industry                 i,   weighted by

national employment in each industry.              We also calculate an industry wage

index that is an average across states of the ratios of the industry domestic

plant wage in state        s•   to the national domestic industry plant wage, weighted

by manufacturing employment in each state.                 Equation    2   explains the Level of

wages in an industry in a state by these adjusted state and industry

influences on wage levels and the importance of foreign—owned establishments.

       This equation suggests that, given the relationship of state s wages to

national averages and of industry i wages to industry averages, a level of

foreign participation higher by 10 percentage points is associated with a wage

rate higher by about $3,400.

the influence on the average wage of both the higher wages in foreign—owned

plants and the spillover of these to domestically—owned plants.

        For the most   part, the introduction of the geographical dimension alters

the explanation of the differential         in compensation between foreign—owned               and

domestically—owned plants only slightly.             In most comparisons, the industry

and state distribution of employment by each group explains about half the

differential, marginally less than the industry distribution alone,                      That

difference implies that the geographical distribution somewhat offsets the

industry distribution's effect on wages, at least in manufacturing.                      The

impact of foreign participation may be linked to establishment size but that

link,   if it exists, does not affect the finding that higher foreign firms'

shares in employment are associated with higher wages in domestically—owned

establishments and in all establishments in an area in an industry.



Employee skills

        One possible reason for differences            in average compensation between

                                                                    within
foreign—owned and domestically—owned establishments, both among and

industries, is that skill levels of employees may be higher in one or the

other set of establishments.        Unfortunately, data on employee skills are hard

to come by, but a match of BEA ownership records with ELS data on broad

                                                                         of

skill   levels between foreign—owned and domestically—owned establishments

within the manufacturing sector.        The analysis of the data by the ELS (1993)

concluded that there were no major differences within industries but large

differences among industries and between foreign establishments as a group and

establishments of different countries' firms in the distribution of

occupations, resulting from differences in industrial distribution.

        The shares   of   two high—skill groups   in total employment were as follows

for manufacturing industry as       a whole (Table     10).

Foreign—owned establishments used about the same proportion of managerial and

administrative workers as domestically—owned establishments and a somewhat

higher proportion of professional and technical workers.

        these proportions reflect their use of each type of worker in each

industry and the industry distribution of their employment.         Within industries

foreign establishments employed fewer managerial and administrative workers

relative to their total labor forces than did the domestic firms, by between

one would expect from the fact that the headquarters operations for the

foreign—owned firms are outside the United States.                 However, the distribution

of total employment in foreign—owned firms was biased toward industries using

higher proportions of managerial and administrative employees.                That can be

seen by asking what the share of such employees would be if foreign firms used

them in the same proportion in each industry as domestic firms did.                The share
in   the foreign firms would then have been 6.94 per cent              as compared with 6.35

per cent in domestic firms, a difference of about 9 per cent.                 Thus the

industry mix effect just about offsets the tendency of the foreign firms to

use relatively fewer managerial and administrative employees within each

industry.

        A similar analysis can   be   made   of the share of professional and

technical workers.    Weighting the ratios for each industry by either the

foreign— or the domestic industry distribution of employment we find that

foreign—owned establishments use a higher proportion of professional and

technical workers than domestically—owned establishments, by a margin of

almost 10 per cent (Table 12).        In addition,         the foreign—owned establishments

are much more concentrated in industries that use more of such workers. if

foreign and domestically—owned firms used identical proportions of

firms),   the share of such workers would have been        14 per cent in   the foreign

firms as compared with about 12.5 per cent in domestically—owned firms, or a

12 per cent higher proportion in the foreign firms.           Thus, with rsspect to

professional and technical employees, the overall share in foreign—owned firms

was higher both because foreign firms used more of such workers in each

industry and because foreign—owned firms tended to be more concentrated in

industries characterized by greater use of professional and technical workers.

      We can make a rough judgment as to the contribution of the distribution

among these broad skill categories to the compensation differences in

manufacturing reported in the BEA—Census match by weighting the national

average wages for each category of employees by the employment distributions

of foreign—owned and domestically—owned establishments.           Unfortunately, there

are several defects to the procedure.       One is that the earnings of the seven

categories are reported as medians for male and female employees separately,

and for a more detailed breakdown of occupations, and          we have calculated

averages for the seven categories from these medians, a process that probably

understates the arithmetic mean skill differentials that would be appropriate.

A second problem   is that the median incomes are for money income only.            The
                                        —   23 —

estimated averages   for the seven groups, given in Table 13, show a wide range

of average incomes, with that of the highest group four times those of the

lowest occupational groups, even though we have probably underestimated the

range because of the use of medians rather than arithmetic means as our basic

data, and also because the income data include money incone only.           If higher—

paid occupational groups also received more non—money compensation and fringe

benefits relative to their wages, the use of money income would understate the

differences among occupations in total compensation.

        A third difficulty arises   in using these BLS occupational distributions

to explain BEA—Census compensation levels.          The classification of

establishments into industries by the       BL.S   does not match that of the Census

data, even at the two—digit SIC level, as can be seen from a comparison of the

data in the two sources.    That means that the occupational distribution

applies to a set of firms somewhat different from those in the compensation

data.    The differences, by two—digit      SIC, are shown in Table 14.

        Among the larger industries (with 40,000 or more employees), the

greatest discrepancy was 27 per cent, for SIC 28, Chemicals and Allied

Product9.    Except for Instruments and Related Products (13 per cent), the

others were all below 10 per cent.       The calculations below using the SLS

occupational distributions are based on the assumption that the occupational

distribution in the DLS data is a good representation of that in the census

data despite these discrepancies.

        Applying the average U.S. money income levels to the occupational

distributions by industry, we can account for only a small part of the 10 per

cent differential in compensation between foreign—owned and domestically—owned

manufacturing establishments.       The predicted wage ratios     for manufacturing as

      For manufacturing   as   a whole, the combination     of the industry mix and

the occupational mix within industries accounts       for only a    one per cent margin

of foreign over domestic plant compensation, out of the more than 10 per cent

overall difference mentioned earlier.        Most of the differences for individual

manufacturing industries explained by occupational group are small: out of 18

industries, nine are less than one per cent and another six are less than two

per cent.    The main exceptions are three industries in which the occupational

group distribution pointed to lower wages in foreign—owned establishments, as

follows:

The occupational distribution explained part of the difference in two

industries with lower compensation in foreign—owned plants, but in one case

pointed in the wrong direction, leaving even more to be explained by some

missing factor than was suggested by the actual wage difference.

      The predicted margins in Table 15 are a combination of the differences

in industry distribution with those in occupational distribution.           The two

influences can be separated, for manufacturing as a whole, by weighting the

individual within —   industry differences     of Table 15 by the    industry

distribution of affiliates or domestic establishments.

     The small                       in favor of foreign—owned establishments   is
                 margin shown here

entirely accounted for by industry composition.     If we   weight the individual

two—digit industry ratios estimated from occupation mix by the industry

employment weights of either foreign or domestic establishments to calculate

within—industry ratios, the average estimated ratio is actually slightly

below, but very close to, one.

      On the whole, this breakdown by broad occupational groups does not

explain any substantial part of the margin between wages in foreign—owned

establishments and those in domestically—owned establishments. If the foreign

firms are employing more skilled workers, the difference in skiLl composition

would have to be within these broad occupations.

Country of ownership

         Whatever the reasons for the differences in compensation between

foreign— and domestically—owned firms, unless they reflect an employee

aversion to foreign owners, there is no reason to
                                                  expect that differentials
would be the same for all nationalities of
                                           ownership.          The industry

distribution of affiliates, in particular, should reflect the
                                                              comparative
advantages of firms from different countries, such as those of German and

Swiss firms in the chemicals industry.

         The averages themselves differ greatly among the countries     of ownership,

with Japanese firms paying compensation per worker more than 60
                                                                per cent above
the average in domestically owned firms and other countries
                                                            paying from 15 per

The range   of differences among countries is much smaller    for manufacturing

than for non—manufacturing, but all countries       affiliates did pay somewhat

more than domestically—owned firms.     All countries' affiliates in

manufacturing, with the exception of Japanese affiliates, paid higher

compensation than the same countries' non—manufacturing affiliates. Japanese

non—manufacturing affiliates    paid higher average compensation than every

country's manufacturing, affiliates.       One consistent aspect of the employment

distribution was the concentration on manufacturing.        The smallest

manufacturing share was for Japanese affiliates, but even that, at 37 per

cent,   was almost twice the share of manufacturing     in employment in


domestically—owned establishments     (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992).

        Once we take account of industry composition, the differences in

compensation are smaller, as expected.       The differentials adjusted for

industry composition at the two-digit level, are shown in Table 17.

        Foreign affiliates from all six countries paid higher compensation than

did domestically—owned establishments, the differences ranging from 17 to 29

per cent by U.S. industry weights, and mostly in the 25 to 29 per cent range,

and 13 to 18 per cent by the foreign affiliate weights, except for Japan, at

29   per cent.   Much of this margin was related to the manufacturing—

nonmanufacturing distribution.

        Within manufacturing, the differential ranged from 2 to 12 per cent,

with Canadian affiliates at the upper end of the distribution.        The inclusion

or exclusion of administrative and auxiliary establishment employment made

little difference to the comparison, despite the high average compensation in

them, an indication that the proportions of such employment did not differ

substantially among the six countries within manufacturing, the only sector

         for   which we could make this distinction by country.

                 It is in the nonrnanufacturing sectors that we find large compensation

        differentials        within industries ranging from over 20 to 36 per cent by U.S.

         The aggregate compensation differentials among countries of ownership in

Table 16 are composed of several elements,          one of these is wage differentials

within industries, described in Table 17, which we can think of         as consisting
mainly of skill differences within industries, although there could be other

unknown differences in worker characteristics or employment terms within

industries, and differences in pay    for identical      workers (pure wage

differentials).     The other main element   is differences in industry

composition, in the sense of differences that.would exist if foreign

establishments paid the same compensation as domestically—owned establishments

in each industry.     These are shown in Table 18.      The compensation differences

can then be interpreted as representing industry differences in the average

skill of employees.
                                       —   33 —

       Across all industries, foreign establishments, except those of Canadian

and Netherlands firms, appear to be more concentrated in higher—skill

industries than U.S.—owned ones, mostly accounting for compensat ion

differentials of 11 to 17 per cent, but with the Japanese again the outliers

at 28 per cent. Within manufacturing, the foreign establishments are more

consistently in the higher—skill industries, but mostly by narrower margins,

ranging from 4 per cent for U.K. firms to 12 per cent for German firms.        In

most cases, the margin is reduced if administrative and auxiliary

establishments are excluded, an indication that foreign firms from most

countries use higher proportions of employees in such establishments than

domestic firms.

        Outside of manufacturing, the picture is much more mixed, with a wide

range of skill ratios.     Firms based in Canada and The Netherlands had a skill

mix in the U.S. biased toward low—skill industries, particularly retail trade

in   the case of Canada.   Japanese firms, on the other hand, had a strong bias

toward high—paid, presumably high—skill nonmanufacturing industries,

particularly "Security and commodity brokers and dealers," and away from low—

skill industries such as retail trade.

       Just as we tested whether the differences in employment mix between

foreign—owned establishments in the aggregate and 1J.S.—owned establishments

could account for the differences in average compensation, we can ask the same

question about establishments belonging to different foreign countries.      The

wage ratios implied by the combination of industry   mix, occupational group   mix

within industries, and average compensation of each occupational group, are     as

The occupational mix data do not go far toward explaining the country of

ownership differences shown in Tables 16 and 17, except for Germany, for which

something between a quarter and a third of the differential is explained.             In

the case of Japan, the occupational group mix implies lower wages in Japanese-

owned plants.     Either the relation between occupational group and pay is

different in Japanese—owned firms, or the grouping of occupations is too broad

for us to be able to observe    the significant differences.

         we have identified skill with either compensation or occupational group,

assuming, in effect, that labor markets were sufficiently competitive that all

firms,    foreign and domestic, or all in    a   region, paid the sane for a given

level of skill.     There is at least fragmentary evidence that the situation is

more complex.     For example, a study comparing Japanese—owned     and U.S. —owned


plants in the United States (Mincer and Higuchi, 1987) found that Japanese

firms paid higher training and recruitment costs and higher fringe benefits,

not included in our comparisons here, and, more important, paid more for

schooling and tenure on the job than the U.S. firms in the sample.         Since the

higher training costs were not associated with lower wages, they presumably

involved specific, rather than general, training, followed by a wage margin

over U.S. employers that reduced turnover and permitted the firms to recoup

their training investment.

Foeqn   Takeovers and U.S. Wages

      One way of observing the effects of foreign ownership of           U.S.    firms on

employees would be to follow firms    or   establishments when they change

ownership from domestic to foreign status.        Ideally, this should be done with

Bureau of the Census data with ownership information added but those data were

not available.   It was possible to select from the Bureau of Economic Analysis

data on foreign—owned enterprises those that reported as foreign—owned in 1990

but not in 1989, and to follow the same enterprises to their 1991 reports.

Unfortunately, those data have several drawbacks, aside from the fact that

they show only a single   years   changes,   a problen that will be reduced as

earlier SEA data are added to their current computer system and as the BEA—

census match adds years of data.     One problen    is that BEA   data are      on an

enterprise basis, so that establishments in different industries belonging to

the same foreign owner are combined and assigned to their main
                                                               industry.
Another is that an initial appearance in the file may not always represent a

foreign takeover of a formerly domestically—owned operation, as would be

preferable1 but may also include firms that switched fron one foreign owner to

another or began reporting after failing to report in earlier years.              Thus,

any conclusions here about the determinants and effects of takeovers nust be

viewed as tentative and experinental.

      The data used here are for 240 "new" foreign affiliates in 1990, of

which 124 were in manufacturing and the remainder in trade and services,

including finance.   Because of confidentiality requirements, data can be shown

here only for total manufacturing and total services, for         S   subdivisions of

manufacturing and three of services, and for wholesale trade, retail trade,

and finance, except banking.
                                        —   36 —

        The new affiliates in 1990 were smaller than existing affiliates in

employment in manufacturing as a whole, and in more than half the individual

industries but not overall or for services as        a   group (Table 19).     The new

affiliates were larger by all the measures in Table 19, in Primary and

fabricated metals and products, Hotels and other lodging places, Other

services, and, by a small margin, in Other manufacturing.'

        The new affiliates can be compared with existing affiliates           in   the year

of takeover in other respects, including pay levels, crude proxies for

efficiency or vertical integration (sales or sales minus imports per

employee), and capital intensity (assets per employee or property, plant, and

equipment per employee).      These comparisons are shown in table 20.

        In the manufacturing sector, the new affiliates seem to have paid, on

average, a little less than existing ones.         That may be because American—owned

firms in general paid less than foreign—owned firms and the newly acquired

firms had not yet assumed the behavior of foreign—owned firms.           However, no

pattern can be seen in the trade and service sectors and the range of ratios

is enormous,   with foreign firms reporting that they paid only half           of average

American wages in two industries and twice American wages in two others.

Sales per   employee were   more frequently below the average for existing

affiliates than was compensation, especially in manufacturing, but were higher

in   the new affiliates in business and other service categories.            Of the three

industry groups in which new affiliates had sales per employee at or above the

levels of existing affiliate9, two also showed relatively high assets per

employee, a fact that suggests a role for capital intensity, although the


     2That group and Other services are heterogeneous groups consisting of all
but the four manufacturing industries and two service industries distinguished
separately.

new affiliates was smaller than that in all foreign affiliates in this year in

most industries, although there were exceptions.            The slow growth of

employment in the new affiliates did not imply a slow growth in sales,

however.     Average sales grew more quickly in new affiliates than in existing

ones in most industries and, as a consequence, or cause, of the divergence

between sales growth and employment growth, sales per employee grew faster in

new affiliates    in almost every industry, as can be seen in        Table   22.     Thus; it

appears on the basis of this rough proxy,       at least, that the newly acquired

firms raised their productivity faster than did the existing affiliates.

sales per employee, as they might if tho sales increases reflected rising

compensation    (Table 23) were negatively correlated with changes in employment

(Table 21).     It appears that in those industries in which            new foreign

affiliates decreased the level of employment, it was the least skilled

employees that were dropped.

      For these new manufacturing affiliates and            for   the set of all

manufacturing affiliates in existence in both 1990 and 1991 we can also make

some comparisons based om data for the individual affiliates, aLthough the

numbers are too small to separate them into industries.                As   a substitute for

industrial grouping, we make some comparisons of each affiliate with all
                                        —   42 —

establishments in the     same industry in the United States,     The skewness of the

distributions and the presence of extreme values makes the means difficult to

interpret, particularly in the full data sets before removal of outliers.

      Some characteristics of the new affiliates in the year of establishment

or takeover, principally the latter, seem clear.       The new affiliates paid

lower wages than    US;   establishments in general in 1990, even though existing

foreign—owned firms paid higher wages than U.S. averages (Table 24).         However,

average compensation rose nuch faster on average, in the new affiliates

between 1990 and 1991, although the median increase was the same.

      The changes   in wage levels between 1990    and 1991 can be related to the

initial wage levels, at least as reported for the end of 1990.         For both the

new affiliates and the universe of foreign affiliates      in   the United States,

lower initial wage levels relative to the affiliates' industries, that is,

relative to all establishments in each affiliate's industry, were associated

with larger increases in wage levels.       The association of wage changes with

1990 relative wages was much stronger among the new affiliates than among        all.


existing affiliates (Table 25), and the coefficient on the 1990 average wage

relative to the industry average was also much higher in the new affiliates.

Thus employees in new affiliates presumably
                                            enjoyed larger gains than those in

existing affiliates for two reasons: one was that they started out in 1990 at

lower wages than the averages in their industries, and the other was that, for

a given distance below the average, there was      a larger absolute and percentage

increase for employees of new affiliates than for those of existing

affiliates.

         Foreign—owned establishments in the United States pay higher wages, on

average, than domestically—owned establishments, especially outside of the

manufacturing sector. Within industries, the foreign—owned establishments pay

somewhat higher compensation per worker than domestically—owned firms,

particularly in nonmanufacturing industries.          In manufacturing, it has been

shown that the differences within industries are associated with the
                                                                     larger
size of foreign—owned establishments, given the tact that
                                                          larger firms pay

higher wages than smaller firms.        Taking size of establishment into account,

there is no effect    of.   foreignness per se on manufacturing wages.

         Employment in foreign—owned establishments is concentrated in relatively

high—wage industries.       Most important is the heavy concentration of
                                                                         foreign
establishment employment in manufacturing: 41 per cent as
                                                          compared with 21 per
cent for domestically—owned establishments.          The manufacturing sector, on

average, pays over a third more than the nonmanufacturing sector.            Aside from

that distinction, the industry composition of foreign establishments

employment within manufacturing and within the nonmanufacturing sector are

both tilted toward higher wage industries.

         Another factor in the higher wages found      in foreign—owned establishments

is   the nature of the establishments.        The proportion   of employees in

administrative and auxiliary establishments was much higher among foreign

firms,    and these establishments' average compensation was about 50 per cent

higher than that in operating establishments in manufacturing and about 75 per

cent higher in nonmanufacturing.

         If U.S. labor markets   are somewhat segmented geographically, the impact

of foreign firms   should    be examined within these markets rather than
                                      —   46 —

nationally.    The only geographic dimension for which data are available for

foreign—owned and domestically—owned establishments is the etate, and we have

assumed, in effect, that each state is a separate labor market.

      Taking account of geographical Location raises the differential paid by

foreign establishments somewhat, especially in manufacturing.         apparently

foreign manufacturing firms have a somewhat greater propensity than

domestically—owned firms to choose locations in lower—wage states within each

industry.     There was some tendency for the wage differentials in favor of the

foreign establishments to be positive and high in the southern states, but

negative in older industrial areas of the north.

      We cannot associate the higher wages paid by foreign—owned

establishments with the skill mix of enployees as defined by the distribution

of the labor force among broad occupational groups. It is true that foreign

firms have more employees in professional and related occupations, and that

they have a higher proportion in establishments listed as administrative and

auxiliary, but they have fewer employees in managerial and administrative

occupations, within industries, than domestic firms.       The occupational mix

within industries in these terms accounts for very little of the pay

differential within industries, but foreign firms' employment is concentrated

in industries    in which firms in general   use higher proportions   of both of the


higher—skill categories of workers.

      The industry distribution of foreign establishment employment        in the

United States varies among some countries, but      a common thread that runs

across the affiliates of the major countries is that the shares of their

employment in certain industries is higher than that of U.S.—owned

establishments.     Of the six major parent countries, all had higher shares than
                                       —   47 —

domestic firma in either electrical or non—electrical machinery and      four   had

higher shares in chemicals.     These three industries are just the ones in which

U.S. direct investment abroad is concentrated.     The foreign shares tended to

be smaller than domestic shares in wholesale trade in nondurabies, in
                                                                      eating
and drinking places, and in health and social services,    all industries in

which there is little U.S. direct investment abroad.     The industry
distribution of foreign firms employment suggests that the propensity to

produce outside the home country is at least in part an industry

characteristic rather than a characteristic of home or host countries or their

firms.

      An indication of the impact of foreign—owned operations on
                                                                 wages in

manufacturing is given by equations that relate domestic plant and total plant

wage levels in an industry in a state to industry and state influences snd the

share of foreign affiliates in total employment.     A higher level of foreign

participation seems to raise domestic establishment wages and total foreign

and domestic establishment wages.     The impact of the foreign firms   is not only

from their own higher wage levels hut also from their influence on
                                                                   wages in
domestic plants.     Thus the higher wages in foreign—owned plants do not result

from simply substituting foreign for domestic high—wage employment.      The

assumption about labor markets implied by these equations is that they are

segmented not only by state, but also by industry.

      A    way to go beyond simple comparisons to judge the impact of foreign

firms is to observe U.S. firms taken over by foreigners after the change of

ownership.     We could do this only for firms acquired in 1990 and could observe

only the first year of operations under foreign ownership, but some patterns

emerged.     The wage levels in acquired operations tended to be a little below
                                              —   48 —

those in continuing operations during the year of acquisition, although there

was    a   wide range     of ratios.   For the most part, employment growth was somewhat

slower in the new affiliates but sales grew more rapidly, as did sales per

employee, suggesting that productivity may have grown faster in the new

affiliates.        Changes in average compensation were negatively correlated with

changes in enployment, a fact that suggests that new affiliates shedding

employees were dropping the lower paid and less skilled ones.

            Employees in the new affiliates, starting with somewhat lower wages than

those in all affiliates or all U.S. establishments in 1990 had above average

increases in wages.           The further below    the averages initially, the larger the

ensuing increases, in both absolute and relative terms.

            On the whole,    a rising presence of foreign operations seems to raise

U.S.       wage levels.     Foreign-owned firms have moved into relatively high—skill,

high—wage industries, to have paid more than domestically—owned firms within

industries and geographical areas, and to have caused donestically—owned firms

to pay higher wages as well.            Within manufacturing, the higher foreign

establishment wages are associated with the relatively large size of the

foreign operations, but it does not seem logical to discount the effect on

this account.

            Whether one considers size of establishment an explanation for wage

differences depends partly on the purpose of the analysis.             If one is

interested in comparing production functions or technology between foreign—

owned and domestically—owned establishments, size of output is clearly an

essential variable.           For   a judgment about labor market impact, the relevance

of size is not clear.           That is partly because the reason for the correlation

between size of establishment and wage rates is not obvious.             If that
                                      —   49 —

correlation   is related to unmeasured differences in   the nature of the   jobs,

such as uncounted fringe benefits, or skill levels, these variables should be

substituted for size because there is no assurance that the relation to size

is identical in foreign-owned and   domestically—owned.establishentsand also
because these other variables are more satisfactory as theoretical

explanations.

      Unless the foreign differential is a compensation for unmeasured

disadvantages of employment in foreign—owned firms, such as longer hours,

harsher working conditions, or less training, whether the differential is

associated with size of establishment seems irrelevant.     Even industry may be

irrelevant unless it is a proxy for skill levels.   The effect on wages     is

positive whether that effect is a result of size, foreignness, or other

establishment characteristics.
