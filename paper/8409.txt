       Debt issued by consumers is an under-studied asset class. There has been particularly

little academic study of recent trends in default on this debt. Between 1994 and 1997 the number

of personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. rose by about 75%. The 1.35 million filings in 1997

represented well over 1% of U.S. households. Delinquency rates on credit cards rose almost as

sharply. [Federal Reserve Board of Cleveland (1998)] The resulting losses to lenders amounted

to a sizeable fraction of the interest payments they collect, potentially raising the average cost of

credit. These trends in default, both in bankruptcy and delinquency, are especially surprising in

light of the strong economy over the period. They provide an unusually rich source of variation to

test the stability of models that forecast personal default and of credit risk models more generally.

       There are two leading explanations for these trends. First, the risk-composition of

borrowers might have worsened. Under the ‚Äúrisk effect,‚Äù less credit-worthy borrowers obtained

additional credit in recent years, and it is these borrowers who accounted for most of the rise in

default. In particular, many analysts cite growth in the number of credit card offers and in the

sizes of credit card limits, among other changes in the supply of consumer credit, as the most

important factors behind the rise in default. (See e.g. the New York Times (1998).)

       The second explanation focuses on the costs of default, including social, information, and

legal costs. Default is often associated with social stigma, both non-pecuniary (e.g., disgrace) and

pecuniary (e.g., the consequences of a bad reputation). Many analysts argue that these social

costs have recently declined, as default has become more commonplace. Filing for bankruptcy

also entails information and legal costs which might also have declined. Here analysts cite

growth in the number of bankruptcy lawyers and their advertising (as prohibitions on advertising

were loosened), as well as in other sources of advice like ‚Äúhow-to-file‚Äù books. Further, the flow

of informal advice from family and friends might have accelerated as more people have been


                                                 1
through bankruptcy.1,2 Even a small decline in these various costs could substantially increase

default rates, considering White (1997)‚Äôs estimate that between 15% and 31% of U.S. households

could benefit, just in terms of their current net worth, by filing for bankruptcy. Generalizing these

arguments, by the ‚Äúdemand effect‚Äù we mean that people have become more willing to default

over time, after controlling for their risk characteristics (which take into account the effects of

changes in credit supply) and other standard economic fundamentals.

         It is important to determine the relative significance of these two alternative explanations.

Unlike the risk effect the demand effect represents a change in the relationship between default

and the variables that lenders typically use to predict default, such as debt levels. Credit risk

models would be missing some systematic and time-varying factor, and hence be unstable,

potentially resulting in the misallocation or mispricing of credit. Unlike a deliberate expansion in

the supply of credit, an unexpected decline in the costs of default would lead to greater credit

losses than expected.3 While lenders can respond to increased losses from either the risk or

demand effects by improving the risk-composition of their portfolios, a significant decline in

default costs might require more substantial changes in lending standards. As regards public

policy, some analysts subscribing to the risk effect have advocated restricting credit supply in

order to improve the risk-composition of the borrowing population. Others, subscribing to the

1
  Weller (1998) provides a typical exposition of these arguments: ‚ÄúJust as attorney advertising has enhanced the
public‚Äôs awareness of bankruptcy as a financial escape hatch and bankruptcy reform has made filing less time
consuming than renewing a driver‚Äôs license, the stigma of bankruptcy has become a shadow of its former self. The
names of good bankruptcy attorneys and stories about the ease of getting out of debt are passed around the water
cooler like football scores on a Monday morning in October.‚Äù

  Another potential cost of default is reduced access to future credit and transactions services. Increases in post-
default credit, or increased information about such credit, is consistent with the demand effect. However, while there
appears to have been an increase in subprime lending and secured credit cards (which are often provided post-
default) in the early 1990s, we are unaware of evidence that this form of credit substantially increased during our
sample period. In fact, some analysts suggest that it might have declined in the later part of the period in response to
increased losses in the earlier part. For an analysis of post-default access to credit, see Musto (2000).




                                                           2
demand effect, have advocated making the terms of bankruptcy less attractive in order to increase

the perceived costs of default.

         Unfortunately, it has been difficult to disentangle the risk and demand effects empirically.

First, it is not obvious how to operationalize the demand effect. The various costs of default,

especially social, legal, and information costs, are inherently difficult to measure. Most of the

proxies that have been suggested run into problems of endogeneity and reverse causality.4 A

second difficulty is that controlling for risk-composition requires detailed measures of credit

supply and credit risk for a large sample of borrowers, including a large number of borrowers

who have defaulted. As in the literature on corporate default, traditional household data sets do

not provide enough information.

         This paper uses a new data set containing a panel of thousands of individual credit card

accounts from several different card issuers. The data is of very high quality. It includes

essentially everything that the issuers know about their accounts, including information from

peoples‚Äô credit applications, monthly statements, and credit bureau reports. In particular, the data

set records cardholder default (both delinquency and bankruptcy) and contains a rich set of

measures of credit risk including debt levels, purchase and payment histories, credit lines, and

credit risk scores, the issuers‚Äô own overall summary statistics for the risk of each account.

         We use this data to analyze credit card delinquency and more broadly personal

bankruptcy and the stability of credit risk models. Aggregate credit card debt currently amounts

to over $500 billion, much of which is securitized, so credit card default is of interest in itself.

3
  Many analysts appear to have been surprised by the rise in default rates and credit loses over the 1994-1997 period
[Moody‚Äôs (1997)].
4
  For example, consider using the number of advertisements by bankruptcy lawyers as an inverse proxy for
information and legal costs. The problem is that an increase in ads might not be the cause of the rise in bankruptcies,




                                                          3
Further, because about 75% of U.S. households hold credit cards, and our data set includes credit

bureau variables pertaining to all sources of consumer credit, not just credit cards, we are able to

study personal bankruptcy and default in general. Total consumer debt amounts to about $6T,

$1.3T excluding mortgages [Federal Reserve System (1999)]. Compared to the assets side of

household balance sheets, there has been surprisingly little analysis to date of the liabilities side,

largely for lack of data. Finally, empirical models of personal default and corporate default are in

many ways analogous. On the corporate side, Saunders (1999) emphasizes the same two

difficulties discussed above: the paucity of data, especially the limited number of observations of

default; and the potential instability of default models over time, especially over the business

cycle. In contrast, our data allows us to study a large number of defaulters over a concentrated

sample period, 1995-1997, of benign macro-economic conditions. Finding model instability in

such a sample would be a relatively strong result.

        Specifically, we estimate duration models for default, for both credit card delinquency

and personal bankruptcy, and assess the relative importance of different variables in predicting

default. For instance, are younger accounts and accounts with larger credit lines more likely to

default? The estimated models also allow us to evaluate the quality of commercial credit scores

as predictors of bankruptcy and delinquency. Are the scores efficient predictors of default,

incorporating all information available to issuers? Moreover, we investigate how the propensity

to default has changed over time, disentangling the risk and demand effects. Since the data

include the information that the card issuers themselves use to measure risk, we are able to

control for all changes in the risk-composition of accounts that were observable by the issuers.



but rather their effect. The increased bankruptcies could be due to the risk effect, with lawyers responding to the
increased demand for their services with additional advertising.


                                                        4
This allows us to assess the stability of default models from the point of view of a lender trying

to forecast default in his portfolio.

        A key finding is that the relation between default and economic fundamentals appears to

have substantially changed over the sample period. Even after controlling for risk-composition

and other standard economic variables, the propensity to default significantly increased between

1995 and 1997. Ceteris paribus, a credit card holder in 1997 was almost 1 percentage point more

likely to declare bankruptcy and 3 percentage points more likely to go delinquent than a

cardholder with identical risk characteristics in 1995. These magnitudes are almost as large as if

the entire population of cardholders had become one standard deviation riskier, as measured by

credit risk scores. By contrast, increases in credit limits and other changes in risk-composition

explain only a small part of the change in default rates over time. Standard default models appear

to have missed an important, systematic and time-varying default factor, consistent with the

demand effect.

        Section 1 of the paper describes the data used in the analysis and Section 2 discusses

related studies. Section 3 develops the econometric methodology and Section 4 reports the

results. Conclusions appear in Section 5.



1. Data Description



        The authors have assembled a panel data set of credit card accounts from several different

credit card issuers. The accounts are representative of all open accounts in 1995. Because the

issuers include some of the largest credit card companies in the U.S., the data should be generally




                                                5
representative of credit card accounts in the U.S. in 1995.5 The individual accounts are then

followed monthly for two years or more, depending on the issuer. Different credit card issuers

track somewhat different sets of variables at different frequencies depending on whether the

variables come from cardholders‚Äô monthly statements, credit bureau reports, or credit

applications. To protect the identity of the accounts and the issuers, the data from different

issuers were pooled together, with great care taken to define variables consistently across issuers.

The reported results will focus on variables common to all the issuers. However, the results were

checked for robustness separately for each issuer, using that issuer‚Äôs complete set of variables.

Table 1 provides summary statistics for the main variables used below.

        This data has a number of unique advantages compared to traditional household data sets

like the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) or the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).

First, the large cross-section of accounts contains thousands of observations of even low

probability events like delinquency and bankruptcy. Second, the long time series makes it

possible to estimate explicitly dynamic models of default. Third, in contrast to data based on

surveys of households, measurement error is much less of a problem. Fourth, the data contains

essentially all the variables used by issuers in evaluating accounts. Using account data does,

however, entail a number of limitations. The main unit of analysis in the data is a credit card

account, not an individual or a household. We partially circumvent this limitation by using data

from the credit bureaus, which cover all sources of credit used by the account holder, and by

examining account delinquency in addition to bankruptcy. Also, there is little information about

some potentially important variables like household assets or employment status. However the

 As a check, the data were benchmarked against the more limited and self-reported credit card information in the
1995 Survey of Consumer Finances and the aggregate data on revolving consumer credit collected by the Federal

issuers also lack access to this information, so its absence will not affect our identification

strategy. Also, the study by Fay, Hurst, and White (1998) discussed below finds that the effects

of such variables on bankruptcy are relatively small in magnitude.



2. Related Studies



        Most empirical studies of default have focused on bankruptcy, concentrating on the effect

of changes in the Bankruptcy Code in 1978 or on the effects of different exemption levels on

filing rates across U.S. states. (For a review see Hynes (1998).) These studies have generally used

aggregated data, and hence do not address the role of risk-composition.

        In their historical discussion of bankruptcy, Moss and Johnson (1998) note that lower

income households have gained increased access to credit over time. They argue that this

‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of credit can potentially explain the recent rise in bankruptcy. This argument

is a version of the risk-composition effect. (See also Ausubel (1997).) Unfortunately the SCF,

which Moss and Johnson use to document the change in the distribution of debt, does not record

whether people have filed for bankruptcy so they are unable to test their argument empirically.

Also, the amount of debt households carry is an endogenous variable, conflating credit demand

and supply, and so cannot itself be said to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù default.6 Finally, since there have been

changes in the income distribution of credit in the past, it does not follow that recent changes in

credit supply explain current bankruptcy trends. The relative importance of risk-composition




Reserve. It appears that the SCF households underreport their credit card borrowing, perhaps to avoid perceived
stigma. (See Gross and Souleles (2001).)
6
  In a companion paper, Gross and Souleles (2001), we explicitly distinguish credit demand and supply, identifying
the response of credit card debt to changes in supply.


                                                        7
versus other factors like default costs is a quantitative question that can only be answered with

suitable data.

        Domowitz and Sartain (1999) circumvent the limitations of the SCF by combining it with

a separate data set of bankruptcy petitions. They use this additional data essentially to estimate

whether the various households in the 1983 SCF have filed for bankruptcy, as a function of their

demographic characteristics. However, it can be difficult to estimate low-probability events like

bankruptcy in a small, cross-sectional sample like the SCF.7

        The 1996 PSID contained a set of retrospective questions about bankruptcy. Fay, Hurst,

and White (1998) use this data to identify the effects of social stigma. Because the PSID also

recorded data on household balance sheets in a number of years (1984, 1989, and 1994), the

authors are able to estimate for each household in their sample the economic benefit of filing for

Chapter 7, taken to be the value of debt that would be discharged minus assets (net of exemption

levels) that would be relinquished. As an inverse proxy for stigma or information costs, the

authors use the lagged bankruptcy rate in the state in which the household resides. They find that

the probability of filing increases with both the economic benefit of filing and the inverse proxy

for stigma. However, the magnitude of the increase is small in both cases. This paper differs from

the Fay, Hurst, and White study in a number of ways. First, their PSID sample contains only

about 250 observations of bankruptcy over the course of a twelve-year period ending in 1995.

Non-linear inference on such a small sample of households can be difficult.8 Second, the PSID




7
  To illustrate, the SCF sub-sample used in their analysis contains about 1,900 households. Even at today‚Äôs
bankruptcy rate of approximately 1%, which is much larger than the 1983 rate, the sub-sample would include only
about 19 households that actually filed for bankruptcy.
8
  Fay, Hurst, and White estimate that their PSID households underreported the incidence of bankruptcy by about
50% relative to aggregate statistics.


                                                      8
does not contain explicit measures of household credit risk like risk scores, nor measures of

credit supply like credit lines. Third, we estimate explicitly dynamic duration models for default.

        Ausubel (1999) uses data from a credit card issuer to analyze interesting marketing

experiments that varied the terms of credit card offers. He finds evidence of adverse selection in

the pools of applicants responding to different offers, in both their observed characteristics and

their subsequent default risk. However, he does not address the questions of interest here, such as

the relative importance of the risk and demand effects, in part because his data includes only a

single ‚Äúcohort‚Äù of accounts.9

        The related literature on corporate default is much larger, though as already noted it too

has been constrained by data limitations. Also, as Shumway (1998) emphasizes, much of the

literature has used static, cross-sectional specifications for default. By contrast the duration

analysis used here will explicitly accommodate changes over time in the riskiness of a given

borrower.



3. Econometric Methodology



        From the data set described in Section 1, we drew a representative sample of all credit

card accounts open as of June 1995, excluding only accounts that had been closed or frozen on or

before June 1995 because they were already bankrupt or three or more cycles delinquent.10,11

   Hence the specified models of default are static and cannot analyze the risk-composition of different cohorts of
credit card accounts. Also, they cannot distinguish the time and seasoning (age of account) effects that will play
important roles below, because time and seasoning are perfectly collinear for a single cohort.
10
    This makes the data stationary. The accounts already two cycles delinquent in June 1995 can go three cycles
delinquent immediately in the following month. While accounts that are one or zero cycles delinquent in June 1995
must wait at least one or two months respectively before going three cycles delinquent, this is true in subsequent
months as well. Account holders can go bankrupt in any month. We also re-ran the main specifications dropping the
first and the first two quarters of data. The results were consistent with the results reported in the text.


                                                        9
These accounts are followed for the next 24 months, or until they first default or attrite in good

standing.12 This period from 1995:Q3 through 1997:Q2 covers the time of the sharp rise in

default at the national level. Two indicator variables were created that identify the first month in

the sample, if any, in which an account defaulted. The delinquency indicator, DEL, identifies the

first time that an account failed to meet its minimum payment for three successive months, the

standard industry definition of serious delinquency. The bankruptcy indicator, BK, identifies the

month in which the card issuer was notified or learned from the credit bureaus that the cardholder

filed for bankruptcy. Accounts that are both delinquent and bankrupt are counted as bankrupt.13

This yields about four thousand accounts going bankrupt and fourteen thousand accounts going

delinquent. A random sample of about ten thousand accounts that never default within the

sample period is included as a control group. The delinquent and the bankrupt accounts are each

separately compared to the non-default control group. The resulting samples overweight

defaulting accounts, in predetermined proportions, in order to increase precision. All the results

below are weighted to make them representative.

         We estimate dynamic probit models for default that are equivalent to discrete duration

models [Shumway (1998), Hoynes (1999)]. For either the delinquency or bankruptcy sample, let

Di,t indicate whether account i defaulted in month t. For instance an account that goes three

cycles delinquent in month 10 would have Dit=0 for the first nine months, Di,10=1, and then drop

11
   To simplify the analysis of the age of a credit card account below, the main analysis excludes accounts opened
before 1990. Given the recent growth in the number of accounts, this restriction retains most accounts. The
conclusions below are unaffected whether or not these older accounts are included.
12
   About one fifth of the accounts attrite in good standing before the end of the sample period. Their characteristics
are similar to those of the accounts that last until the end of the sample; for example, their credit scores are only a
few points lower. The duration models we estimate allow for such attrition. As a check, we re-ran the main
specifications dropping these attritors from the entire sample, and verified that our conclusions did not change.
13
   Of the bankrupt accounts, about one fifth never went delinquent, half went delinquent before bankrupt, and the
rest went delinquent and bankrupt together. When bankruptcy followed delinquency it usually followed within a

out of the sample. Let Di*,t be the corresponding latent index value. The main specification that

will be estimated is given by Eq. (1):

                                ‚Ä≤           ‚Ä≤            ‚Ä≤            ‚Ä≤
                      Di*,t = b0 time t + b1 age i,t + b2 riski,t + b3 econi,t + Œ∑i ,t .                       (1)

agei,t represents the number of months that account i has been open by time t. This variable

allows for ‚Äúseasoning‚Äù of credit card accounts. For instance, accounts might become less likely to

default as they age. Under the duration model interpretation of Eq. (1), it is agei,t that allows the

hazard rate for default to vary with duration (duration-dependence). The vector agei,t represents a

fifth-order polynomial in account age, to allow the associated hazard function to vary non-

parametrically. riski,t and econi,t represent account-specific measures of risk and local economic

conditions, respectively, and will be further described below. The time dummies timet,

corresponding to calendar quarters, allow for shifts over time in the average propensity to default,

for accounts of any age and risk characteristics and controlling for economic conditions. They

capture any other time-varying default factors.

        It will be helpful to begin with a simpler specification. A probit model of delinquency

was first estimated with only the time dummies and the fifth-order polynomial in account age as

the independent variables, omitting riski,t and econi,t. Figure 1 displays the resulting predicted

values. Each curve shows the effect of account age (seasoning) on the probability of delinquency,

i.e. the non-parametric hazard function, for a different quarter. The underlying age variables are

both statistically and economically significant. The inverted-U shape suggests that the probability

of delinquency rises from the time an account is booked until about its two-year birthday, and

then declines. The coefficients on the time dummies are also significant and generally increasing


quarter, so grouping them together should not affect the results. The estimated hazard functions for bankruptcy and
delinquency (below) have similar shapes, but different levels since delinquency is more common.


                                                          11
over time, though not completely monotonic. This suggests that the hazard functions shifted over

time, and so the simple specification is unstable.

        It is tempting to interpret these shifts as reflecting the demand effect, due to changes in

people‚Äôs willingness to default. However, the shifts could instead reflect changes over time in the

risk-composition of accounts, due to changes in credit supply, or in other economic

fundamentals. For instance if lending standards were loosened over time, recently booked

accounts might be riskier, raising the average default rate. To illustrate, we re-estimated the

simple probit model replacing the time dummies with ‚Äúcohort‚Äù or vintage dummies reflecting the

time at which each account was opened. For instance the 1990 cohort is composed of the

accounts that were opened in 1990. Figure 2 shows the predicted values, with each curve now

representing the age hazard-function for a given cohort, over the period in which that cohort

appears in the sample.14 The effect of age is similar to that in Figure 1, with the hazard rate

peaking at about two years. But for a given age, the younger cohorts (to the left in the figure) are

more likely to go delinquent than the older cohorts (at the bottom right).

        At first glance these results seem to support the risk effect, since recent cohorts of

accounts appear to be riskier.15 However, the results do not rule out the possibility that all

cohorts, not just the recent cohorts, became increasingly likely to default in recent years. In fact,

Figures 1 and 2 are statistically equivalent because of the ‚Äúlife cycle‚Äù identity that links the

month in which an account is opened (represented by its cohort), the age of the account, and the


14
   The cohort dummies are for 1990, 1991, 1992, the first and second halves of 1993 and 1994, and the first half of
1995. The curve furthest to the ‚Äúsouth-east‚Äù represents the 1990 cohort, which was already over 50 months old at the
beginning of the sample in 1995 and is then followed for the 24 months of the sample period. The curve furthest to
the ‚Äúwest‚Äù represents accounts opened in the first part of 1995, which are only a few months old at the start of the
sample and are also followed for the 24 months of the sample period.
15
   Also, the younger cohorts start the sample with lower credit scores on average than the older cohorts. However
this difference largely reflects the seasoning effects prominent in the figures.


                                                        12
current month. Since the opening date plus age equals time, the two specifications underlying the

figures are collinear.16

         Eq. (1) avoids this identification problem by replacing the cohort dummies with account-

specific measures of risk, riski,t, which are not collinear with age and time. These measures

provide a more complete specification of risk at the individual account level, while still capturing

differences in average risk characteristics at the cohort level. The reason that different cohorts

have different average probabilities of default is that there are different fractions of risky

accounts in each cohort, so what matters is the riskiness of the individual accounts. The available

risk measures are quite comprehensive. They include direct, monthly observations of the

performance of each account, such as debt levels, purchase and payment histories, and credit

lines, as well as the credit risk scores, the issuers‚Äô own summary of the riskiness of each account.

We will assess the relative importance of these variables in predicting default. Note that if the

credit scores are sufficient statistics for default, no other variables available to the issuers should

be significant predictors given the scores. Furthermore, econi,t controls for local economic

conditions like the unemployment rate, per capita income, and the poverty rate in the state in

which the account holder resides (unemployment, average_income, and poverty_rate,

respectively); the fraction of people in the state without health insurance (no_insurance), and the

median real new house price in the corresponding census region (house_prices). While

unemployment is available monthly, house_prices and average_income are measured quarterly,




16
   Consider the following example. Suppose one observes that the 1995 cohort had a greater default rate when it was
2 years old (in 1997) than the 1990 cohort had when it was 2 years old (in 1992). This could be due to a cohort
effect, if the 1995 cohort was riskier, at any age, than the 1990 cohort, as suggested by Figure 2. Alternatively, this
could be due to a time effect, if all accounts in 1997 were more likely to default than were accounts in 1992,
whatever their cohort and age, as suggested by Figure 1.


                                                          13
and no_insurance and poverty_rate only annually. Monthly values for the latter four variables

were linearly interpolated.17

         The age polynomial and the risk measures riski,t together control for the risk-composition

of credit card accounts and therefore for the risk effect. If recently booked accounts have

sufficiently worse risk characteristics, this could explain the rise in default, as under the risk

effect. The time dummies identify changes over time in the average propensity to default that are

not due to risk-composition or other economic fundamentals. Hence the time dummies capture

the demand effect, including omitted factors like changes in default costs which affect people‚Äôs

willingness to default. It is of course possible that the time dummies are picking up some other

measure of risk or other economic fundamental that we have not controlled for. However, Eq. (1)

already contains a much richer set of controls than is available in the data used in previous

studies. In particular, the controls include the variables tracked by the card issuers themselves,

who have strong incentives to measure risk accurately, and thereby control for credit supply.

Further, in light of the strength of the economy over the sample period, most other unmeasured

economic fundamentals improved over time and therefore would be unlikely to increase default

rates.

         There are multiple possible timing conventions that could be used for the risk controls

riski,t in Eq. (1). To identify changes in booking standards over time, they might naturally be

taken from the original time of application. However, application data would not control for



17
   We also considered median family income and the divorce rate in each state, both available only annually. Median
income was generally insignificant, and since average_income is available at higher frequency we use the latter
instead in the reported specifications. The coefficient on the divorce rate was significantly positive in the bankruptcy
models below, but did not quantitatively change the marginal effects measured by Eqs. (2) and (3). The divorce rate
was insignificant in the delinquency models however. Because the divorce variable (which comes from the
Department of Health and Human Services) is missing for a number of states, we do not include it in the reported
specifications. We verified that omitting it does not change our conclusions.


                                                          14
changes in risk-composition or economic conditions between the time of application and the start

of the sample. For example, the 1990-91 recession might have had lingering effects on people‚Äôs

ability to pay their debts. Taking the risk controls from the time of application would attribute all

of this variation to the demand effect. Also, some issuers did not store some of their application

variables, especially for the older accounts.

         Instead, for the main results the risk controls are all taken from June 1995, the month

before the start of the sample period (that is, month t=0). While the polynomial agei,t non-

parametrically controls for the time-varying component of account risk, riski,0 controls for the

fixed component, more completely than the fixed cohort dummies used in Figure 2. Formally,

agei,t allows for duration-dependence in the baseline hazard function: the (conditional)

probability of default can vary over time as account i, of fixed characteristics riski,0, ages. riski,0

allows this hazard function to shift across accounts that start the sample period with different risk

characteristics.18 In extensions we will also interact agei,t and riski,0, which will allow the hazard

functions to have non-parametrically different shapes across the different risk groups.

         Given this specification, to test for the risk effect we will essentially check whether the

sample trends in default can be explained by riskier accounts progressing through the riskier parts

of their life cycle (e.g., around their two-year birthday). For instance, suppose that many of the

youngest accounts in the sample, those opened in early 1995, have bad risk characteristics riski,0.

Then, ceteris paribus, the default rate might have increased in 1997 because the risky (and

    18
       More formally, let g(a) be a fifth-order polynomial in account age a, in months, corresponding to agei,t. The
hazard function Œªi(a) ‚â° Pr(D i,a = 1| D i,a-1 = 0) is the probability of defaulting at age a conditional on not having
defaulted before. Eq. (1) implies that Œªi,t(a) = Œª(b0‚Äôtimet + g(a) + b2‚Äôriski,0 + b3‚Äôeconi,t), where the functional form
Œª() depends on whether we are using the probit or logit estimator. Thus the hazard function is allowed to vary with
both age a and the risk characteristics riski,0, as well as with time and economic conditions. Such a specification of
the hazard function is standard in the literatures on the duration of unemployment and welfare spells. There the




                                                          15
relatively large) 1995 cohort of accounts hit its two-year birthday in 1997. By contrast, to test for

the demand effect, we will check whether all accounts ‚Äì even accounts with the same risk

characteristics, age, and other economic fundamentals ‚Äì have become more likely to default over

time. Using riski,0 is also appropriate from the point of view of a lender (or investor) who at time

0 is trying to forecast future default rates in a portfolio. Forecasting over a two-year horizon is

consistent with industry practice; in particular the credit risk scores are usually calibrated on two-

year samples.

        Another possible timing convention would be to use updated, contemporary risk controls,

riski,t. But updating the risk controls would confound the risk and demand effects because many

of the risk variables are under the direct control of the account holder. For instance, people could

have chosen to take on more debt over the course of the sample period because the stigma of

default has fallen. Using riski,t would attribute all of this variation to the risk effect, thereby

understating the demand effect. One of the variables in riski,t, however, is directly under the

control of the issuers, namely the credit line. Therefore we sometimes replace the initial line,

linei,0, with the updated line (once lagged), linei,t-1, keeping the other, demand-determined risk

controls at their initial (t=0) values. This allows us to test whether increases in credit lines ‚Äì the

intensive margin of credit supply ‚Äì have contributed to the default rate during the sample

period.19

        At the national level, credit supply also changed during the sample period along the

extensive margin, through the introduction of new accounts. Since our sample is representative

of accounts already open in mid 1995, it does not include accounts that opened subsequently.


analogues of age a and riski,0 are the length of the unemployment spell so far and the characteristics of the
unemployed person, usually time-invariant demographic variables like gender and race. (See e.g. Hoynes (1999).)




                                                      16
Hence the results do not include the contribution of these youngest accounts to national default

rates between mid 1995 and mid 1997. However, this is not a problem for our analysis. The

demand effect should be similar across different accounts, and the results will fully capture the

contribution of the risk-composition of the accounts that are in the sample, to the default rates in

the sample.

           Both dynamic probit and logit models of Eq. (1) were estimated. Because the results were

both qualitatively and quantitatively similar, we report only the probit results. The standard errors

allow for heteroscedasticity across accounts as well as serial correlation within accounts. Dummy

variables for the issuers are included but not reported. Various extensions of Eq. (1) will also be

considered.

           To evaluate quantitatively how changes in the risk and demand effects influenced the

probability of default, we want to compute the marginal value of varying each effect

independently, at different times in the sample period. This requires a generalization of the

marginal effects that are usually computed [e.g., Greene (1991), p. 664]. Let Œ¶ be the normal

mean of x in quarter t. We can naturally define the marginal value of the demand effect to be the

effect on default rates of varying only the time dummies, holding all other variables in Eq. (1),

which control for credit supply and other aspects of risk-composition, equal to their cross-

sectional means. As a baseline, marginal values will be calculated relative to the first quarter

(1995:Q3). Thus, the marginal effect of the change in the demand effect between quarter 1 and

quarter t is calculated as

Symmetrically, we define the marginal effect of changing risk-composition over time to be the

Standard errors for demandt and riskcompt are calculated using the delta method.

         It is important to understand exactly what riskcompt and demandt measure. First, to

emphasize the difference between changes in the demand effect and changes in standard

economic fundamentals, we include in riskcompt the effects of changes in economic conditions,

by varying econi,t. Second, since riski,0 identifies the fixed component of each account‚Äôs risk, it

does not directly contribute to variation in risk-composition over the sample period. As a result,

in the baseline specification, the changes in riskcompt over time are driven by changes in the

variable, hazard-rate component of risk-composition, agei,t, and in econi,t. Once we have used

riski,0 to control for the fixed component of account risk, our identification scheme allows us to

treat the marginal effects of risk and demand symmetrically, by using the polynomial in duration

agei,t to control for changes in risk over time, and the dummy variables timet to measure changes


even the updated line could understate the demand effect.

                                                              18
in the demand effect over time. For a given risk group, identified by the account-specific

measures of risk in riski,0, both age and time are allowed to have a non-parametric effect on the

probability of default over time.



4. Results



       Column (1) of Table 2 shows the baseline results from the probit model for bankruptcy.

The estimated coefficients for the quarter dummies and age polynomial are followed by the

coefficients for the risk controls and local economic conditions. Starting with the latter at the

bottom of the column, the unemployment rate unemployment and house prices house_prices are

significant with the expected signs:      greater unemployment and weaker house prices are

associated with more bankruptcies. The risk controls are jointly very significant. Because the

credit scores are important summary statistics for risk, both their levels and squares are included.

The issuers estimate the scores using all the information at their disposal, both in-house (the

"internal" scores, based on the past behavior of the individual account) and at the credit bureaus

(the "external" scores, based on the behavior of the account holder across all sources of credit).

We use both scores. For each score the linear and quadratic terms are together quite significant,

with œá2(2) statistics well over 100. Their total effect has the expected sign: accounts with higher

scores are much less likely to go bankrupt. The remaining risk controls include account total

balances, payments, and purchases, all normalized by the credit line, and the line itself. The

normalized balance, defined as the utilization rate, is specified flexibly as a series of dummy

variables: utilization1 to utilization7 represent a utilization rate of 0, in (0,0.4], (0.4,0.7],




                                                19
(0.7,0.8], (0.8,0.9], and (0.9,1.0], and over 1.0, respectively.20 Not surprisingly, accounts with

higher utilization rates are much more likely to go bankrupt. Accounts making smaller payments

or larger purchases also go bankrupt more often, although the latter effect is not significant. Since

variables other than the credit scores are statistically significant, the scores appear to be

inefficient predictors of default. The coefficient on the line is insignificant, but will be discussed

further below, along with additional risk controls. The age variables are jointly significant, with

the associated age hazard function rising for young accounts but then flattening out compared to

Figure 1.

           As for the time dummies, their coefficients are highly significant and increase

monotonically. Thus, even after controlling for account age, balance, purchase and payment

history, credit line, risk scores, and economic conditions, a given account was more likely to go

bankrupt in 1996 and 1997 than in 1995. Some other systematic default factor must have

deteriorated, consistent with the demand effect.

           To quantify the relative importance of the risk and demand effects over time, we compute

their marginal values, riskcompt and demandt, for each quarter. The results appear in column (1)

of Table 3, and are graphed in Figure 3. riskcompt is initially flat and then declines. As expected

the aging of the portfolio and improvements in economic conditions imply a decrease in the

bankruptcy rate over time. The time dummies essentially capture the difference between this

implied bankruptcy rate and the actual rate in the sample. The rising trend in demandt suggests

that the actual rate is increasingly larger than the implied rate. The magnitudes are much larger

than for riskcompt and are statistically and economically significant. The probability of

bankruptcy in quarter eight is about 0.06 percentage points per month larger than at the start of

20
     Because the credit limit constrains the magnitude of total balances, including transactions balances, not just debt,


                                                            20
the sample. At an annual rate this translates to more than a 0.7 percentage point increase in the

bankruptcy rate, ceteris paribus, a substantial effect.

         Another way to illustrate the magnitude of the demand effect is to contrast it with the

effect of reducing the credit score of every account in the sample by one standard deviation. This

represents a very large increase in the overall riskiness of the sample portfolio of credit cards. A

one standard deviation decrease in the internal risk score raises the average probability of

bankruptcy by about 0.10 percentage points per month, not very much larger than the peak value

of demandt in quarter eight. Thus, the estimated demand effect increased the bankruptcy rate by

almost as much as had the entire portfolio become one standard deviation riskier ‚Äì again a

substantial effect. We similarly computed the effects of varying the other risk controls. The

values for demandt are always large in comparison.

         The remaining columns of Table 2 present various extensions of this analysis of

bankruptcy. The associated marginal effects appear in the corresponding columns in Table 3.

Column (2) shows the effects of interacting the age polynomial with all of the risk controls

riski,0, which allows the hazard functions to have non-parametrically different shapes across

different risk groups.21 The coefficients reported in Table 2 are for the primary, non-interacted

variables. The interaction terms are significant for utilization, payments, purchases, and the

internal risk scores. In Table 3 the associated marginal values demandt have decreased by about

one-quarter in magnitude relative to baseline column (1), but they remain significant and

continue to rise over time. The marginal values riskcompt now rise slightly through quarter 4 but

then decline.


we include total balances in the numerator of utilization. The results are similar using just debt in the numerator.




                                                           21
         Turning to the intensive margin of credit supply, credit lines increased substantially over

the sample period, on average over 60%. Column (3) in Tables 2 and 3 shows the results of

adding to Eq. (1) the updated credit line, linei,t-1. The other, demand-determined risk controls are

maintained at their initial values. The coefficient on the credit line is significant but negative,

implying that larger lines are associated with less default. This reflects the fact that issuers

offered greater amounts of credit to the people that they expected to be less risky. The

coefficients on the time dummies and their marginal values demandt do not change very much.

These findings suggest that larger credit lines were not responsible for the recent rise in default.22

         Column (4) extends this analysis by updating all of the risk controls, using riski,t-j for a

fixed number of lags j. Although this extension confounds the risk and demand effects by

attributing some demand-related changes in default rates to the risk controls, it is still interesting

for comparative purposes. However it is not clear how many lags j would be most appropriate. In

the year or so before default, many people significantly increase their debt (e.g. utilization rates

often asymptote to 100%) and miss payments. Hence using a very small j would make riski,t-j

statistically very informative, but economically irrelevant, since lenders need to predict default

earlier than just a few months in advance, before debt increases. In practice lenders often forecast

over 24 month horizons. But using riski,t-24 would eliminate all but the final month of the sample.

As a compromise we use j = 6 lags, adding riski,t-6 to Eq. (1), at the cost of dropping quarters one

and two of the sample period.

21
   For computational ease and to minimize collinearity in the interaction terms, the reported results interact riski,0
with a quadratic polynomial in age, and use a quadratic function of utilization in riski,0 instead of the six dummy
variables. The results are similar using the fifth-order polynomial in age and the utilization dummies variables.
22
   For a subset of accounts we have credit bureau data on the number of other credit cards the account holder has.
The average account holder opened about one new account over the sample period. We added this variable, once
lagged, to Eq. (1). For bankruptcy, its coefficient was significantly positive; however the marginal values demandt
declined by only about five percent in magnitude. For delinquency, below, its coefficient was significantly negative



                                                         22
         The results are reported in column (4). The coefficients are qualitatively similar to the

baseline results in column (1), though, not surprisingly, much more significant.23 Nonetheless the

time dummies and their marginal values demandt remain jointly quite significant and generally

increasing. To interpret their magnitude, note that having dropped the first two quarters from the

sample, the omitted time dummy is for quarter 3. Hence the marginals demandt in column (4) of

Table 3 can be compared to the differences (demandt - demand3) from column (1). In column (4)

the peak value of demandt in quarter 8 is .018%, almost half the size of the corresponding value

in column (1) of .043% (= .060% - .017%).24 This decline in the magnitude of demandt is not

surprising since riski,t-6 incorporates borrowers‚Äô risky behavior within the sample period.

However, since this behavior is endogenous, using riski,t-6 does not help identify the cause of the

trends in default in the sample; it merely reflects them, confounding the risk and demand effects.

As already noted, people might have taken on more debt over the sample period and then

defaulted because the costs of default had decreased.

         Column (5) adds dummy variables for the state in which the cardholder resides. These

variables control for fixed geographical effects on the propensity to default. For instance,

additional credit might have recently been obtained by riskier households living in poorer areas.

Similarly, regulations, judicial attitudes, and average household demographics, as well as default




by contrast. Note that the number of credit cards a person holds incorporates both supply effects and demand effects
(i.e., the person‚Äôs decision to accept credit card offers).
23
    The t-ratios for high levels of utilization are above 10, the œá2(2) statistic for the significance of the internal scores
has almost doubled, and the pseudo R2 has increased by almost 50%. The results are similar on controlling for
possible drift in the scores by normalizing them by the average score in the month.
24
   Dropping the first two quarters but still using riski,0, as opposed to riski,t-6, resulted in a peak value for demandt of
about .045%, consistent with the original results in column (1).


                                                             23
costs like stigma, can differ across states. The state dummies are jointly quite significant (not

shown), but nonetheless slightly raise the magnitudes of demandt.25

         As discussed above, it is difficult to operationalize more directly the various notions of

the demand effect that have been proposed. Some of these emphasize the idea that social stigma

and information about bankruptcy might change with the number of people in one‚Äôs community,

appropriately defined, that have already filed for bankruptcy. To operationalize this geographic

view of default costs we use the aggregate bankruptcy rate in the state in which the cardholder

resides. Column (6) adds to Eq. (1) the average of this rate over the previous two calendar

quarters, denoted by stateratet-1, plus its square. These variables are quite significant and their

total effect is positive, as expected. The probability that someone files for bankruptcy increases

with the number of people in her state who filed in the recent past. Furthermore, the marginal

values demandt have decreased to about two-thirds of their baseline values in column (1).26

These results support the geographic view of default costs. The omitted default factor varies

systematically across states. Of course, the relevant community within which stigma operates and

information flows might not be one‚Äôs state, so these results can be considered a lower bound for

their effect.

         The same analysis was undertaken using account delinquency instead of bankruptcy as

the indicator of default. Tables 4 and 5 present the results for the different specifications and their

corresponding marginal values. In the baseline specification, in column (1), the pattern of

coefficients on the risk controls is similar to that above for bankruptcy. Now no_insurance is


25
   A conditional logit model was estimated to remove fixed effects by zip code, as well. The results were similar.
26
   We also added one, two, and six month‚Äôs worth of lags of econi,t to this and the other main specifications. For
bankruptcy these lags were generally insignificant and had very little effect on the demandt marginals and the
significance of stateratet-1. For delinquency, below, a few of the lags were significant (though unstable in sign) but
again had little effect on demandt.


                                                         24
significant, with lack of health insurance associated with more delinquency. Once again people

with larger balances and lower risk scores are much more likely to default. Even with these

controls for risk, the coefficients on the time dummies are again highly significant. Figure 4

graphs the corresponding marginal values. demandt rises for six quarters, but unlike for

bankruptcy it then plateaus. (The magnitudes are larger than in Figure 3 because delinquency is

more common than bankruptcy.) The peak value in quarter six of about 0.21 translates into

almost a 3 percentage point increase in the annual delinquency rate, ceteris paribus. For

comparison, decreasing the internal credit scores by one standard deviation raises the average

predicted probability of delinquency by about 0.5 percentage points per month, about double the

peak value of demandt.

       The remaining columns in Tables 4 and 5 present various extensions. Column (2) shows

the results on interacting agei,t with riski,0. The interaction terms are significant for payments,

purchases, and the internal scores. Again the time dummies remain significant and retain their

original pattern, and their marginal values demandt have been reduced by about one-fifth in

magnitude. In column (3) the updated credit line linei,t-1 is again significantly negative. In column

(4) the updated risk controls riski,t-6 are again very significant and reduce the magnitudes of

demandt by well over half relative to (demandt - demand3) in column (1). (The linear and

quadratic terms for the external score are jointly very significant.) Finally, adding state dummies

does not substantially change the results, as reported in column (5).

       For both bankruptcy and delinquency, for each issuer we added its complete set of

available risk controls to Eq. (1). These often include variables like the income and age of the

account holder (from the credit card application), and credit bureau variables like the total

number of credit cards held by the account holder. While such variables are often significant in


                                                 25
predicting default, they are less significant than the credit scores and utilization, and the

coefficients on the time dummies always remain significant and generally increasing.27,28 It

appears that there has not been enough change in risk-composition to explain the variation in

default rates over the sample period. These results are consistent with the demand effect.



5. Conclusion



        This paper used a unique new panel data set of credit card accounts to analyze credit card

delinquency and more generally personal bankruptcy and the stability of credit risk models. We

estimated duration models for consumer default and assessed the relative importance of different

variables in predicting default. We also investigated how the propensity to default has changed

over time, disentangling the two leading explanations for the recent increase in default ‚Äì changes

in risk-composition versus the demand effect, namely an increase in borrowers‚Äô willingness to

default due to declines in default costs, including social, information, and legal costs. Our data

contains a much richer set of measures of risk-composition than previously available, including

debt levels, purchase and payment histories, credit lines, and credit risk scores. Since these

measures include the information that credit card issuers themselves use to measure risk, we were

able to control for all changes in credit supply and risk-composition that were observable by the

issuers, including increases in credit lines.

27
   For example, for bankruptcy both account-holder age and income have a negative coefficient, but are not
significant given the other covariates. (We first deflated application income to constant dollars, and then applied a
real growth rate of 2.5% per year to allow for income growth between the time of application and the sample.) In
both cases the demandt marginals declined only slightly, by about 1 percent in magnitude. The results for
delinquency were similar, though the negative coefficient on age was significant.
28
   We also interacted the quarter dummies with an indicator for having high income (above the median). The trend in
the time dummies was somewhat smaller in magnitude for the high income account holders than for the others, but



                                                         26
        The risk controls were highly significant in predicting both bankruptcy and delinquency.

Accounts with lower credit scores were much more likely to default. Even controlling for the

scores, accounts with larger balances and purchases, or smaller payments, were also more likely

to default. Default also increased with unemployment, weak house prices, and lack of health

insurance. Larger credit lines however were not associated with default, suggesting that issuers

extended the larger lines to less risky accounts. Nonetheless, despite their significance, these

variables explain only a small part of the change in bankruptcy and delinquency rates over the

sample period. In sum, neither the risk-composition of accounts nor economic conditions

changed enough to explain the trends in default rates.

        Instead, the relation between default and economic fundamentals appears to have

substantially changed over the period. Even after controlling for risk-composition and other

economic fundamentals, the propensity to default significantly increased between mid 1995 and

mid 1997. Ceteris paribus, a credit card holder in 1997 was almost 1 percentage point more

likely to declare bankruptcy and 3 percentage points more likely to go delinquent than a

cardholder with identical risk characteristics in 1995. These magnitudes are almost as large as if

the entire population of cardholders had become one standard deviation riskier, as measured by

risk scores. Standard default models appear to have missed an important, systematic and time-

varying default factor. Because this factor is not explained by our very rich set of controls for risk

and credit supply, nor by other economic fundamentals, these results are consistent with the

demand effect.

        While our analysis rules out the risk effect, it does not directly identify what underlies the

estimated demand effect. The fact that the omitted default factor rises with the number of people


not significantly so. However, these interaction terms are hard to interpret in our empirical framework because they


                                                        27
in one‚Äôs state who have previously filed for bankruptcy is suggestive of a decline in social stigma

or information costs, but is not conclusive. Further, the demand and risk effects can be

interrelated. It is possible, for instance, that a previous deterioration in risk-composition or

economic fundamentals caused a critical mass of people to declare bankruptcy, leading in turn to

a reduction in default costs. This suggests the possibility of multiple equilibria in default rates.

Also, lenders would likely respond to the demand effect by tightening lending standards and so

improving the risk-composition of borrowers. Furthermore, our analysis does not provide a

forecast about the future path of default. Nevertheless, if the demand effect is due to recent

reductions in social or information costs, it will most likely be difficult to return the bankruptcy

rate back to its previous levels before the 1990s, without a substantial tightening in lending

standards or the bankruptcy code.29 And if default costs in turn decrease with the number of

people that have already defaulted, future recessions could further ratchet up default rates.

         This analysis can be extended in a number of ways. First, the authors are attempting to

collect additional data to lengthen the sample period. Second, better predictors of default might

be constructed. Evidently the credit risk scores did not fully predict the recent increase in default

rates. Since variables other than the scores were also found to be significant in predicting default,

the scores might not even be efficient predictors. Better predictors might improve credit risk

management and lead to a more efficient allocation of credit. Further, the standard risk scores do

not summarize the expected future profitability of accounts. ‚ÄúProfit scores‚Äù might be constructed


confound the risk and demand effects.
29
   Increased defaults raise the marginal costs of lending. If marginal revenues do not increase correspondingly, for
instance if lenders are constrained in raising interest rates, then one would expect less lending in response. Credit
card issuers have recently tightened lending standards, apparently in response to increased losses over our sample
period. In conjunction with an ever improving economy, this might have helped recently stem the rise in the
bankruptcy rate, but it remains high by historical standards [Moody‚Äôs (1999)]. Also, there is an ‚Äúinventory‚Äù issue that
might put some downwards pressure on the bankruptcy rate in the future: most bankrupts file under Chapter 7, which
does not allow them to file again for another six years.


                                                          28
to combine default probabilities with expected future cash flows. Third, because the estimated

demand effect represents an increase in the probability of default that is common across

accounts, it would be interesting to examine its implications for portfolio diversification and

securitization. Fourth, in a companion paper, Gross and Souleles (2001), the authors investigate

more generally how people use their credit cards, including how they respond to changes in credit

supply. Understanding why people accumulate large quantities of debt in the first place should

shed additional light on why some people default.30

This table provides summary statistics for some of the key variables in the analysis. age represents
a credit card account‚Äôs age in months, line its credit limit. The utilization rate is balances divided
by the line. payments and purchases are also normalized by the line. internal_score and
external_score are the credit risk scores from the issuer and credit bureau. unemployment,
average_income, and poverty_rate are the unemployment rate, per capita income (in thousands of
$), and poverty rate in the state of residence; no_insure is the fraction of people in the state without
health insurance; and house_prices is the median real new house price in the census region (in
thousands of $). BK is an indicator for bankruptcy, DEL for three-cycle delinquency. Apart from
BK and DEL, the statistics refer to the first month of the sample period. The reported statistics for
BK and DEL measure the probability of ever going bankrupt or delinquent at any point in the
sample period. These statistics cover both the bankruptcy and delinquency samples (3929 bankrupt
and 13872 delinquent accounts, plus a control group of 9821 non-defaulting accounts), and are
weighted to be representative.

This table shows the results of probit models of bankruptcy (BK) using monthly credit-card account
panel data from July 1995 through June 1997. The independent variables control for time effects,
account age, measures of account risk, and local economic conditions. quarter2 to quarter8 are dummy
variables for the calendar quarter. age to age5 represent a fifth-order polynomial in account age.
utilization2 to utilization7 are dummy variables for successively higher utilization rates. line is the credit
limit, and payments and purchases are normalized by the line. internal_score and external_score are the
credit risk scores. unemployment, average_income, and poverty_rate are the unemployment rate, per
capita income, and poverty rate in the state of residence, no_insure the fraction of people without health
insurance, and house_prices the median real new house price in the region. Coefficients on dummy

dependence within accounts. The number of observations is the number of account-months. agen = agen-

    *age/100. external_score2 = external_score*external_score/1000. internal_score2 = internal_score* internal_score /1000.

In the baseline specification in column (1) the risk controls riski,0 (utilization, payments, purchases, line, and
the scores) are all taken from month 0, June 1995. Column (2) interacts the risk controls with a quadratic
polynomial in account age. Only the coefficients on the primary, non-interacted variables are shown.
Column (3) uses the updated credit limit (once lagged). Column (4) updates the risk controls using riski,t-
6. Column (5) adds dummy variables for the cardholder‚Äôs state, whose coefficients are not shown.
staterate in column (6) is the aggregate bankruptcy rate in the state, averaged over the previous two
calendar quarters.

Each column reports the marginal effects for the probit models in the corresponding column in Table 2,
as defined by Eqs. (2) and (3). demandt shows the effect on bankruptcy rates of varying only the time
dummies across quarters t, relative to the first quarter. riskcompt shows the effect of varying account age
and the economic control variables across their cross-sectional averages in different quarters. The units
are in percentage points per month.

This table shows the results of probit models of delinquency (DEL) using monthly credit-card account
panel data from July 1995 through June 1997. The independent variables control for time effects,
account age, measures of account risk, and local economic conditions. quarter2 to quarter8 are dummy
variables for the calendar quarter. age to age5 represent a fifth-order polynomial in account age.
utilization2 to utilization7 are dummy variables for successively higher utilization rates. line is the credit
limit, and payments and purchases are normalized by the line. internal_score and external_score are the
credit risk scores. unemployment, average_income, and poverty_rate are the unemployment rate, per
capita income, and poverty rate in the state of residence, no_insure the fraction of people without health

insurance, and house_prices the median real new house price in the region. Coefficients on dummy
variables for the issuer are not shown. Standard errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity and
dependence within accounts. The number of observations is the number of account-months. agen = agen-

    *age/100. external_score2 = external_score*external_score/1000. internal_score2 = internal_score* internal_score /1000.

In the baseline specification in column (1) the risk controls riski,0 (utilization, payments, purchases, line, and
the scores) are all taken from month 0, June 1995. Column (2) interacts the risk controls with a quadratic
polynomial in account age. Only the coefficients on the primary, non-interacted variables are shown.
Column (3) uses the updated credit limit (once lagged). Column (4) updates the risk controls using riski,t-
6. Column (5) adds dummy variables for the cardholder‚Äôs state, whose coefficients are not shown.

Each column reports the marginal effects for the probit models in the corresponding column in Table 4,
as defined by Eqs. (2) and (3). demandt shows the effect on delinquency rates of varying only the time
dummies across quarters t, relative to the first quarter. riskcompt shows the effect of varying account age
and the economic control variables across their cross-sectional averages in different quarters. The units
are in percentage points per month.

Figure 1
The effects of account age (in months) and time on the probability of delinquency
Each curve represents the hazard function for a different calendar quarter (from top to bottom, for a
given age: sample quarters 6, 8, 7, 5, 2, 3, 4, and 1). Each hazard function gives the average probability
of an account going delinquent at the indicated age (months since booking), conditional on not having
already defaulted.

Figure 2
The effects of account age (in months) and cohort on the probability of delinquency
Each curve represents the hazard function for a different cohort of credit card accounts, over the period
in which that cohort appears in the sample (from left to right: accounts booked in the first half of 1995,
the second and first halves of 1994 and 1993, 1992, 1991, and 1990). Each hazard function gives the
average probability of an account going delinquent at the indicated age (months since booking),
conditional on not having already defaulted.
