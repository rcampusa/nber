This paper considers how the role of inflation as a leading business-cycle indicator affects the pricing
of nominal bonds. We examine a representative agent asset pricing model with recursive utility preferences
and exogenous consumption growth and inflation. We solve for yields under various assumptions
on the evolution of investor beliefs. If inflation is bad news for consumption growth, the nominal yield
curve slopes up. Moreover, the level of nominal interest rates and term spreads are high in times when
inflation news are harder to interpret. This is relevant for periods such as the early 1980s, when the
joint dynamics of inflation and growth was not well understood.

I    Introduction

The main theme of this paper is that investors dislike surprise inﬂation not only because it lowers

the payoﬀ on nominal bonds, but also because it is bad news for future consumption growth. The

fact that nominal bonds pay oﬀ little precisely when the outlook on the future worsens makes them

unattractive assets to hold. The premium that risk averse investors seek as compensation for inﬂation

risk should thus depend on the extent to which inﬂation is perceived as a carrier of bad news.

    One implication is that the nominal yield curve slopes upward: long bonds pay oﬀ even less than

short bonds when inﬂation, and hence bad news, arrives. Therefore, long bonds command a term

spread over short bonds. Moreover, the level of interest rates and term spreads should increase in

times when inﬂation news are harder to interpret. This is relevant for periods such as the early 1980s,

when the joint dynamics of inﬂation and growth had just become less well understood.

    We study the eﬀect of inﬂation as bad news in a simple representative agent asset pricing model

with two key ingredients. First, investor preferences are described by recursive utility. One attractive

feature of this preference speciﬁcation is that – in contrast to the standard time-separable expected

utility model – it does not imply indiﬀerence to the temporal distribution of risk. In particular, it

allows investors to prefer a less persistent consumption stream to a more persistent stream, even

if overall risk of the two streams is the same. In our context, aversion to persistence generates a

heightened concern with news about the future and makes investors particularly dislike assets that

pay oﬀ little when bad news arrives.

    The second ingredient of the model is a description of how investor beliefs about consumption

and inﬂation evolve over time. Investor beliefs determine to what extent inﬂation is perceived to

carry bad news at a particular point in time. We consider various speciﬁcations, some of which take

into account structural change in the relationship between consumption growth and inﬂation over

the postwar period in the United States. Given investor beliefs about these two fundamentals, we

determine interest rates implied by the model from the intertemporal Euler equation.

    We perform two broad classes of model exercises. First, we consider stationary rational expecta-

tions versions of the model. Here we begin by estimating a stochastic process for U.S. consumption

growth and inﬂation over the entire postwar period. We assume that investor beliefs are the condition-



                                                   2
als of this process, and derive the properties of the model-implied yield curve. The estimated process

in this benchmark exercise has constant conditional variances. As a result, all asset price volatility

derives from changes in investors’ conditional expectations. In particular, the dynamics of yields is

entirely driven by movements in expected consumption growth and inﬂation.

   The benchmark model captures a number of features of observed yields. Both model implied

and observed yields contain a sizeable low frequency component (period > 8 years) that is strongly

correlated with inﬂation. At business cycle frequencies (between 1.5 and 8 years), both the short rate

and the term spread are driven by the business cycle component of inﬂation, which covaries positively

with the former and negatively with the latter. Both a high short rate and a low term spread forecast

recessions, that is, times of low consumption growth. Finally, average yields are increasing, and yield

volatility is decreasing, in the maturity of the bond.

   The fact that the model implies an upward-sloping nominal yield curve depends critically on

both preferences and the distribution of fundamentals. In the standard expected utility case, an asset

commands a premium over another asset only when its payoﬀ covaries more with consumption growth.

Persistence of consumption growth and inﬂation then implies a downward sloping yield curve. When

investors exhibit aversion to persistence, an assets commands a premium also when its payoﬀ covaries

more with news about future consumption growth. The estimated process implies that inﬂation

brings bad news. The implied correlation between growth and inﬂation is critical; if inﬂation and

consumption growth were independent, the yield curve would slope downward even if investors are

averse to persistence.

   The role of inﬂation as bad news suggests that other indicators of future growth might matter for

term premia. Moreover, one might expect the arrival of other news about growth or inﬂation to make

yields more volatile than they are in our benchmark model. In a second exercise, we maintain the

rational expectations assumption, but model investors’ information set more explicitly by exploiting

information contained in yields themselves. In particular, we begin by estimating an unrestricted

stochastic process for consumption growth, inﬂation, the short rate, and the term spread. We then

derive model-implied yields given the information set described by this stochastic process.

   The resulting model-implied yields are very similar to those from our benchmark. It follows

that, viewed through the lens of our consumption-based asset pricing model, inﬂation itself is the key



                                                   3
predictor of future consumption, inﬂation, and yields that generates interest rate volatility. Conditional

on our model, we can rule out the possibility that other variables – such as investors’ perception of

a long run inﬂation target, or information inferred from other asset prices – generates volatility in

yields. Indeed, if observed yields had been generated by a version of our model in which investors

price bonds using better information than we modelers have, our exercise would have recovered that

information from yields.

   We also explore the role of inﬂation as bad news in a class of models that accommodate investor

concern with structural change. Here we construct investor beliefs by sequentially estimating the

stochastic process for fundamentals. We use a constant gain adaptive learning scheme where the

estimation for date t places higher weight on more recent observations. The investor belief for date t is

taken to be the conditional of the process estimated with data up to date t. We then compute a sample

of model-implied yields from the Euler equations, using a diﬀerent investor belief for each date. We

apply this model to consider changes in yield curve dynamics, especially around the monetary policy

experiment.

   It has been suggested that long interest rates were high in the early 1980s because investors at the

time were only slowly adjusting their inﬂation expectations downward. In the context of our model,

this is not a plausible story. Indeed, it is hard to write down a sensible adaptive learning scheme in

which the best forecast of future inﬂation is not close to current inﬂation. Since inﬂation fell much

more quickly in the early 1980s than nominal interest rates, our learning schemes do not generate

much inertia in inﬂation expectations. At the same time, survey expectations of inﬂation also fell

relatively quickly in the early 1980s, along with actual inﬂation and the forecasts in our model.

   We conclude that learning can help understand changes in the yield curve only if it entails changes

in subjective uncertainty that have ﬁrst order eﬀects on asset prices. In a ﬁnal exercise, we explore one

scenario where this happens. In addition to sequential estimation, we introduce parameter uncertainty

which implies that investors cannot easily distinguish permanent and transitory movements in inﬂation.

With patient investors who are averse to persistence, changes in uncertainty then have large eﬀects

on interest rates and term spreads. In particular, the uncertainty generated by the monetary policy

experiment leads to sluggish behavior in interest rates, especially at the long end of the yield curve,

in the early 1980s.



                                                    4
     A by-product of our analysis is a decomposition into real and nominal interest rates, where the

former are driven by expected consumption growth, whereas the latter also move with changes in

expected inﬂation. Importantly, inﬂation as an indicator of future growth aﬀects both nominal and

real interest rates. Loosely speaking, our model says that yields in the 1970s and early 1980s were

driven by nominal shocks – inﬂation surprises – that aﬀect nominal and real rates in opposite directions.

Here an inﬂation surprise lowers real rates because it is bad news for future consumption growth. In

contrast, prior to the 1970s, and again more recently, there were more real shocks – surprises in

consumption growth – that make nominal and real interest rates move together.

     Our model also predicts a downward sloping real yield curve. In contrast to long nominal bonds,

long indexed bonds pay oﬀ when future real interest rates – and hence future expected consumption

growth – are low, thus providing insurance against bad times. Coupled with persistence in growth, this

generates a downward sloping real yield curve in an expected utility model. The eﬀect is reinforced

when investors are averse to persistence. Unfortunately, the available data series on U.S. indexed

bonds, which is short and comes from a period of relatively low interest rates, makes it diﬃcult to

accurately measure average long indexed yields. However, evidence from the United Kingdom suggests

that average term spreads are positive for nominal, but negative for indexed bonds.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the model, motivates our use of recursive

utility and outlines the yield computations. Section III reports results from the benchmark rational

expectations version of the model. Section IV maintains the rational expectations assumption, but

allows for more conditioning information. Section V introduces learning. Section VI reviews related

literature. Appendix A collects our estimation results. Appendix B presents summary statistics about

real rate data from the US and the UK. Appendix C contains results with alternative data deﬁnitions

and estimation strategies.



II     Model

We consider an endowment economy with a representative investor. The endowment – denoted {Ct }

since it is calibrated to aggregate consumption – and inﬂation {πt} are given exogenously. Equilibrium

prices adjust such that the agent is happy to consume the endowment. In the remainder of this section,

we deﬁne preferences and explain how yields are computed.


                                                   5
A.      Preferences


We describe preferences using the recursive utility model proposed by Epstein and Zin (1989) and

Weil (1989), which allows for a constant coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion that can diﬀer from the

reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES). This class of preferences is now common

in the consumption-based asset pricing literature. Campbell (1993, 1996) derives approximate loglinear

pricing formulas (that are exact if the IES is one) to characterize premia and the price volatility of

equity and real bonds. Duﬃe, Schroeder, and Skiadas (1997) derive closed-form solutions for bond

prices in a continuous time version of the model. Restoy and Weil (1998) show how to interpret the

pricing kernel in terms of a concern with news about future consumption. For our computations, we

assume a unitary IES and homoskedastic lognormal shocks, which allows us to use a linear recursion

for utility derived by Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005).

      We ﬁx a ﬁnite horizon T and a discount factor β > 0. The time t utility Vt of a consumption

stream {Ct } is deﬁned recursively by


(1)                                     Vt = Ct1−αt CEt (Vt+1 )αt ,


with VT +1 = 0. Here the certainty equivalent CEt imposes constant relative risk aversion with coeﬃ-

cient γ,
                                                          1/(1−γ)
                                                       1−γ
                                    CEt (Vt+1 ) = Et Vt+1           ,

and the sequence of weights αt is given by

                                                 T −t
                                                                T −t
                                                                
                                                            j
(2)                                      αt :=          β               βj .
                                                 j=1              j=0


If β < 1, the weight αt on continuation utility converges to β as the horizon becomes large. If γ = 1,

the model reduces to standard logarithmic utility. More generally, the risk aversion coeﬃcient can be

larger or smaller than one, the (inverse of the) intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

Discussion

   Recursive preferences avoid the implication of the time-separable expected utility model that de-

cision makers are indiﬀerent to the temporal distribution of risk. A standard example, reviewed by

Duﬃe and Epstein (1992), considers a choice at some date zero between two risky consumption plans

A and B. Both plans promise contingent consumption for the next 100 periods. Under both plans,

consumption in a given period can be either high or low, with the outcome determined by the toss

of a fair coin. However, the consumption stream promised by plan A is determined by repeated coin

tosses: if the toss in period t is heads, consumption in t is high, otherwise consumption in t is low. In

contrast, the consumption stream promised by plan B is determined by a once and for all coin toss

at date 1: if this toss is heads, consumption is high for the next 100 periods, otherwise, consumption

is low for the next 100 periods.

   Intuitively, plan A looks less risky than plan B. Under plan B, all eggs are in one basket, whereas

plan A is more diversiﬁed. If all payoﬀs were realized at the same time, risk aversion would imply a

preference for plan A. However, if the payoﬀs arrive at diﬀerent dates, the standard time-separable

expected utility model implies indiﬀerence between A and B. This holds regardless of risk aversion

and of how little time elapses between the diﬀerent dates. The reason is that the time-separable model

evaluates risks at diﬀerent dates in isolation. From the perspective of time zero, random consumption

at any given date – viewed in isolation – does have the same risk (measured, for example, by the

variance.) What the standard model misses is that the risk is distributed diﬀerently over time for the

two plans: plan A looks less risky since the consumption stream it promises is less persistent.

   According to the preferences (1), the plans A and B are ranked diﬀerently if the coeﬃcient of

relative risk aversion γ is not equal to one. In particular, γ > 1 implies that the agent is averse to the

persistence induced by the initial shock that characterizes plan B and therefore prefers A. This is the

case we consider in this paper. When γ < 1, the agent likes the persistence and prefers B.

   Another attractive property of the utility speciﬁcation (1) is that the motives that govern con-

sumption smoothing over diﬀerent states of nature and consumption smoothing over time are allowed

to diﬀer. For example, an agent with recursive utility and γ > 1 would not prefer an erratic deter-

ministic consumption stream A to a constant stream B. Indeed, there is no reason to assume why the

two smoothing motives should be tied together like in the power utility case, where the risk aversion



                                                    7
coeﬃcient γ is the reciprocal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. After all, the notion of

smoothing over diﬀerent states even makes sense in a static economy with uncertainty, while smoothing

over time is well deﬁned in a dynamic but deterministic economy.

      We specify a (long) ﬁnite horizon T because we want to allow for high discount factors, β > 1.

There is no a priori reason to rule out this case. The usual justiﬁcation for low discount factors is

introspection: when faced with a constant consumption stream, many people would prefer to shift

some consumption into the present. While this introspective argument makes sense in the stochastic

environment in which we actually live – where we may die before we get to consume, and so we want

to consume while we still can – it is not clear whether the argument should apply to discounting in a

deterministic environment with some known horizon (which is the case for which the discount factor

β is designed.)

Pricing kernel

      We divide equation (1) by current consumption to get

                                                                      αt
                                        Vt                 Vt+1 Ct+1
                                           = CEt                             .
                                        Ct                 Ct+1 Ct

Taking logarithms, denoted throughout by small letters, we obtain the recursion


                             vt − ct = αt ln CEt [exp (vt+1 − ct+1 + Δct+1 )] .


Assuming that the variables are conditionally normal, we get

                                                                1
(3)                  vt − ct = αt Et (vt+1 − ct+1 + Δct+1 ) + αt (1 − γ) vart (vt+1 ) .
                                                                2


      Solving the recursion forward and using our assumption that the agent’s beliefs are homoskedastic,

we can express the log ratio of continuation utility to consumption as an inﬁnite sum of expected

discounted future consumption growth,

                                           T
                                            −t
(4)                            vt − ct =          αt,1+i Et (Δct+1+i ) + constant.
                                           i=0


For β < 1 and T = ∞, the weights on expected future consumption growth are simply αt,i = β i . Even

                                                           8
for large ﬁnite T, equation (4) can be viewed as a sum of expected consumption growth with weights

that are independent of the forecasting horizon 1 + i.

      For ﬁnite T , the weights αt,i are given by

                                                    T −t
                                                                   T −t
                                                                   
                                                               j
                                          αt,i :=          β               βj ,
                                                    j=i              j=0


so that αt,1 = αt . For β > 1, the weights on expected future consumption growth are decreasing

and concave in the forecast horizon i. For large T , they remain equal to one for many periods. If

consumption growth reverts to its mean – that is, Et (Δct+1+i ) converges to the unconditional mean

of consumption growth as i becomes large – then the log ratio of continuation utility is approximately

given by the inﬁnite-horizon undiscounted sum of expected consumption growth.

      Payoﬀs denominated in units of consumption are valued by the real pricing kernel

                                                       −1                      1−γ
                                                 Ct+1                 Vt+1
(5)                               Mt+1 = β                                               .
                                                  Ct                CEt (Vt+1 )

The random variable Mt+1 represents the date t prices of contingent claims that pay oﬀ in t + 1. In

particular, the price of a contingent claim that pays oﬀ one unit if some event in t + 1 occurs is equal

to the expected value of the pricing kernel conditional on the event, multiplied by the probability of

the event. In a representative agent model, the pricing kernel is large over events in which the agent

will feel bad: claims written on such events are particularly expensive.

      Again using normality, we obtain the log real pricing kernel

The logarithmic expected utility model (the case γ = 1) describes “bad events” in terms of future

realized consumption growth – the agent feels bad when consumption growth is low. This eﬀect is

represented by the ﬁrst term in the pricing kernel. Recursive utility introduces a new term that

reﬂects a concern with the temporal distribution of risk. In the case we consider, γ > 1, the agent

fears downward revisions in consumption expectations. More generally, a source of risk is not only

reﬂected in asset prices if it makes consumption more volatile, as in the standard model, but it can also

aﬀect prices if it aﬀects only the temporal distribution of risk, for example if it makes consumption

growth more persistent.

      Finally, we deﬁne the log nominal pricing kernel, that we use below to value payoﬀs denominated

in dollars:

The agent’s Euler equation for a real bond that pays 1 unit of consumption n periods later determines
                   (n)
its time-t price Pt      as the expected value of its payoﬀ tomorrow weighted by the real pricing kernel:

For a ﬁxed date t, the real yield curve maps the maturity n of a bond to its real yield yt . Throughout

this paper, we assume that the agent’s beliefs are homoskedastic. To the extent that we observe

heteroskedasticity of yields in the data, we will attribute it to the eﬀect of learning about the dynamics

of fundamentals.

     Analogously, the price of a nominal bond Pt                    satisﬁes the Euler equation (8) with dollar signs

attached. From equations (9) and (10), we can write the nominal yield as
                                                  n                                n

By ﬁxing the date t, we get the nominal yield curve as the function that maps maturity n to the
                 (n)$
nominal yield yt        of a bond.

     Equations (9) and (10) show that log prices and yields of real bonds in this economy are determined

by expected future marginal utility. The log prices and yields of nominal bonds additionally depend

on expected inﬂation. To understand the behavior of yields, it is useful to decompose yields into their

unconditional mean and deviations of yields from the mean. Below, we will see that while the impli-

cations for average yields will depend on whether we assume recursive or expected (log) preferences,

the dynamics of yields – and thus volatility – will be the same for both preference speciﬁcations.

     The dynamics of real yields can be derived from the conditional expectation of the real pricing

kernel (6) together with the yield equation (10). Speciﬁcally, we can write the deviations of real yields
 (n)
yt     from their mean μ(n) as

                                                                    n

                                                         n
                                                                i=1


where μc denotes the mean consumption growth rate. This equation shows that the dynamics of real

yields are driven by changes in expected future consumption growth. Importantly, these dynamics do

not depend on any preference parameters. In particular, the equation (12) is identical for recursive

utility and expected log utility. Of course, equation (12) does depend on the elasticity of intertemporal

substitution, which we have set equal to one.

     Similarly, the dynamics of nominal yields can be derived from the conditional expectation of the

nominal pricing kernel (7) together with the yield equation (11). As a result, we can show that

de-meaned nominal yields are expected nominal growth rates over the lifetime of the bond

The ﬁrst three terms represent the mean real short rate in the log utility case. The latter is high

when β is low, which means that the agent is impatient and does not want to save. An intertemporal

smoothing motive increases the real rate when the mean consumption growth rate μc is high. Finally,

the precautionary savings motive lowers the real rate when the variance of consumption growth is high.

With γ > 1, an additional precautionary savings motive is captured by the covariance term. It not

only lowers interest rates when realized consumption growth is more volatile, but also when it covaries

more with expected consumption growth, that is, when consumption growth is more persistent.

   The mean of the nominal short rate is

There are several reasons for why the Fisher relation fails or, put diﬀerently, for why the short rate

is not simply equal to the real rate plus expected inﬂation. First, the variance of inﬂation enters

due to Jensen’s inequality. Second, the covariance of consumption growth and inﬂation represents an

inﬂation risk premium. Intuitively, nominal bonds – including those with short maturity — are risky

assets. The real payoﬀ from nominal bonds is low in times of surprise inﬂation. If the covariance

between inﬂation and consumption is negative, nominal bonds are unattractive assets, because they

have low real payoﬀs in bad times. In other words, nominal bonds do not provide a hedge against

times of low consumption growth. Investors thus demand higher nominal yields as compensation for

holding nominal bonds. Recursive utility introduces an additional reason why nominal bonds may

be unattractive for investors: their payoﬀs are low in times with bad news about future consumption

growth. These bonds may thus not provide a hedge against times with bad news about the future.

The covariance term on the right-hand size is the risk premium, while the variance term is due to

Jensen’s inequality. Expected excess returns are constant whenever conditional variances are constant,

as in our benchmark belief speciﬁcation. With learning, however, the conditional probabilities that

are used to evaluate the conditional covariances in equation (16) will be derived from diﬀerent beliefs

each period. As a result, expected excess returns will vary over time.

       The risk premium on real bonds is positive when the pricing kernel and long bond prices are

negatively correlated. This correlation is determined by the autocorrelation of marginal utility. The

risk premium is positive if marginal utility is negatively correlated with expected changes in future

marginal utility. In this case, long bonds are less attractive than short bonds, because their payoﬀs

tend to be low in bad times (when marginal utility is high). The same equation also holds for nominal

bonds after we attach dollar signs everywhere. Here, the sign of the risk premium also depends on the

correlation between (nominal) bond prices and inﬂation. Over long enough samples, the average excess

return on an n-period bond is approximately equal to the average spread between the n-period yield

and the short rate.1 This means that the yield curve is on average upward sloping if the right-hand

side of equation (16) is positive on average.

       In our model, expected changes in marginal utility depend on expected future consumption growth.

The expected excess return (16) can therefore be rewritten as

                                        
                                                   n−1

                                                                                              2

Real term premia are thus driven by the covariance of marginal utility with expected consumption

       To see this, we can write the excess return as

For large n and a long enough sample, the diﬀerence between the average (n − 1)-period yield and the average n-period
yield is zero.

kernel with expected nominal growth.



III       Benchmark

In this section, we derive investor beliefs from a state space system for consumption growth and

inﬂation that is estimated with data from the entire postwar sample. The conditional probabilities

that we use to evaluate the agent’s Euler equation, and thus to compute yields, come from this

estimated system.

Data

    We measure aggregate consumption growth with quarterly NIPA data on nondurables and services

and construct the corresponding price index to measure inﬂation. We assume that population growth is

constant. The data on bond yields with maturities one year and longer are from the CRSP Fama-Bliss

discount bond ﬁles. These ﬁles are available for the sample 1952:2-2005:4. The short (1-quarter) yield is

from the CRSP Fama riskfree rate ﬁle. The data and our MATLAB programs can be downloaded from

our websites. Appendix C contains additional results based on alternative inﬂation and population

series.

Beliefs about Fundamentals

    The vector of consumption growth and inﬂation zt+1 = (Δct+1 , πt+1 ) has the state-space repre-

sentation


(19)                                   zt+1 = μz + xt + et+1

                                      xt+1 = φx xt + φx Ket+1


where et+1 ∼ N (0, Ω), the state vector xt+1 is 2-dimensional and contains expected consumption and

inﬂation, φx is the 2 × 2 autoregressive matrix, and K is the 2 × 2 gain matrix. Our benchmark model

                                                     14
assumes that the agent’s beliefs about future growth and inﬂation are described by this state space

system evaluated at the point estimates. Based on these beliefs, the time-t conditional expected values

in the yield equations (12) and (13) are simply linear functions of the state variables xt . We estimate

this system with data on consumption growth and inﬂation using maximum likelihood. Table A.1 in

Appendix A reports parameter estimates.

   The state space system (19) nests a ﬁrst-order Vector-Autoregression. To see this, start from the

VAR zt+1 = μz + φzt + et+1 and set xt = φ (zt − μz ). This will result in a system like (19) but with

K = I (and φx = φ). Since K is a 2 × 2 matrix, setting K = I imposes four parameter restrictions,

which we can test with a likelihood ratio test. The restrictions are strongly rejected based on the

usual likelihood ratio statistic 2 × [L (θunrestricted) − L (θrestricted)] = 34.3, which is greater than the 5

percent and 1 percent critical χ2 (4) values of 9.5 and 13.3, respectively.

   The reason for this rejection is that the state space system does a better job at capturing the

dynamics of inﬂation than the ﬁrst-order VAR. Indeed, quarterly inﬂation has a very persistent com-

ponent, but also a large transitory component, which leads to downward biased estimates of higher

order autocorrelations in the VAR. For example, the nth-order empirical autocorrelations of inﬂation

are .84 for n = 1, .80 for n = 2, .66 for n = 5 and .52 for n = 10. While the state space system matches

these autocorrelations almost exactly (as we will see in Figure 1 below), the VAR only matches the

ﬁrst autocorrelation and understates the others: the numbers are .84 for n = 1, .72 for n = 2, .43 for

n = 5 and .19 for n = 10.

   For our purposes, high-order autocorrelations are important, because they determine long-horizon

forecasts of inﬂation and thus nominal yields through equation (13). By contrast, this issue is not

important for matching the long-horizon forecasts of consumption growth and thus real yields in

equation (12). The autocorrelation function of consumption growth data starts low at .36 for n = 1,

.18 for n = 2 and is essentially equal to zero thereafter. This function can be matched well with a

ﬁrst-order VAR in consumption growth and inﬂation.

   To better understand the properties of the estimated dynamics, we report covariance functions

which completely characterize the linear Gaussian system (19) . Figure 1 plots covariance functions

computed from the model and from the raw data. At 0 quarters, these lines represent variances and

contemporaneous covariances. The black lines from the model match the gray lines in the data quite

The variance of consumption growth is .22 in model and data, which amounts to .22 × 42 = 1.88

percent volatility. Figure 1 shows that consumption growth is weakly positively autocorrelated. For

example, the covariance cov(Δct, Δct−1 ) = ρ var(Δct) = ρ × .22 = 0.08 in model and data which

implies that the ﬁrst-order autocorrelation is ρ = .36. Inﬂation is clearly more persistent, with an

autocorrelation of 84%.


                                                 16
   An important feature of the data is that consumption growth and inﬂation are negatively correlated

contemporaneously and forecast each other with a negative sign. For example, the upper right panel

in Figure 1 shows that high inﬂation is a leading recession indicator. Higher inﬂation in quarter t

predicts lower consumption growth in quarter t + n even n = 6 quarters ahead of time. The lower left

panel shows that high consumption also forecasts low inﬂation, but with a shorter lead time. These

cross-predictability patterns will be important for determining longer yields.

   From equations (12) and (13) we know that the dynamics of equilibrium interest rates are driven by

forecasts of growth and inﬂation. Real yield movements are generated by changes in growth forecasts

over the lifetime of the bond, while nominal yield movements are generated by changing nominal

growth forecasts. To understand the conditional dynamics of these forecasts better – as opposed to

the unconditional covariances and thus univariate regression forecasts from Figure 1 – we plot impulse

responses in Figure 2. These responses represent the change in forecasts following a 1-percent shock

et+1 . The signs of the own-shock responses are not surprising in light of the unconditional covariances;

they are positive and decay over time. This decay is slower for inﬂation, where a 1-percent surprise

increases inﬂation forecasts by 40 basis points even two years down the road. However, the cross-shock

responses reveal some interesting patterns. The middle left plot shows that a 1-percent growth surprise

predicts inﬂation to be higher by roughly 20 basis points over the next 2-3 years. The top right plot

shows that a 1-percent inﬂation surprise lowers growth forecasts over the next year by roughly 10 bp.

   While we can read oﬀ the impulse responses of real rates directly from the top row of plots in

Figure 2, we need to combine the responses from the top two rows of plots to get the response of

nominal growth or, equivalently, nominal interest rates. This is done in the bottom row of plots in

Figure 2. Here, inﬂation and growth surprises both lead to higher nominal growth forecasts – even

over longer horizons. From the previous discussion, we know that this eﬀect is entirely due to the

long-lasting eﬀect of both types of shocks on inﬂation. These ﬁndings imply that growth surprises and

inﬂation surprises move short-maturity real rates in opposite directions, but won’t aﬀect long-maturity

real rates much. In contrast, growth and inﬂation surprises aﬀect even longer-maturity nominal rates,

because they have long-lasting eﬀects on inﬂation forecasts. In particular, these shocks move nominal

rates in the same direction.

   An inspection of the surprises et+1 in equation (19) reveals that the historical experience in the

U.S. is characterized by a concentration of large nominal shocks in the 1970s and early 1980s. (We do

not include a plot for space reasons.) Outside this period, inﬂation shocks occurred rarely and were

relatively small. By contrast, real surprises happened throughout the sample and their average size

did not change much over time. As a consequence, our benchmark model says that yields in the 1970s

and early 1980s were mainly driven by nominal shocks – inﬂation surprises – that aﬀect nominal and

real rates in opposite directions. Here an inﬂation surprise lowers real rates because it is bad news

for future consumption growth. In contrast, prior to the 1970s, and again more recently, there were

more real shocks – surprises in consumption growth – that make nominal and real interest rates move

together.




                                                         18
Preference Parameters and Equilibrium Yields

      The model’s predictions for yields are entirely determined by the agent’s beliefs about fundamentals

and two preference parameters, the discount factor β and the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion γ. We

select values for the preference parameters to match the average short and long end of the nominal

yield curve. For our benchmark, those values are β = 1.005 and γ = 59. These numbers indicate

that the agent does not discount the future and is highly risk averse. The nominal short rate and the

spread implied by the benchmark model are shown in Figure 3. The benchmark model produces many

of the movements that we observe in the data. For example, higher nominal growth expectations in

the mid 1970s and early 1980s make the nominal short rate rise sharply.

Average Nominal Yields

      Panel A in Table 1 compares the properties of average nominal yields produced by the model with

those in the data. Interestingly, the model with recursive utility produces, on average, an upward

sloping nominal yield curve – a robust stylized fact in the data. The average diﬀerence between the

5-year yield and the 3–month yield in the data is roughly 1 percentage point, or 100 basis points (bp).

This diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant; it is measured with a 13 bp standard error. By contrast,

the average level of the nominal yield curve is not measured precisely. The standard errors around

the 5.15 percent average short end and the 6.14 percent average long end of the curve are roughly 40

bp. The intuitive explanation behind the positive slope is that high inﬂation means bad news about

future consumption. During times of high inﬂation, nominal bonds have low payoﬀs. Since inﬂation

aﬀects the payoﬀs of long bonds more than those of short bonds, agents requires a premium, or high

yields, to hold them.

      Panel A in Table 1 also shows that the average nominal yield curve in the data has more curvature

than the curve predicted by the model. A closer look reveals that the curvature in the data comes

mostly from the steep incline from the 3-month maturity to the 1-year maturity. If we leave out

the extreme short end of the curve, the model is better able to replicate its average shape.2 This

idea is explored in the line ”Benchmark Model 1-5 year” where we select parameter values to match

the average 1-year and 5-year yields. The resulting parameter values are β = 1.004 and γ = 43.

A potential explanation for the steep incline in the data are liquidity issues that may depress short

      Note: Panel A reports annualized means of nominal yields in the 1952:2-2005:4 quarterly data sample and
     the various models indicated. “SE” represent standard errors computed with GMM based on 4 Newey-West
     lags. “SE Spreads” represent standard errors around the average spreads between the indicated yields. For
     example, the 0.99 percentage point average spread between the 5-year yield and the 1-quarter yield has a
     standard error of 0.13 percentage points.


    In contrast, the expected utility model generates average nominal yield curves that are downward
sloping. For the case with expected log utility, the negative slope is apparent from line 3 in Panel A.
To see what happens in the more general case with coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion γ, we need to
re-derive the equation for expected excess returns (18). The equation becomes

growth becomes more and more important, and the real yield curve becomes steeply downward sloping.
Since this eﬀect is quadratic in γ, it even leads to a downward-sloping nominal curve. The intuitive
explanation is that long real bonds have high payoﬀs precisely when current and future expected con-
sumption growth is low. This makes them attractive assets to hold and so the real yield curve slopes
down. When γ is high, this eﬀect dominates also for nominal bonds.
Average Real Yields
    At the preference parameters we report, the benchmark model also produces a downward sloping
real yield curve. The short real rate is already low, .84 percent, while long real rates are an additional
.60 percentage point lower. It is diﬃcult to assess the plausibility of this property of the model without
a long sample on real yields for the United States. In the United Kingdom, where indexed bonds have
been trading for a long time, the real yield curve seems to be downward sloping. Table B.3 reports
statistics for these bonds. For the early sample (January 1983 – November 1995), these numbers are
taken from Table 1 in Evans (1998). For the period after that (December 1995 – March 2006), we use
data from the Bank of England website. Relatedly, Table 1 in Barr and Campbell (1997) documents
that average excess returns on real bonds in the U.K. are negative.
    In the United States, indexed bonds, so-called TIPS, have started trading only recently, in 1997.
During this time period, the TIPS curve has been mostly upward sloping. For example, mutual funds
that hold TIPS – such as the Vanguard Inﬂation-Protected Securities Fund – have earned substantial
returns, especially during the early years. Based on the raw TIPS data, J. Huston McCulloch has
constructed real yield curves. Table B.4 in Appendix B documents that the average real yield curve


                                                         22
in these data is upward sloping. The average real short rate is .8 percent, while the average 5-year
yield is 2.2 percent.
    These statistics have to be interpreted with appropriate caution. First, the short sample for which
we have TIPS data and, more importantly, the low risk of inﬂation during this short sample make
it diﬃcult to estimate averages. Second, TIPS are indexed to lagged CPI levels, so that additional
assumptions are needed to compute ex ante real rates from these data. Third, there have been only
few issues of TIPS, so that the data are sparse across the maturity spectrum. Finally, TIPS were
highly illiquid at the beginning. The high returns on TIPS during these ﬁrst years of trading may
reﬂect liquidity premia instead of signaling positive real slopes.
Volatility of Real and Nominal Yields
    Table 2 reports the volatility of real and nominal yields across the maturity spectrum. We only
report one row for the benchmark recursive utility model and the (log) expected utility model, because
the two models imply the same yield dynamics in equations (12) and (13). Panel A shows that the
benchmark model produces a substantial amount of volatility for the nominal short rate. According
to the estimated state space model (19), changes in expected fundamentals – consumption growth
and inﬂation – are able to account for 1.8 percent volatility in the short rate. This number is lower
than the 2.9 percent volatility in the data, but the model is two-thirds there. In contrast, the model
predicts a smooth real short rate. This eﬀect is due to the low persistence of consumption growth.

    Panel A also reveals that the model predicts much less volatility for long yields relative to short
yields. For example, the model-implied 5-year yield has a volatility of 1.1 percent, while the 5-year
yield in the data has a volatility of 2.7 percent. While the volatility curve in the data is also downward
sloping, the slope of this curve is less pronounced than in the model. This relationship between the
volatility of long yields relative to the volatility of short yields is the excess volatility puzzle. This puzzle
goes back to Shiller (1979) who documents that long yields derived from the expectations hypothesis
are not volatile enough. According to the expectations hypothesis, long yields are conditional expected
values of future short rates. It turns out that the persistence of the short rate is not high enough to
generate enough volatility for long yields. Shiller’s argument applies to our benchmark speciﬁcation,

                                                       23
because risk premia in equation (17) are constant, and the expectations hypothesis holds. Below, we
will show that our speciﬁcation with learning produces more volatility for long yields.
    Panel B shows that the volatility curve of real bonds also slopes down. Tables B.3 and B.4 in
Appendix B show that this feature is also present in the U.K. indexed yield data and the McCullogh
real yields for the U.S.
Frequency Decompositions and the Monetary Experiment
    To better understand the properties of the model, we use a band-pass ﬁlter to estimate trend and
cyclical components of yields. The ﬁlters isolate business-cycle ﬂuctuations in yields that persist for
periods between 1.5 and 8 years from those that persist longer than 8 years. Figure 5 plots the various
estimated components. The top left panel shows the low frequency components of the model-implied
short rate as well as the observed short rate and inﬂation. The plots shows that the model captures
the fact that the low frequency component in nominal yields is strongly correlated with inﬂation. At
these low frequencies, the main diﬀerence between model and data is the experience of the mid 1980s.

When inﬂation started to come down at the end of the 1970s, nominal yields stayed high well into the
1980s. According to benchmark beliefs – which are estimated over the whole data sample and which
ignore parameter uncertainty – inﬂation forecasts came down as soon as inﬂation started to decline.
The basic mechanism behind these changes in inﬂation expectations is persistence; since inﬂation is
close to a random walk, inﬂation forecasts for next quarter are close to this quarter’s value of inﬂation.
As a consequence, inﬂation forecasts in the early 1980s fell dramatically, right after inﬂation went
down. In the model, changes in the nominal short rate during this period are driven by changes in
inﬂation expectations, and so the short rate falls as well. Below, we will explore how these ﬁndings
are aﬀected by learning.
    The top right panel in Figure 5 shows the business cycle movements of the same three series:
nominal rate in data and model together with inﬂation. At this frequency, the short rate is driven by
the business cycle movements in inﬂation. The model captures this eﬀect, but does not generate the
amplitude of these swings in the data. The bottom right panel in Figure 5 shows the business cycle
movements in data on the spread and consumption growth together with those in the model. The
plot reveals that the three series are strongly correlated at this frequency. In contrast, the bottom left
panel shows that the series do not have clear low-frequency components.
Autocorrelation of Yields
    Another feature of the benchmark model is that it does a good job matching the high autocorre-
lation of short and long yields, as shown in Table 3. The autocorrelation in the nominal short rate is
93.6 percent, while the model produces 93.4 percent. For the 5-year nominal yield, the autocorrelation
in the model is 94.8 percent and only slightly underpredicts the autocorrelation in the data, which is
96.5 percent. These discrepancies are well within standard error bounds. As in the data, long yields
in the model are more persistent than short yields. These ﬁndings are quite remarkable, because we
did not use any information from nominal yields to ﬁt the dynamics of the state space system.

IV     The Role of Investor Information

In the benchmark exercise of the previous section, the fundamentals – inﬂation and consumption
growth – play two roles. On the one hand, they determine the pricing kernel: all relevant asset prices


                                                      25
can be written in terms of their conditional moments. On the other hand, they represent investors’
information set: all conditional moments are computed given the past record of consumption growth
and inﬂation, and nothing else. This is not an innocuous assumption. It is plausible that investors
use other macroeconomic variables in order to forecast consumption growth and inﬂation. Moreover,
investors typically rely on sources of information that do not come readily packaged as statistics, such
their knowledge of institutional changes or future monetary policy.
    In this section, we extend the model to accommodate a larger investor information set. In particu-
lar, we use yields themselves to model agents’ information. We proceed in two steps. First, we estimate
an unrestricted state space system of the type (19) that contains not only consumption growth and
inﬂation, but also the short rate and the yield spread. At this stage, we ignore the fact that the model
itself places restrictions on the joint dynamics of these variables – the only purpose of the estimation
is to construct agents’ information set. The second step of the exercise is then the same as in the
benchmark case: we compute model-implied yields and compare them to the yields in the data.
    The motivation for this particular way of modelling investor information comes from the theoretical
model itself. If the data were in fact generated by a model economy in which yields are equal to
investors’ expectations of consumption growth and inﬂation, our approach would perfectly recover all
investor information relevant for the analysis of the yield curve. To illustrate, suppose that the short
rate is given by
                                 (1)$
                               yt = Et [Δct+1 + πt+1 |It] + constant,
where It is the investor information set, which contains past consumption growth, inﬂation, and yields,
but perhaps also other variables that we do not know about.
    Suppose further that our unrestricted estimation delivers the true joint distribution of Δct+1 , πt+1 ,
 (1)$      (20)$
yt    and yt     . The sequence of model-implied short rates computed in the second step of our exercise,
is then, up to a constant,
                                                                          t
                             Et Δct+1 + πt+1 | Δcτ , πτ , yτ(1)$ , yτ(20)$         .
                                                                            τ =1

                                                                                                    $(1)
The law of iterated expectations implies that this sequence should exactly recover the data yt . A
similar argument holds for the yield spread. The series of model-implied yield changes would thus be
identical to yield changes in the data. In other words, if the benchmark model replicates observed
yield changes for some information structure under rational expectations, then it will generate observed
yield changes also under the particular information structure we consider here.
    The joint model of fundamentals and yields takes the same general form as the system (19), except
that it allows for four state variables and four observables, which implies that 42 parameters must
be estimated. Table A.2 in Appendix contains these parameter estimates. Figure 6 compares the
autocovariance functions of the four observables in the data and for the estimated model. A ﬁrst order
state space structure appears to do a reasonable job in capturing the joint dynamics of fundamentals
and yields. According to these estimated dynamics, low short rates and high spreads predict lower
consumption growth. Moreover, high short rates and low spreads predict high inﬂation rates. To key
question for our model is whether these real and nominal growth predictions arise from additional
information contained in yields.
   When we compute the model-implied short rate and term spread with a “Large Info Set”, they
look very much like those from the benchmark. Figure 7 plots these series, together with the data
and the benchmark results. Summary statistics on model-implied yields from this “Large Info Set”
model are also included in Tables 1 and 2. Interestingly, average nominal yields in Table 1 based on

a “Large Info Set” are somewhat lower than in the benchmark, when we evaluate the two models at
the same preference parameter values. The intuitive explanation is that more information lowers risk
in the model. Line 5 of Table 1 re-phrases this ﬁnding: if we want to match the average slope of the
nominal yield curve with a “Large Info Set”, we need to rely on more risk aversion, γ = 85 instead
of the benchmark value of γ = 59, and a similar discount factor β = 1.005. Nevertheless, the results
are overall very similar to the benchmark case. We conclude that not much is lost by restricting the
investor information set to contain only past inﬂation and consumption growth.
    The key point from this exercise is that the short rate and the yield spread do not contain much
more information about future consumption growth and inﬂation than is already contained current
and past consumption growth and inﬂation. Another way to see this is to run regressions of future
                                                                                 (1)$       (20)$

Newey-West standard errors.) The coeﬃcients on yields are not signiﬁcant and also economically tiny,
around 0.0015. The R2 in this regression is 16%. In 4-step ahead and 8-step ahead growth regressions,
inﬂation becomes more important, but yields remain insigniﬁcant. In the one-step ahead nominal
growth regression, we ﬁnd the same pattern. The coeﬃcient on consumption is .21 with a t-stat of
2.5, the coeﬃcient of inﬂation is .58 with a t-stat of 5.1, and yields do not enter signiﬁcantly. The R2
of this regression is 31%. In the 4-step ahead and 8-step ahead nominal growth regressions, we get the
same patterns. We can conclude that the bivariate autocovariances between, say, current consumption
growth and lagged spreads in Figure 6 do not survive in multivariate regressions.
    Our results may appear surprising in light of the observed volatility in yields. On the one hand,
one might have expected that it is always easy to back out a latent factor from observed yields that
generates a lot of volatility in model-implied yields as well.3 On the other hand, it would seem easy
to change the information structure of the model in order to have information released earlier, again
making conditional expectations, and hence yields, more volatile. However, an important feature of
the exercise here is that we not only compute model-implied yields from an Euler equation, but also
check the correlation of model implied and observed yields.
    To see the diﬀerence between our exercise and other ways of dealing with information unknown to
the modeler, consider the following stylized example. Assume that the true data generating process
for consumption growth is constant, while inﬂation and the short rate are both iid with unit variance,
but independent of each other. If we had performed our benchmark exercise on these data, we would
have found an iid inﬂation process. With constant consumption growth and iid inﬂation, computing
the short rate from the Euler equation would have delivered a constant model-implied nominal short
rate, which is much less volatile than the observed short rate.
     Now consider two alternative exercises. Exercise A assumes that investors’ expected inﬂation is
driven by a perceived “inﬂation target”, which is backed out from the short rate (for simplicity, suppose
it is set equal to the short rate). Exercise B assumes that investors’ expected inﬂation is driven by
a perceived inﬂation target that is equal to next period’s realized inﬂation. This exercise may be
motivated by the fact that investors read the newspaper and know more than past published numbers
at the time they trade bonds. Suppose further that both exercises maintain the assumption that
the Euler equation holds: model-implied short rates are computed as investors’ subjective expected
inﬂation. Both exercises then generate model-implied short rates that – when viewed in isolation –
have exactly the same distribution as observed short rates.
    In spite of their success in generating volatility, both exercises miss key aspects of the joint distri-
bution of inﬂation and the short rate. In Exercise A, model-implied expected inﬂation is independent
of actual inﬂation one period ahead, which is inconsistent with rational expectations. This happens
because the inﬂation target is backed out from the short rate, which here moves in the data for reasons
that have nothing to do with inﬂation or inﬂation expectations. In Exercise B, the model implied short
rate is perfectly correlated with inﬂation one period ahead, while these variables are independent in
the data.
    The exercise of this section avoids the problems of either Exercise A or B. If the ﬁrst step estimation
had been done using the example data, we would have found independence of inﬂation and the short
rate. As a result, the model-implied short rate based on the estimated information set would be
   3
    Indeed, the quarterly variation in bond yields is well explained using a statistical factor model with only two latent
factors, or principal components. Intuitively, the lion share of the movements in nominal yields are up/down movements
across the curve. The ﬁrst principal component of yields captures these so-called “level” movements which explain
98.22% of the total variation in yields. An additional 1.58% of the movements in yields is captured by the second
principal component, which represents movements in the slope of the curve. Together, “level” and “slope” explain
almost all, 99.80%, of the variation in yields.

exactly the same as in the benchmark case. The model would thus again imply constant short rates.
We would thus have correctly inferred that yields do not contain information about future inﬂation
and consumption growth, than is contained in the fundamentals themselves. As a result, any model
economy where the Euler equation holds and beliefs are formed via rational expectations produces
model-implied yields that are less volatile than observed yields.


V      Learning

In the benchmark exercise of Section III, investor beliefs about fundamentals are assumed to be
conditional probabilities of a process that was estimated using all data through 2005. This approach
has three a priori unattractive properties. First, it ignores the fact that investors in, say, 1980 only
had access to data up to 1980. Second, it assumes that agents believed in the same stationary model
throughout the postwar period. This is problematic given that the 1970s are often viewed as a period
of structural change. Indeed, the decade witnessed the ﬁrst ever peacetime inﬂation in the US, the
breakdown of leading macroeconomic models, as well as signiﬁcant innovation in bond markets. Third,
the benchmark beliefs were based on point estimates of the forcing process, ignoring the fact that the
parameters of the process itself are not estimated with perfect precision, and investors know this.
    In this section, we construct a sequence of investor beliefs that do not suﬀer from the above
drawbacks. We maintain the hypothesis that, at every date t, investors form beliefs based on a state
space system of the form (19). However, we reestimate the system for every date t using only data
up to date t. To accommodate investor concern with structural change, we maximize a modiﬁed
likelihood function that puts more weight on more recent observations. To model investor concern
with parameter uncertainty, we combine the state space dynamics with a Bayesian learning scheme
about mean fundamentals.


A.     Beliefs

Formally, beliefs for date t are constructed in three steps. We ﬁrst remove the mean from the funda-
mentals zt = (Δct, πt) . Let υ ∈ (0, 1) denote a “forget factor” that deﬁnes a sequence of geometrically
declining sample weights. The weighted sample mean for date t is
                                                 t−1           −1 t−1
                                                                  
                                                            i
(21)                                μ̂z (t) =           υ                υ izt−i .
                                                 i=0              i=0

The sequence of estimated means for consumption growth and inﬂation picks up the low frequency
components in fundamentals.
Adaptive Learning
    In a second step, we estimate the state space system (19) using data up to date t by minimizing
the criterion

                 i=0

starting at x0 = 0. Maximum likelihood estimation amounts to the special case υ = 1; it minimizes
the equally weighted sum of squared in-sample forecast errors. In contrast, the criterion (22) penalizes
recent forecast errors more heavily than those in the distant past. Ljung and Soderstrom (1987) and

                                                        30
Sargent (1993) advocate this approach to adaptive learning in situations where the dynamics of a
process may change over time.
     The forget factor υ determines how quickly past data are downweighted. For most of our results,
we use υ = .99, which implies that the data point from 17 years ago receives about one half the
weight of the most recent data point. To allow an initial sample for the estimation, the ﬁrst belief
is constructed for 1965:1. The analysis of yields in this section will thus be restricted to the period
since 1965. As in the benchmark case, the estimation step not only delivers estimates for the matrices
φx , K and Ω, but also estimates for the sequence of states (xτ )tτ =1 , starting from x0 = 0. In particular,
we obtain an estimate of the current state xt that can be taken as the basis for forecasting future
fundamentals under the system estimated with data up to date t.
    Figure 8 illustrates how the dynamics of consumption growth and inﬂation has changed over time.
In each panel, we plot estimated impulse responses to consumption growth and inﬂation surprises,
given data up to the ﬁrst quarter of 1968, 1980 and 2005. In a rough sense, the three selected years
represent “extreme points” in the evolution of the dynamics: impulse responses for years between
1968 and 1980 would for the most part lie in between the lines for these two years, and similarly for
the period 1980-2005. The response of real growth to a growth surprise has not changed much over
the years. In contrast, an inﬂation surprise led to a much larger revision of inﬂation forecasts – at all
horizons – in 1980 than in 1968; the eﬀect has diminished again since then.
    Growth surprises also had a larger (positive) eﬀect on inﬂation forecasts in 1980 than either before
or after. While this is again true for all forecast horizons, the eﬀect of inﬂation surprises on growth
forecasts changed diﬀerently by horizon. For short horizons, it has decreased over time; only for longer
horizons is it largest in 1980. The bottom line is that both the persistence of inﬂation and its role as
an indicator of bad times became temporarily stronger during the great inﬂation of the 1970s.
    Performing the estimation step for every date t delivers not only sequences of parameter estimates,
but also estimates of the current state xt . Computing conditional distributions given xt date by date
produces a sequence of investor beliefs. The subjective belief at date t determines investors’ evaluation
of future utility and asset payoﬀs at date t. We thus use this belief below to calculate expectations
of the pricing kernel, that is, yields, for date t. In contrast to the benchmark approach, the exercise
of this section does not impose any direct restriction on beliefs across diﬀerent dates; for example, it
does not requires that all beliefs are conditionals of the same probability over sequences of data. The
updating of beliefs is thus implicit in the sequential estimation.
    The model also does not impose a direct link between investor beliefs and some “true data gener-
ating process”, as the benchmark approach does by imposing rational expectations. The belief at date
t captures investors’ subjective distribution over fundamentals at date t. It is constrained only by past
observations (via the estimation step), and not by our (the modelers’) knowledge of what happened
later. At the same time, our approach does impose structural knowledge on the part of investors:
their theory of asset prices is based on the representative agent preferences that we use.
Parameter Uncertainty
    The third step in our construction of beliefs introduces parameter uncertainty. Here we focus
exclusively on uncertainty about the estimated means. Our goal is to capture the intuition that, in
times of structural change, it becomes more diﬃcult to distinguish permanent and transitory changes
in the economy. We thus assume that, as of date t, the investor views both the true mean μz and the
current persistent (but transitory) component xt as random. The distribution of zt can be represented

by a system with four state variables:

                                   zτ +1 = μz + xτ + eτ +1 ,
                                                                      

(23)                                     =                      +              .

The matrices φx , K and Ω are assumed to be known and are taken from the date t estimation step.
   In order to describe investors’ perception of risk, it is helpful to rewrite (23) so that investors’
conditional expectations – rather than the unobservables μz and x – are the state variables. Let μ̂z (τ )
and x̂τ denote investors’ expectations of μz and xτ , respectively, given their initial knowledge at date




                                                       32
t as well as data up to date τ . We can rewrite (23) as

                               zτ +1 = μ̂z (τ ) + x̂τ + êτ +1 ,
                                                                              

(24)                                 =                              +                  êτ +1 ,
                        x̂τ +1             0 φx              x̂τ       φx Kz (τ + 1)

where êτ +1 is investors’ one step ahead forecast error of the data zτ +1 . The matrices Kμ (τ + 1) and
Kz (τ + 1) can be derived by applying Bayes’ Rule. They vary over time, because the learning process
is nonstationary. Early on, the investor expects to adjust his estimate of, say, mean inﬂation, a lot in
response to an inﬂation shock. As time goes by, the estimate of the mean converges, and the matrix
Kμ converges to zero, while the matrix Kz reverts to the matrix K from (19).
    To complete the description of investors’ belief, it remains to specify the initial distribution of μz
and xt at date t. We assume that these variables are jointly normally distributed, with the mean of
μz given by the point estimate (21) and the mean of xt given by its point estimate from the date t
estimation step. To specify the variance, we ﬁrst compute the weighted sum of squares
                                    t−1           −1 t−1
                                                     
(25)                    Σz (t) =           υ   i
                                                            υ i (zt−i − μ̂z (t)) (zt−i − μ̂z (t)) .
                                    i=0              i=0

This provides a measure of overall uncertainty that the investor has recently experienced. We then
compute the variance of the estimates (μ̂z (t) , x̂t) under the assumption that the system (24) was
initialized at some date t − n, at a variance of Σz (t) for μz (t − n) and a variance of zero for xt−n .
    The idea here is to have investors’ relative date t uncertainty about μz and x depend not only on
the total variance in recent history, captured by Σz (t) , but also by the nature of recent dynamics,
captured by the estimation step. For example, it should have been easier to disentangle temporary
and permanent movements in inﬂation from the data if inﬂation has been less persistent recently. The
above procedure captures such eﬀects. Indeed, the main source of variation in investor beliefs for
this exercise comes from the way the estimated dynamics of Figure 8 change the probability that an
inﬂation surprise signals a permanent change in inﬂation. The patterns for yields we report below
remain essentially intact if we initialize beliefs at the same variance Σz for all periods t. Similarly, the
results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of n. For the results below, we use n = 25 years.
    The presence of parameter uncertainty adds permanent components to the impulse responses of
growth and inﬂation surprises. This is because a surprise ê changes the estimate of the unconditional
mean, which is relevant for forecasting at any horizon. The direction of change is given by the
coeﬃcients in the Kμ matrices. In particular, the matrix Kμ (t) will determine investors’ subjective
covariances between forecasts of growth and inﬂation in period t + 1 – the key determinants of risk
premia in the model. For the typical date t, the coeﬃcients in Kμ (t) reﬂect similar correlation patterns
as the impulse responses in Figure 8. Growth surprises increase the estimates of both mean growth
and mean inﬂation. Inﬂation surprises aﬀect mean inﬂation positively, and mean growth negatively.


B.     Yields

To compute yields, we evaluate equation (11), where all conditional means and variances for date t are
evaluated under the date t subjective distribution. The results are contained in Table 4 and Figure
9, which shows realized yields predicted by the model. We report two types of results. The results
in Table 4 allow only for adaptive learning, without parameter uncertainty. For this case, we select
the preference parameters so that the model matches the mean short rate and term spread, as for the

       Note: The implications of the learning models can only be studied from 1965:1 onwards, because we need
       some initial observations to start the algorithms.


    Implementing the case of parameter uncertainty for patient investors (β ≥ 1) requires us to choose
a third parameter, the planning horizon T . To see why, consider how continuation utility (4) enters
the pricing kernel (6). Utility next quarter depends on next quarter’s forecasts of future consumption
growth, up to the planning horizon. As discussed above, the case of parameter uncertainty adds a
permanent component to the impulse response of, say, an inﬂation surprise: an inﬂation surprise next
quarter will lower expected consumption growth for all quarters up to the planning horizon. The
“utility surprise” vt+1 − Etvt+1 therefore depends on the length of the planning horizon. Intuitively,
an investor who lives longer and cares more strongly about the future, is more aﬀected by the outcomes
of future learning.4
   It follows that, for patient investors with a long planning horizon, the eﬀect of risk on utility
can be as large (or larger) as the eﬀect of mean consumption growth and inﬂation. Since parameter
uncertainty becomes the main driver of risk premia in this case, the planning horizon and the risk
aversion coeﬃcient have similar eﬀects on the model results. For the results below, we use T =
25000 years and γ = 4, together with β = 1. At these parameter values, the model has interesting
implications for the behavior of the short rate and spread during the monetary experiment.




   4
    This eﬀect is not present without parameter uncertainty, because the random component of future consumption
growth forecasts then converges to zero with the forecast horizon. Therefore, as long as the planning horizon is long
enough, it does not matter for the utility surprise even if β > 1.

Adaptive Learning
    The short rate in the economy with adaptive learning (not shown) behaves similarly to that in
the benchmark model as long as there is little turbulence – the 1960s and early 1970s, and the 1990s.
However, the model generates signiﬁcantly higher short rates during the monetary experiment and also
somewhat higher rates during the mid 1980s. The new movements are brought about by changes in
the dynamics. In particular, the investor’s subjective covariance between inﬂation and future expected
consumption increased a lot around 1980. This development was not just due to inﬂation volatility:
the correlation between inﬂation and future consumption also increased. As the stagﬂation experience
of the 1970s made its way into the beliefs of adaptive learners, our basic “inﬂation as bad news”
mechanism was thus reinforced.
    Since inﬂation became such an important carrier of bad news, the 1980s not only increased the
inﬂation premium on short bonds in the adaptive learning economy, but also introduced large spikes
in the term spread. In the data, the high short rates of 1980 were accompanied by historically low
term spreads. In contrast, the adaptive learning model generates a large term spread, for the same
reason as it generates high short rates. Apart from this outlier, the model economy does exhibit a low
frequency trend in the spread, with higher spreads after the 1980s than before.
   Model implied yields from the adaptive learning economy are remarkably similar to the benchmark
model immediately after the monetary experiment ended. The reason is that inﬂation forecasts from
both models drop immediately as inﬂation itself comes down. This result is quite robust to alternative
speciﬁcations of the learning scheme, obtained for example by changing the forget rate or switching
from geometric downweighting to a rolling window approach. We conclude that learning does not
induce inertia in inﬂation forecasts that can explain why interest rates remained high in the early
1980s.
Parameter Uncertainty
    The results with parameter uncertainty also look very diﬀerent in the early 1980s compared to
other years. The short rate tracks the benchmark until the late 1970s. However, it then peaks at a
higher rate in 1981 and it remains high thereafter. Parameter uncertainty thus generates the sluggish
adjustment of yields at the end of the monetary experiment. The economy with parameter uncertainty
also exhibits a transition of the spread from negative values in the late 1970s to historically high values
throughout the ﬁrst half of the 1980s. A similar transition took place in the data. Towards the end
of the sample, yields and spreads come down again; especially for the latter, the decline is more
pronounced than in the data.5
    Importantly, this is not due to sluggish inﬂation expectations: by design, inﬂation forecasts are the
same in the adaptive learning and the parameter uncertainty exercises. Instead, the role of inﬂation as
bad news is here enhanced by the diﬃculty investors face in disentangling permanent from transitory
moves in inﬂation. The increase in parameter uncertainty through the 1970s implies that, in the
early 1980s, there is a greater chance that an inﬂation surprise signals a permanent shift in inﬂation
that would generate bad news. Since the (subjective) means of inﬂation and consumption growth are
also negatively correlated, the inﬂation surprise would generate permanent bad news. For a patient
investor, we obtain large movements in risk premia.
   5
     The parameter uncertainty model also generates low spreads at the beginning of the sample. As for the adaptive
learning model, the behavior in this period is driven in part by the fact that the samples used in the sequential estimation
are as yet rather short.

VI     Related Literature

The literature on the term structure of interest rates is vast. In addition to a substantial body of
work that documents the behavior of short and long interest rates and summarizes it using statistical
and arbitrage-free models, there are literatures on consumption based asset pricing models, as well as
models of monetary policy and the business cycle that have implications for yields. There is also a
growing set of papers that documents the importance of structural change in the behavior of interest
rates and the macroeconomy. We discuss these groups of papers in turn.
Statistical and Arbitrage-Free Models
    Average nominal yields are increasing and concave in maturity. Excess returns on nominal bonds
are positive on average and also increasing in maturity. They are also predictable using interest
rate information (Fama and Bliss 1987, Campbell and Shiller 1991). The latter fact contradicts the
expectations hypothesis, which says that long rates are simply averages of expected future short rates,
up to a constant. The expectations hypothesis also leads to an “excess volatility puzzle” for long
bond prices, which is similar to the excess volatility of stock prices: under rational expectations, one
cannot reconcile the high volatility of nominal rates with observed persistence in short rates (Shiller
1979). A related literature documents “excess sensitivity” of long rates to particular shocks, such as
macroeconomic announcements (Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson 2005).
    Another stylized fact is that nominal yields of all maturities are highly correlated. Litterman
and Scheinkman (1991) have shown that a few principal components explain much of the variation
in yields. For example, in our quarterly postwar panel data, 99.8% of the variation is explained by
the ﬁrst and second principal components. Here the elephant in the room is the ﬁrst component,
which alone captures 98.2% of this variation and stands for the “level” of the yield curve. The second
component represents changes the “slope” of the curve, while the third principal component represents
“curvature” changes.
    This fact has motivated a large literature on arbitrage-free models of the term structure. The
goal here is to summarize the dynamics of the entire yield curve using a few unobservable factors.
Recent work in this area explores the statistical relationship between term structure factors and
macroeconomic variables. For example, the arbitrage-free model in Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2006)
captures the role of the term spread as a leading indicator documented by the predictive regressions
surveyed in Stock and Watson (1999). In this work, the only cross-equation restrictions on the joint
distribution of macro variables and yields come from the absence of arbitrage.
    In the present paper, our focus is on cross-equation restrictions induced by Euler equations, which
directly link yields to conditional moments of macroeconomic variables. In particular, we focus on
properties of the short rate and a single yield spread and use these to link the level and slope of
the yield curve to inﬂation and the business cycle. The rational expectations exercises in Sections
III and IV also impose the expectations hypothesis through our assumptions on preferences and the
distribution of shocks. While this implies that the model economies do not exhibit predictability and
excess volatility of long yields, they are useful for understanding the macro underpinnings of average
yields as well as the volatility of the level factor, which accounts in turn for the lion’s share of yield
volatility. The learning exercises in Section V do generate predictability in yields because of time
variation in perceived risk.
Consumption-based asset pricing models
    The representative agent asset pricing approach we follow in this paper takes the distribution
of consumption growth and inﬂation as exogenous and then derives yields from Euler equations.


                                                   37
Early applications assumed power utility. Campbell (1986) shows analytically that positive serial
correlation in consumption growth and inﬂation leads to downward sloping yield curves. In particular,
term spreads on long indexed bonds are negative because such bonds provide insurance against times
of low expected consumption growth. Backus, Gregory, and Zin (1989) document a “bond premium
puzzle”: average returns of long bonds in excess of the short rate are negative and small for coeﬃcients
of relative risk aversion below 10. Boudoukh (1993) considers a model with power utility where the
joint distribution of consumption growth and inﬂation is driven by a heteroskedastic VAR. Again, term
premia are small and negative. The latter two papers also show that heteroskedasticity in consumption
growth and inﬂation, respectively, is not strong enough to generate as much predictability in excess
bond returns as is present in the data. Chapman (1997) documents that ex-post real rates and
consumption growth are highly correlated, at least outside the monetary policy experiment.
    Our results show that the standard result of negative nominal term spreads is overturned with
recursive utility if inﬂation brings bad news. The form of recursive utility preferences proposed by
Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989) has become a common tool for describing investors’ attitudes
towards risk and intertemporal substitution. Campbell (1999) provides a textbook exposition. An
attractive feature of these preferences is that they produce plausible quantity implications in business
cycle models even for high values of the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion, as demonstrated by Tallarini
(2000). Bansal and Yaron (2004) show that a model with recursive utility can also generate a high
equity premium and a low riskfree rate if consumption growth contains a small, but highly persistent,
component. They argue that, even though empirical autocovariances of consumption growth do not
reveal such a component, it is hard to refute its presence given the large transitory movements in
consumption growth.
    Our benchmark rational expectations exercise postulates a consumption process parametrized by
our maximum likelihood point estimates. As a result, the autocovariances of consumption growth
in our model are close to their empirical counterparts. The eﬀects we derive are mostly due to
the forecastability of consumption growth by inﬂation, again suggested by our point estimates. Our
learning exercise with parameter uncertainty plays oﬀ the fact that permanent and persistent transitory
components can be hard to distinguish.
    The literature has also considered utility speciﬁcations in which current marginal utility depends
on a mean-reverting state variable. In habit formation models as well as in Abel’s (1999) model of
“catching up with the Joneses ”, marginal utility not only depends on current consumption but also
on consumption growth which is mean reverting. The presence of a mean-reverting state variable in
marginal utility tends to generate an upward sloping yield curve: it implies that bond prices (expected
changes in marginal utility) are negatively correlated with marginal utility itself. Since bonds thus
pay oﬀ little precisely in times of need (when marginal utility is high), they command a premium.
Quantitative analysis of models of habit formation and catching up with the Joneses showed that short
real interest rates become very volatile when the models are calibrated to match the equity premium.
    Campbell and Cochrane (1995) introduce a model in which marginal utility is driven by a weighted
average of past innovations to aggregate consumption, where the weight on each innovation is positively
related to the level of the marginal utility. With this feature, low current marginal utility need not
imply extremely high bond prices, since the anticipation of less volatile weighted innovations in the
future discourages precautionary savings and lowers bond prices. In their quantitative application,
Campbell and Cochrane focus on equity and short bonds, and pick the weight function so that the
real riskless rate is constant and the term structure is ﬂat. Wachter (2006) instead picks the weight
function to match features of the short rate dynamics. In a model driven by iid consumption growth
and an estimated inﬂation process, she shows that this approach accounts for several aspects of yield



                                                   38
behavior, while retaining the results for equity from the Campbell-Cochrane model.6
Monetary and business cycle models
    The consumption based asset pricing approach we follow in this paper assumes a stochastic trend
in consumption. In contrast, studies in the business cycle literature often detrend real variables,
including consumption, in a ﬁrst step and then compare detrended data to model equilibria in which
the level of consumption is stationary. This distinction is important for the analysis of interest rates,
since the pricing kernel (6), derived from the Euler equation, behaves very diﬀerently if consumption
is stationary in levels or trend stationary (Labadie 1994).7 Alvarez and Jermann (2005) have shown
that a permanent component must account for a large fraction of the variability of state prices if there
are assets that have large premia over long term bonds, as is the case in the data. A stochastic trend
in consumption directly induces a large permanent component in real state prices.
    Recently various authors have examined the term-structure implications of New Keynesian models.
The “macro side” of these models restricts the joint distribution of output, inﬂation and the short
nominal interest rate through an Euler equation – typically allowing for an eﬀect of past output on
current marginal utility as well as a taste shock – , a Phillips curve and a policy reaction function
for the central bank. Longer yields are then linked to the short rate via an exogenous pricing kernel
(Rudebusch and Wu 2005, Beechey 2005) or directly through the pricing kernel implied by the Euler
equation (Bekaert, Cho and Moreno 2005, Hordahl, Tristani, and Vestin 2005, Ravenna and Seppala
2005). Our model diﬀers from these studies in that it does not put theoretical restrictions on the
distribution of the macro variables and does not allow for taste shocks.
    Our model assumes frictionless goods and asset markets. In particular, there are no frictions
associated with the exchange of goods for assets, which can help generate an upward sloping yield
curve. For example, Bansal and Coleman (1996) derive a liquidity premium on long bonds in a model
where short bonds are easier to use for transactions purposes. Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe (1999)
show that money injections contribute to an upward sloping real yield curve in a limited participation
model of money. This is because money injections generate mean reversion in the level of consumption
of bond market participants. Seppala (2004) studies the real yield curve in a model with heterogeneous
agents and limited commitment. He shows that incomplete risk sharing helps to avoid a bond premium
puzzle.
Learning
    Our learning exercise builds on a growing literature that employs adaptive learning algorithms
to describe agent beliefs. This literature is surveyed by Evans and Honkapohja (2001). Empirical
applications to the joint dynamics of inﬂation and real variables include Sargent (1999) and Marcet
and Nicolini (2003). Carceles-Poveda and Giannitsarou (2006) consider a Lucas asset pricing model
where agents learn adaptively about aspects of the price function. In these studies, learning often
concerns structural parameters that aﬀect the determination of endogenous variables. In our setup,
investors learn only about the (reduced form) dynamics of exogenous fundamentals; they have full
structural knowledge of the price function. Another feature of many adaptive learning applications
is that standard errors on the reestimated parameters are not taken into account by agents. In our
model, standard errors are used to construct subjective variances around the parameters and investors’

     The New Keynesian model of Bekaert, Cho and Moreno (2005) assumes “catching up with the Joneses” together
with a taste shock to marginal utility. This is another way to reconcile the behavior of yields with a habit formation
model.

     In particular, if consumption reverts to its mean, “good” shocks that increase consumption lead to lower expected
consumption growth and hence lower real interest rates and higher real bond prices. This is exactly the opposite of
the eﬀect discussed in Section II, where “good” shocks that increase consumption growth leads to higher expected
consumption growth and hence higher real interest rates and lower bond prices.

anticipation of future learning is an important determinant of risk premia.
    Learning has been applied to the analysis of the term structure by Fuhrer (1996), Kozicki and
Tinsley (2001), and Cogley (2005). In these papers, the expectations hypothesis holds under investors’
subjective belief, as it does in our model. Fuhrer’s work is closest to ours in that he also considers
the relationship between macrovariables and yields, using an adaptive learning scheme. However, the
link between yields and macroeconomic variables in his model is given by a policy reaction function
with changing coeﬃcients, rather than by an Euler equation as in our setting. This paper shows that
changing policy coeﬃcients induce expectations about short rates that generate inertia in long rates
in the 1980s. In other words, inertia is due to changing conditional means. This is diﬀerent from our
results, where interest rates are tied to expected consumption growth and inﬂation. This is why, in
the context of our model, changes in conditional variances are more important.
    Kozicki and Tinsley (2001) and Cogley (2005) use diﬀerent learning models to show that the
expectations hypothesis may seem to fail in the data even if it holds under investors’s subjective
belief. Kozicki and Tinsley consider an adaptive learning scheme, while Cogley derives beliefs from a
Bayesian VAR with time-varying parameters for yields, imposing the expectations hypothesis. Regime-
switching models of interest rates deal with some of the same stylized facts on structural change as
learning models. (For a survey, see Singleton 2006.) A key property is that they allow for time
variation in conditional variances. Since this is helpful to capture the joint movements of inﬂation and
the short rate, regime switching is a prominent feature of statistical models that construct ex ante
real rates from inﬂation and nominal yield data. Veronesi and Yared (2001) consider an equilibrium
model of the term structure with regime switching and power utility.


VII     Conclusion

We see at least two interesting tasks for future research. The ﬁrst is to understand better the sources of
yield volatility at business cycle frequencies. While some of the models presented in this paper exhibit
substantial volatility, and do quite well on low frequency movements in interest rate levels, none of them
exhibits as much volatility at business cycle frequencies as we ﬁnd in the data, especially for the yield
spread. One natural extension of our benchmark rational expectations model is to capture nonlinear
features of the inﬂation process through regime switching or other devices that allow conditional
heteroskedasticity. In addition to generating more volatility, this might have interesting implications
for the predictability of excess long bond returns. To evaluate rational expectations models, the
analysis in Section 4 – where we capture investors’ information using asset prices in a ﬁrst step before
computing model implied yields – provides a way to evaluate many diﬀerent information structures at
the same time.
    A second task is to develop further models in which changes in uncertainty have ﬁrst order eﬀects
on interest rates. We have provided one example of such a model and have shown that it holds some
promise for understanding why interest rates were high in the 1980s, although inﬂation expectations
were low. However, more work is needed to reconcile the learning process with interest rates during
other periods, and to integrate it more tightly with survey expectations. To this end, the tractable
approach to learning that we consider in Section 5 – combining adaptive learning and parameter
uncertainty – is less involved than a full Bayesian learning setup, but can nevertheless capture both
agents’ understanding of the future dynamics of fundamentals and agents’ conﬁdence in how well they
understand these dynamics.

Appendix

A    Estimation of the State Space System

Given the normality assumption on the disturbance vector et+1 , the log likelihood function of the
vector zt+1 is easily derived as the sum of log Gaussian conditional densities. In setting up these
conditional densities, we compute the state vector xt recursively as xt = φx xt−1 + φx K (zt − xt−1 )
starting with x0 = 0. The resulting parameter estimates are reported in Tables A1 and A2. The
data are in percent and sampled at a quarterly frequency, 1952:2-2005:4. For example, this means that
μc = 0.823 represents a mean annualized consumption growth rate of 0.823 × 4 = 3.292 percent. We
de-mean the series for the estimation, which is why we do not report standard errors for the means.
    The dotted lines in Figure 1 are 2 × standard error bounds computed using GMM. We use
these bounds to answer the question whether the point estimate of the covariance function from
the model is within standard error bounds computed from the data, without imposing the structure
from the model. For each element of the covariance function, we estimate a separate GMM objec-
tive function. For example, we use moments of the type h (t, θ) = (Δct − μc ) (Δct−1 − μc ) − θ or
h (t, θ ) = (Δct − μc ) (πt−1 − μπ ) − θ . We compute the GMM weighting matrix with 4 Newey-West
lags.

B     U.K. and U.S. Evidence on Real Bonds

Table 1 in Evans (1998) reports means, volatilities and autocorrelations for U.K. indexed yields for the

monthly sample January 1983 – November 1995. The Bank of England posts its own interpolated real

yield curves from U.K. indexed yields. The sample of these data starts later and has many missing

values for the early years, especially for short bonds. Panel A in Table B.3. therefore reproduces the

statistics from Table 1 in Evans (1998) for the early sample. Panel B in Table B.3 reports statistics

based on the data from the Bank of England starting in December 1995.

    The data from the Bank of England can be downloaded in various ﬁles from the website

http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/index.htm. The data are daily observations.

                                                             45
To construct a monthly sample, we take the last observation from each month. The shortest maturity

for which data are available consistently is 2 1/2 years. There are a few observations on individ-

ual maturities missing. We extrapolate these observations from observations on yields with similar

maturities.

C      Alternative Data Definitions and Estimation Strategies

Section A. investigates the impact of using alternative inﬂation measures for the estimation. We show

that the choice of inﬂation series matters for the model’s predictions regarding the level of yields

in the 1970s and the volatility of yields. These alternative measures, especially CPI inﬂation, are,

however, not appropriate because they do not correspond to our measure of consumption. Section B.

investigates the impact of using alternative assumptions about population growth. We document that

the standard population growth series look strange and diﬀerent from each other. We estimate the

model based on these alternatives and ﬁnd that the numbers change, but not in ways that aﬀect the

story we tell in the paper. Section C. investigates the impact of estimating the initial state x0 . Again,

the numbers change, but not by much.



A.     Inflation Data


We measure inﬂation with the NIPA price index that corresponds to precisely our measure of aggregate

consumption. This measure is the most appropriate for matching theory to data, and therefore we use

it in our empirical work. Our measure of inﬂation diﬀers from other conventional inﬂation measures,

such as the Consumer Price Index. Here, we check the impact of using a diﬀerent inﬂation measure

in our estimation.

     Figure 10 plots our inﬂation measure together with CPI inﬂation in the top panel and inﬂation

measured by the GNP deﬂator in the lower panel. It is clear from the plot that our measure of inﬂation

has less high-frequency noise and is lower in the 1970s than CPI inﬂation. The measure is more similar

to the GDP deﬂator and other inﬂation measures (such as the personal consumption deﬂator) that

are computed from time-averaged data.

     To check how these diﬀerences aﬀect the implications of the benchmark model, we re-estimated

the state space system (19) with CPI inﬂation. The CPI-based system improves upon Figure 3,

because it generates higher nominal yields in the 1970s. It also improves upon Table 2 by producing

more volatility for nominal yields. For example, the volatilities of the n = 1, 4, and 20 maturity

CPI-implied yields are 2.14, 1.90, and 1.31 percent as opposed to the 1.80, 1.64, and 1.12 percent in

Table 2. However, a frequency decomposition as in Figure 6 reveals that the volatility in the CPI

numbers generates volatility at the “wrong frequency” — volatility at frequencies higher than the

business cycle. Other popular inﬂation measures (such as the GNP Deﬂator or Personal Consumption

Deﬂator) generate results that are more similar to our benchmark results.



B.    Population Data


As we explain on page 14, the results in the paper are based on the assumption that population growth

is constant. Under this assumption, per capita consumption growth is equal to the growth rate of the

raw consumption NIPA data minus a constant. The size of the constant only aﬀects the interpretation

of the discount factor β in the model. The results in the paper are based on a constant which is equal

to zero.

     The advantage of working with the assumption of constant population growth is that we do not

have to take a stance on which population series we want to use. There are surprisingly large diﬀerences

in the standard population series available from various data sources. Not only do these series look

strange, they also diﬀer widely from each other.

   Figure 11 plots two standard population growth rates. The two panels in the ﬁgure use quarterly

population numbers Nt and compute the annualized growth rate as 400 × (log Nt − log Nt−1 ). The

top panel plots the growth rate from the NIPA quarterly tables. The bottom panel plots the original

BLS numbers, where Nt is the quarterly average of the monthly data. The BLS data is downloadable

from http://www.bls.gov/cps.

   Both series look strange, in that they exhibit large spikes. The spikes often happen at the beginning

of decades, which indicates that the construction of these population series suﬀers from interpolation

issues between each census. The other issue is that the two series look nothing alike. For example,

the NIPA population growth rate exhibits high-frequency ﬂuctuations that are clearly not present in

the BLS data. We checked into various other databases (such as the population numbers posted on

FRED), and found that they also look strange and diﬀerent from the two series in Figure 11.

   We re-estimated the model with per-capita consumption based on the BLS data. Figure 12 in this

appendix is the analogue of Figure 1. We can see that the precise numbers diﬀer, but the ﬁndings

are similar. Not surprisingly, the benchmark model now needs a lower discount factor, β = 1.0016

(as opposed to the β = 1.005 number we report on page 19) in order to match the sample average of

the shortest and longest yield in the dataset. The model also needs a lower coeﬃcient of relative risk

aversion γ = 37 (as opposed to the γ = 59 in the paper).

   We also re-estimated the model with per-capita consumption based on the NIPA data. Again,

Figure 13 is the analogue of Figure 1. Again, the precise numbers diﬀer, but the ﬁndings are similar.

Again, not surprisingly, the benchmark model now needs a lower discount factor, β = 1.0014 (as

the shortest and longest yield in the dataset. Diﬀerently from the BLS data, the model now needs a

higher coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion γ = 210 (as opposed to the γ = 59 in the paper).

C.    Initial State x0


To construct benchmark beliefs in Section 3 of the paper and beliefs with a large information set in

Section 4, we estimate the parameters μz , φx , K, and chol(Ω) of the state space model (19) using

maximum likelihood. We form the log likelihood function as the sum of log conditional Gaussian

densities of the observed vector zt+1 conditional on xt for t = 1, ..., T . Appendix A reports results

based on the assumption that the density for the ﬁrst observation z1 conditions on the value x0 = 0

for the initial state, its unconditional mean. An alternative approach is to treat the initial state x0

as parameter which we estimate along with μz etc. Here, we report results based on this alternative

approach.

     Tables C.1 and C.2 are the analogues of Tables A.1 and A.2 in Appendix A, but now we also

report estimates for the parameter vector x0 . The parameter estimates for the benchmark model are

essentially the same. The results for the large infoset model are also similar.

   Based on the new set of parameter values in Tables C.1 and C.2, we now select values for the

preference parameters to match the average short and long end of the nominal yield curve. For our

benchmark, those values are β = 1.005 and γ = 57. Tables C.3 and C.4 report results based on these

parameters.
