Fiscal Reform and Government Debt in Japan: A Neoclassical Perspective

                                              ABSTRACT

Past government spending in Japan is currently imposing a significant fiscal burden that is reflected
in a net debt to output ratio near 150 percent. In addition, the aging of Japanese society implies that
public expenditures and transfers payments relative to output are projected to continue to rise untilat
least 2050. In this paper we use a standard growth model to measure the size of this burden in theform
of additional taxes required to finance these projected expenditures and to stabilize governmentdebt.
The fiscal adjustment needed is very large, in the range of 30-40% of total consumption expenditures.
Using a distorting tax such as the consumption tax or the labor income tax requires either tax to rise
to unprecedented highs, although the former is much less distorting than the latter. The extremely high
tax rates we find highlight the importance of considering alternatives that attenuate the projected increases
in public spending and/or enlarge the tax base.

1     Introduction
Due to large government stimulus in response to low economic growth in 1990s and 2000s,
Japan accumulated the highest debt to output ratio among developed economies. In
addition, this ratio is rising rapidly due to projected increases in public pensions and
health expenditures. Figure 1 shows that net debt to Gross National Product (GNP) has
risen from around 15% of GNP in the early 1990s to about 110% in 2010, with further
increases projected.1

                                 Figure 1: Net Debt to GNP Ratio

        When compared with the experiences of other countries, it is surprising that Japan
can have such a high debt to output ratio and yet pay very low interest rates on its debt.
The majority of Japanese government debt, above 90%, is held domestically and bond
holders are presumably expecting suﬃcient future tax increases or spending cuts so that
the government may be able to support high debt or ultimately reduce it to sustainable
levels.
        At the same time, Japan is facing a severe demographic transition that implies
drastic increases in public pension payments and health expenditures in the future.

     Net debt is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between ﬁnancial liabilities and assets of the general government
in Japanese national accounts. Our measure of GNP reﬂects adjustments to GNP from national accounts
to be described in Section 3.

                                       Figure 2: Dependency Ratios

        Figure 2 above shows two dependency ratios; one shows the ratio of the number of
65 and older individuals to the number of 20 to 64 year old individuals, and a second one,
the ratio of 70 and older individuals to the number of people between 20 and 69.2 The
second may be more relevant in the future as retirement ages are expected to increase.
The ﬁrst dependency ratio implies that about 3 workers are currently supporting 1 retiree.
In about 60 years, this ratio is projected to increase to just over 1 worker paying taxes to
support 1 retiree.
        Clearly much additional revenue is required if beneﬁts are to remain at current
levels. Even when we consider a scenario where Japanese individuals work late into their
60s, the ratio of 70 and older individuals to the number of 20 to 69 year old workers is
expected to increase from its current value of just over 20% to over 65% before stabilizing
at 60% in the distant future. This is equivalent to having about 5 workers to support 1
retiree in 2005 but looking to have less than 2 workers to support a retiree in less than
40 years.

                      Figure 3: Government Expenditures to GNP Ratios

        Figure 3 shows projections by Fukawa and Sato (2009) that imply large increases in
government purchases to output driven by health expenditures and aging, and in transfer
payments to output driven by expected increases in total pension payments. According
to these projections, not only will there be far fewer workers paying taxes, but there
will also be many more retirees requiring huge outlays for health expenditures and old
age pensions. Assuming that it is not possible for the Japanese government to continue
to issue additional debt to cover these expenditures, what sort of tax increases will be
required for the Japanese ﬁscal policy to be sustainable?
        In this paper, we develop a neoclassical growth model that builds on Hayashi
and Prescott (2002) and Chen, İmrohoroğlu, and İmrohoroğlu (2006) by incorporating a
strong domestic demand for government bonds and explore alternative ways of ﬁnancing
the projected increases in government expenditures. In particular, we ask “What are the
revenue requirements and new taxes needed to ﬁnance future government expenditures
and at the same time reduce the level of indebtedness to 60% of output in the long run?”
        The model is a one sector deterministic growth model in which the private sector
has perfect foresight about population growth rates, government policy and factor prices.
Both the quantity and the price of bonds are endogenously determined in our model;
government purchases of goods and services and transfer payments are exogenous. The
government raises revenue by taxing factor incomes, interest income and consumption.
The representative household values consumption, leisure, and government bonds and
markets are complete. The inclusion of bonds in the utility function makes the model
consistent with the very strong domestic demand for government bonds in Japan.3 A

    Sakuragawa and Hosono (2010) employ an alternative approach that incorporates intermediation
costs to obtain low equilibrium interest rates on government debt.

stand-in ﬁrm hires labor and rents capital from households.
        After calibrating the model to the Japanese economy, we compute a transition path
from given initial conditions in Japan in 1981 to a steady-state in the distant future. We
incorporate forecasts of government purchases and transfer payments from Fukawa and
Sato (2009) and projections of future population growth rates produced by the Japanese
government. In our model, any debt to output ratio is sustainable in steady state as long
as it is possible to raise suﬃcient tax revenue to cover expenditures as well as interest
payments on the debt.4 Hence, we assume an arbitrary threshold debt to output ratio
that, once reached, triggers tax increases that eventually bring this ratio down to a long
run value of 60 percent. In our benchmark exercise, we compute the additional revenue,
in the form of lump sum taxes or reductions in transfer payments, that must be raised
in order to accomplish this transition. Next, we compute alternative transition paths in
which the government increases distorting tax rates, either the consumption tax or labor
income tax, and also consider the possibilities associated with increasing the tax base.
        Our main ﬁnding is that the revenue required to ﬁnance the projected increases in
government expenditures and to stabilize Japanese government debt is on the order of 30-
40% of aggregate consumption per year. Furthermore, if the government uses distorting
taxes such as the consumption tax, this tax rate must be increased to an unprecedented
level of over 60%. If the tax base is broadened, the consumption tax would still have
to increase to approximately 40%. The labor tax, however, is suﬃciently distorting that
it cannot be used by itself to accomplish the transition, even when tax broadening is
implemented. Instead, the consumption tax must be increased along with the labor
income tax rate.5
        Given the unprecedented tax increases necessitated by this transition, increases
that Japanese policymakers may want to avoid, our quantitative results motivate study-
ing alternative reforms that would raise revenue and/or reduce government spending.
Examples of such policies include reforms to the pension system (by reducing beneﬁts
or raising the retirement age), health insurance (increased premiums or co-pays), family
policy (to raise fertility and female labor force participation), and allowing for increased
immigration to Japan.
        We are contributing to a large literature studying the additional revenue required
to stabilize the debt to output ratio in Japan. A recent example is Doi, Hoshi, and
Okimoto (2011) who estimate the tax revenue as a fraction of GDP required to sustain
the debt at the 2010 level. They ﬁnd that revenue has to go to 40-47% of GDP (relative
to 33% of GDP in 2010). They do not, however, consider what would be required if one
were to use distorting taxes to raise this additional revenue. Hoshi and Ito (2012) ﬁnd
similar results.
        Work that follows an approach similar to ours include İmrohoroğlu and Sudo
(2011a) who also use the methodology of Hayashi and Prescott (2002). They measure the
   4
     Hoshi and Ito (2012) endogenize the maximum debt to output ratio by assuming that government
debt cannot exceed the total ﬁnancial assets held by the private sector. This leads them to conclude that
the maximum debt to output ratio is 246%. We assume a maximum ratio of 250% in our benchmark
case.
   5
     Keen, Pradhan, Kang, and de Mooij (2011) also argue for increasing the consumption tax in Japan
on the grounds that it is a less distorting way to raise the necessary revenue than the labor income tax.

impact of raising the consumption tax rate in Japan from its current level of 5% to 15%.
They ﬁnd that despite the temporary improvement in government revenues that produces
primary surpluses for several years, eventually primary deﬁcits re-emerge and the ﬁscal
situation worsens. To see if a growth miracle may increase the tax base suﬃciently to
allow for ﬁscal balance, İmrohoroğlu and Sudo (2011b) try several scenarios under which
exogenous growth in total factor productivity reduces the ﬁscal burden by lowering the
projected increases in the government expenditures to output ratio on one hand and by
raising the tax base on the other hand. They ﬁnd that a decade of productivity growth
of 6% or more is needed to restore ﬁscal balance in Japan, which is a growth experience
that has not been achieved in any advanced economy over the last 35 years.
        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model economy and
calibration is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents our quantitative results. Section
5 concludes.


2     Model
In this section we describe the details of our model. Upper case variables are per capita
values that grow along a balanced growth path. Lower case variables are stationary along
a balanced growth path.
         The economy is populated by a representative household with Nt members at time
t. The size of the household is assumed to grow at a time-varying growth factor ηt so that
Nt+1 = ηt Nt . There is no uncertainty in our economy; households are assumed to have
perfect foresight.
         The ﬁscal analysis in this paper takes as given time series on tax rates, government
spending (Gt ), transfer payments (T Rt ), the working age population (Nt ), and total
factor productivity (At ), where actual time series are used from 1981-2010. Forecasts
and assumptions are used to extend these series to 2050 and beyond. In addition, we
assume that the tax rates, the ratios of government purchases and transfer payments to
output, and the growth rates of Nt and At are all eventually constant and the economy
converges to a balanced growth path. A one sector neoclassical growth model is used to
endogenously determine hours worked (ht ), consumption (Ct ), output (Yt ), the stock of
capital (Kt ), tax revenues, government debt (Bt ), and the price of government bonds,
(qt ), from 1981 into the inﬁnite future.

2.1    Government
We begin by describing the government’s budget constraint. The government is assumed
to collect revenue from taxing household consumption at the rate τc,t , labor income at the
rate τh,t , capital income at the rate τk,t , and interest on government bonds at the rate τb,t .
Given time series for Gt and T Rt , the quantity of one-period discount bonds (Bt+1 ) that
are issued by the government is determined by the following budget constraint (where all
quantities are in per capita terms):




                                               5
                   Gt + T Rt + Bt = ηt qt Bt+1 + τc,t Ct + τh,t Wt ht                           (1)
                                    +τk,t (rt − δ)Kt + τb,t (1 − qt−1 )Bt .

        Here, in addition to variables already deﬁned, Wt and rt denote the wage rate and
the return to capital, and δ is the depreciation rate of capital. In order to guarantee that
the government obeys its intertemporal budget constraint, we assume a “debt sustain-
ability” rule that forces the government to retire a fraction κ of its debt that is in excess
of what we assume the government will hold along its balanced growth path (B t ). In
particular, we assume that the debt to output ratio along the balanced growth path is
equal to b.
        This rule is triggered once the debt to output ratio exceeds some value bmax .
                              {
                                1 if Bs /Ys ≥ bmax for some s ≤ t,
                         ιt =                                                             (2)
                                0 otherwise.
       Once the sustainability rule is triggered, the government must generate revenue
equal to Dt that can be used to retire debt:

                                         Dt = κιt (Bt − B t ).

       We will experiment with alternative ways to raise Dt along the transition path to
the balanced growth path. One way is to replace T Rt with T Rt∗ = T Rt − Dt . This is
equivalent to Dt being a lump sum tax and will serve as our benchmark case. Later, we
will consider rules that replace τc,t and/or τh,t with larger tax rates that are suﬃcient to
bring Bt /Yt to its steady state level b.

2.2     Household’s Problem
The household at time 0 is endowed with initial holdings of per capita physical capital
K0 > 0, and real, one-period, zero-coupon, discount bonds B0 > 0. In addition, each
member of the household is endowed with one unit of time each period that can be used
for market activities ht or leisure 1−ht . Given a sequence of wages, rental rates for capital,
government bond prices {Wt , rt , qt }∞  t=0 , tax rates on consumption, and labor, capital and
bond income, and per-capita transfer payments {τc,t , τh,t , τk,t , τb,t , T Rt }∞
                                                                                 t=0 , the household
chooses a sequence of per member consumption, hours worked, capital, and real bond
holdings {Ct , ht , Kt+1 , Bt+1 }∞

                                             +[1 − (1 − qt−1 )τb,t ]Bt + T Rt∗ ,

                                                  6
where K0 > 0 and B0 > 0 are given initial conditions. Here Kt+1 is per member holdings
of capital at time t + 1. ηt Kt+1 expresses the same quantity of capital per member at
time t. The household’s maximization is subject to a budget constraint where after-tax
consumption expenditures and resources allocated to wealth accumulation in the form of
capital and bond holdings are ﬁnanced by after-tax labor income, after-tax capital income
and holdings of capital, after-tax proceeds of bond holdings chosen in the previous period,
and transfer payments from the government. The parameter β denotes the household’s
subjective discount factor. The disutility of work is described by −α < 0 and ϕ >
0 denotes the household’s preferences for government bonds. We use ψ to denote the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) of labor.
       Since about 95% of the Japanese government bonds are held domestically, we as-
sume that Japan is a closed economy where all debt is held by Japanese citizens, i.e.
the Japanese household in our model. In addition, Japanese government bonds histori-
cally have had yields less than the return to physical capital. As a result, we introduce
government debt in the utility function, with ϕ > 0.6
       Finally, µt is a parameter that limits the curvature of the period utility function
over bonds. Essentially, it represents assets that might be perfect substitutes to Japanese
government issued bonds in generating utility to households.7 We allow this parameter to
move at the same rate of balanced growth as the rest of the economy so that the detrended
                                               1/(1−θ)
version is a constant. In particular, µt = µAt         .

2.3     Firm’s Problem
A stand-in ﬁrm operates a constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas production technology


                                     Nt Yt = At (Nt Kt )θ (Nt ht )1−θ
                                Nt+1 Kt+1 = (1 − δ)Nt Kt + Nt Xt .

Capital depreciates at the rate δ. The income share of capital is given by θ. At is total
factor productivity which grows exogenously at the rate γt , so we have At+1 = γt At . Per
capita gross investment is denoted by Xt .

q − R1 = ϕc
          b > 0, which means that the return on k, denoted by R, dominates that on b which is equal to
1/q.

     This parameter helps us to match the volatility of the bond prices.

2.5    Detrended Equilibrium Conditions
In this subsection we derive the detrended equilibrium conditions to use in solving the
model numerically. Given a trending per capita variable Zt we obtain its detrended per
capita counterpart by
                                            Zt
                                     zt = 1/(1−θ) .

       The ﬁrst set of detrended equilibrium conditions is given below.

                                                    (1 + τc,t )ct
                                             yt = ktθ h1−θ
                                                        t   ,                                    (7)
                                      1/(1−θ)
                                  ηt γt       kt+1       = (1 − δ)kt + xt .                      (8)

       Equation (4) is the typical Euler equation arising from the choice of capital stock
at time t. The bond Euler equation is given by (5). The ﬁrst order condition for hours
worked is shown in equation (6). The production function and the law of motion for
capital are given in equations (7) and (8), respectively. The budget constraint for the
household is given below in equation (9)
                        1/(1−θ)                1/(1−θ)
      (1 + τc,t )ct + ηt γt   kt+1 + qt ηt γt      bt+1                                           (9)
          = (1 − τh,t )wt ht + [1 − (1 − qt−1 )τb,t ]bt + trt − dt + [1 + (1 − τk,t )(rt − δ)]kt .

       The government budget equation is given by equation (10)
                                               1/(1−θ)
                   gt + trt + bt = qt ηt γt    bt+1 + τc,t ct + τh,t wt ht                      (10)
                                   +τk,t (rt − δ)kt + τb,t (1 − qt )bt + dt .

Equation (11) is the detrended ﬁscal rule

                                       dt = κιt (bt − b y),                                     (11)

                                                     8
where y is the value of yt along the balanced growth path. Recall that b is the targeted
debt to output ratio along the balanced growth path and ιt is an indicator function given
by equation (2).
       Finally, the market clearing conditions are given below in equations (12), (13) and
(14)

                                              rt = θktθ−1 h1−θ
                                                           t   ,                                         (12)
                                                             θ −θ
                                             wt = (1 − θ)kt ht ,                                         (13)
                                    ct + xt + gt = yt .                                                  (14)

           Hence we have 10 equations, (4) through (13), in 10 unknowns
{ct , xt , ht , yt , kt+1 , bt+1 , dt , qt , wt , rt } at each time period t.

2.6     Solution Procedure
Given a sequence {τc,t , τh,t , τb,t , τk,t , ηt , γt , gt , trt }∞t=1981 , where these exogenous variables are
constant beyond some date Ts so that the endogenous variables that are determined by
equations (4) through (13) converge to a steady state. Given a value for c1981 we use these
equations to calculate the sequence of endogenous variables
{ct , xt , ht , yt , kt+1 , bt+1 , dt , qt , wt , rt } for all time periods. We use a shooting algorithm,
similar to that in Hayashi and Prescott (2002) and Chen, İmrohoroğlu, and İmrohoroğlu
(2006), to iterate on c1981 which is equivalent to imposing a transversality condition on
the capital stock. Note that our ﬁscal rule serves as a transversality condition on bond
holdings.


3       Calibration
The structural parameters of our model are calibrated based on information from the
sample period, which consists of annual data from 1981 to 2010.8 We take the capital-
output and bond-output ratios in 1981 as initial conditions and use the sample paths for
total factor productivity (TFP), population growth rates, tax rates, government purchases
and transfer payments as exogenous inputs to the model. In addition we make assumptions
about the values for these exogenous variables beyond the sample period in order to
calculate equilibrium transition paths from 1981 toward the eventual steady state.

Population:      Our measure of population, Nt , is working age population between the
ages of 20 and 69. We use the actual values between 1981 and 2010 and rely on oﬃcial
projections for 2011-2050. We assume that the population stabilizes after 2050; that is
ηt = 1, t ≥ 2050. In section 4.4 we consider the eﬀects of using total population as a
measure of population instead of working age population.
    8
   The main reason for taking the year 2010 as the last year for our sample is to abstract from the huge
public expenditures in 2011 following the Great Tohoku Earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear disaster.




                                                      9
National Accounts:        Our measure of output is Gross National Product adjusted to
include income from foreign capital, following Hayashi and Prescott (2002). In particu-
lar, we deﬁne the model’s capital stock, Kt , as consisting of private ﬁxed capital, held
domestically and in foreign countries. We add net exports and net factor payments from
abroad to measured private investment.
       Government investment, including net land purchases, is assumed to be expensed.
Therefore we treat it as part of government consumption and subtract depreciation of
government capital from government consumption. We summarize these choices in Table 1
below:


               Table 1: Adjustments to National Account Measurements

             C=  Private Consumption Expenditures
             I=   Private Gross Investment
                    + Change in Inventories
                    + Net Exports
                    + Net Factor Payments from Abroad
             G=   Government Final Consumption Expenditures
                    + General Government Gross Capital Formation
                    + Government Net Land Purchases
                    − Book Value Depreciation of Government Capital
             Y = C +I +G




Labor input: For ht we take the product of employment per working age population
and average weekly hours worked, normalized by dividing by 98, which is our assumption
on discretionary hours available per week.

Government Accounts: Our measure of government purchases of goods and services,
Gt , in Table 1, also includes Japanese public health expenditures. Transfer payments,
T Rt , includes social beneﬁts (other than those in kind, which are included in Gt ) that
are mostly public pensions, plus other current net transfers minus net indirect taxes. We
also add 8% of output to our measure of transfers since our modeling of ﬂat tax rates
leads to higher tax revenue than in the data because we abstract from all deductions and
exemptions that are present in the complicated Japanese tax code.

Tax Rates: Our measure of labor income tax rates, τh,t , comes from the estimates of
average marginal labor income tax rates by Gunji and Miyazaki (2011). The last value
is 0.3324 for 2007 and we assume that this same value holds for 2008 and beyond in the
benchmark calibration.
        The capital income tax rate, τk,t , is constructed following the methodology in
Hayashi and Prescott (2002). The value of this tax rate for 2010 is 0.3557. We assume
that this value remains unchanged for 2011 and beyond.

                                           10
       A consumption tax rate of τc,t = 3% was introduced in Japan in 1989, and it was
raised to 5% in 1997. This tax rate is scheduled to rise to 8% in 2014 and 10% in 2015.
In our benchmark calibration, we assume that the consumption tax rate stays constant
at 10% beyond 2015.
       The tax rate on interest from government bonds, τb,t , is equal to 20% for all time
periods. This tax is imposed on the semiannual interest income from coupon-bearing
bonds and is withheld (15% income tax plus 5% local tax) at the time the interest is paid.
       Figure 4 below shows the tax rates used except for the tax on bond interest income,
which is constant throughout at 20%.

Technology parameters:          Given the data described above, the Cobb-Douglas pro-
duction function allows us to calculate total factor productivity:

                                    At = Yt /(Ktθ h1−θ
                                                   t   ).

       The capital income share, θ, is set equal to 0.3783, which is the sample (1981-2010)
average of the annual ratio of capital income to our adjusted measure of GNP.
       The measure of the growth factor of TFP, γt = At+1 /At , comes from the actual
data between 1981 and 2010. For 2011 and beyond, we assume that γt = 1.0151−θ . This
implies a growth rate of 1.5% for per capita output along the balanced growth path.
       Our estimate for δ = 0.0842 comes from the sample average, following Hayashi
and Prescott (2002). Table 2 summarizes these choices.

       We show the demographic, technological and ﬁscal inputs that are exogenous to
the model in Figure 5. The projected ﬁscal burden due to the aging of the Japanese
population is reﬂected in the projected increases in government purchases and transfer
payments. Taking these demographic, technological and expenditure variables as given,
and assuming a target of an eventual 60% debt to GNP ratio in the steady state, we
compute the magnitude of the ﬁscal adjustment necessary to achieve ﬁscal balance in
Japan.

        For the three preference parameters β, α, and ϕ, we use the equilibrium conditions

       Note, however, that the equilibrium condition in equation (17) contains the equi-
librium price of government bonds, qt . The empirical counterpart to qt that we compute
reﬂects the fact that government debt in actual economies is comprised of bond holdings
of varying maturities while our model economy includes only one period discount bonds.
In particular, let Bt be beginning of period debt and Pt be interest payments made in
period t, both measured in current Yen. In addition, let Ft be the GNP deﬂator. We
compute the price of bonds in period t as follows:

                                               Bt+1 /Ft
                                   qt =                       .                        (18)
                                          (Bt+1 + Pt+1 )/Ft+1
       Using data on Bt+1 , Ft , and Pt+1 over the sample period, we compute qt and feed
the values into the equilibrium conditions above to calculate the sample values of the
preference parameters.
       Figure 6 shows the sequences of {qt }2009
                                            1981 calculated from the data using equation 18
and that implied by our benchmark calibration. In addition, we show the same sequence
when ϕ = 0 and bonds earn the same rate of return as capital. With ϕ > 0, households
are willing to hold government debt at a higher bond price and lower return than in the
ϕ = 0 case.

4       Quantitative Experiments
As we mentioned in the Introduction, Japan’s already high debt to output ratio is pro-
jected to rise even further due to the aging of the population. Fukawa and Sato (2009)
estimate an increase of 3 percentage points in the ratio of government purchases to output
and a 4 percentage point rise in transfer payments to output from 2010 to 2050.9 These
estimates are very similar to those calculated independently by İmrohoroğlu, Kitao, and
Yamada (2013). This growth in debt may not be sustainable and requires a ﬁscal rule
that guarantees that the government’s intertemporal budget is satisﬁed.


4.1     Benchmark Experiment
In our benchmark exercise, the government imposes lump sum taxes (or, equivalently,
reduces transfers) when the bond to output ratio reaches some critical value. Later, we
will consider alternative ﬁscal policies that impose distorting taxes and/or broadening
the tax base to retire debt. In what follows, we describe how we implement the ﬁscal
sustainability rule introduced earlier in equation (11).

4.1.1    Fiscal Sustainability Rule
We repeat below the equations that describe the benchmark ﬁscal rule.
   9
     The projections in Fukawa and Sato (2009) are based on the ﬁnancial projections produced in Sato
and Kato (2007). These projections come from a system of equations that form their accounting model.
Some of the equations, such as the consumption of ﬁxed capital, production function, pension beneﬁts,
medical expenditures, etc., are estimated from Japanese data, using age brackets when appropriate.
Other inputs to the equations are taken from population projections and government’s long-term care
expenditure estimates. For mortality projections, the medium variant is used. The rate of growth of real
GDP is assumed to be 2%. The income share of labor is estimated to be 57%.



                                                  15

                                 1 if Bs /Ys ≥ bmax for some s ≤ t,

                                 0 otherwise.

        Values need to be assigned to the three parameters, κ, bmax , and b, that characterize
this policy. For bmax , the maximum net debt to output ratio beyond which ﬁscal austerity
kicks in, we try three values, 200%, 250%, and 300%. For most countries, these values
may seem too high. For Japan, however, these may be more reasonable. Indeed, the (net)
debt to output ratio for 2013 is around 150%. As we argue below, our choice of bmax is
250%, which is very close to the maximum sustainable debt to output ratio estimated by
Hoshi and Ito (2012).
        For the debt to output ratio along the balanced growth path, b, we use a value
of 60%. This is loosely motivated by the debt to output ratio that was once viewed as
an upper bound for European Union member countries that are also a part of European
Monetary Union before the recent Euro debt problems.10
        Figure 8 illustrates how we choose κ for the benchmark value of bmax = 250%. The
upper panel of this ﬁgures shows the paths implied by our model for the debt to output
ratios under three possible values for κ. The endogenous date at which our sustainability
rule is triggerred is 2021, at which time the government begins to retire a fraction κ of the
debt in excess of the steady-state value, by. A value of κ, 0.05, as can be seen in Figure 8
is insuﬃcient to rein in the debt to output ratio which continues to grow beyond 2021.
The two larger values shown, 0.1 and 0.15, do succeed in bringing the debt to output ratio
under control.
        The lower panel of Figure 8 quantiﬁes dt /ct , which is the revenue required to retire
debt as a fraction of consumption expenditures, for diﬀerent values of κ. We refer to this
as the “consumption tax equivalent revenue requirement.”
        We choose the smallest value of κ that is suﬃcient to cause the debt to output
ratio to fall once the trigger is activated. A value of κ = 0.15 would allow the debt to
output ratio to fall more quickly, but, as can be seen from the bottom panel of Figure
8, this value would involve collecting more revenue than necessary in the initial periods
after the trigger is activated. But κ = 0.1 works to achieve our targeted ﬁscal balance.
  10
    We experimented with higher steady-state debt to output ratios, such as 100%. This higher value
had very little quantitative impact on the ﬁscal burden along the transition.

       Note that as long as debt exceeds the steady-state value, ιt is equal to 1 and
debt is brought down by lump sum taxes (equivalent to a reduction in transfers). As
the diﬀerence between actual debt and its steady-state value becomes small, the revenue
requirement gets smaller and eventually, when the government purchases to output and
transfer payments to output become stationary in 2050, the need to levy lump sum taxes
to bring debt to a sustainable steady state level vanishes.
       Figures (9) and (10) illustrate the paths of the bond to output ratios and the
revenue requirements for the two alternative values for bmax . For bmax = 200% and bmax =
300%, we choose κ = 0.12 and κ = 0.085, respectively, for the same reason outlined above.

Although our primary interest is in projecting the path for endogenous variables beyond
our sample period, we ﬁrst report the time paths over the sample period 1981-2010 gen-
erated by our calibrated model and their counterparts from Japanese data. This allows
us to evaluate similarities and diﬀerences between actual data and those generated by the
model.
       Figure 11 shows data and model comparisons for hours worked, capital stock and
output. The last two variables are normalized so that 1981 values equal 100.

                           Figure 11: Labor, Capital, and Output

       A striking aspect of Figure 11 is that our model does not quite match the observed
time path for hours worked. During the 1990’s, labor supply fell signiﬁcantly in Japan.
Hayashi and Prescott (2002) attribute some of this decline to the legislated reduction in
the length of the work week in Japan, a feature that is absent in our model. As a result,
the model predicts a ﬂatter hours path than observed in the data.
       Figure 12 illustrates data and model consumption and investment, normalized to
equal 100 in 1981, and the capital-output ratio. Here, one can see that the model predicts
higher investment during the 1990’s and early 2000’s than actually observed. This may
be due to the substitution toward capital goods with lower depreciation rates during this
period, something that is not featured in our model.11 Toward the end of the 1981-2010
period, there is more agreement between the model and the data.
  11
    Using the methodology for computing the depreciation rate in Hayashi and Prescott (2002), we ﬁnd
that the rate of depreciation fell from 9.1% in 1989 to 7.5% in 2010.

for the fact that our model abstracts from exemptions and reductions in the Japanese tax
code. With this assumption, our endogenous debt to output ratio is very much in line
with that in the data.

Our benchmark experiment relies on lump-sum taxes and transfers to ﬁnance the ﬁscal
burden Japan is facing. One particular interpretation is that the government reduces
transfers to deal with the economic impact of aging. In practice, however, reducing
transfers signiﬁcantly may not be politically feasible and the government may have to use
distorting taxes such as the consumption tax and/or the labor income tax.
        Before we consider the short run eﬀects, it will be useful to describe the long run
consequences of using distorting taxes. For this purpose, we deﬁne an eﬀective tax rate
as a function of τc and τh using equation (6):


          (1 − τ ) = (1 − τh )/(1 + τc ), which implies that τ = (τc + τh )/(1 + τc ).                            (19)

        As equation 19 indicates, both tax rates distort the static ﬁrst order condition
governing the labor/leisure decision. However, the amount of revenue raised by these
taxes is not a function of τ , but instead a function of τc and τh separately. In particular,
the total tax revenue of the government in steady state is given by


  τ c c(τh , τc ) + τ h w(τh , τc )h(τh , τc ) + τ k (r(τh , τc ) − δ)k(τh , τc ) + τ b (1 − q(τh , τc ))b(τh , τc ),

where a ‘ ’ over a variable indicates its steady state value. Note that steady state quantities
such as consumption, hours worked, capital stock, bond holdings, as well as the wage
rate, interest rate and the bond price depend on the particular conﬁguration of τh and τc .
Throughout this section, we hold τ k constant at 35.57% and τ b at 20%.
        In Figure 14, we hold τc constant at 10% and plot total tax revenues as a function
of the steady state labor income tax rate, τ h . In addition, we normalize steady state rev-
enues with respect to steady state government purchases and transfers, and plot revenues
multiplied by 100/(g + tr).
        Using our calibrated value for the Frisch elasticity of labor supply ψ equal to 0.5,
one can see from Figure 14 that there exists no labor income tax rate in steady state
that can raise needed steady state revenues. We show, however, that it is possible to
raise suﬃcient revenues at the steady state with very high values for τ h at very low Frisch
elasticities. We regard the extremely high labor income tax rate corresponding to the
very low Frisch elasticities as being unreasonable parameterizations and therefore we do
not pursue these cases further.
        Instead, we consider increases in the consumption tax rate, perhaps in combination
with increases in the labor income tax rate, that will raise the required revenue in the
steady state.

        Figure 15 depicts the steady state relationship between the consumption tax rate
and government revenues. Note that the value of the consumption tax rate needed to
raise the required revenue is about 40% and not sensitive to the Frisch elasticity of labor
supply. Still, a consumption tax of this magnitude would give pause to policymakers.

        In Figure 16 we show combinations of τ h and τ c that raise the required steady
state revenue. By increasing the labor income tax rate one can reduce the corresponding
consumption tax rate until the steady state is on the wrong side of the “Laﬀer” curve. In
addition, this ﬁgure shows that the tax distortion as deﬁned above is minimized (i.e. the
eﬀective tax is minimized) by setting the labor income tax rate equal to zero and raising
all of the revenue by a consumption tax equal to about 45%. In other words, although
consumption and labor income tax rates both raise the eﬀective tax rate and distort the
labor supply, for a given amount of revenue, it is better to use the consumption tax.

4.3    Fiscal Policy Experiments
Our benchmark exercise computes the additional revenue that must be raised to achieve
ﬁscal balance in the steady state but does not incorporate the distortions that would be
caused by higher tax rates. In this subsection, we compare the results from our benchmark
experiment with ones that use the consumption tax and/or the labor income tax to achieve
ﬁscal balance.
       Before we can proceed, however, we need to fully specify the ﬁscal policies we
consider. The speciﬁc ﬁscal policies considered are motivated by three considerations.
First, we accept the likely political reality that there will be a tendency to put oﬀ any
reform until it cannot be put oﬀ any further. This is why we use the debt to output
trigger described below. Second, we focus on consumption and labor income tax rates
because of their simplicity and because they do not involve the overwhelming distortions
associated with increasing the capital income tax in this environment. Third, we also
consider the possibility of broadening the tax base. We do this by reducing transfers by
8% of output. Recall that we added 8% of output to transfers as computed from Japanese

                                                                    23
data to account for the fact that we abstract from the exemptions and reductions in the
Japanese tax code.
        We assume that tax rates and transfers are equal to their benchmark values until
                                                                                     B      B
the debt to output ratio hits the threshold level, bmax . We denote these values by τc,t , τh,t ,
         B
and T Rt . Once the threshold is hit, say at t = T1 , some or all of these ﬁscal parameters
will change from their benchmark values. For example, if tax broadening is assumed, then
T Rt will equal T RtB − 0.08Yt for t ≥ T1 .
        In each of our experiments, one tax rate, either the consumption tax or the labor
income tax, will be raised endogenously in the steady state to a level denoted by τ c or
τ h to satisfy the government’s steady state budget constraint. In addition, at the start of
the transition (t = T1 ) this tax rate is raised by an amount π over and above its steady
state level to pay for the projected expenditures and pay oﬀ the accumulated debt so that
the debt to output ratio converges to b. In particular, π is the smallest such value that
facilitates convergence to the steady state.
        This ﬁscal policy can be summarized as follows (where x = c or h and t ≥ 2010):

            B
           
           τx,t      if t < T1 (i.e. Bs /Ys ≤ bmax for all s ≤ t)
   τx,t   = τx + π    if T1 ≤ t < T2 (i.e. Bs /Ys > bmax for some s ≤ t and Bt /Yt > b)
           
           
             τx       if t ≥ T2 (i.e. Bt /Yt ≤ b),

where T2 is the second trigger date which signals that the debt to output ratio has fallen
to its steady state level b.
        Table 4 below summarizes the ﬁve experiments we consider in this section. The
ﬁrst two experiments use the consumption tax to achieve ﬁscal balance, while experiments
3-5 use the labor income tax.

                       Figure 17: Consumption Tax Experiments

Figure 17 shows the projected time path of τc,t in experiments 1 and 2 when this tax
rate is used to ﬁnance the projected increases in expenditures and to reduce the debt to
output (eventually) to 60%. The labor income tax rate in these experiments is assumed
to follow the same path as in the benchmark case.
        The diﬀerence between experiments 1 and 2 is the presence of tax broadening in
experiment 2 and its absence in experiment 1. The solid line depicts the time path of
the consumption tax in experiment 1 when it is the only ﬁscal policy instrument used to
achieve ﬁscal balance. In this case, there is a very sharp increase in the consumption tax
in T1 = 2018 from 10% to 61.4%. Eventually, at T2 , the consumption tax rate reaches its
steady state value of τ 1c = 47.4%.
        When we assume in experiment 2 that the government broadens the tax base by 8%
of output, the consumption tax rises from 10% to 38.7% at T1 = 2019. It then converges to
its steady state value of τ 2c = 25.7%, more quickly than before. The signiﬁcant reduction
in transfers allows the government to contain the increase in the consumption tax needed
to pay for the projected increases and at the same time bring the debt to output ratio
down to the prescribed value of 60% much sooner.

4.3.2   Experiments 3–5 (Labor Income Tax)
As Figure 14 shows, it is impossible to raise suﬃcient revenue to cover the projected
expenditures at the steady state when the government relies exclusively on increasing the


                                               26
labor income tax. In Figure 18 we consider additional ﬁscal policies that complement the
increase in the labor income tax so that suﬃcient revenues are raised.
        In our ﬁrst two labor income tax experiments, denoted experiments 3 and 4, when
the debt to output ratio reaches the ﬁrst trigger value of 250% in T1 , the consumption
tax rate is increased exogenously from 10% to 40%.12
        In experiment 3, the labor income tax rate rises to 56.7% in T1 = 2020, eventually
falling to its steady state value of τ 3h = 41.7%. In experiment 4, in addition to the increase
in the consumption tax to 40%, we allow for tax base broadening, as in experiment 2 in
the consumption tax case. Now, the trigger is activated in T1 = 2019 at which point the
labor income tax rate drops slightly from 33.2% to 33.1%, eventually falling to its steady
state level of τ 4h = 20.1%.
        While a very large permanent increase in the consumption tax is required when
there is no tax base broadening, clearly no such increase is needed in experiment 4. Hence,
in experiment 5, we increase the consumption tax to just 15% (ﬁve percentage points above
its benchmark value) at date T1 while also allowing for tax base broadening.13             This
turns out to happen in T1 = 2023, at which time the labor income tax rate is raised to
63.2%, falling eventually to its steady state level of τ 5h = 46.2%.

       These experiments show that without tax base broadening very large increases in
either the consumption tax or the labor income tax (or both) is required. Such ﬁscal
  12
     Our numerical solution method (shooting algorithm) was unable to ﬁnd an equilibrium in experiment
3 unless the consumption tax rate were increased to this level.
  13
     Again, the ﬁve percentage point increase in the consumption tax rate was required to compute an
equilibrium.


                                                 27
policies are not likely to be adopted. Unless one is willing to accept extremely high labor
income tax rates, Japan needs to ﬁnd ways to broaden its tax base and to increase its
consumption tax rate to 40% for a few decades.

4.3.3   Comparing the Benchmark with Alternative Policies
Below, we compare the equilibrium transition paths of key macroeconomic indicators
under the benchmark ﬁscal policy and two alternative ﬁscal policies associated with ex-
periments 2 and 5 in which required the tax revenue is reduced by 8% of output. Recall
that in experiment 2, the ﬁrst trigger of 250% debt to output ratio is hit in 2019 and
therefore the consumption tax is increased from 10% to 38.7%, eventually declining to
its steady state level of 25.7%. In experiment 5, the trigger is activated in 2023 when
the consumption tax rate is raised to 15% and the labor income tax rate is increased to
63.2%, eventually falling to its steady state level of 46.2%.
        Before we begin the description of the eﬀects of ﬁscal responses, it will be useful
to discuss the distortions created by the consumption and the labor income tax rates. In
our environment, the consumption tax distorts the saving decision when the consumption
tax rate changes over time. In particular, when the consumption tax rate is expected to
increase at some future date, this makes consumption today relatively cheaper compared
to consumption in the future. As a result, there is an intertemporal distortion that
reduces saving and raises consumption today. When the consumption tax does increase,
then there is a drop in consumption and a rise in investment.
        As discussed in section 4.2, both tax rates appear in the ﬁrst order condition for
labor and distort labor supply. When one conditions the increases in the consumption
and labor income tax rates on raising the same ﬁxed revenue, then the consumption tax
rate produces a much smaller distortion in labor supply.

                                     Figure 19: Eﬀective Tax Rate

       In Figure 19, we show the eﬀective tax rate τ (deﬁned in equation 19) across three
selected experiments all of which use identical paths of government purchases and transfer
payments. The ﬁgure shows that the resulting increase in the eﬀective tax rate is much
higher when the labor tax is the primary tool used to retire Japan’s debt than if the
consumption tax is used instead. Because the labor income tax is more distorting in this
environment, hours worked and output are more depressed when the labor income tax is
the primary ﬁscal instrument employed.
       In Figure 20, we show the transition paths of consumption and investment, where
everything is expressed relative to the benchmark values in 2010.

                         Figure 20: Consumption and Investment

        As the top frame in Figure 20 shows, there is a consumption boom in experiment
2 which starts even before 2010 in anticipation of the huge increase in the consumption
tax in 2019. When the consumption tax increases in 2019, there is a very sharp decline in
consumption. The mirror image of this consumption path can be seen in the bottom frame
of Figure 20 as investment drops signiﬁcantly for several years until the consumption tax
is raised in 2019 when there is a huge jump in investment.
        The bottom frame in Figure 20 shows that in experiment 5 there is a large increase
in investment prior to 2023 when the labor income tax rate is raised signiﬁcantly. At this
date, there is a very sharp decline in investment as well as consumption.

       Figure 21 depicts the responses of labor, capital and output in the selected ex-
periments. In the top frame of Figure 21, there is a sharp decline in hours worked, and
as a result, in output, in response to the large increase in the labor income tax rate of
experiment 5. In experiment 2, however, the distortion on labor supply is much smaller
and spread over time. In the second and third frames of Figure 21 the eﬀects of changes
in hours worked and investment are reﬂected in changes in the capital stock and output.
       Figure 22 shows the transition paths for debt to output ratios under the same three
scenarios.

4.4     Sensitivity Analysis
Here we examine the sensitivity of our results to the parameter ψ, which is the intertem-
poral elasticity of substitution of labor supply, in this case also the Frisch elasticity of
labor supply, and our measure of population. Note that in our benchmark experiment,
the consumption tax rate after 2010 follows the expected path according to current law
in Japan, namely, the consumption tax rate is projected to rise from 5% to 8% in 2014
and to 10% in 2015. The labor income tax rate is equal to 33.2% for 2007 and beyond. In
our experiments, one or both these tax rates change according to the ﬁscal sustainability
rule we impose on the government.



4.4.1   Frisch Elasticity and Economic Responses

To explore the role played by the Frisch elasticity, we consider a lower value ψ = 0.25 and
compare the economic responses to those from the benchmark value of ψ = 0.5. Table 5
describes our ﬁndings.

        In Table 5 we show the ﬁrst year that our ﬁscal sustainability rule is triggered,
which occurs when the debt to output ratio exceeds 250%, and the new levels of relevant
tax rates. In particular, we show results from experiments 2 and 5, both of which are
described in the previous subsection. Columns labeled ψ = 0.5 report the ﬁndings that
are also shown in Figures 17 and 18.
        In experiment 2, using the smaller Frisch elasticity results in a relatively small
change. With a smaller distortion in labor supply, a slightly smaller consumption tax
during the transition can now provide ﬁscal sustainability. The only notable diﬀerence
is the shortened length of the transition of the consumption tax rate to its steady state
value of 46.9%. The transition is now 20 periods shorter than with ψ = 0.5.
        In experiment 5, the length of transition is about the same, but the labor income
tax rate during the transition is now lower at 54.5% relative to 63.2%. The smaller Frisch
elasticity results in a smaller distortion in labor supply and therefore a tax rate not as
high as that required when ψ = 0.5.



4.4.2   Working Age Population versus Total Population

In this paper we have calculated ‘per capita’ variables by using the working age population.
This assumption may imply a relatively small consumption tax base as we abstract from
the people above the age of 69 who also pay this tax. Hence, in this subsection we use
total population in Japan as an alternative measure of population to examine if this larger
tax base will change our results.

                                                 33
       Table 6 presents the key ﬁndings from the two consumption tax experiments in
Figure 17 (experiments 1 and 2) and the corresponding experiments using total population
instead of working age population.

       Indeed, as Table 6 shows, using a population measure that includes retirees makes
a diﬀerence. In particular, the larger population measure produces a smaller equilibrium
consumption tax rate during the transition. The diﬀerence is about four percentage points
in both experiments, although this diﬀerence nearly vanishes in steady state.


5    Conclusions
Japan is aging rapidly. The ratio of the number of Japanese over the age of 64 to those
between 20 and 64 is projected to increase from 39% in 2010 to above 91% in 2070. This
dramatic shift in the share of elderly in the society is expected to raise public retirement
and health expenditures signiﬁcantly. Indeed, the ratio of these aging-related expenditures
to output is projected to rise an additional 7 percentage points. In addition, past spending
decisions have already caused the net debt to output ratio to soar above 110% by 2010.
       In this paper we build a neoclassical growth model to measure the size of the ﬁscal
response needed to restore ﬁscal balance in Japan. In our model, both consumption and
labor income taxes distort labor supply. However, for a given amount of revenue, the
consumption tax is less distorting than the labor income tax.
       Our main result is that ﬁscal sustainability requires a large adjustment in tax
revenues, in the range of 30-40% of aggregate consumption if we abstract from distortions.
Adjusting the consumption or labor income tax rate to achieve this, however, requires that
taxes be set to unprecedentedly high levels–tax rates of 40-60%. The lower end of this
range is made possible if revenue equal to 8% of output can be raised through broadening
the tax base.

       The dismal nature of these ﬁndings is motivation for research that explores policy
measures that will allow some of the ﬁscal adjustment to come from sources other than
higher taxes. These may include reducing expenditures via reforms of public pensions
and health expenditures, a new approach to immigration, family policies to raise fertility
and to increase female labor force participation, and microeconomic reforms to incentivize
higher rates of innovation and growth.
