                   Reconsidering the Work Disincentive
                       Effects of Social Security

                               ABSTRACT


     This paper shows that, contrary to commonly held views, the provisions

of the social security law actually provide strong work incentives for older

men. The reason is that, for most workers, higher current earnings lead to

higher future social security benefits. These incentives have been particularly

strong for workers under 65 years of age and, although they will be reduced

somewhat when the 1977 amendments to the social security law become fully

effective, they will remain substantial. The findings raise serious questions

about recent econometric work attributing the decline in labor force partici-

pation rates of older men to the social security system.

1. Introduction

           Labor force participation rates of older men in the United States have

declined significantly in recent decades. Among the factors that allegedly account

for this phenomenon is the social security system1 which has increased both in coverage

and in generosity over the period. That social security should lead to earlier

retirement seems in accord with common sen and so is widely assumed. Furthermore,

several recent econometric contributions have appeared to buttress this common
              1
assumption.

           Our purpose in this paper is a curmudgeonly one: to case doubt on the

widespread view that social security provides significant work disincentives for older

men. Our principal reason for raising doubts about the common sense view is a poorly-

understood provision of the law which provides strong work incentives for most workers--

incentives which in many cases are large enough to cancel out or even overwhelm the

work disincentive effects of the earnings te5t.

           The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly describes and

critically evaluates the conventional argument for why social security discourages

labor supply. Section 3 explains in some detail the important aspect of the law that

has hitherto mostly been ignored: the fact that current earnings can increase future

social security benefits. Calculations based on the Longitudinal Retirement History

Survey (LRHS) are presented to show that this effect is typically equivalent to a wage

subsidy   roughly equal in size to the tax rate of the earnings test. Section 4 offers
some concluding remarks, but   our   main message is both simple and important enough to
be inenlioned right at the outset. Social security certainly distort.s labor-leisure
choice, but not in any simple way. It. may in fact induce some older workers to reduce
their labor supply. But there must be many others who--if they understood the law
properly--would be encouraged to work even more than they would in the absence of
social security.

2.    Work Disincentives: The Conventional View

              The conventional view that social security discourages the work effort of

older workers is based on two perceived problems with the law. First, benefits are

subject to an earnings test which implicitly taxes earnings beyond an exempt amount

at a 50% marginal rate. Second, actuarial adjustments for those who defer benefits

arebelieved to be insufficient, so the expected present value of social security
benefits declines the longer one stays at work. We take up each of these in turn.
The Earnings Test
              The structure of the social security benefit formula is approximately                          as


follows. Let E              (e1, e2, ...,   eT),   where e1 is         covered earnings 1          years ago,
be    a vector describing an individual's earnings history; and let X be a vector of

relevant demographic characteristics such as marital status, number of dependent

children, etc. The law          defines a potential benefit B                  B(E, x).2      ce   current
                                                           , benefits       are reduced by         for each dollar

 individuals who receive social security benefits corresponds with that for individuals

 who do not (line segment de).

           The potential work disincentive effects of the earnings test are obvious

 from Figure 1 and, indeed, we should not be surprised to find many people "bunched"

 at point c.4 This is the basic indictment of the earnings test; but it is naive for

 several reasons. The first of these is well known: many individuals who select a point

 to the left of point c receive an increase in their future benefits.

 Actuarial Adjustments

           The nature of the actuarial adjustment made to future social security benefits

 of individuals who have some of their benefits withheld depends on whether the individual

 is eligible for partial benefits (ages 62-64) or for full benefits (ages 65 and over).

          For individuals aged 62-64, the intent of the law is to provide an actuarially

fair increase in future benefits for those who forego current benefits. Let us

consider what an actuarially fair adjustment would mean in terms of the budget constraint

of Figure 1. Individuals who elect not to draw the (partial) benefits for which they

are eligible (the height ab) would have their future benefits increased to compensate

them for this loss on an actuarial basis. Thus consider an individual who chooses

to work enough so as not to draw benefits at age 62. With no actuarial offset, his

net earnings would be e0(l-t), and he would accrue no future social security benefits.

With a full actuarial offset, by contrast, he would receive e0(1-t) from his own

earnings plus an increase in future social security benefits equal in actuarial present

value to the benefits he gives up this year, B, making his total income e0(l-t) + B.

Thus his effective budget constraint, would be parallel to line ade , and uniformly

above it by an amount equal to B. This is shown in Figure 2 as line abcfg.5

         While students of the social security program are well aware of the actuarial

adjustmert given to workers aged 62-64, many have expressed skepticism that it is

actuarially fair.6 To measure the extent to which the compensation actually is fair,
we have made computations based on the law as it was in 1973, and life tables based

on 1975, for a number of hypothetical individuals. Our calculations can be explained

with reference to Figure 2. In this figure, the kinked budget constraint abcde simply

duplicates Figure 1, and the hypothetical budget line       abcfg   indicates what a full

actuarial compensation would create (distance fd is equal to distance ab). Consider

the decision to decrease leisure from 10 to 1 hours. With no actuarial offset,

the individual would move from point c to poinL d .         With a full adjustment, he would

move from point c to point f instead. With a partial adjustment, he would move to

some intermediate point uch as h .     Our calculations measure the distance dh as

a fraction of the potential distance df     ab •   Thus a value of zero represents no

actuarial adjustment, a value of unity represents a full adjustment, and so on.

          The first two columns of Table 1 offer a selection of the many results we

have obtained. There are several striking aspects. First of all, we have selected

as our 'base case" a representative 62-year--old: he is white and married, his wife

is 59 years old,7 he has no dependent children, and his earnings history gives him

                                                            representative   amount. For
average monthly earnings (AME) of $Li36, an arbitrary but

such a person, the adjustment is precisely actuarially fair at about a 5% interest

rate--a figure that is quite high for a real after-tax interest rate. At more

realistic (lower) interest rates, there is actually a considerable actuarial bonus

for deferrinp benefits.

          The story is only slightly less dramatic for an unmarried man.       While the

actuarial present value of the increase in his future benefits is smaller since he

has no wife, so is the current benefit that he gives up.       On balance, the actuarial

offset is reduced somewhat. (Compare lines 1 and 2.)

          The actuarial offset is smaller, however, if the wife is at least 65 or if

there are dependent children. The reason is that no compensation is given for wives'

or children's benefits that are lost when the worker foregoes one year's benefits

by continuing to work. Lines 3-5 in Table 1 show how the actuarial offset is reduced

in several such cases. "Older wife" denotes a 62-year-old man with a 65-year-old

wife. For him the actuarial adjustment is unfair, but still restores 71—87% of his

lost benefits.8 The situation is quite similar for a 62-year-old man with a 59-year-

old wife and a 15-year-old child ('one dependent chi1d, line ii-).     For those few men

of this age with two dependent children (line c) the actuarial offset falls far short

of being complete.

            Things are quite different, however, for individuals aged 65 and over

because, for them, the law makes no effort to give fair actuarial compensation for

lost benefits. Instead, until the .1977 amendments to the social security law become

effective, a token increase of 1% in future benefits is granted in any year in which

the individual earns enough to lose all of his current benefits (i.e., works somewhere

to the left of point d). This introduces an upward discontinuity into the budget

constraint at point

            That this 1% increase in benefits is quite inadequate is seen in the two

middle columns of Table 1--which apply to a 65-year-old man. Except for the base

case, the actuarial adjustment is trivial (12% or less). In the base case, however,

the wife is under 65;   so the offset, though incomplete, is not negligible because

are recouped.

            The 1977 amendments raise the 1% increase in future benefits to 3% beginning

in 1981. As can be seen in the last two columns of Table 1, this reform will increase

the actuarial adjustment in our base case to around 50%--thus negating about half of

postpone benefits that is typically fair or more than fair. This means that the

effective budget constraint comes much closer to abcfg in Figure 2 than to abcde, so

that the effective wage is essentially what it would have been in the absence of

social security benefits. For men 65 and over, the actuarial offsets are far from

complete, though the 1977 amendments will eventually make them restore perhaps 30-50%

of the lost benefits for a typical man.


3.   The Effect of Current Earnings on Future Benefits

          We have thus far argued that, when both the earnings test and the actuarial

offsets are considered simultaneously, the social security law provides neither work

incentives nor disincentives for 62'-64-year-olds, but probably provides some disincentives

for those 65 and older. We now turn to a rather neglected provision of the law which

provides rather dramatic work incentives for almost all older workers.

          The provision we have in mind is the automatic recomputation of benefits

whenever current earnings rise above a certain amount. We first describe and evaluate

how this mechanism operated prior to the 1977 amendments to the social security law--

since this is the law that has applied to all men who have retired to date, and

thus to all the recent econometric studies that have purported to detect a negative effect

of social socurty benefits on the labor supply of older men.1° Once this discussion

is complete, we consider how things were changed by the 1977 amendments.

Automatic Benefit Recomputation (ABR)

          To illustrate how automatic benefit recomputation (ABR) works, consider a man

turning 65 in 1975. As noted above, the potential benefit for which he is eligible,

B, dept'nds on his earn:thgs history, E, and on two principal demographic characteristics:

whether he is married, and whether he has dependent children. It is calculated in

steps. First, his earnings history is used to compute his Average Monthly Earnings

(ÂME). The AME depends on the T years of highest current earnings between 1951 and

the current ytar, where the value of T is the year in which the irdividual reached
                                                                                     7.




65, minus 1956.11 Let the earnings history for those          T years be (81, e2, ...,     eT),

and let e.        be the lowest of these. As soon as current earnings, e0,       exceed emi

the automatic benefit recomputation provision (APR) comes into play because e0

replaces emin in the earnings base used for computing benefits in future years.

           The effect of this replacement on ÂME is easy to calculate, as it depends

only on the worker's age. For each dollar of earnings above emjn the ÂME increases

by l/12T (the 12 converts annual earnings
                                                 to moh1y earnings). But what this increase

in ÂME does to the individual's future benefits depends on several other factors.
                                                        (PIA) depends on ÂME in a piecewise

the potential monthly benefit, B/12, is defined as

children. 13

           Thus the increase in annual benefits when current earnings increase by one

dollar (assuming current earnings exceed emin) is
                                                                 =   r(x)

life expectancy of the wife, because of survivor's benefits).

 distribution of MIE, PIA/ AHE is about .45, so the PIA increases by about .l9çt

 for each dollar of additional earnings. If he is married, this increase in the P1A

 raises the monthly benefit check by           so the annual check goes up by          while

 this may seem small, it must be remembered that this amount is to be received for as

 long as the individual lives, and then two-thirds of it is received for as long as

 the wife   survives.   For a 1% real interest rate and actual life expectancies, an

 actuarial present value calculation amounts to multiplying this annual benefit of

 by a factor of about 16. The conclusion, therefore, is that the additional social

 security benefits attributable to the recomputation amount      to about       for each

 dollar of earnings; that is, the marginal return to work effort is thereby increased

 by 51% of the wage rate. This is hardly a trivial effect, to say the least.

             Since the value of benefits from ABR is obviously sensitive to the

discount rate used, this is an appropriate point to explain our use of such low

discount rates. Note first that a real after-tax interest rate is appropriate, since

social security benefits are indexed and tax free, and that such rates are historically

very low. (Indeed, they are often negative.) Second, note that (except for issues

of risk aversion) the probability that the individual might die is irrelevant to the

choice of discount rate because survival probabilities are automatically incorporated

in the   actuarial   present value calcu].ations. Third, while high rates of subjective

time preference are often confused with high rates of interest, only interest rates

are relevant to valuing streams of future income. Subjective time preferences come

into play only in deciding how to consume the value of an asset over one's remaining

lifetime. Even if older men have very high subjective discount rates, it would still

be   appropriat.e to use the low market interest rate unless these men had drawn down all their
other assets and were being constrained by an inability to borrow against future
social security benefits. For all these reasons, we believe that a very low discount
rate like $    is most appropriate.

  the   level of earnings at which ARR came into play (p.) and the magnitude of the

 implicit   wage subsidy. Tables 2 and 3      summarize the results.

             Look   first   at columns (1) and (2) in Table 2, which indicate how common

 automatic benefit recomputation has been in practice. About 224% of married men and

 32 of single men were eligible for an implicit wage subsidy from ABR on their very

 first dollar of earnings            = 0) because they had not worked in covered employment

 for T years. Virtually 100% of the sample would have been able to receive ABR before

 they earned $5,000. For reference, average annual earnings of all private nonfarrn

 workers in the U.S. in 1975 exceeded $8,000. Another way to put these results into

 perspective is to note that the exeipt amount of earnings under the social security

 law, denoted in     above, was $2,520 in 1975. Thus for almost half of all workers the

 wage subsidy from ABR became relevant before the tax from the earnings test, so that

 Figure 3b rather than Figure 3a was relevant.

             The next question is how large the implicit wage subsidies implied by

 automatic benefit recomputation actually are. Table 3, which contains the principal

results of this paper, tabulates the frequency distribution of this subsidy expressed

as   a percentage of the     current wage. For the most part the calculations use the 1

percent discount rate that we find most realistic. However, for those who prefer a

higher rate, we also show results based on a 5% discount rate. Each column in t.e

table is a frequency distribution. Thus, for example, with a 1% discount rate and the

1975 law, colunin (1), 42.14 of married men had subsidy rates between 55% and 60%,

33.1% hrid subsidy rates btweon 50% and 55%, and so on.

            The results in columns (1)-(3) are quite striking. Implicit subsidy rates

for married men average about 54%, with most concentrated in the 50-60% range.16

Thus benefit recomputation just about offsets the tax implicit in the earnings test.

Even at a 5% discount rate, which we view as far too high, most married men still had

implicit subsidy rates between 35 and            Single men receive only about half this

subsidy rate, however.

           The conclusion, then, is that our illustrative example is indeed representative

of the situation that has faced the vast majority of married men who reached retirement

age during the 1970s. The automatic benefit recomputation certainly has been no mere

detail.

           It is, however, worth paying some attention to the tails of the distributions

in Table 3.   Looking first at the lower tail, we note that 9Z of       married men and     about
                                                                       individuals are at
15% of single men get no benefit recomputation at all. These
the minimum PIA, so their benefits are independent of current ernings at the margin.

For this minority, budget constraint abcde in Figure       3a is a   fairly accurate


representation
                 of their choice set, and so work disincentives are likely. At the other
extreme, however, we find that about 14    percent   of married men and about 1.5 percent
of single men turning 65 in 1975 experienced implicit wage subsidies greater than 70
percent: This is an extremely large wedge' which should have had a correspondingly
large   incentive effect on   their labor supply.
            One further characteristic of the automatic benefit recomputation (ABR)

merits consideration. The actuarial present value of any increase in future social

security benefits obviously depends on age.

on 65-ycar-olds. If we considered these sare individuals at a younger age, the annual

flows of future benefits from ABR would be identical, but the discount factors needed

to convert these flows to an     equivalent   current wage subsidy would be greater. Thus

the implicit suhdy rate is lower at younger ages, which provides an incentive to

shift labor supply to older ages--exactly the opposite of the assunption made by

Burkhauser and Turner (1978).

            For men older than 6,    however,   potential benefits always start "next year,"

                                                                                the
so the number of years over which benefits can be received falls, thus reducing
                                                                                             12.




 implicit subsidy. For example, the average subsidy rate for married men using a 1%

 discount rate falls from 54%     at   age 65,   to   44% by age 69   and 34% by   age 73.   Thus the
 subsidy rate peaks at age 65.

             Combining both of these cases, it seems that the automatic benefit

 recomputation provision, considered in isolation, provides some incentive to concentrate

 work effort around age 65.     As we have seen earlier, however, the actuarial offsets

 to the earnings test are normally fair before age 6 and unfair thereafter. So it

 seems that when both factors are considered social security provides the strongest

 work incentives for individuals aged 62-64--precisely the group that many have claimed

 are induced to retire prematurely by social security

 The 1977 Social Security Amendments

            In 1977 many aspects of the social security law were revamped, and one of

 these changes affected automatic benefit recomputation in an important way. Prior to

 the 1977 amendments, the A1€ was based on the nominal earnings history. Since the

 1977 amendments,covered earnings through age 60          have   been indexed to average earnings

 in the year in which the individual turns 60. Thus, for example, if a nominal

earnings figure like $1,600 from some past year is included in the earnings base,

but average wages have tripled between that year and the year in             which the individual
turns   60, then $4,800 is used in computing Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIMS).
Earnings   after age 6o   are included without indexing, just as before.
           This   element of indexing has a clear effect on the likelihood that any

particular individual will be subject to automatic benefit recomputation: it lowers

the chances by substantially reducing the gap between "old earnings" and "current

earnings" for most people. In addition, for those who remain subject to ABR, the

implicit subsidy rates were reduced by the 1977 amendments because the amendments,

while raising typical AIMS values by indexing, simultaneously reduced the slope

coefficients (PIA/ AI1E. For most people, this reduction was about one-third,

indicating a one-third reduction in the typical subsidy rate.

            Nonetheless,   due to the combined effects of inflation since age 60 and

the   normal life-cycle pattern in earnings, most older workers are still able to earn

                                                                     while the 1977
much more than emin by working close to full time. On balance, then,

amendments will reduce both the fraction of the population subject to AER               and the

typical wage subsidies that it provides, it still seems likely that a large number

of older workers will receive sizeable implicit wage subsidies through ABR.

            Since   the 1977 amendments are not yet fully effective, we have no actual sample

of potential retirees whose subsidy rates we can compute.              Our approach   was to pretend

that,   the 1977 amendments had been in effect in 1975,        the   year our sample of men

                                                                              in
reached age 6. We computed AIME for each man, applying indexing as prescribed
                        17 and repeated the calculations discussed earlier. By doing so,
the 1977 amendments,

we get a quantitative "feel" for the changes in ABR wrought by the amendments.

             As columns (3) and (L)    of "able   2 point out, the distribution of emin is

pushed 'outward (compare columns (i) and (2). The most common               values of efl for

married   men, for example, would have been in the      $6,000-$7,200 range with indexing

                                                       this means that some workers that were
instead of in the $3,600-$4,800 range. Clearly
                                                              would not have been eligible if
eligible for benefit rncomputati-on without indexing
                                                                 would have been increased 5
indexing    had been in effect. The mean value of
                                                              by the top row of Table 2:
by indexing. Note, however, the obvious point made
indexing    has no effect whatever on     the substantial minority of men whose emin's

are zero because they lack sufficient years
                                                    of covered earnings. And when we remember

                                            exceeded $8,000, it becomes clear that a great
that    average annual earnings in 197.5

innv    workers would have   been   eligible for ABR even with indexing.
             Turning next to   columns (14)-(6) of Table 3, we see that the wage subsidy

rates    implicit in automatic benefit recomputation would have been reduced by about
                                                   Nonetheless, this still leaves the average
one-third    by indexing, just as suggested.

 subsidy rates in the 3545 range to about 8o of all married workers.

            Thus even when the 1977 amendments become fully effective, automatic benefit

recomputation will still provide large wage subsidies to most workers.

Interaction with Supplemental Security Income (ssI)

            One final proviso about recent revisions in the law. Since 1975, individuals

with poor earnings histories have been eligible to draw benefits from Supplemental

Security Income (ssi) that exceed the benefits they would be entitled to under the

standard social security program. For these individuals, who now comprise about one-

eighth of all social security recipients, automatic benefit recomputation is irrievant.

Thus   some of the low income people that would have faced huge wage subsidies from ABR
prior to the    advent   of SSI (the upper tails of the distributions in Table   3) no

longer   have this strong work incentive.


4. Summary and Conclusions

            The main findings of this short paper are easy to summarize:

            1. The earnings test for social security does not present a work disincentive

for the typical worker aged 62-64 because, if he loses benefits to the earnings test,

he recoups most or even more than all of them through an actuarial adjustment of his

future benefits. There are, however, exceptions to this--especially those few men

of this age who have dependent children.

           2. At least prior to the 1977 amendments and the advent of SSI, the vast

majority of workers became subject to automatic benefit recomputation at rather low

levels of work effort. This provision provided an implicit wage subsidy of 5O-6O,

about the same as   the   tax rate in t,he earnings test, and it remained in effeot over

a much broader range of earnings.

           3.   Because of these two effects, and especially the latter, it seems likely

that the social security law--if understood by the public--should provide work

disincentives for only a small minority of individuals. It seems that social security
                                                               18
should induce the majority of older workers to work harder.
                                                                                    15.


              4.   Recent changes in the law, especially SSI and   the   indexing provisions

in the 1977 amendments, will reduce the importance of automatic recomputation, though

it still seems likely that most individuals working close to full time will be subject

to it. Wage subsidies implicit in the benefit recomputation will be about two-thirds

as large as they were in the 1970s.

              5.   Social   security no doubt distorts labor-leisure choices in many complex

ways, and therefore creates a variety of deadweight losses.        But the glib assertion

that these distortions typically amount to powerful work disincentives is just that--

a 1ib assertion.

              These findings, in turn, lead us to two sorts of conclusions--one aimed at

scholars doing research on the effects of social security, and the other aimed at

policyinaker   s.
              6. Since a full understanding of the complex nature of the social security
law   shows that    it does not provide significant work disincentives for many people,
the   many recent econometric findings that social security reduced labor supply and/or

encouraged retirement are surprising, to say the least.19 The approaches used in

econometric studies of the labor supply effects of social security need rethinking,

and will probably have to be much more complicated than those that have been used to date.

              7. In discussing automatic benefit recomputation with knowledgeable governhuLent

officials and academic researchers, we learned that while almost everyone knew that

the provision existed, almost no one had any idea of its quantitative importance.

F1rthnrmore, the nature of the recomputation is clearly complex. These two facts

suggest to    us   that many people   eligible for social security benefits may   not understand

how   their   current earnings affect their future benefits. It is possible, therefore,

that social security is discouraging labor supply only because its provisions are poorly

understood. If this hypothesis is correct, then one simple way to cure any 'disincentive"

effects that social security may now be having on the labor supply decisions of older
                                                                             16.




workers is simply to tell these workers how the law really works: Happily, this

policy initiative is non-partisan and non-ideological, requires no legislation, and

should entail negligible budgetary expense. A good policy, it would seem.

          However, a broader policy issue can be raised. According to our arguments,

social security is probably distorting the labor-leisure decisions of most older

workers in the direction of greater work effort. This is particularly true of those

between 62 and 64 years of age, who on balance typically receive a 5O wage subsidy.

It is not clear what social purpose is served by this distortion.

 able to collect more as wives (50 percent of their husband's benefits) than they could

 the only source of non-labor income, and income taxes are ignored.

earnings are withheld, jump        to offset a month's lost benefits whenever          benefits
are withheld in that month.
