                              TAX POLICY AND INVESTMENT



                                           ABSTRACT


       In this paper, we summarize recent advances in the study of effects of tax policy on the fixed

investment decisions of firms. We attempt to identify consensus where it has been achieved and to

highlight important unresolved issues. In addition, we discuss the implications   of recent findings

for the analysis of policy options, and discuss arguments for and against long-run tax policy that

favors business investment spending.

 “The~rst ship to arrive in St. Petersburg in 1701, a Dutch vessel, receivedfiom Peter the Great the
privilege of paying no custom duties for the rest of its physical life --a concession which had the
e~ect of prolonging the ship 5 ll~efor almost a century -- three orfour times the normal span.”1



 I.       Introduction

          Just as Peter the Great’s tax amnesty spurred substantial maintenance     investment   in that

Dutch ship, many governments have apparently believed that tax policy can be used as an instrument

to alter firms’ capital investment decisions. Indeed, investment w credits (ITCS), special investment

“reseme” tids,     or accelerated depreciation allowances have been the rule rather than the exception

in most developed countries since World War II. Against this backdrop, however, economists have

generally struggled to find a significant impact of tax policy on investment.
                                                                          I
          The empirical economic literature on investment finds its early ~oots in the work of Afialian

(1909), Clark (191 7), and Fisher (1930). Aftalian and Clark observed that business investment is

highly correlated with changes in business output -- providing support for the early “accelerationist”

school -- while Fisher’s neoclassical theory argued for the importance of marginal conditions.       At

the risk of oversimpli&ing,   the literature subsequently divided into two camps. One side argued that

the “accelerator” model pefiormed      so well empirically that it should be adopted as the standard

model, the other side looked to “neoclassical” models relating investment to the user cost of capital.

While the neoclassical school may have had the theoretical high ground, empirical implementations

of neoclassical models have been generally disappointing.      Indeed, while the time-series evidence

has always revealed that lags of output are highly correlated with investment,      interest rates have




      1See Braudel (1992, page 241).
                                                     L

provided     very limited additional   explanatory   power. 2 The debate between these two schools

provides a usefil introduction to our review of the literature relating tax policy to investment.    Many

obsewers even recently (e.g., Clark, 1993) have argued that tax policy likely does not significantly

affect investment,   and the arguments inevitably harken back to the accelerationist     debate.

        Motivated     by the hope that the simplest neoclassical models failed to explain investment

fluctuations because they were too stylized, substantial energy was devoted to the task of extending

these models to incorporate more realistic assumptions in the 1970s and early 1980s.3 Chief among

these was the incorporation      of costs of adjusting the capital stock.   According to these models,

investment is forward-looking,     and based upon rational expectations of future variables.       Because

firms base their expectations of future variables in part on their observ~ions   of the past, researchers

identified a link between lagged variables and current investment.     Indeed, correlation of pmt output

growth and fiture “fidamentals”        could be used to rationalize a strong correlation between current

investment     and past values of the growth of output.        When asked to explain the time-series

movements      of investment,   however, these new models proved very disappointing.           Additiond

variables that were meant to capture the marginal cost or return to investment seemed to be of little

use, over and above output, in predicting investment.        Moreover, structural parameter estimates

tended to be wildly implausible.



   2 We update the time-series stylized facts in section III.

    3 Eisner and Strotz ( 1963) offer an early discussion of adjustment costs. The theory was
developed and extended by Lucas ( 1967, 1976), Gould (1 968), Treadway (1 969, 1971), Uzawa
(1969), Mortensen (1 973), Abel (1 980), andHayashi(1982).       Researchers have generally
assumed convex costs of adjusting the capital stock; the idea is that it is more costly to
implement a given increment to the capital stock quickly rather than gradually. We discuss
alternative assumptions about adjustment costs in Section V.
          It is at this point in the evolution of the literature that we begin this review.       After briefly

reviewing neoclassical theory, we summarize recent theoretical advances in section II. Section 111

updates the time-series    stylized facts for investment.     In Section IV, we review recent empirical

studies of investment     in producers’ durable equipment.        After concluding     in section IV that tax

policy designed to stimulate investment likely has done so, we turn in section V to the question of

the desirability of such intervention, highlighting the arguments that have been made for and against

stimulative tax policy. In section VI, we consider implications of our analysis for two current policy

questions--whether    lower intlation offers a significant investment stimulus and the consequences for

investment of a switch from the current tax system to a broad-based consumption                tax. Section VII

concludes.

II.       Models of Investment in the Neoclassical       Tradition

          Models in the neoclassical    tradition focus on the derived demand for capital by value-

maximizing     firrns.4 This intuition is typically transformed      into models of investment      by making

assumptions     about costs of changing the capital stock. For simplicity of exposition, consider the

decisions of a price-taking    firm. Absent taxes, in each period t, firm i’s real net cash flow is given

by:


               x i,t = F(Ki,_,       ,Nif)-w/N,        {-p,    li,    -c(lif,     K,   (_,),                 (1)



where K(-) is the capital stock, ~(~) is the real revenue function of the firm, N is the variable factor,

w is the price of the variable factor, p is the real price of investment goods, and C~) is the function




      4 For a more detailed discussion of the models introduced in this section, see Abel (1 990).

determining the cost of adjusting the capital stock. In the absence of taxes, then, the marginal cost

of newly installed capital is p, + Cl ~IioK,,,. J.

           To study investment tax policy, we add to the net cash flow expression in(1) a profits tax

at rate ~, an investment tax credit at rate k, and the present value of a dollar’s worth of depreciation

allowances, Z.5 With these additions, the marginal cost of newly installed capital is:




                                p, (1   -ri ,) + (1 -T,) Cl (Ii , , Kit ,.,) ,




where ri, = k, + T, z,, , and we can rewrite (1) as:


     xi,       =   (1 -T,) ( F(K,   ,_,, N,)   - w, Ni , - C1 (Zi ,, K.,,,.,))-P,   (l   -r,,,)],,.

           Under the assumption of value maximization,           the firm maximizes the present value of its

fiture net cash flows. Letting ~ be the discount factor appropriate for the ith fin-n the firm’s value

at time t, firm value is given by:



                                                                                                         (2)




where E,, is the expectations operator for firm i conditional on information available at time t. The

parallel analysis which employs a more general tax formulation which nests that of many
countries see Sinn (1987), and King and Fullerton (1984). Sweden, in particular, has had one of
the more complicated and interesting tax codes in the postwar period. For a discussion relating
their code to this model see Taylor (1982), Sodersten (1989), and Auerbach, Hassett, and
Sodersten (1 995).

stock, to maximize firm value, The change in the capital stock — net investment — is given by lj, -

6K,,,.,, where 5 is the (assumed constant) proportional rate of depreciation.

           For investment, the solution to the problem requires that the marginal value of an additional

unit of investment      equal its marginal cost.    Denoting the shadow value of an additional unit of

investment by q:6


                             9,,, = P, (1 ‘ri, f) + (1 ‘T> CJ (l;, f , ‘i, f.~) ~                         (3)



The shadow price q must also obey:


       Aqi,      = (r, + 6, q,, ~ - (I -~i) F~ (K,, ,.l , ~,, ~ ) + (1 -’c, ) .CK (Ii. , , Ki, /-1) ~    (4)



where r is the instantaneous     rate at which marginal cash flows are discounted.

           We can now use this general set up to examine two conventional               formulations    of the

neoclassical    approach, one based on the user cost of capital and one based on q.

           A. User Cost of Capital

           Jorgenson (1963) and his collaborators     suggested using a form of equation (4) to derive an

expression for the “user cost of capital. ” If we interpret q as the price at which a unit of capital can

be bought or sold, we can consider the thought experiment             of renting a unit of newly installed

capital.    The owner of this capital will levy a rental cost c such that the rate of return equals r, the

return available on alternative (financial) assets. me owner’s return from renting the capital equals



     b Implicit in this derivation is the idea that firms can remove capital goods and sell them subject
to an adjustment cost.

                                                             6

the rental cost, c, plus the capital gain on the machine, Aqi, ., /qi,, less the depreciation              of the

machine,   aq,,.   Expressed as a rate of return and equating the rate of return with the available

alternative yields:


                                                                            A q,
                                   c;, =(l-tt)(r,            +a)q,        -—.                                (5)
                                                                              91,(




We can substitute for q in equation (3) to express the user cost as a function of the price of

investment goods, adjustment costs, and tax parameters.                   Jorgenson assumed that adjustment costs

were zero, yielding the fmiliar          user cost expression:




                        c l.t‘P,     (
                                          I -ri,                         A 0,+1 (1   -r,j) ),                 (6)
                                            ~_’T    )(rt+a           _
                                                                           p, (1 -r,,,)




Returning to our derivation of q in (3), we can more generally express the user cost as equaling the

marginal cash flow of an additional unit of capital:


                      (1 ‘T,   ) (FK (Kj,~., , ‘j, f) - c~ (1,,f , ‘i, ,-[)) =            Cj,f .




        Jorgenson’s interest centered on isolating the effects of the user cost on the desired capital

stock and investment,     He considered a special case in which the prices p, w, and r are constant and

I,, = 5K,,, ., in steady state, (so that C, = C~ = O). Hence from (7):


                                         (1 -Tt) FK (Ki, ,.l , ~i,l) = c,,, .
                                                                                          ,./

                                                      7

Assuming a constant elasticity of substitution production fiction:


                                                                           1

                           F(K,      N)= A[bK-e+ (l-b) N-e ]-~,

where ~> O, 0< b <1, and 6>-1,        one can express the marginal revenue product of capital as:



                               FK(K,N)=(~                  )(:)”8.
                                                      A“


Returning to the Jorgensonian derivation in (7), the steady-state capital stock can be described as a

function of the user cost of capital and the firm’s real revenue:



                                    K*      = (:)”   F u (:)-”      ,                                (8)
                                                A




where o is the elasticity of substitution    (u = 1/(1 + (3)).

        Equation (8) describes the steady-state capital stock, K*. As we describe in more detail

below, it is not an “estimating equation. ” To estimate investment, Jorgenson assumed that a = 1

(Cobb-Douglas    technology), so that K*,,, = @/A~[() -r,)F, /c,, J.    He then assumed that the capital

stock adjusted to the desired level at an exogenous rate dictated by, e.g., delivery lags. A substantial

empirical debate ensued, with Eisner and Nadiri (1968, 1970) claiming on the one hand that the

elasticity of substitution is nearer zero than unity, while Jorgenson and Stephenson (1969) claimed

on the other hand that an elasticity of unity is more consistent with the data.’



   7 It maybe important to allow the ex an?e and ex post values of u to be different, the
argument being that the labor needed for a given piece of capital in place is fixed. This is the
“putty-clay” hypothesis, put forward by Bischoff(1971 ). In some cases, these models have been
shown to perform well empirically (see Struckrneyer, 1977).
                                                                                                    .,/

                                                             8

           More contemporary applications of the user cost model incorporate explicit adjustment costs

as opposed to ad hoc mechanism such as delivery lags. Auerbach ( 1989), for example, begins with

the Euler equation for investment and assumes a production function with productivity                     shocks and

adjustment     cost function.     He approximates       the optimal solution for perturbations        by solving a

linearized version of the Euler equation. He then derives a relationship between the investment rate

(1,,,/Kr,,.,) and the user cost of capital, in which the user cost coefficient is a finction of the steady-

state average user cost and a root of the linearized difference equation in K (for applications,                 see

Auerbach and Hassett, 1991, 1992; and Curnmins, Hassett, and Hubbard, 1994 1996).

           B. The q Theory

           Tobin’s (1969) q theory of investment made more rigorous Keynes’s ( 936) idea that the

incentive to add new fixed capital depends on the market value of capital relative to its replacement

cost. Tobin represented by q the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement cost of its

capital stock. One can easily incorporate adjustment costs and tax parameters in the q fiarnework

(see Hayashi, 1982).

           Returning   to equation (2), we know that equilibrium              marginal q is related to the price of

investment     goods, tax parameters,        and adjustment costs.         If we assume that the adjustment     cost

finction    is quadratic:



                                C(I, , , K.,, ,,)   = :(+-                Pi )2 Kf, /.l,                        (9)
                                                                 r, f-l




where p is the steady-state rate of investment and u is the adj ustrnent cost parameter, then equation

(2) can be rewritten as an investment equation:
                                                         9




                                                                                                                (lo)



Equation (1O)offers a convenient way of estimating the responsiveness of investment to neoclassical

variables,    including tax parameters, but there is a hitch—marginal               q is unobservable.      Following

Hayashi (1982), if the firm is a price-taker in input and output markets, and the production function

exhibits constant returns to scale, marginal q equals average q, defined for each firm as tax-adjusted

q (denoted below by Q):

where V is the market value of the firm’s equity, B is the market value of the firm’s debt, A is the

present value of depreciation      allowances     on investment              made before period t, and K~ is the

replacement value of the firm’s capital stock (including inventones).

         The Q formulation     stresses a relationship       between investment and the net profitability               of

investing, m measured by the difference be~een           the value of an incremental unit of capital and the

tax-inclusive    cost of purchasing capital.    As with the user cost approach, by making assumptions

about costs of adjusting the capital stock, we can estimate effects of investment                        incentives    on

investment,

         C. Foreshadowing      Empirical Problem

         Jorgenson (1963) investigated whether a version of equation (8) could be used to describe

aggregate fluctuations in U.S. investment.      Moving from this equilibrium relationship to an empirical
                                                    10

model, however, required a few more steps. Because output is determined             by the choice of K,

equation (8) does not relate K to a set of exogenous variables .6 Rather, it expresses a relationship

between endogenous     variables that holds in equilibrium.    Indeed, equation (8) does not define an

investment relationship,   that is, theflow of capital, but rather describes only the equilibrium stock

of capital.9 Jorgenson moved to an “investment” specification by defting       a firm’s “desired” capital

stock, K* as Y/c, and then assuming that the fm     gradually approached this desired stock over time.

He assumed that the rate at which the fm       closed the gap between its actual and desired stocks was

given exogenously,   and did not effect the level of the “desired” stock. These assumptions      yielded

the estimating equation:



                                                                                                   (12)




        Hall and Jorgenson (1967) originally used such a model to explain aggregate investment, and

concluded   that it described the data well.    Eisner and his collaborators   later pointed out that the

model they estimated -- recognizing      that ~ was the ratio of output to the user cost -- could be

capturing   accelerator effects, which had long been known to be strong explanatory           factors for




   s To be more specific, Jorgenson assumed that the revenue function of the firm was Cobb-
Douglas and that the firm set marginal revenue (with respect to capital) equal to the user cost in
order to maximize profits.

    9 For example, Haavelmo (1960) writes “The demand for investment cannot simply be
derived from the demand for capital.,.1 think the sooner this naive, and unfounded theory of the
demand for investment schedule is abandoned, the sooner we shall have a chance of making
some real progress in constructing more powerful theories to deal with the capricious short-run
variations in the rate of private investment. ” (quoted in Jorgenson, 1967, page 133)
investment. In particular, if one constrained the user cost to be a constant, one could rewrite (12) as:



                                                                                                  (13)




which is a form of an accelerator model.     When critics of Hall and Jorgenson isolated the separate

contribution   of the user cost to explaining investment, they found it to be negligible- (see Eisner,

1969, 1970; Eisner and Nadiri, 1968; and Chirinko and Eisner, 1983).

        Nonetheless,    by the late 1960s, the neoclassical model developed by Jorgenson and others

had become the standard model for studying investment decisions, but empirical debates remained.

On the one hand, the neoclassical     approach offers a structural link be,~een tax policy parameters

— the corporate tax rate, the present value of depreciation allowances, and the investment tax credit

—   and investment     through the user cost of capital. 10 On the other hand, the empirical evidence

suggested that the more rigorous theory did not improve the econometrician’s         ability to explain

aggregate investment fluctuations or the response of business investment to changes in tax policy.

        Partially in response to this empirical concern, models based on the Q representation     of the

firm’s investment problem occupied much of the empirical research by the 1980s.11 A key appeal

of the Q approach was that it related investment to a variable that was (under certain assumptions)

easier to observe than the user cost of capital. However, early emptical   adaptation of Q models did



     ‘0In an alternative representation, Feldstein ( 1982) explored the effects of effective tax rates
on investment in reduced-form models; for a critique of this approach, see Chirinko (1987).

     11As we noted earlier, Hayashi (1982) provided the conditions required to equate marginal q
with average Q, which is observable because it depends on the market valuation of the firm’s assets.
Summers (198 1) incorporated additional tax parameters in the Q model.
                                                                                              ‘.?


                                                    12

not fare well in explaining either time-series or cross-sectional   (firm-level) variation in investment.

        Despite such empirical titrations,      policymakers    in the United States and other industrial

economies    evidently believe that business fixed investment responds to tax changes — given the

frequency with which they manipulate tax policy parameters.          Hence it is disturbing that models

emphasizing the net return to investing are defeated in forecasting “horse races” by ad hoc models

and that structural variables are frequently found to be economically        or statistically insignificant. 12

Recently, the investment literature has begun to make a convincing case that the fundamentals             are

in fact key determinants    of investment, but that they appeti to have little effect in the macro data

because of several severe econometric        problems, 13 TO set the stage for the discussion       of these

problems    in Section IV, we first review key “stylized facts” about the time-series           behavior of

business fixed investment and “fundamental       determinants   of investment.”

III.    Some Stylized Facts about Business Fixed Investment

        In Figure    1, we plot aggregate U.S. equipment        investment     against several investment

“fidamentals.”      The top panel shows the comovement of investment and the Jorgensonian user cost.

The series rarely move together in an obvious way, and the correlation since 1960 is a statistically

insignificant -0.11. The second panel illustrates the strong comovements          between investment and

corporate cash flow. The two series are rou@y coincident, and the correlation over time is a highly



      ‘2See, e.g., Bosworth (1985), Bemde,      Bohn, and Reiss (1988), and the survey in Chirinko
(1993). The often poor empirical performance of Q models has led some researchers to abandon the
assumptions of reversible investment and convex costs used in testing neoclassical models in favor
of approaches based on lumpy and “irreversible” investment. See, e.g., the discussions and reviews
of studies inPindyck(1991    ), Dixit and Pindyck (1 994), and Hubbard (1994).

   13Taylor (1993) does find, however, that aggregate fixed investment is significantly
negatively related to the real interest rate in every one of the G7 countries.
                                                      13

significant 0.64. The bottom panel illustrates the “accelerator” effect, which relates changes in the

growth rates of output and equipment spending.             As with cash flow, the correlation is large and

highly significant, and the coincidence of the series is visually striking.

         While one should be cautious interpreting          such correlations     formally, they nonetheless

suggest clear patterns. Aggregate equipment investment varies significantly over the business cycle,

and neither lags or leads the cycle; it is highly correlated with other variables that are also highly

procyclical.    The time-series correlation between investment and the user cost, on the other hand,

is quite weak. Figure 1 can be thought of as a visual summary of the early investment literature:

Accelerator effects are strong and obvious; user cost effects appear weaker and more subtle,

         We focus on studies of equipment investment, in large part bqcause empirical attempts to

model investment     in structures have been more disappointing.         Figure 2, which repeats Figure 1

with the relevant “fundamentals” related to the growth rate of investment in nonresidential structures,

illustrates    the problem.      Structures   investment     is less clearly    correlated   with all of the

“fundamentals.”     The correlation with the user cost is insignificant        and has the incorrect sign, the

correlation with cash flow is about one-fourth of that between cash flow and equipment investment,

and the accelerator effect, while still noticeable, is significantly weaker.

         An alternative   branch of the investment     literature has followed the suggestion        of To bin

(1969) that investment        should be related to Q, the ratio of the market value of the firm to the

replacement costs of its capital stock. Figure 3 depicts the correlation of aggregate business fixed

investment with Q. 14The top panel compares the level of real investment to the level of Q. Clearly,



   14 The measure of Q plotted here is constructed from data from the Federal Reserve’s Flow of
Funds Accounts.
                                                                                                .,,

                                                        14

the low frequency movements in the two series are not highly correlated.           The bottom panel relates

the growth rates of these two series. Here it appears that growth in Q leads growth in investment

somewhat,      although the relationship      is weak, and the contemporaneous        correlation     is actually

negative. 15

        To summarize, the tendency for a number of aggregate variables to move together over the

business cycle makes it difficult to isolate effects of individual tidamentals        on investment,      Hence

a partial equilibrium investment demand approach might have very little power to explain aggregate

investment     fluctuations.     Movements     of the aggregate variables -- including investment          -- are

determined     simultaneously,     and disentangling    the marginal impact of a single driving variable is

difficult if not impossible.     For example, suppose that aggregate dem~d        increases exogenously       for

some reason.      This shift might lead firms to be more optimistic about their sales prospects and to

purchme more investment goods;             it might also be expected -- at least in the short run --to lead to

higher interest rates. If we then examine the correlation between investment and the interest rate,

we might even find that the sign is the opposite of that predicted by the theory.                      While an

instrumental     variables     procedure   might allow us to overcome       this simultaneity    problem,     the

estimator    is only as good as the instruments,        and it is difficult to imagine an appropriate       set of

instruments for this application.      Macroeconomic dam however, provide a rich additional source of




    15 If we regress the growth rate of business fixed investment on many lags of the growth rate
of Q, the sum of the coefficients is about 0.1, implying that a 20 percent increase in the growth
rate of Q would lead to a prediction of about a 2 percent higher growth rate of business fixed
investment. Cochrane (1992) finds significant] y larger effects of the growth of Q on the growth
of total private investment. The results differ because Cochrane’s measure of investment includes
residential investment, which is -- perhaps surprisingly -- more highly comelated with stock
market fluctuations.

variation, and it is to the microdata studies that we now turn.

IV.       Estimating    Effects of Tax Policy on Investment Using Micro Data

          Standard investment models emphasizing the net return to investment yield four empirical

representations.       Each begins with the firm maximizing   its net present value.   The first-order

conditions   lead to an Euler equation describing the period-to-period    optimal path of investment.

Abel and Blanchard (1986) solved the difference equation that relates investment to its expected

current and future marginal revenue products of capital; Gilchrist and Hirnrnelberg (1994) apply a

related forecasting approach to panel data. Alternatively, effects of tax parameters may be estimated

from the Euler equation (see, e.g., Abel, 1980; and Hubb~d        and Kashyap, 1992). As in Auerbach

(1983b) and Abel (1990), investment can be expressed in terms of c~ent         and future values of the

user cost of capital and, under some conditions,       expressed in terms of average q. Again, this

approach was suggested initially by Tobin ( 1969), with the necessary conditions supplied by Hayashi

(1982).

          A. The Bmic Problem

          To assess recent empirical work on tax policy and investment, we begin with the following

general model of investment, which follows the discussion in section II.


                                        Ii ,
                                       ‘=SitY+ei~~                                                (14)
                                       K 1,t- I




where 1 and K denote investment and the capital stock, respectively; S is an underlying structural

variable (e.g., the expected value of tax-adjusted Q or the user cost of capital) or set of variables; y

is a coefficient whose structural interpretation relates to assumptions about convex costs of adjusting
                                                     16

the capital stock; and ~ is a white-noise error term that reflects optimization    error by firms. 16

        Researchers usually estimated such models using either ordinary least squares or generalized

method of moments techniques with instrumental variables. Curnmins, Hmsett, and Hubbard (1994,

1996) note that conventional estimated values of y in firm-level panel data for the United States or

for other countries are very small, ranging from 0,01 to 0.05, implying marginal costs of adjustment

of between one and five dollars per dollar of investment.         Such estimates, which hav~ emerged in

many empirical      studies (see, e.g., Summers,    198 1; Salinger and Summers,      1983; and Fazzari,

Hubbard, and Petersen, 1988a), imply very small effects of permanent investment             incentives on

investment.

        Subsequently, empirical researchers have offered two general ~xplanations of the ftilure to

estimate significant tax effects on investment — (1) measurement          error in fundamental variables,

and (2) misspecification     of costs of adjusting the capital stock.      Both research programs       have

contributed to our understanding of the responsiveness of investment to changes in the net return to

investing     and have reached similar conclusions        about the likely effects of tax policy for some

important cases.

        B. Mewurement        Error in Fundamental         Variables

        A major problem in using equation(14)       in order to recover estimates of marginal adjustment

costs and the effect of tax changes on investment is that measurement        error in Q or the user cost of

capital may bias downward the estimated coefficient. A number of techniques have been suggested

to address this measurement     error, including:   (1) statistical corrections, (2) avoiding the use of Q



     16One could, of course, incorporate more complex error structures.         We m~e this simplifying
assumption for ease of exposition.
or user cost representations,   (3) using new proxies for Q, (4) focusing on periods or frequencies in

which firm variation       in fundamental   variables   is less subject to measurement        error, and (5)

modifiing     assumptions about the financial frictions fires face. We consider each in turn below and

examine whether the techniques produce a “consensus” estimate of adjustment costs that can be used

to forecast the effects of investment incentives on business fixed investment.

           Statistical Approaches.   There are at least two problems in measuring Q that might affect

estimated adjustment costs. First, to the extent that the stock market is excessively volatile, Q might

not reflect market fundamentals.         Second, the replacement         value of the capital stock in the

denominator      of Q is likely to be measured with error. Gnliches and Hausman (1986) argue that

measurement      error will lead to different biases among potential estimators that are similar in that

they control for firm-specific effits,   but differ in their signal-to-noise    ratios, making it possible to

place bounds on the importance of measurement           error. Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard (1994)

estimate     a model like (14) using first differences      and longer differences      (as opposed   to the

conventional fixed-effects, within-group estimator) to address measurement error problems.             Their

estimated adjustment costs decline significantly.

           In a time-series setting, Caballero (1 994) pursues an alternative estimation strategy, based

on a suggestion by Stock and Watson (1993). Caballero argues that small sample biases of typically

employed time-series estimation procedures are partictiarly          severe when estimating adjustment cost

models, and he shows that elasticities will generally be biased down.          Using the procedure of Stock

and Watson for estimating the low-frequency          relationships     between variables in small samples,

Caballero estimates a long-run elasticity of investment with respect to the user cost of approximately

unity.     This is much larger than the early estimate, but roughly consistent with the other studies
                                                   18

summarized in this section.

        Euler Equation Estimates, The second approach departs from the strategy of using proxies

for marginal q, and relies on the firm’s Euler equation to model the investment decision.        (As long

as one makes the same assumption about technology and adjustment costs, the Euler equation can

be derived from the same model as the conventional          Q or user cost of capital models.)    By not

relying on the “investment     tiction”   representation,    one can sidestep problems     of measuring

marginal q.

        Tests following this approach have frequently used panel data on manufacturing           firms to

estimate the Euler equation (Pindyck and Rotemberg, 1983; Shapiro, 1986; Gilchrist, 1991; Whited,

1992; Bond and Meghir, 1994; and Hubbard, Kashyap, and Whited, 1995). Studies using Compustat

data for the United States are unable to reject the fiictionless neoclassical model for most firms, and

the estimated adjustment cost parameters are more reasonable than those found in estimates of Q

models. For example, Hubbard, Kashyap, and Whited (1995) report estimated values of y between

1 and 2.2. Very similar estimates are reported for European manufacturing            firms by Cummins,

Harris, and Hassett (1995) and for investment           in overseas subsidiaries   of U.S. multinational

corporations   in Cumrnins and Hubbard (1995).

        Alternatives   to Q.   The measure of average Q used as a proxy for marginal q in most

empirical studies is constructed as the ratio of the market value of the financial claims on the firm

(equity and debt) to the replacement cost of the firm’s capital stock. The third approach bypasses

using financial variables as proxies for marginal q by forecasting the expected present value of the

current and fiture profits generated by an incremental unit of capital — that is, the expected value

of marginal q — an idea developed (in the time-series context) by Abel and Blanchard (1986) and
                                                      19

extended for use in panel data by Gilchrist and Himmelberg          (1995). One can extend this setup to

a panel-data setting by constructing      investment fundamentals using a VAR forecasting framework

to decompose        the effect of profits or cash flow on investment into two components       — one that

forecasts fiture profitability under the fiictiordess capital markets assumed in the neoclassical model

(analogous to marginal q) and a residual component that maybe attributable to financial frictions

(analogous       to the role played by cash flow in the imperfect-capital-markets   approach of F~i,

Hubbard,        and Petersen,   1988a).   By including     lags of cash flow in the vector of observed

fidamentals        in the forecasting equations, one cm ensure that any information about fiture marginal

profitability    of capital contained in cash flow is reflected in the proxy for marginal q.

         Using such an approach, Gilchrist and Himmelberg           (1995) report estimates of y that are

roughly consistent with the Eder equation estimates discussed above. In addition, they test whether

cash flow is an independent       “fundamental” variable explaining investment and find that it is for a

subset of firms that are likely to face liquidity constraints. 17 We return to a discussion of this latter

result below.

         Measuring Changes in Fun&mentals          Using Tm Reforms. As we discussed in the previous

section, one reason the data do not appear to favor neoclassical models over accelerator models is

a simultaneous       equations problem:    If, on the one hand, the data were dominated by exogenous

increases or decreases in the real interest rate, then the user cost movements would lead investment




      ‘7This is a test of the restricted model against the alternative model that current profits have
explanatory power for investment beyond their ability to predict future profits. Gilchrist and
Himmelberg find that cash flow is an independent fidamental            and that excess sensitivity of
investment to cash flow is a characteristic of fms they identifi as constrained — measured by size,
bond rating, commercial paper rating, or dividend payout.
                                                       20

to decrease or increase, respectively.    If, on the other hand, investment rises with positive “animal

spirits,” then higher investment demand puts upward pressure on the real interest rate. Hence to the

extent that data incorporate both exogenous changes in the real interest rate and in the intercept of

the investment finction,    the positive relationship between investment and the user cost of capital

because of shifis in the investment function may dominate the hypothesized                negative relationship

between investment and the user cost of capital. In this case, the estimated coefficient on the user

cost of capiti   will be “too small,” leading to estimated adjustment costs that are “too large. ” Such

simultaneity increases apparent accelerator effects, because positive shifts of the investment function

raise both investment and output.

        As we noted above, this simultaneity       problem in the estimation of neoclassical          models is

remedied by the use of instrumental       variables,        Conventional   instrumental    variables (including

lagged endogenous      variables or sales-to-capital    ratios) have not proven very helpful.         Major tax

reforms arguably offer periods in which there is exogenous cross-seclional variation in the user cost

of capital or tax-adjusted q. Cumrnins, Hassett, and Hubbard (1994, 1996) demonstrate that major

tax reforms are also msociated with significant h-            and asset-level variation in key tax parameters

(such as the effective rate of investment tax credit and the present value of depreciation allowances).

Hence tax variables are likely to be a good instrument for the user cost or Q during tax reforms.

         To indicate the significance    of cross-sectional       heterogeneity     in incentives to invest, we

emphasize variation across assets. Figure 5 plots the annual values of (1 - r ) for the 22 classes of

equipment capital classified by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The peaks and valleys along the

“year” axis for a given asset reveal the time-series variation in the tax parameters, and those along

the “asset” axis for a given year reveal the cross-sectional variation.           For asset eight (metalworking
                                                                                           ,.

                                                   21

machinery), for example, the tier-tax     cost of investing falls in 1962, 1972, and 1981, and rises in

1986,

        Figure 5 reveals that the variation across assets is large within most years in our samples, as

is the time-series variation.   In addition, the positions of the peaks and valleys changes somewhat

over time. For example, following the removal of the investment tax credit and the reduction of the

corporate tax rate by the Tax Refom      Act of 1986, the cross-sectional   variation across assets fell,

consistent with the act’s stated goal to “level the playing field.”

        Curnmins, Hassett, and Hubbard (1995) use vector autoregressions         to forecast investment

in the year following a tax reform, and then compare the forecast errors for each of the assets to the

changes in the user cost for that asset. In Figure 6, we repeat that expe~ent    and for the Tax Refom

Act of 1986, and provide a plot of the forecast errors constructed from models that exclude taxes

against shocks to the user cost of capital for each of the 22 equipment asset classes tracked by the

BEA. In addition, we draw a regression line through the scatterplot.        The idea is that the forecast

errors for investment shodd be negatively correlated with forecast errors for the user cost of capital.

The downward-sloping      line indicates a clear negative correlation.

        We can now illustrate the effect of tax parameters on firm investment.        Table 1 shows the

significance   of using exogenous tax changes to identifi     changes in Q. la Taken from Cummins,

Using contemporaneous       tax variables as instrument during major tax reforms, Cummins, Hassett,

and Hubbard estimate y to be 0.65 for the United States, compared with 0,048 under conventional

estimates.      The y obtained similar estimates for each of the other major U.S. tax reforms in the

postwar period using data from Compustat (Curnmins, Hassett, and Hubbard, 1994); focusing on the

T= Reform Act of 1986, Auerbach andHassett(1991              ) found similar coefficients using asset level

data and cross-sectional     variation in the user cost.     As Table 1 shows, applying the Curnmins-

Hassett-Hubbard       approach in tax reform periods in other OECD countries produces               estimates

roughly similar to those for the United States. 19

        Financial Frictions and the Neoclassical           Model.   In contrast to the frictionless   capital

markets in the standard neoclassical model, earlier applied research on investment, especially the

work of Meyer and Kuh (1957), stressed the significance of financiaL considerations             (particularly
                                                                    I

internal fids     or net worth) for business investment.     Since the mid-l 960s, however, most applied

research on investment isolated “real” fm      decisions from “fmcing.”        The intellectual justification

for this shift in approach      drew on the seminal work by Modigliani            and Miller (1958), who

demonstrated the irrelevance of fmcial       structure and financial policy for real investment decisions



    ‘9Tax reforms are not the only plausible reform that can be used to estimate adjustment costs.
There is a large body of evidence suggesting that union power to expropriate returns is
significant, and that the “union tax” adjusts as the return to capital changes. If union wage
demands vary with the return to capital, then the union rent share is--in part at least--a tax on
capital, distorting the level of investment when it is introduced. Fallick andHassett(1995)
explore whether a change in the union status of the fim is another type of large identifiable
shock that affects purchases of capital. Using firm-level panel data, they document a large
negative response of investment to union certification elections. For most of the firms who
experience union certification elections in their sample, net investment turns significantly
negative in the year immediately following the election, with the mean response to union
certification being roughly the same size as that which would occur -- given the responsiveness
of investment to the user cost in Cumrnins, Hassett, and Hubbard (1994) -- if the corporate tax
rate were increased 35 percentage points. This set of firms, at least, is not burdened by an ability
to adjust their capital stock downward when a negative shock to profitability occurs.
                                                                                                     ...

under certain     conditions.      The central Modigliani-Miller          result, which facilitated        the early

development of the neoclassical model, was that a firm’s financial structure will not affect its value

in frictionless   capital markets.     As a result, if their assumptions     are satisfied, real firm decisions,

motivated by the maximization of shareholders’ claims, are independent of financial factors such as

the availability of internal tids.

           The assumption of representative fms        (in terms of trade on capital markets) is common to

most research programs          in the neoclassical   tradition.     That is, the same empirical model (e.g.,

equation     (14)) applies to all firms.     Therefore, tests could not ascertain whether the observed

sensitivity of investment to financial variables differs across firms and whether these differences in

sensitivity explain the weak apparent relationship between the meas~d                 user cost and investment.

Contemporary      empirical studies of information and incentive problems in the investment process

have moved beyond the assumption of representative                 fires by examining firm-level panel data in

which firms can be grouped into “high net worth” and “low net worth” categories.                       For the latter

category,    changes in net worth or internal fids           tiect   investment,   holding constant underlying

investment opportunities (desired investment) .20 Following Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988a),

empirical     researchers   have placed firms into groups as a priori              “financially    constrained”    or

“financially unconstrained.”

           Two aspects of the findings of this research program are noteworthy                    in the context of

measuring      incentives to invest.     First, numerous empirical studies have found that proxies for

internal    funds have explanatory       power for investment,         holding constant     Q, the user cost, or



    20For reviews of the theoretical literature, see Bemanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1996); Hubbard
(1990); and Hubbad (1996).
accelerator variables (see the review of studies in Hubbard, 1995). This suggests that tax policy may

have effects on investment by constrained firms beyond those predicted by neoclassical approaches.

(Indeed, returning to the “accelerator” analogy, Bemanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1996) argue that

this literature describes a “financial accelerator.”)     In particular, the quantity of internal finds

available for investment is supported by the average tax on earnings from existing projects.        In this

sense, average as well as marginal tax rates faced by a firm affect its investment decisions.21

         Second,   empirical   studies of financing   constraints   generally   find that the fiictionless

neoclassical model is rejected ordy for the groups of firms that a priori are financially constrained

(see, e.g., Calomiris and Hubbard, 1995; Gilchrist and Himelberg,         1995; and Hubbard, Kashyap,

and, Whited, 1995). Hence while the shadow value of internal funds may not be well captured for

some firms in standard representations     of the neoclassical approach, the neoclassical model with

convex adjustment costs yields reasonable estimated values of marginal adjustment costs for most

firms.

         Measurement Error and A~ustment Costs: Nearing Consensus?               To summarize, a variety



      21Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen(1988b) and Gertler and Hubbard(1988b) illustrate this point
in examining the affect of the investment tax credit on investment. Calomiris and Hubbard (1995)
focus on a tax experiment in which retained earnings are taxed more heavily than distributed profits.
In frictionless capital markets, firms would take advantage of the incentive to change their payout
policies. Working against this response for some firms is the potential difference in the cost of
internal and external fids.    To the extent that the marginal cost of external tids is high, a growing
firm with profitable investment opporhmities might choose to pay the undistributed profits tax and
invest its internal finds, rather than distribute tids and then reacquire them in the capital market.
me U.S. Undistributed Profits Tax of 1936-1937, which imposed a graduated surtax on corporate
retention offers a usefil experiment. Because the maximum marginal tax rate on corporate retention
was 27 percent, most firms had large incentives to alter their payout policies. Using firm-level panel
data from the 1930s, Calomiris and Hubbard find that a neoclassical investment model with no
explicit capital-market frictions is rejected ordy for firms with high ex anfe surtax margins.

of empirical implementations     of the neoclassical model with convex adjustment costs have attempted

to mitigate measurement       error and other econometric problems in conventional         OLS and GMM

estimates of equation (14) in panel data. The methods described above generally yield estimated

values of y of 0.50 or higher, implying marginal costs of adjustment in the range of $0.10 per dollar

of additional    investment    (using the estimate in Cummins,       Hassett,   and Hubbard,   1995 as a

benchmark), and elasticities of investment with respect to the user cost of capital between -0.5 and

-1.0.

        C. An Alternative      Interpretation:   Misspect~~ation    of Adjustment   Cos&

        The emphasis in many recent empirical studies of investment on sources of mismeasurement

of explanatory    variable acting as proxies for the net return to investing accepts the conventional

belief that costs of adjusting the capital stock are convex.       The Q, user cost of capital, and Euler

equation approaches can all be derived from the same intertemporal         ma.ximi=tion    problem, given

common assumptions       about technology, competition,     and adjustment costs. An important recent

line of inquiry focuses on modeling and testing the effects of irreversibility and uncertainty on firms’

investment decisions (see, e.g., the excellent survey by Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). 22 If this literature

is correct, then there may be important          regions wherein tax policy has little or no effect on

investment, and knowledge of which region an economy is currently in is an important prerequisite

to any policy analysis, Finally, these models can possibly explain a key remaining pwle             in the




    22 The seeds of this literature are much older. For example, Rothschild(1971) writes:
“’’Convex cost-of-adjustment fictions     may help to explain why Rome was not built in a day.
However, there is no clear saving and maybe some loss to spreading the work of installing a
button on a shirt over several weeks.” His “bang-bang” model of investment provides an early
example of a “lumpy investment” model.

literature -- that is, why firms report in surveys that they use such high hurdle rates (see Summers,

1987).

         Neoclassical models implicitly assume that there is an efficient secondary market for capital;

hence irreversibility poses no problem.      If a firm purchases a machine today, and the output market

turns sour in the future, the firm can recoup the purchase price of the machine at that time.          If,

however, investment is irreversible, then the firm faces the chance that it cannot sell the machine in

the future.   In this setup, there is a gain to delaying investment and allowing the random price

process to move either into a region far enough above the neoclassical “breakeven” point that the

probability of the “bad state” becomes low enough, or into a region where it clearly does not make

sense to purchase the machine. An investment extinguishes the value qf the call option of delay, an

option that has positive value when prices are uncertain.         In this approach, the value of the lost

option is a component of the opportunity cost of investment.      In the tetiology   of the Q framework,

the threshold     criterion for investment    requires that marginal   Q exceed unity by the value of

maintaining     the call option to invest.   As a consequence,   high “hurdle rates” may be required by

corporate managers making investment decisions.

          Indeed, at least part of the interest in option-based investment models has been the problem

raised in many time-series studies that indicated that the response of investment to changes in Q or

the user cost of capital are implausibly     small, implying, perhaps, that there are regions wherein Q

varies but investment      does not. In addition, it is not difficult to suggest examples of nonconvex

adjustment costs—such       as retooling in automobile plants or the adoption of more energy-efficient

kilns in cement plants.

cost specifications, we present in this subsection aprimafacie    case that pure irreversibility    may not

be of overriding importance at the aggregate level.

         There is a large literature (see, e.g., Hulten and Wykoff,   979; Jorgenson, 1994; Fraumeni,

1995; and Oliner, 1996) that focmes on the estimation of economic depreciation rates for different

types of machines.     For the most part, researchers estimate rates of decay from the patterns of used

machine prices.      This literature is relevant to the debate concerning the form of adjustment costs

because irreversibility results most plausibly from either the absence of resale markets, or from the

presence of significant “lemons” problems in resale markets.

         To examine the extent to which resale markets are limited, we surveyed the depreciation

literature   and cataloged    types of equipment    for which we could find an estimated           economic

depreciation     rate. Using disaggregated   data on investment by asset type, we than calculated the

proportion     of aggregate investment that is made up of assets that have clearly identifiable resale

markets. Figure 4 plots this proportion from 1950 to 1994. The proportion of investment in assets

that have easily identifiable resale markets is about 0.7 over most of the period. This is not to say

that the remaining assets are necessarily “irreversible,” of course; depreciation studies may not yet

have fomd data for those assets.

         Hence in order to demonstrate that irreversibility is an important property of most investment

goods, researchers      must show that the market for used capital goods is plagued with lemons

problems.      To our knowledge, there is no existing evidence that lemons are important in markets for

equipment goods. Indeed, Hulten and Wykoff(1981 ) argue that estimated secondary market prices

in depreciation studies are inconsistent with a major role for lemons problems.       One reason for this

finding may be that the market for used capital goods is one where the participants                  possess
significant asset-specific expertise.   The typical purchaser of a machine tool, for example, may have

worked in a factory filled with machine tools for many years, and would easily recognize a “lemon.”

If this is the case, there is little asymmetric information, and the resale market functions well.

        Models with More General A@ustmenl Costs. Abel and Eberly (1994) provide a general

framework that encompasses reversibility,          fixed costs, and a wide array of alternative adjustment

cost specidcations.     They show that, under certain conditions, the investment behavior of firms can

be characterized      by three distinct regimes: (1) regime in which gross investment is positive; (2)

regime in which gross investment is zero; (3) regime in which gross investment is negative.             The

responsiveness     of investment to tidarnentals     differs across regimes, and their more general model

predicts that there is a region in which gross investment will stay zero for a range of unfavorable

values of Q. Because this model nests the more traditional q models, it provides a usefil empirical

framework, and we review attempts to estimate this model below.

        Researchers      are begiting   to study the impact of alternative adjustment cost assumptions

within structural investment models with panel data. Barnett and Sakellaris (1995) use Compustat

data to investigate the implication of the model of Abel andEberly(1995)         that investment alternates

between regimes of insensitivity to Q and regimes of responsiveness         to Q. The region of inactivity

should be close to the region for which the model predicts that investment is negative.         Because the

thresholds   for these regions are unknown, conventional          asymptotic   distributions   do not apply.

Barnett and Sakellaris use a statistical framework that allows them to estimate the threshold points

and the coefficients on Q simultaneously       in the different regions given the threshold points.    They

find evidence of a nonlinear relationship between investment and Q; in particular, they estimate the

largest responsiveness of investment to Q for low values of Q, and the smallest for very high values
                                                                                      ...

                                                 29

of Q. On average, they estimate that the elasticity of investment with respect to Q is about unity,

but that the aggregate elasticity varies considerably over time, depending on the average level of Q.

Barnett and Sakellaris argue that their results imply that adjustment cost may not be quadratic, but

that the most likely cause is not firms’ inability to disinvest, but rather, their reluctance to make

“large” changes.

        Barnett and Sakellaris’s results we not necessarily inconsistent with the measurement     error

story. Some firms in their Compustat universe have values of average Q that are astronomical      (one

firm actually has a q of 40,000!), presumably because the capital stock measure is missing important

goodwill or human capital components,    If one accepts that Q is a poor measure of fidamentals     for

these firms, then the result that investment does not respond as much to Q for these firms is not

surprising.   In the more “normal” range of Q values, the investment response seems to accord well

with the predictions of the convex adjustment cost model.

        Finally, Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger ( 1995) explore adjustment costs in a more general

framework.      Using a subset of 7000 U.S. manufacturing        plants from the Census Bureau’s

Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), they explore whether cross-sectional patterns of investment

are consistent with symmetric, convex adjustment cost models, or whether the data imply that there

are nonconvexities ,23 They proceed in two steps. First, they assume that there are no adjustment

costs and that the Jorgensonian   model adequately describes a firms “desired” capital stock (~). 24



   23 In earlier work, Doms and Dunne (1994) report that plant-level investment data exhibit
skewness and kurtosis that is consistent with investment being somewhat “lumpy.”

   24 To calculate the desired capital stock for each firm, Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger use
plant-level output data, and two-digit Jorgensonian user costs constructed from the tax data used
in Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard (1994) and Goolsbee (1995).
                                                                                           ‘r<


                                                   30

They then compare in each period a firm’s beginning-of-period     capital stock to its desired stock and

call the difference (~-K,., ) “mandated investment. ” Second, they explore how firms actually adjust

their capital stocks.   In this step, they find that the relationship   between actual and mandated

investment is highly nonlinear. If mandated investment is negative, then firms do not quickly adjust

their capital stocks downward,   If mandated investment is small and positive, then firms also do not

respond very much. If mandated investment is very large, then fms        adjust their capiti     stocks very

quickly. They conclude that an (S, s) model, in which furns have a range of inaction, and ordy adjust

their capital stocks to their desired levels when the gap between current and desired capital stock is

“large enough” offers a good description of the data.

        Using firm-level data from Compustat, Abel andEberly(1996)         estimate that the relationship

between investment and fundamental determinants (Q and the tax-adjusted price of capital goods)

is concave;   that is, the response    of investment    to fi.lndamental determinants    is positive,    but

monotonically declining. The results of Abel and Eberly suggest that the distribution of tax-adjusted

Q or the user cost of capital maybe a determinant of aggregate investment.        However, the caution

that applied to Barnett and Sakellaris conclusions applies here as well: Large observed values of Q

may not coincide with high levels of inves~ent     because the high Q values reflect rnismeasuremen4

rather than extraordinary   fidarnentals.

        Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger also illustrate how to construct aggregate implications

from their microeconornic results.     Integrating over the macroeconomic distribution of plants, they

calculate a predicted aggregate elasticity of investment with respect to the user cost of capital. The

estimates of this elasticity vary considerably over time: If, on the one hand, many plants are near

the region for which mandated investment is very large, then small changes in the user cost can have
                                                                                            .,,.

                                                    31

large effects on aggregate investment.    If, on the other hand, the bulk of the distribution of mandated

investment     is in the region of low responsiveness    of investment to fundamentals,    then changes in

the user cost will have little impact. They concur with the main conclusion of Cummins, Hassett,

and Hubbard (1994) that the aggregate elasticity of investment             with respect to the user cost is

between -0.5 and -1, and also conclude that tax reforms appear to have generally had large effects

on investment.      They caution, however, that the reforms have had large effects because they

coincidentally occurred during periods in which the plant-level distribution of mandated investment

was aligned in such a way to allow a large effect of changes in tax parameters.        This would happen

if, for example, investment tax credits were removed in booms, when mandated investment is very

large, and an increase in the user cost can cause firms to canceI significant investment plans. As a

consequence,     Caballero,   Engel, and Haltiwanger     argue that researchers must consult the micro

distribution   of mandated investment before predicting the likely impact of future tax reforms on

business investment.25

         Alternatively,   Curnmins,    Hassett,   and Hubbard     (1994,     1996) argue that recovering

“reasonable” estimates of the response of investment to Q or the user cost of capital is easiest during

periods in which large exogenous changes in the distribution         of structural determinants    occur, as

during tax reforms. In response to the alternative interpretation that firms respond only to changes

in fidamentals      when these changes are large, Curnmins, Hassett, and Hubbard use firm-level data




   25 Because their mandated investment measure is the same as that in a frictionless
neoclassical model, their tests -- while suggestive -- neither confirm or reject the presence of
convex adjustment costs. First, mandated investment itself depends on adjustment costs.
Second, if adjustment costs were present, mandated investment also depends on fiture values of
tax parameters
                                                                                           .,/

to investigate whether there was evidence of “bunching” of investment around tax reforms.             They

estimate transition probabilities   among various ranges of (l/K) over the year prior to, of, and after

the tax reform, and find no evidence that firms with large investment were likely to have lower

investment     in prior or subsequent years. Indeed, only a very tiny fraction of the sample was ever

found to transit from high investment to low investment states.

        In part, the conclusions    of these studies may differ because of differences in the level of

aggregation.    At a sufficiently fme level of disaggregation,   all investment looks lumpy.     The plant-

level evidence     suggests that investment    appears lumpy, but the firm-level     evidence does not

corroborate this. However,      there may be interesting differences between the investment behavior

of plants and firms, as might be the case if, for example, managerial auention is limited and only a

fraction of a firm’s plants adjust their capital in a given year. Clearly, reconciling the plant-level and

firm-level results is an important topic for future research.

        D. Summing       Up: The Partial Equilibrium      Eflects of Investment   Tax Policy

        Recent studies appear to have reached a consensus that the elasticity of investment            with

respect to the user cost of capital is between -0.5 and -1.0. Indeed, recent studies using convex costs

of adj ustment and studies using nonconvex costs of adjustments agree that the long-run elasticity

of investment to the user cost is high by the standards of the early empirical literature.       This range

of estimated responses of investment to tax parameters is well above the consensus of only a few

years ago, and suggests that investment       tax policy can have a significant impact on the path of

aggregate capital formation.     One should be cautious, however, in moving from the macroeconomic

evidence to aggregate predictions.     Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger demonstrate a technique for

aggregating the micro distribution of fms      to calculate aggregate investment demand, but very little

continues to be known about the general equilibrium effects of major policy changes.

v.         Arguments For and Against Investment Incentives

           Thus far we have argued that: (1) tax incentives for investment are important components

of the net return to investing,    and (2) the short-term and long-term responses of investment        to

pemanent      tax incentives are large. We now turn to the deeper policy question of whether we should

have permanent incentives for investment even if such incentives increase the stock of business fixed

capital.    (We then address the question of the desirability    of short-run incentives.)   Economists

generally argue against intervention.    Under what circumstances     might one advocate distortionary

investment incentives?

           A. Do Investment Incentives Affect the Price of Capital Goods?

           One scenario under which investment incentives might have an especially large impact on

the quantity of investment without dissipation in prices of investment goods is one in which firms’

demand for capital is responsive to changes in the user cost of capital and in which capital goods are

supplied perfectly elastically.    While it is implausible that the supply function for most individual

capital goods manufacturers       is perfectly elastic, the effective supply of capital goods to a given

domestic market might well be highly elastic in the long run if the world market for capital goods

is open. Investment incentives would raise prices of capital goods in the short run if the supply of

capital goods is highly inelastic.

           Using data for the United States and ten other countries, Hassett and Hubbard (1995) find

that local investment tax credits have a negligible effect on prices paid for capital goods, indeed, they

find that the capital goods prices for most countries are very highly correlated,            and that the

movements       of these over time are consistent    with “the law of one price.”     In addition, using
                                                     34

disaggregated data on reset-specific investment good prices and tax variables for the United States,

they find that tax parameters have no effect on capital goods prices. ‘b The conclusion that tax policy

in the United States does not affect the world price of capital goods is especially meaningful, given

the relative size of the U.S. economy.       Taken together, these tests suggest that the effects of

investment tax policy have not been muted in a significant way by upward-sloping supply schedules

for capital goods.

        B. Is the Capital Stock Too Small?

        While it is instructive to ask how effective investment incentives are at increasing the fixed

capital stock, a more important question remains:           What is the social value of the increase in the

fixed capital stock?

        Theoretical    research   has demonstrated        that perfectly   competitive   economies   do not

necessarily converge to the “correct” capital stock. Indeed, Diamond (1965) demonstrated              that a

competitive economy can reach a steady state in which there is “too much” capital, in the sense that

the economy is investing more than it is earning in profit.          In this case, individuals can be made

better off if they are forced to consume a portion of the capital stock. When evaluating investment

incentives, it is crucial for policy analysis to evaluate whether the economy is operating with “too

much” or “too little” capital.




   26 Goolsbee (1995) argues that U.S. tax shocks are positively correlated with capital price
movements. The difference in the two sets of results arises from two sources. First, Goolsbee
uses the ITC as a measure of the tax change, rather than the fill user cost of
capital. Second, Goolsbee’s price regressions relate the level of the price to the level of the ITC,
while Hassett and Hubbard use the first-difference of the price (because the price series used are
highly nonstationary). When the model is estimated in levels, the uncorrected regression errors
contain unit roots.
        The classic “golden rule” literature offers benchmarks      for guidance.27 In the golden rule

approach of Phelps (196 1), the golden rule level of the capital stock relative to output is achieved

when the marginal product of capital (R) net of depreciation (5) equals the sum of the rate of growth

of the labor force (n) and the rate of labor-augmenting    technical change ~), or:


                                         R=6+n+g.                                                  (15)



Alternatively,   in the optimal growth literature, Ramsey (1928) golden rule levels require that the

marginal product of capital net of depreciation equal the sum of the social rate of time preference

(p) and the elasticity of marginal social utility with respect to per capita consumption    (0) OPS


                                       R=6+P+(#)g.                                                 (16)



Depending on the values of p and (#),the Ramsey golden-rule levels of capital can be less than the

Phelps golden-rule levels.

        Following the conventional in neoclassical models of the capital stock, we assume a Cobb-

Douglas technology, so that the ratio of the steady-state golden-rule capital stock (K*) to output (~

eqtis   the ratio of capital’s share in output (a) to the marginal product of capital (R). Moreover,   the

golden tie   level of net investment (~ relative to output equals (n + g) times the capital-output ratio.



    27 Another argument for subsidies to equipment investment has been advanced by Judd
(1995), who concludes that the optimal tax on equipment investment is negative. He argues that,
to the extent that capital-goods-producing  industries are imperfectly competitive (owing, say, to
the presence of patents), equipment prices contain significant markups. Hence to return firms’
input mix to the optimal level, the government should design an investment subsidy that equates
the price paid for equipment to its marginal cost.

    “ See, e.g., the analysis in Blanchard and Fischer (1989).

Hence:

One can account for different types of capital by noting that, in equilibrium,    the net rates of return

on the alternative types are equal. Hence one can substitute into (17) measures of a~ for each type

of capital k and the relevant R (given differences in depreciation), and solve for the golden rule levels

of the capital stocks.

         Using a range of parameter values in the golden rule expressionsin(17)         and ( 18), Cohen,

Hassett, and Kennedy (1995) compare golden rule and actual levels of the capital stock or net

investment relative to output to their acti    values over the period from 1980-1994.     Table 2, which

we excerpt     from several tables in that study indicates that for benchmark         parameter   values,

equipment investment and capital stocks are below their golden rule levels (assuming        1980-1994 is

sufficiently   long to characterize a steady state), while residential investment    and the residential

capital stocks -- which have received significant tax subsidies over this time period -- are near or

above their golden rule levels. Cohen, Hassett, and Kemedy        also show that these conclusions       are

not changes if the key parameters are allowed to vary across a broad range of plausible values.
                                                      37

        Alternatively,    several authors have attempted to evaluate the optimality of the U.S. capital

stock by relating various interest rates to the rate of economic growth.      One the one hand, Tobin

(1965), Solow (1970), and Feldstein (1977) argue that the maginal           productivity     of capital one

obtains from accounting profits estimates is about 10 percent, and thus conclude that the economy

is dynamically    efficient.     On the other hand,   Ibbotson (1987) calculates a mean return on U.S.

Treasury bills from 1926-1986 of only 0.3 percent, suggesting dynamic inefficiency.            The answer

to the question using interest rates depends critically on assessing the impact of risk, of course.

        Abel,    Mankiw,       Summers,   and Zeckhauser    (1989) pursue   an alternative     strategy   for

evaluating    whether the U.S. capital stock is greater or less than the optimal level. In a stochastic

setting with a very general production technology, they demonstrate that an economy is dynamically

inefficient   if it invests more than the returns from capital.       They show that the economy           is

dynamically efficient -- and hence in the range in which stimulative tax policy might have positive

social returns -- if the returns from capital exceed investment.      Using their terminology,      the key

question is whether the capital stock is on balance a “sW’ or a “spout.” This observation is a useti

contribution because it allows one to base judgment about dynamic efficiency on readily observable

cash flows. Abel, etal,conclude that the economy is dynamically efficient. Thus, both capital stock

data and “cash flow” data suggest that, by raising the stock of equipment            capital, investment

incentives have positive social returns.29

         C. Should We Use Temporary Investment Incentives?

         The discussion        thus fw pertains to permanent changes in investment   incentives.     Even a



     ‘9 Because the golden rule models are developed for a closed economy, it is difficult to
extend the comparison to domestic versus foreign fixed capital.
                                                    38

casual obsemation    of the history of investment incentives since the 1950s suggests the usefulness

of considering   temporary investment incentives.        Since 1962, the mean duration of a typical state

in which an ITC is in effect has been about three and one-half years, and the mean duration of the

“no-ITC” state has been about the same length. Most recently, President Bush advocated a modified

ITC, known as the “Investment        Tax Allowance”        in 1992, and President   Clinton proposed   an

incremental ITC in early 1993; neither of these measures was enacted. What is the likely impact on

aggregate capital accumulation     of temporary investment incentives?

          Temporary investment incentives can have even larger short-run impacts on investment than

permanent investment incentives (see, e.g., Auerbach, 1989). Consider, for example, a temporary

ITC known to last for one period.        The expression      for the user cost of capital in equation (5)

indicates that the ITC lowers the current user cost both through its effect on r,,~ and through the

consequences of its removal on ri ,~+1,More generally, anticipated future changes in tax policy affect

the current value of the user cost and investment.

          The large potential effects of tempor~   tax incentives on investment do not imply that they

are desirable tax policy -- even if one believes that long-run investment incentives are sound tax

policy.    In the presence of uncertainty and adjustment costs, there is little reason to believe that

policymakers can “time” investment incentives for the purposes of stabilization policy. Moreover,

the use of temporary incentives increases uncertainty in business capital budgeting, making it more

difficult for firms to forecast the path of the user cost of capital.

D. Does Uncertain@ About Tax Policy Affect Investment?

          What if firms do not know the exact timing of changes in investment incentives -- that is, if

tax policy is uncertain?    There is a substantial literature evaluating the effects of price uncertainty
on investment,     and the lesson from this literature is that the sign of the effect of uncertainty     on

investment depends crucially on assumptions about adjustment costs and returns to scale. Hartman

(1972) shows that uncertainty generally increases investment in a model with constant returns and

convex adjustment costs. Abel (1983) derives a similar result in continuous time. Pindyck (1 988),

however,    shows    that uncertainty   can significantly    lower capital formation     if investment    is

irreversible and if returns to scale are decreasing.    We described Pindycks      intuition earlier: In an

uncertain world, there is a gain to delaying investment -- the option value of waiting -- and these

gains are higher the higher is the variance in the output price.

        Thus, one might be tempted to conclude from the early contributions          to this literature that

the predicted effect of ti    policy uncertainty will depend on what we believe about the reversibility

.- or lack thereof -- of capital investments.   However, strictly speaking, tax policy uncertain y can

even increase investment in the models of H-an,             Abel, and Pindyck (see Ha.ssett and Metcalf,

1994, 1995).

        This difference      arises because tax policy uncertainty     is urdike price uncertainty    in an

important   way.     Researchers   ofien introduced uncertainty    by assuming that the price follows a

continuous-time     random walk (Brownian motion or geometric Brownian motion).               When prices

follow a random walk, the appropriate rational expectations forecast for the price at any time in the

future is today’s price, and the fiture path of the price is unbounded.           Urdike most prices, t=

parameters tend to remain constant for a few years, arid then jump to new values. In addition, jumps

in the ITC tend to be mean-reverttig:     When the credit is high, it is likely to be reduced in the fiture;

when the credit is low, it is likely to be increased in the future.      Because of these properties, the

normal gain to waiting in a model with irreversibility       is reduced significantly when an investment
                                                     40

tax credit is “on”: Because the firm fears that the credit might be eliminated, it is more likely to

invest today while the credit is still effective.     Hassett and Metcalf demonstrate      that this effect

dominates the reverse effect in the state in which there is no investment tax credit, and conclude that

increasing tax policy uncertainty raises aggregate investment.

        As with the case of temporary investment incentives generally, this result does not imply that

random tax policy is desirable.     Most existing studies analyze investment in a partial equilibrium

setting wherein there are no utility costs to bunching capital formation.        In a general equilibrium

setting, Bizer and Judd (1989) show that welfme is reduced significantly by random investment tax

policy. The randomness has a negative impact because consumers wish to smooth consumption, and

fluctuations   in investment credits make smoothing costly.

VI.     Policy Implications

        Our finding of significant short-term and long-term effects of the user cost of capital on

equipment investment suggests applications to current policy debates.        In particular, we evaluate in

this section consequences     for the user cost and investment of a reduction in inflation and a switch

from a income tax to a broad-based consumption            tax.

        A. Low In~ation as a “Costless” Investment Subsidy

           Many economists (see, e.g., Feldstein, 1976; and King and Fullerton, 1984) have argued that

under fairly general assumptions,      a reduction in the rate of inflation provides a relatively costless

stimulus     to business fixed investment    by reducing the user cost of capital.       Returning   to the

expression     for the user cost, there are two channels through which expected inflation            affects

investment decisions.     First, for given values of r and 5, the user cost varies positively with the level

of expected inflation n because the present value of depreciation         allowances — which is formed
                                                                                              ‘/

                                                    41

using the nominal rate, r + n, as a discount rate — varies inversely with inflation owing to

historical-cost depreciation.30 Second, inflation affects the real cost of finds, r. In this section, we

briefly illustrate this second channel (following Auerbach, 1983b), and calculate the extent to which

lower inflation over the past decade had led to a reduction in the user cost of capital.

        In a small open economy, the real cost of debt would be determined in world capital markets,

and would be exogenously given to firms. If the capital market were closed, then the marginal tax

rate of the holder of debt would affect the interest rates that firms pay. That is, local debtholders

require a fixed real afier-tax return, r, where:


                                      r=      i (1 -Tp)   -       7C,                                   (19)



where i is the nominal interest rate on corporate debt, ~Pis the marginal personal tax rate on interest

income, and x is the expected rate of inflation. The inflation premium component of interest income

is taxable to bondholders.   The fro’s real cost of debt, p~, depends on its own marginal income tax

rate, ~C:


                                     Pd    = i(l-~C)          -    n,                                   (20)



because under current U.S. tax law nominal interest payments on corporate debt are fi.dly deductible.

Combining the two previous expressions relates the fms            real cost of debt to the investor’s required


     30That is, the present value of depreciation allowances is given by:




where DEP (a) is the depreciation allowance permitted an asset of age a, discounted at a
nominal rate that includes the expected inflation rate n.

return and marginal tax rate:

                                                    (1 -Tp)        -




 The firm’s real cost of equity finance, p., is defined as:


                                      P,     .D~E-~,                           ;                       (23)


where D is the dividend-price ratio and E is investors’ required ex-dividend nominal return to equity.

          Note that, for a given r, inflation has very little effect on the cost of debt finance if--as       is

likely the cme in the United States -- rC is approximately         equal to rP. In this case, lower inflation

reduces the nominal interest deduction         but lowers the tax liability of bondholders      by the same

amount.     Note also that the effects of inflation on the cost of debt finance depend crucially on the

assumption     that the marginal debt holder is taxable.      If the marginal debtholder is a pension fund

(whose income is not taxed under current law), then lower inflation unambiguously               increases the

cost of debt finance. Firms receive smaller interest deductions, and pension fids           do not accrue an

offsetting reduction in tax liability .31



    31There is no clear consensus regarding the effects of marginal tax rates on domestic real
interest rates, or on the question of whether the “Fisher effect” implicit in equation (21) holds.
This is an important area for future research in this context.
                                                      43

       Individuals receive the afier-tax real return:


                            pi   = (l-Ti)D           + (1-C)E      -    n.                         (21)



where ri is the individual’s marginal tax rate on dividend income, and c is the individual’s accrual

equivalent tax rate on capital gains. Combining terms, the firm’s real cost of equity finance is:




                                  (Ti -c)   ~    +         pi        c
                         Pe=—                         —         + —      n.                        (22)
                                   (1 -c)             (1 -c)      (1 -c)


       Higher inflation unambiguously       increases the cost of equity finance by the factor c/(1-c).

This term captures the “inflation tax” paid by shareholders            who reqeive purely nominal gains;

taxation of real capital gains would eliminate this effect. 32

        The total real cost of investment tids       is simply the weighted average of the cost of equity

and the cost of debt, where the weights are the share of each in marginal finmce.              Using this

approach, one can examine the effect on investment of recent declines in expected inflation. Cohen,

Hassett, and Hubbard (1996) calculate the marginal effects on the user cost of lowering inflation.33




    32For the calculations described below, we do not include the first term reflecting the tax on
dividends. In effect, we adopt the “tax capitalization” view of equity taxation (summarized in
Auerbach, 1983b) which suggests that the relevant tax rate is the effective capital gains tax rate,
regardless of the amount of dividends paid. This view assumes that marginal equity funds come
primarily from retained earnings rather than from new share issues and that earnings distributions
to shareholders are primarily through dividends rather than share repurchases.

    33 Earlier empirical studies of the effect of inflation on real business tax burdens include
Feldstein and Summers (1977) and Auerbach (1983 b). Cohen, Hassett, and Hubbard (1 996)
also allow for inflation to increase taxes paid because of the effects of inflation on the cost of
carrying inventones.
                                                                                              ,.

                                                     44

They estimate that, under plausible assumptions,          the current value of the user cost for equipment

investment       is about 0.22, and they conclude that a one-percentage-point       permanent decrease in

inflation     lowers the user cost by about one-half a percentage         point. In their calculations,      the

incremental      effect of each additional percentage point reduction in inflation is approximately          the

same.        Thus if the aual    inflation rate were reduced from four percent to zero, the user cost of

capital would decline about two percentage points -- proportionally by about ten percent. Given the

elasticity     estimates reviewed in the previous section, this “tax cut” would provide a significant

stimulus to investment.

            B. Moving to a Consu~tion       Tax

            Under the income tax, the user cost of capital is itiuenced         by the corporate tax rate,

investment tax credits, and the present value of depreciation allowances (see equation (4)). Under

a broad-based consumption tax, firms pay tax on the difference between receipts and purchases from

other firms. That is, there is no investment tax credit, and investment is expensed (z= 1). In this

case (assuming       that the corporate tax rate does not change over time), the user cost of capital

simplifies to:


                                             AP,+,
                       Cit = p,[r,   +h    - —l-
                                               Pt                                                     (4’)




            Comparing the user cost expressions in (4) and (4’) leads to two observations.         First, under

a consumption        tax, taxes do not distort business investment decisions; investment       decisions are

breed on nonta.x tidarnentals.       Second, given current U.S. tax policy, the user cost is lower under

a consumption       tax than under an income tax.
                                                                                          .,.

        By how much? Under current law, and assuming that the output price and the capital goods

price are both equal to unity, then for assets with seven-year lives, (assuming that the expected real

interest rate is four percent, the expected inflation rate is three percent, and the marginal machine

is financed half with equity and half with debt), the value of (1-r)/(1-~)   under 1996 U.S. tax law is

1.148, and the user cost of capital is equal to 0.234. The move to the consumption      tax would lower

the value of the user cost to 0.205, a reduction that would lead, celerisparibus,   to about a 10 percent

increase in equipment investment given the consensus estimates of y in equation (14).

        Of course, other aggregate variables are also likely to change in response to such a large

change to the tax code were adopted. For example, nominal interest rates and the supply of savings

are likely to change. While it is difflcdt to say how Iwge, the net stimvlus to investment would be,

the consensus of the recent investment      literature suggests that the partial equilibrium    impact on

investment may be quite large.

VII.    Conclusions

        Economists     and policymakers    have long been concerned about the effects of business

taxation and investment incentives on the equilibrium capital stock and the timing of investment.

Such concerns figure prominently      in research programs: (1) identifying impac~ of tax parameters

on fundamental    determinants    of investment;    (2) describing links between fundamentals     and the

capital stock or investment;     and (3) testing models of those links. Studies within the neoclassical

tradition offer rigorous applications of(1) and (2), but, until recently, have not produced reasonable

empirical estimates of effects of fidamental       on investment. Indeed, the poor empirical performance

of neoclassical factors led some researchers to conclude that “taxes don’t matter” and still others to

question assumptions    of the neoclassical paradigm.

                                                                                                  .-
        Our principal conclusions         are four.    First, neoclassical   models that use convex costs of

adjusting the capital stock to derive investment equations yield economically               important short-run

and long-run effects of tax policy on investment.         This result reflects recent research which, through

a number of complementary            approaches,    demonstrates    that measurement    error in tidamentals

biases downward      conventional      estimates of tax effects.     Second, at least for data on firm-level

investment,   predictions   of models with nonconvex adjustment costs are no more consistent with

observed links between fidarnentals         and investment than those of models with convex adjustment

costs. Third, recent studies conclude that U.S. business investment is below its “golden rule” level.

Finally, consensus estimates of the impact of the user cost of capital on investment indicate that two

cment policy suggestions      -- pursuing a monetary policy that would ryduce expected inflation and

switching from an income tax to a consumption tax -- would significantly               stimulate investment.

        The current state of research on business investment decisions suggests the desirability of

developing    tests to distinguish     among alternative models of costs of adjusting the capital stock.

Different adjustment     cost specifications       imply different time paths of the response of the capital

stock to tax policy, making such tests usefil for policymakers.              Nonetheless,   most recent studies

imply a high long-run elasticity of the capital stock to the user cost of capital, so that tax policy

clearly has the potential to have a powefil         effect on equipment investment and the capital stock in

the long run.
