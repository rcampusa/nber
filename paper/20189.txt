                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we develop an approach to measuring inequality and poverty that recognizes the fact
that individuals within households may have both different preferences and differential access to resources.
We argue that a measure based on estimates of the sharing rule is inadequate as an approach that seeks
to understand how welfare is distributed in the population because it ignores public good and the allocation
of time to market work, leisure and household production. We develop a money metric measure of
welfare that accounts for public goods (by using personalized prices) household production and for
the allocation of time.

1    Introduction: individual and household wel-
     fare

When dealing with households, the applied welfare literature is faced with an

interesting conundrum. On the one hand, what we are (or should be) ulti-

mately interested in is individual welfare. ‘Household welfare’, if this notion has

any sense, cannot be de…ned without considering the welfare of each member.

On the other hand, most empirical measures of welfare stop at the household

level. That could have been acceptable if the two approaches were equivalent -

say, if there existed a stable, monotonic, one-to-one relationship between house-

hold welfare, as measured by the standard approaches, and the welfare of each

individual composing the household, so that any reform improving total wel-

fare would automatically improve that of each member in similar proportion.

However, everything we know about household behavior strongly suggests that

such an assumption would be plain wrong. From a theoretical perspective, it

would imply that ‘power’ is either distributed across household members in a

totally in‡exible manner, regardless of individual situations, or is irrelevant to

intrahousehold allocation of welfare. While both arguments can be found in

the literature (the …rst is reminiscent of Samuelson’s household welfare index,

whereas the second relates to Becker’s rotten kid theorem), advances in family

economics over the last two decades have essentially been build upon the oppo-

site view - i.e., that intrahousehold allocation of power is crucial for individual

welfare, and responds to changes in the environment. From an empirical per-

spective, moreover, the verdict is clear. Income pooling - a central prediction of

the previous approaches - has been systematically rejected; there is ample evi-



                                        2
dence that reforms which alter the balance of power within the household (e.g.,

by paying a bene…t to the wife instead of the husband) do impact household

behavior and individual well-being.

   Analyzing welfare at the intrahousehold level, however, raises a host of spe-

ci…c problems. An obvious di¢ culty is observability. While many data sets

report aggregate consumption at the household level, individual consumptions

are typically not recorded, at least for most commodities; they have to be re-

covered. But conceptual problems at least as challenging. A large fraction of

household expenditures relate to public commodities - i.e., goods that are jointly

consumed by the household, without anyone being excluded; moreover, in many

cases these public commodities are internally produced within the household.

Spouses may have di¤erent preferences regarding public goods; therefore, the

fraction of household expenditures devoted to public consumption has a poten-

tially important (and di¤erentiated) impact on individual welfare that cannot

be ignored. Similar questions arise for intrahousehold production, with the ad-

ditional twist that time spent by each spouse should also be taken into account.

How should such public productions and consumptions be considered? Can

one de…ne a money-metric measure of individual welfare that accounts for the

public nature of several consumption goods (and their potentially di¤erentiated

impact of the welfare of each individual)? And when would such a measure be

empirically identi…able from standard data on household behavior?

   The aim of the present article is to provide a new answer to these ques-

tions. Obviously, this task …rst requires an explicit model of household decision

making that recognizes the existence of (potentially di¤erent) individual pref-

erences and clari…es the notion of ‘power’within the household. Furthermore,



                                        3
these goals should be achieved in an empirically tractable way. An acceptable

approach must ful…ll a double requirement: testability (i.e., it should generate

a set of empirically testable restrictions that fully characterize the model, in

the sense that any given behavior is compatible with the model if and only if

these conditions are satis…ed) and identi…ability (it should be feasible, possibly

under additional assumption, to recover the structure of the model –in our case,

individual preferences and welfare) from the sole observation of household be-

havior. The main candidate, in this respect, is the collective approach.1 While

other (non-unitary) perspectives have been adopted in the literature, none of

the alternatives has (so far) convincingly addressed the double requirement of

testability and identi…ability just evoked.

    The basic axiom of the collective approach is Pareto e¢ ciency: whatever de-

cision the household is making, no alternative choice would have been preferred

by all members. While this assumption is undoubtedly restrictive, its scope

remains quite large. It encompasses as particular cases many models that have

been proposed in the literature, including:


      ‘unitary’ models, which posit that the household behaves like a single

      decision maker; this includes simple dictatorship (possibly by a ‘benevolent

      patriarch’, as in Becker, 1974) to the existence of some household welfare

      function (as in Samuelson 1956),

      models based on cooperative game theory, and particularly bargaining

      theory (at least in a context of symmetric information), as pioneered by

      Manser and Brown (1980) and McElroy and Horney (1981),
   1 For a more detailed presentation, the reader is referred to Browning, Chiappori and Weiss

      more speci…c models, such as Lundberg and Pollak’s ‘separate spheres’

      framework.2


    Over the last decades, the collective model has been fully characterized. We

now have a set of necessary and su¢ cient conditions for a demand function to

stem from a collective framework (Chiappori, Ekeland 2006); and exclusion re-

strictions have been derived under which individual preferences and the decision

process (as summarized by the Pareto weights) can be recovered from the sole

observation of household behavior (Chiappori, Ekeland 2009a). To the best of

our knowledge, this is the only model of the household for which such results

have been derived.3

    The next section describes the basic model. We then discuss the conceptual

issues linked with intrahousehold inequality, …rst in the case where all com-

modities are privately consumed, then in the presence of public goods. In the

following section, we consider extensions of the model to encompass individual-

speci…c prices and domestic production. Finally, we discuss issues related to

identi…cation.
   2 On the other hand, the collective framework excludes models based on non cooperative

game theory (at least in the presence of public good), such as those considered by Ulph (2006),
Lechene and Preston (2009), Browning, Chiappori and Lechene (2009) and many others, as
well as models of ine¢ cient bargaining a la Basu (2006).
   3 Browning, Chiappori and Lechene (2009) and Lechene and Preston (2009) provide a set

of necessary conditions for non cooperative models. However, whether these conditions are
su¢ cient is not known; moreover, no general identi…cation result has been derived so far.




                                              5
2    Concepts, de…nitions, axioms

In what follows, we consider a K-person household that can consume several

commodities; these include standard consumption goods and services, but also

leisure, future or contingent goods, etc. Formally, N of these commodities are

publicly consumed within the houshold. The market purchase of public good j

is denoted Qj ; the N -vector of public goods is given by Q. Similarly, private

goods are denoted qi with the n-vector q. Each private goods bought is divided

between the members so that member a (a = 1; :::; K) receives qia of good i, with
P a                                                           a
                                                                      P a
  a qi = qi . The vector of private goods that a receives is q , with   a q = q.

An allocation is a N + Kn-vector Q; q 1 ; :::; q K . The associated market prices

are given by the N -vector P and the n-vector p for public and private goods

respectively.

    We assume that each married person has her or his own preferences over

the allocation of family resources. The most general version of the model would

consider utilities of the form U a Q; q 1 ; :::; q K , implying that a is concerned

directly with all members’ consumptions. Here, however, tractability requires

additional structure. In what follows, we therefore assume that preferences are

of the caring type. That is, each individual a has a felicity function ua (Q; q a );

and a’s utlity takes the form:


                U a Q; q 1 ; :::; q K = W a u1 Q; q 1 ; :::; uK Q; q K   ;      (1)


where W a (:; :) is an increasing function. The weak separability of these ‘social’

preferences represents an important moral principle; a is indi¤erent between

bundles q b ; Q that b consumes whenever b is indi¤erent. In this sense caring



                                            6
is distinguished from paternalism. Caring rules out direct externalities between

members because a’s evaluation of her private consumption q a does not depend

directly on the private goods that b consumes.

    Lastly, a particular but widely used version of caring is egotistic preferences,

whereby members only care about their own (private and public) consumption;

then individual preferences can be represented by felicities (i.e., utilities of the

form ua (Q; q a )).4 Note that such egotistic preferences for consumption do not

exclude non economic aspects, such as love, companionship or others. That is, a

person’s utility may be a¤ected by the presence of other persons, but not by their

consumption. Technically, the ‘true’preferences are of the form F a (ua (Q; q a )),

where F a may depend on marital status and on the spouse’s characteristics.

Note that the F a s will typically play a crucial role in the decision to marry and

in the choice of a partner. However, it is irrelevant for the characterization of

individual preferences over consumption bundles.

    E¢ ciency has a simple translation - namely, the household behaves as if it

was maximizing a weighted sum of utilities of its members. Technically, the

program is thus (assuming egotistic preferences):

                                                 X
                                                     a a
                                    max                  u (Q; q a )                         ((P))
                             (Q;q 1 ;:::;q K )
                                                 a


under the budget constraint:

                X               X
                      Pi Qi +        pj qj1 + ::: + qjK = y 1 + ::: + y K = y
                  i             j


where y a denotes a’s (non labor) income. Here,                        a
                                                                           is the Pareto weight of

are continuously di¤erentiable and strictly quasi-concave.

member a; one may, for instance, adopt the normalization                          a       = 1. In
                              a
the particular case where         is constant, the program above describes a uni-

tary model, since household behavior is described by the maximization of some
                                                         a
(price independent) utility. In general, however,            may vary with prices and

individual incomes; the maximand in (P) is therefore price-dependent, and we

are not in a unitary framework in general.

   This program can readily be extended to caring preferences - one must simply

replace ua (Q; q a ) with W a u1 Q; q 1 ; :::; uK Q; q K            in (P). In what follows,

however, (P) plays a very special role, mostly because of the following result:

Proposition 1 Assume that some allocation is Pareto-e¢ cient for the caring
utilities W 1 ; :::; W K . Then it solves (P) for some       1
                                                                 ; :::;   K
                                                                              .
Proof. Assume not, then there exists an alternative allocation that gives a
larger value to ua for all a = 1; :::; K. But then that allocation also gives a
higher value to all W a s, a contradiction.

   In words: any allocation that is e¢ cient for caring preferences must be ef-

…cient for the underlying, egotistic felicities. The converse is not true, because

a very unequal solution to (P) may fail to be Pareto e¢ cient for caring prefer-

ences: transfering resources from well endowed but caring individuals to poorly

endowed ones may be Pareto improving. We conclude that any property of the

solutions to a program of the form (P) must be satis…ed by any Pareto-e¢ cient

allocation with caring preferences.

   A major advantage of the formulation (P) is that the Pareto weights have

a natural interpretation in terms of respective decision powers. The notion of

‘power’ in households may be di¢ cult to de…ne formally, even in a simpli…ed

framework like ours. Still, it seems natural to expect that when two people

bargain, a person’s gain increases with the person’s power. This somewhat

                                          8
                                                                                     a
hazy notion is captured very e¤ectively by the Pareto weights. Clearly, if               in
                                                                     a
(P) is zero then a has no say on the …nal allocation, while if           is large (close

to 1 in our normalization) then a e¤ectively gets her way. A key property of

(P) is precisely that increasing      will result in a move along the Pareto set,

in the direction of higher utility for a. If we restrict ourselves to economic
                                                                         a
considerations, we may thus consider that the Pareto weight                  ‘re‡ects’ a’s
                                        a
power, in the sense that a larger           corresponds to more power (and better

outcomes) being enjoyed by a.

   If Q (p; P; y) ; q 1 (p; P; y) ; :::; q K (p; P; y) denotes the solution to (P), we

de…ne the collective indirect utlity of a as the utility reached by a at the end of

the decision process; formally:


                    V a (p; P; y) = ua Q (p; P; y) ; q a (p; P; y)


Note that, unlike the unitary setting, in the collective framework a member’s

collective indirect utility depends not only on the member’s preferences but also

on the decision process (hence the adjective ‘collective’). This notion is crucial

for welfare analysis, as we shall see below.

   Finally, an important concept is the notion of distribution factors. A distri-

bution factor is any variable that (i) does not a¤ect preferences or the budget

constraint, but (ii) may in‡uence the decision process, therefore the Pareto

weights. Think, for instance, of a bargaining model in which the agents’respec-

tive threat points may vary. A change in the threat point of one member will

typically in‡uence the outcome of the bargaining process, even if the household’s

budget constraint is una¤ected. In particular, several works use individual (non

labor) incomes as distribution factors. If y 1 ; :::; y K is the vector of individual


                                            9
                        P
incomes and y =            a   y a , while total income y is not a distribution factor (it

enters the budget constraints), the (K                 1) ratios y 1 =y; :::; y K   1
                                                                                        =y are.5

    In what follows, the vector of distribution factors will be denoted z =

(z1 ; :::; zS ); Pareto weights and collective indirect utilities, therefore, have the
                  a
general form          (p; P; y; z) and V a (p; P; y; z).



3     Intrahousehold welfare: basic issues

We now consider individual welfare issues. We …rst consider a special case in

which all commodities are privately consumed, then move to the general case.


3.1     The case of private goods

When all commodities are privately consumed, the household can be considered

as a small economy without externalities or public goods. From the second

welfare theorem, any Pareto e¢ cient allocation can be decentralized by adequate

transfers. Formally, we have the following result:

Proposition 2 Assume an allocation q 1 ; :::; q K                    is Pareto e¢ cient. Then
there exists K non-negative functions 1 ; :::; K of prices, total income and
                          P
distribution factors, with k k (p; y; z) = y, such that agent a solves


                                        max
                                         a
                                            ua (q a )                                              (D)
                                         q


under the budget constraint
                                          n
                                          X
                                                pi qia =   a

                                          i=1
    5 In practice, distribution factors must be uncorrelated with preferences, which, in the case

of individual incomes, can generate subtle exogeneity problems. See Browning, Chiappori and
Weiss (2013) for a detailed discussion.

Conversely, for any non-negative functions                  ; :::;       such that   k   k   (p; y; z) =
y, an allocation that solves (D) for all a is Pareto-e¢ cient.

      In words: in a private goods setting, any e¢ cient decision can be described

as (or as if) a two-stage process. In the …rst stage, agents jointly decide on the

allocation of household aggregate income y between agents (and agent a gets
 a
     ); in stage two, agents freely spend the share they have received. The decision

process (bargaining, for instance) takes place in the …rst stage; its outcome is
                              1            K
given by the functions            ; :::;       , which are called the sharing rule of the

household.

      From a welfare perspective, the crucial point is that there exists a one-to-

one, increasing corespondance between Pareto weights and the sharing rule,

at least when the Pareto set is strictly convex. When prices and incomes are

constant, increasing the weight of one individual (reducing the other weights

proportionally in order to maintain the normalization) always results in a larger

share for that individual and conversely. The collective, indirect utility of agent

a takes a simple form, namely:


                             V a (p; y) = v a (p;       a
                                                            (p; y))


where v a is the standard, indirect utility of agent a. In particular, we have the

following result:

Proposition 3 When all commodities are privately consumed, then for any
given price vector there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the sharing
rule and the indirect utility

      This result has two consequences. First, given each person’s preferences, the

sharing rule is a su¢ cient statistic for the entire decision process. Indeed, since

                                                 11
all agents face the same prices, the sharing rule fully summarizes intrahouse-

hold allocation of resources. As such, it is directly relevant for intrahousehold

inequality. Second, and more importantly for our present purpose, the sharing
                                                                           a
rule is a money metric measure of individual utility. For given prices,        is an

increasing transform of the collective indirect utility of person a; moreover, and

unlike V a , it is measured in dollars.


3.2     Public and private commodities

Convenient as the previous notions may be, they still rely on a strong assumption

- namely that all commodities are privately consumed. Relaxing this assumption

is obviously necessary, if only because the existence of public consumption is

one of the motives of household formation. We shall successively consider three

possible extensions of the previous notion to the case of public goods.


3.2.1   Conditional sharing rule

A …rst generalization of the notion of sharing rule, the conditional sharing rule,

is based on the following result:

Proposition 4 Assume an allocation Q; q 1 ; :::; q K is Pareto e¢ cient. Then
there exists K non-negative functions ~1 ; :::; ~K of prices, total income and
                          P                       P
distribution factors, with k ~k (p; P; y; z) = y    j Pj Qj , such that for all a

the vector of private consumptions q a solves:


                                    max
                                     a
                                        ua Q; q a
                                     q


under the budget constraint
                                    n
                                    X
                                          pi qia =   a

                                    i=1




                                            12
Proof. Assume not, then there exists q^a such that ua Q; q^a > ua Q; q a while
Pn
         ^ia = a . But then Q; q 1 ; :::; q^a ; :::; q K is feasible and Pareto dominates
  i=1 pi q

 Q; q 1 ; :::; q K , a contradiction.


   The function ~ = ~1 ; :::; ~K constitute the conditional sharing rule of the

household. The interpretation, again, is in terms of a two-stage process. In

stage one, the household decides the consumption of public goods and the dis-

tribution of remaining income between members; in stage two, members all

spend their alloted amount on private consumption, so as to maximize individ-

ual utility conditional on the level of public consumption decided in stage 1.

The conditional indirect utility is thus:


                  V~ a (p; Q; ) = max
                                   a
                                      fua (Q; q a )          s.t.   p:q a = g
                                        q



   While the conditional sharing rule (CSR) is indeed a generalization of the

sharing rule, three points must be noted. First, the existence of a conditional

sharing rule is a necessary but not su¢ cient condition for e¢ ciency; that is,

for any given level of public consumption, it is in general the case that almost

all conditional sharing rules lead to ine¢ cient allocations. Speci…cally, a con-

ditional sharing rule is compatible with e¢ ciency if and only if the standard,

Bowen-Lindahl-Samuelson conditions, which express the optimality of Q for

these preferences, are satis…ed:

                     X @ V~ a (p; Q;        a
                                             ) =@Qj
                                                       = Pj ; j = 1; :::; N
                       a   @ V~ a (p; Q;    a ) =@ a



   Second, the monotonic relationship between sharing rule and Pareto weights

is lost. In particular, increasing a’s weight does not necessarily result in a larger



                                                13
            a
value for       . The intuition, here, is that giving more weight to one agent may

result in a di¤erent allocation of public expenditures, which may or may not

result in an increase in the agent’s private consumption. In that sense, the

generalization is only partial.

   Third, and more importantly for our purpose, the conditional sharing rule

may give a biased estimate of intrahousehold welfare allocation, because it sim-

ply disregards public consumption. That this pattern could be problematic is

easy to see. Assume that one spouse (say the wife) cares a lot for a public

good, while her husband cares very little. If the structure of household demand

entails a signi…cant fraction of expenditures being devoted to that public good,

one can expect this pattern to have an impact on any welfare measure within

the household. Disregarding public consumption altogether is therefore not an

adequate approach.


3.2.2     Public goods and Lindahl prices

An alternative approach to public consumption relies on the notion of Lindahl

prices. An old result in public economics states that, in the presence of public

goods, Pareto e¢ cient allocations can be decentralized using personal prices that

add up to the market price of the commodity. Formally, we have the following

result:

Proposition 5 Assume an allocation Q; q 1 ; :::; q K is Pareto e¢ cient. Then
                                      1
                                                          P
there exists K non-negative functions   ; :::; K , with k k = y, and N
non-negative functions Pja ; a = 1; :::; K; j = 1; :::; N (where P a is a’s vector
                         P
of personal prices), with a Pja = Pj for all j, such that for all a the vector
 Q; q a solves:
                                  max
                                   a
                                      ua (Q; q a )                          (DP)
                                   q



                                           14
under the budget constraint

                               n
                               X                   N
                                                   X
                                        pi qia +         Pja Qaj =      a

                               i=1                 j=1

                                                                 P a
Conversely, for any non-negative functions 1 ; :::; K such that   a    = y
      a
                   P a
and Pj such that a Pj = Pj for all j, an allocation that solves (DP) for all
a is Pareto-e¢ cient.

                           1              K
    The vector      =          ; :::;          de…nes a generalized sharing rule (GSR).

From an inequality perspective, this notion raises interesting issues. One could

choose to adopt     as a description of intrahousehold welfare allocation; indeed,

agents now maximize utility under a budget constraint in which                                 describes

available income. In particular,              is a much better indicator of the distribution

of resources than the conditional sharing rule ~, because it takes into account

both private and public consumptions.
                                                                                     a
    However, the welfare of agent a is not fully described by                            ; one also needs

to know the vector P a of a’s personal prices. Technically, the collective indirect

utility of a is:

                    V a (p; P; y; z) = v a (p; P a ;            a
                                                                     (p; P; y; z))

                            a
which depends on both            and P a . This implies that the sole knowledge of the

GSR is not su¢ cient to recover the welfare level reached by a given agent, even

if her preferences are known; indeed, one also needs to know the prices, which

depend on all preferences.

    In particular, welfare within the household cannot be analyzed from the sole

knowledge of the generalized sharing rule. Agents now face di¤erent personal

prices, and this should be taken into account. Of course, this conclusion was



                                                    15
expected; it simply re‡ects a basic but crucial insight - namely that if agents

‘care di¤erently’about the public goods (as indicated by personal prices, which

re‡ect individual marginal willingnesses to pay), then variations in the quantity

of these public goods have an impact on intrahousehold inequality.


3.2.3   The Money Metric Welfare Index

This leads us to the basic concept of Money Metric Welfare Index (MMWI) of

agent a. Formally:

De…nition 6 The Money Metric Welfare Index (MMWI) of agent a, ma (p; P; y; z),
is de…ned by:
                     v a (p; P; ma (p; P; y; z)) = V a (p; P; y; z)              (2)

Equivalently, if ca denotes the expenditure function of agent a;then:


                     ma (p; P; y; z) = ca (p; P; V a (p; P; y; z))               (3)


   In words, ma is the monetary amount that agent a would need to reach

the utility level V a (p; P; y), if she was to pay the full price of each public good

(i.e., if she faced the price vector P instead of the personalized prices P a ). The

basic intuition is simple enough. The index is de…ned as the monetary amount

that would be needed to reach the same utility level, at some reference prices; a

natural benchmark is to use the current market price for all goods, private and

public. Unlike the GSR, the Money Metric Welfare Index fully characterizes

the utility level reached by the agent. That is, knowing an agent’s preferences,

there is a one-to-one relationship between her utility and her MMWI, and this

relationship does not depend on the partner’s characteristics.




                                          16
   Three remarks can be made at this point. First, in the absence of public

goods, the MMWI coincides with the sharing rule. In other words, the MMWI

is a fully general measure of individual welfare, which coincides with the natural

concept (i.e. the sharing rule) in the (largely explored) case of private consump-

tions, and extends it to allow for public expenditures within the household.

   A second remark is that in the presence of public goods, the MMWI depends

on the price vector for public goods used as a reference. While using the market

price as a benchmark is a natural solution, it is by no means the only one. Even

more striking is the fact that even the direction of intrahousehold inequality

may be a¤ected by this choice; i.e., one can easily construct examples in which

the MMWI of member A is larger than B’s for some prices but smaller for others

(see Figure 1).6

                                                                               X

                                                     17
   Lastly, there is a direct relationship between the MMWI and the standard

notion of equivalent income.7 Both approaches rely on the notion that referring

to a common price vector can facilitate interpersonal comparisons of welfare.

However, to the best of our knowledge, equivalent income has exclusively be

applied so far to private goods. Our point, here, is that using the concept

of Lindahl prices allows to extend it to the case of public comsumption, thus

providing a natural solution to a recurrent and somewhat di¢ cult problem.


3.3       An example

The previous concepts can be illustrated on a very simple example. Assume

two agents a and b, two commodities - one private q, one public Q - and Cobb-

Douglas preferences:


                                         1
                             ua     =         log q a +        log Q
                                        1+                1+
                                         1
                             ub     =         log q b +        log Q
                                        1+                1+


corresponding to the indirect utilities:


                va   =      log y          log P    log (1 + ) +        log
                                     1+                            1+
                vb   =      log y          log P    log (1 + ) +        log
                                     1+                            1+


   Let       be b’s Pareto weight; then the couple’s consumption is given by:


                                          1
                       qa     =                   y; q b =               y
                                    (1 + ) (1 + )          (1 + ) (1 + )
                                      (1 + ) +    (1 + ) y
                 and Q =
                                    (1 + ) (1 + ) (1 + ) P

generating utilities equal to:


                                                                 (1 + ) +  (1 + )
Va    =     log y        log P    log ((1 + ) (1 + )) +     log
                    1+                                 1+              1+

Vb    =     log y        log P    log (1 + ) (1 + ) +     log +      log
                    1+                                1+        1+             1+


     In this context, straightforward calculations allow to see that:


  1. The conditional sharing rule coincides with private consumption:


                                   1
                      ~a =                 y; ~b =               y
                             (1 + ) (1 + )         (1 + ) (1 + )


  2. Lindahl prices are


                                            (1 +           )
                             Pa   =                               P
                                       (1 + ) +            (1 + )
                                             (1 +           )
                             Pb   =                               P
                                       (1 + ) +            (1 + )


       and the generalized sharing rule is


                                       a              y
                                             =
                                                     1+

                                             =
                                                     1+


  3. The two MMWIs are given by:


                     (1 + ) +  (1 + )           1+
                                                      y           (1 + ) +  (1 + )    1+
       ma     =                                             =                              a
                          (1 + )                     1+                (1 + )
                     (1 + ) +   (1 + )          1+
                                                       y          (1 + ) +   (1 + )   1+
       mb     =                                             =                              b
                           (1 + )                    1+                 (1 + )


     Assume, now, that    = 1 but agents have di¤erent preferences for the public



                                           19
good - say,   = 2 while      = :5; and let us analyze intrahousehold welfare using

three possible indicators.


  1. If we concentrate on private consumption, we …nd that

                                   ~a =     y;     ~b =       y
                                          6                 3


     and we conclude that member b is much better o¤ than a.

  2. This conclusion is clearly unsatisfactory, because it disregards the fact

     that half the budget is spent on the public good, which bene…ts a more

     than b. Indeed, the GSR is


                                          a       y     b
                                              =     =
                                                  2


     and we conclude that for this indicator, the household is perfectly equal:

     the bene…ts of public expenditures exactly compensate di¤erences in pri-

     vate consumptions.

  3. The later conclusion is however too optimistic, since it omits the fact that
                                                                               2
     a ‘pays’ twice as much for the public good than b does (here, P a =       3P

                   1
     while P b =   3 P ).    Taking this last aspect into account, the respective

     MMWIs are:

                                 ma = :655y;        mb = :72y


     Again, b is better o¤ than a (although by much less than with the …rst

     measure). In addition, one may note that


                                    ma + mb = 1: 375y



                                          20
      Individual MMWIs add up to more than total income, re‡ecting the gain

      generated by the publicness of one commodity.



4     Extensions

We now consider a few extensions of the model


4.1    Private goods with individual-speci…c prices

Interesting issues arise when, within the same household, individuals face di¤er-

ent prices for some good. A typical example is leisure: its (opportunity) price

is the wage, which is individual-speci…c. The previous approach applies in that

case as well. Speci…cally, consider a standard, collective model of labor supply

with private consumption, as in Chiappori (1992). Individual utilities are of

the form ua (q a ; La ), where L denotes leisure and q is the consumption of some

Hicksian aggregate good. Let wa denote member a’s wage, y the household’s

(total) non labor income, and de…ne Y to be the household total (or potential)

income:
                                         X
                               Y =y+             wa T
                                             a

where T denotes total time available.

    E¢ ciency, in this context, is equivalent to a two stage process, in which

total income Y is split between members at the …rst stage (so that member
                P a
a gets a , with   a     = Y ), and members each independently choose their

consumption and leisure bundle in a second stage, by maximizing ua under the

budget constraint:

                               pq a + wa La =       a




                                        21
   Here as above, a natural measure of individual welfare is provided by the
               a
sharing rule       . Unlike standard measures, which are based on consumption, the

sharing rule also considers leisure, the value of which is, as usual, estimated at

the person’s current wage. This approach directly extends to non participation

by one spouse (or both). If member a does not work, then his/her leisure equals

total time available T , and is valued at its opportunity cost wa T , where wa

is member a’s potential wage. Clearly, the notion thus de…ned requires the

(actual or potential) wage to be observable; for non working spouses, one may

have to estimate a potential wage, as a function of observable characteristics

(age, education,...) and correcting for possible selection biases.

   While the practical implementation may raise speci…c di¢ culties, the concep-

tual background is largely straightforward. Welfare measures should be based

on total consumption, which includes consumption of leisure; and if the op-

portunity cost of leisure di¤ers across members, this should be re‡ected in the

assessment. Note, however, that this logic may have surprising implications.

Consider a couple in which husband and wife have identical levels of leisure and

commodity consumption but di¤erent wages (say, his wage is higher). Then

our criterion concludes that the intrahousehold allocation is unequal in the hus-

band’s favor, because, although the number of hours of leisure is the same, the

value of his consumption of leisure is larger. This conclusion is, in a sense, un-

avoidable if one wants to consider a ‘general’measure of consumption that also

includes leisure. Aggregating various consumptions requires relative prices, and

there is no compelling reason for not using market prices. But then the value

of one hour of leisure equals the person’s wage; there is little justi…cation for

departing from this benchmark.



                                          22
   It should however be noted that this approach may be seen as contradict-

ing the notion of equivalent income - which would require using the same ‘price’

(here wage) as a common benchmark. The contradiction, however, is largely su-

per…cial. Using the same reference wage for the husband and the wife is needed

only to the extent one considers male and female leisure as the same commod-

ity (which happens to be priced di¤erently depending on gender). While this

assumption may sometimes be acceptable (say, if both spouses have exactly the

same human capital and exert exactly the same task with the same productiv-

ity, so that the wage di¤erence is exclusively due to gender discrimination), one

would expect such cases to be the exception. Most of the time, husband and

wife have di¤erent jobs, and there would be little rationale to imposing these

jobs to be priced equally.

   Finally, it is clear that the measure of welfare thus de…ned will be sensitive

to the de…nition of leisure. This raises two speci…c problems. One is the choice

of total available time T : a larger value of T in‡ates the evaluation of time spent

on leisure, which increases total consumption of all members, but increases more

that of higher wage individuals. Second, and more important, is the issue of

domestic production. If, as seems natural, we include leisure in our assessment

of total consumption, then the distinction between ‘true’leisure and other uses

of available time (including chores and other forms of household production)

becomes crucial. This issue is considered below.


4.2    Changes in marital status

One of the main advantages of the collective approach, as opposed to unitary

models, is that it allows to model member’s preferences both within and outside



                                        23
the relationship (say, before marriage or after divorce) within the same basic

framework. Still, an important question is the relationship between the two

sets of preferences. Various models make di¤erent assumptions on this issue.

One extreme version does not postulate any link between utilities when mar-

ried and single; hence, knowing an individual preferences when single brings

no information about her tastes whithin the household. On the other extreme,

some models assume that preferences are una¤ected by marital status, at least

ordinally. This means that if uaS (Q; q a ) denotes a’s utility when single, then her

utility when married takes the form:


                            ua (Q; q a ) = F (uaS (Q; q a ))


where F is an increasing transform. Thus marriage can directly a¤ect a person’s

utility level, but not the person’s marginal rates of substitution between various

commodities. Note that if we assume preferences are una¤ected by marital

status, then the MMWI de…ned above has a natural interpretation; namely,

it is the level of income that would be needed by the individual, if single, to

reach the same utility level as what she currently gets within marriage. It must

however be stressed that the assumption of constant preferences across marital

status is not needed for the de…nition of the index, but only for this particular

interpretation.

   An intermediate approach, that relies on the notion of domestic produc-

tion, has recently been proposed by Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel (2003).

It posits that agents, when they get married, keep the same preferences but can

access a di¤erent (and generally more productive) technology. That is, while

the basic rates of substitution between consumed commodities remains unaf-


                                          24
fected by marriage (or cohabitation), the relationship between purchases and

consumptions is not; therefore, the structure of demand, including for exclusive

commodities (consumed only by one member) is di¤erent from what it would be

for singles. More generally, one can, following Dunbar, Lewbel and Pendakur

(), only assume that preferences are una¤ected by family composition; e.g., that

parents’preferences regarding their own consumption does not depend on the

number of children. These approaches are described in the next subsection.


4.3    Domestic production

The general notion of domestic production covers a host of di¤erent situations.

Rural households typically have an explicit production activity, the outcomes

of which can be self consumed or sold on a market; in low income countries,

a large fraction of GDP consists of agricultural commodities produced at the

household (or the village) level. Even in high income economies, a signi…cant

fraction of individual available time is spent on household production. This

entails immediate tasks (cleaning, cooking, etc.) but also long term investments

in health, education and others. In a more abstract way, some authors, starting

with Becker’s (1965) seminal contributions, have argued that most intrahouse-

hold activities, including consumption, can be modeled as entailing a production

component; even such ‘commodities’as love, a¤ection or mutual care are ‘pro-

duced’ (and consumed) at the household level. In Becker’s model, actually,

the only commodities that are ultimately consumed by individuals are those

produced at the household level; goods purchased in the market are seen as

inputs in a production system that transforms these purchased goods into …nal

commodities that are actually consumed (and enter individual utilities). These



                                      25
home produced goods can be public or private. In what follow, we respectively

denoted by Qj and qia ; a = 1; :::; K; j = 1; :::; n the household’s consumption of

public good j and private good i by agent a.

    The technology is described by a production function that gives the possible

vector of outputs (q; Q) that can be produced given a vector of market purchases
                                      a
x (and possibly the time        =(        ; a = 1; K) spent in household production by

each of the members). It takes the general form:


                                     (q; Q) = f (x; )                                    (4)


while individual utilities are now U a (q a ; Q) for a = 1; :::; K.8

    For clarity purposes, it is useful to start with case when all produced goods

are privately consumed within the household, then move to the general case.


4.3.1      Private goods only

We start with the case N = 0; moreover, we …rst disregard the time spent

by each member on domestic production. This setting is thus identical to the

general model of household production of Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel

(2003).9 Pareto e¢ ciency translates into the program:


                                           X
                                                a a
                                    max            u (q a )
   8 The  setting just described is identical to the general model of household production of
Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel (2003). For empirical applications, these authors use a linear
technology a la Barten.

In that case, again, individual welfare is adequately measured by the sharing

rule.

   Extending this model to domestic labor supply is straightforward. The

Extending this formula to domestic time is straightforward.



5       Identi…cation: some remarks

While the conceptual tools just presented help clarifying some of the issues in-

volved, their empirical content must be carefully considered: these is no point

putting much emphasis on a concept that cannot possibly be identi…ed form

existing data. In fact, much progress has recently been made on these issues. In

this section, we brie‡y summarize some of the main results. For a detailed pre-

sentation, the reader is referred to Chiappori and Ekeland (2009b) and Brown-



                                              30
ing, Chiappori and Weiss (2014).

   We start with the ‘pure’ identi…cation problem. Assume that the entire

demand function of a household can be observed; what can be recovered from

such data (and such data only)? A …rst result, due to Chiappori and Ekeland

(2009a), is that under mild regularity conditions, one exclusion restriction per

agent is su¢ cient to fully identify the collective, indirect utilities. The exclusion

restriction, here, requires that for each agent there exists a least one commodity

that is not consumed by this agent. The result is local; in particular, it does

not require global constraints (such as non negativity restrictions). Moreover,

the presence of distribution factors would allow a stronger identi…cation result.

Speci…cally, the exclusion requirement can then be relaxed; one only need the

presence of an assignable commodity.10

   A crucial remark is that what is identi…ed (up to an increasing transform) is

the indirect collective utility of each member. From a welfare perspective, this is

the only relevant concept, since it fully characterizes the utility reached by each

agent. However, its implications for the previous discussion must be carefully

considered. Paradoxically, the public good case is the easiest. Indeed, Chiappori

and Ekeland (2009a) show that when all commodities are publicly consumed,

recovering a person’s indirect collective utility is equivalent to recovering their

direct utility. It follows that all the concepts previously de…ned (in particular

the MMWI) are exactly identi…ed under either the exclusion condition or the

assignable and distribution factor case.

   Private goods, however, raise speci…c di¢ culties. Remember that, in that

case, the various concepts (conditional sharing rule, generalized sharing rule,
 1 0 A good is assignable when it is consumed by all members and the consumption of each

member is independently observed.



                                          31
money metric welfare index) coincide with the sharing rule, and the collective

indirect utility takes the form:


                            V a (p; y) = v a (p;   a
                                                       (p; y))


where, as above, v a is a’s indirect utility and            is the sharing rule. Under

assumptions stated above, the function V a is identi…ed. The sharing rule, how-

ever, is not; identi…cation only obtains up to an additive function of the prices

of the non exclusive goods. The corresponding indetermination is not welfare

relevant, since the di¤erent solutions correspond to the same collective indi-

rect utilities for each agent. In that case, and somewhat paradoxically, one can

identify intra-household welfare distribution (although only up to the usual re-

strictions: one can only identify individual utilities in an ordinal sense), but not

income distribution.

   It is crucial to remark, however, that this non identi…cation result is only

local. In particular, it disregards additional, global restrictions such as non neg-

ativity contraints. If these are added, then more precise identi…cation obtains.

For instance, adding a non negativity restriction exactly pins down the sharing

rule in general. This result should be related to recent work on the estimation

of the sharing rules based on a revealed preference approach (see for instance

Cherchye et al 2012). Since the revealed preference approach is global by nature,

it can generate bounds on the sharing rule, which can actually be quite narrow.

In all cases, the global restrictions are generated at one end of the distribution

of expenditures, so their use for identifying the sharing rule outside this range

should be submitted to the usual caution. Still, they tend to considerably reduce

the scope of the non identi…cation conclusion.


                                          32
    Finally, additional assumptions may also help identi…cation. The literature,

here, has followed two main directions.     On the one hand, one may assume

that individual preferences remain (partly) unchanged after marriage. Then

information can be recovered from observing the demand of single individuals,

which allows full identi…cation of the sharing rule even with private goods. This

line has been followed, for instance, by Bargain et al (2006), Vermeulen et al

(2006) and Lise and Seitz (2011) for labor supply, and by Browning, Chiappori

and Lewbel (2013) for consumption. Recently, Dunbar, Lewbel and Pendakur

(2012, 2014) have extended this approach by showing that, under additional

conditions on either preferences or the sharing rule (the so-called ‘independence

of base’, whereby the fraction of income going to each member does not depend

on total income), the requirements can be relaxed; what is needed is simply that

demand functions should be observed for families of di¤erent composition.

    A second line of research adopts an equilibrium approach. There constraints

on intrahousehold allocations are derived from the equilibrium conditions on the

‘marriage market’. These approaches refer either to frictionless, matching mod-

els (Choo and Siow 2002; Chiappori, Iyigun and Weiss 2009; Chiappori, Salanie

and Weiss 2013; Chiappori, Costa and Meghir 2014) or to a search framework

(Jacquemet and Robin 2013; Goussé 2013). In all these cases, complete identi-

…cation of the sharing rule obtains.



6     Conclusion

In the paper, we propose a systematic view of issues related to welfare within

the household. We argue that any such analysis should be based on the notion

of individual welfare; i.e., it should consider the well-being of each individual


                                       33
within the household. This raises conceptual and empirical di¢ culties. On

the conceptual side, the main issue is to account for the public nature of some

consumptions and for the presence of household production. We suggest that

the concept of Money Metric Welfare Index (MMWI), which can be viewed as

a generalization of the notion of equivalent income, is an adequate response to

these concerns. On the empirical side, while some (and possibly most) individual

consumptions are not observable, recent progress in the collective literature

allows one to actually recover these concepts from data on household behavior

under relatively mild conditions (typically exclusion restrictions for at least one

commodity per agent). All in all, the tools exist for shifting our perspective from

household to individual welfare. We expect future empirical work to follow this

promising direction.
