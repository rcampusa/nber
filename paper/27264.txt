COVID-19 Doesn't Need Lockdowns to Destroy Jobs: The Effect of Local Outbreaks in Korea

                                          ABSTRACT

Unlike most countries, Korea did not implement a lockdown in its battle against COVID-19,
instead successfully relying on testing and contact tracing. Only one region, Daegu-Gyeongbuk
(DG), had a significant number of infections, traced to a religious sect. This allows us to estimate
the causal effect of the outbreak on the labor market using difference-in-differences. We find that
a one per thousand increase in infections causes a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment. Non-
causal estimates of this coefficient from the US and UK, which implemented large-scale
lockdowns, range from 5 to 6 percent, suggesting that at most half of the job losses in the US and
UK can be attributed to lockdowns. We also find that employment losses caused by local
outbreaks in the absence of lockdowns are (i) mainly due to reduced hiring by small
establishments, (ii) concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and
transportation industries, and (iii) worst for the economically vulnerable workers who are less
educated, young, in low-wage occupations, and on temporary contracts, even controlling for
industry effects. All these patterns are similar to what we observe in the US and UK: The unequal
effects of COVID-19 are the same with or without lockdowns. Our finding suggests that the
lifting of lockdowns in the US and UK may lead to only modest recoveries in employment unless
COVID-19 infection rates fall.

          We isolate the economic effect of COVID-19 that operates through the fear
       of infection: The fact that people hunker down and curtail economic activity in
       response to local outbreaks. Our estimate is not contaminated by the concomi-
       tant effect of government-mandated lockdowns or supply and demand shortages
       from outside the economy (such as inter-regional and international trade) due to
       the epidemic. We estimate the effect on overall employment, hires and separa-
       tions, and also examine how the effect is distributed across industries and across
       workers of different occupation, education, age, gender and employment type.
          Our estimation exploits exogenous regional variation in the COVID-19 out-
       break in Korea, as well as the absence of mandatory lockdowns or other social-
       distancing measures imposed by the government.1 South Korea had only 30
       confirmed infections prior to February 18, 2020, when “Patient 31” attended a
       religious gathering of the “Shincheonji” sect in Daegu, a metropolitan city in
       the Gyeongbuk province. By February 29, the number of cases in Korea had
       exploded to 3,150, with 2,724 cases (or 86.4 percent) in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk
       region (DG hereafter) alone. Of these, more than 60 percent were traced to
       Shincheonji. Figure 1 shows the cumulative COVID-19 infections per thousand
       on February 28 and March 15. It is not the case that DG was more susceptible
       to the Shincheonji sect, which has members and churches spread all over Korea.
       Thus, the regional variation in infections is uncorrelated with any underlying
       socioeconomic factor and provides grounds for a natural experiment.2
          Moreover, the Korean government chose intensive testing and contact tracing
       as their tool for containing the epidemic rather than enhanced social distancing,
       and never mandated a lockdown. This resulted in two additional advantages
       of our estimation strategy: (i) The economic reactions were not prescribed by
       the government’s promulgation of what are essential or non-essential economic
       activities, unlike in the vast majority of countries, and (ii) As of May 20, the
       success of its containment strategy resulted in a very low cumulative infection
       rate of 0.06 per thousand in Korea, excluding DG, ensuring that the direct effect
   1
      Another celebrated example of a country not implementing a lockdown is Sweden, and researchers have
tried to infer the economic effect of lockdowns by comparing Sweden with other countries (Andersen et al.,
2020; Born et al., 2020). By design, such studies cannot recover the direct, causal effect of the pandemic
and at best, can only estimate the effect of a lockdown. But even the lockdown effects are still subject to
omitted variable bias and endogeneity—lockdowns are a choice variable for the government, not an exogenous
variation across countries. In addition, Sweden has a much higher cumulative infection rate (3.2 per thousand
as of May 20) than some of the comparison countries (e.g., Denmark, 1.9 per thousand), rendering a simple
comparison of economic outcomes less informative.
    2
      The DG region comprises about 10 percent of South Korea’s total population of 52 million and about 9
percent of national GDP.

      is entirely confined to DG, with a rate of 1.6 per thousand.
          We exploit this setting using difference-in-differences (DiD) on data from an
      establishment survey and a separate household survey. The scheme captures
      the causal effect of the outbreak on local employment relative to the rest of
      the country. The establishment survey further allows a breakdown by industry
      and by establishment size. The household survey further allows a breakdown by
      occupation, education, age, gender and employment type.

      Results Our causal estimate implies that a one per thousand increase in in-
      fections leads to a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment in the absence of
      lockdowns. In comparison, non-causal estimates of this coefficient for the United
      States or United Kingdom, which implemented large-scale lockdowns, range from
      5 to 6 percent, suggesting that about half of their job losses may be due to volun-
      tary reductions in economic activity by private businesses and consumers, rather
      than a consequence of government-mandated lockdowns. Alternatively, at most
      half the job losses in the US and UK can be attributed to lockdowns.
          Employment losses caused by local outbreaks stem mostly from reduced hir-


                                                  3
       ing by businesses and are mirrored by a rise in labor market non-participation
       rather than unemployment. By industry, losses are concentrated in the accom-
       modation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, similar to
       (non-causal) patterns observed in the US and UK.
           The causal effects of the COVID-19 shock without lockdowns are very un-
       equally distributed: More or less all employment losses were accounted for by
       small establishments (fewer than 30 employees), while large establishments ac-
       tually grew. Less-educated workers, the young, workers in low-wage occupations
       and on temporary contracts, and the self-employed lost the most jobs to the
       COVID-19 shock, even controlling for industry effects. In a nutshell, the most
       economically vulnerable groups even before the shock experienced the most dire
       effects. By gender, although the COVID-19 shock hit industries in which women
       are over-represented harder, the within-industry effect was positive for women
       while negative for men. Consequently, the total causal effect destroyed more jobs
       for men than for women.3 All these patterns of causal effects except the effects
       by gender are similar to what we observed in the US and UK: The unequal effects
       of COVID-19 are the same with or without lockdowns.
           Our finding that lockdowns account for at most half the job losses in the US
       and UK suggests that the lifting of lockdowns may lead to only modest recoveries
       in employment absent larger reductions in COVID-19 infection rates.
           Of course, this is not to say that lockdowns are the best policy response. They
       are a very blunt tool and may cause more economic damage than necessary. Using
       a more theoretical approach, Aum et al. (2020) shows that targeted approaches
       can more effectively contain the epidemic at a lower economic cost.


       1     Data
       We use three data sets. The first is the Labor Force Survey at Establishments
       (LFSE), a monthly survey of 40,000 sampled employers (out of 4.1 million in
       2018) by the Ministry of Employment and Labor. It reports the number of
       employees and vacancies as of the last business day of the month, as well as
       the number of new hires and separations for the month. The second is the
       Economically Active Population Survey (EAPS), a monthly survey of 35,000
       households collected around the 15th of each month by Statistics Korea, which
   3
    Nationwide, the drop in women’s employment was larger than men’s in Korea as well, even in the absence
of a lockdown.

       includes worker characteristics (education, age, gender) and jobs (occupation and
       employment type).4 The last is the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over
       time published by the Korea Centers for Disease Control (KCDC).

       2     Methodology and Estimation Results
       The DiD scheme we use requires treatment to be exogenous to outcomes, and
       a parallel trends assumption to hold between comparison groups pre-treatment.
       In our case, the treatment is DG having experienced a major outbreak, which
       was traced to local Shincheonji gatherings. Shincheonji is a popular yet secretive
       religious sect, but from what we know, has more than 200,000 members spread
       out across Korea regardless of each region’s economic standing. If anything, the
       DG region has less followers per capita than other regions. Thus, the epidemic
       variation can be considered exogenous.
           Economically, DG’s share of national GDP and employment has been stable
       for at least the last three years, as well as its share of international trade. In any
   4
   Respondents’ region is not available in the public-use microdata, but Statistics Korea provides detailed
summary tables by province.

case, Korean exports and imports were in fact higher in February to March 2020
than the monthly average throughout 2019, so it is unlikely that our results are
driven by international factors, especially the contraction of the Chinese economy.
Moreover, to alleviate concerns that differences in industrial or demographic
composition across regions may introduce nonparallel pre-trends, and also to
disaggregate COVID-19’s causal effects, our cross-regional analysis is performed
not only on the entire sample for each of our data sources, but also by industry
and by demographic group.
   We present three sets of estimates using DiD, using LFSE data as of February
28 and March 31, and EAPS data as of March 15. Since the Korean government
closed schools on March 2 and commenced social distancing campaigns on March
22, later estimates may be biased; that is, both labor market outcomes and the
spread of the epidemic are endogenous to government policy. Nonetheless, at
no point did the government suggest the possibility of a lockdown, so all our
estimates are free of potentially large-scale disruptions.

2.1    Establishment-side employment data (LFSE)
We first focus on the LFSE data as of February 28, nine days after the Shincheonji
outbreak. At this point, the Korean government is yet to implement any social
distancing measures, instead relying exclusively on contact tracing, testing, and
quarantine of the confirmed infected. Given the exogenous regional variation in
confirmed infections and the timing of the survey, we estimate the causal effect
of the outbreak on the labor market using the following DiD specification:

       i
      yr,t = β0i + β1i · Dr (DG) + β2i · Dt (Feb) + γ i · Dr (DG) · Dt (Feb) + εir,t ,   (1)

       i
where yr,t is the variable of interest for industry i, region r at month t, Dr (DG)
is a dummy variable that equals 1 if r =DG and 0 otherwise, and Dt (Feb) equals
1 if t is February 2020 or later months, and 0 otherwise. The primary coefficient
of interest is the DiD term γ i , designed to capture the effect on the DG region,
which was the lone hot spot. In some cases, we will compare γ i with β2i , the effect
of the epidemic on the country as a whole, which we cannot interpret as causal
but is still informative as it is uncontaminated by government-led lockdowns.
   We report estimation results for employment growth from January to Febru-
ary and from January to March in Table 1. We estimate the regression coefficients
for the whole sample and also separately for the 18 different industries that span

    our data. The industry composition varies across regions and may introduce het-
    erogeneous pre-trends, but the industry-by-industry estimation alleviates such
    concerns.
        The first row shows the effect of the incipient COVID-19 epidemic on over-
    all employment. Between the end of January and the end of February (from 11
    confirmed cases to 3,150 nationwide), employment fell by 0.89 percent (not annu-
    alized) in Korea, shown by the estimate of β2 . To put this number in perspective,
    employment grew by an average of 0.23 percent per month (not annualized) from
    Jan 2018 to Jan 2020, and there is only negligible seasonality. Although causality
    cannot be established, it strongly suggests the effect of the incipient epidemic on
    the entire Korean economy. The effect was much stronger for DG, which ac-
    counted for 86.5 percent of the 3,150 total confirmed cases (there were no case
    in DG as of January 31). The estimated γ shows that employment in DG fell at
    more than double the rate for the entire country, by 1.91 (0.89 plus 1.02) percent




                                                   7
      in a month.5 The estimate of γ is the direct causal effect of the local epidemic
      on local employment, given the exogenous nature of the variation in confirmed
      infections by region.
          Table 1 shows that the effects differ across industries, sorted in ascending
      order of average wage. Not surprisingly, accommodations/food service industries
      were hit hardest, not only nationwide (-5.7 percent), but especially in DG (-15.2
      percent), as people avoided contact-intensive services. They also happen to be
      the lowest-paying industry. Employment in education industries, which does not
      include public school teachers, also saw a large drop (2.4 percent nationwide
      and 5.7 percent in DG). Employment in arts/sports/recreation fell substantially
      nationwide (2 percent) but there was no additional effect from local infections.
      On the other hand, real estate shows a significant negative causal effect, although
      its employment went up weakly nationwide.
          The right panel of Table 1 shows the cumulative employment effect from the
      end of January to the end of March (9,569 cases nationwide, 83.4 percent in DG)
      from a regression of bimonthly data. Employment fell by 2.1 percent nation-
      wide over two months (not annualized) and by 3.3 percent in DG. The Korean
      government delayed the start of the school year on March 2 and implemented
      enhanced social distancing measures on March 22, both at the national level. As
      a result, the estimated β2 partly reflects the effect of government policies and
      the γ estimate is likely biased downward. The estimates of the causal effect of
      the local outbreak γ are similar to those in the left panel, with accommoda-
      tion/food services showing the largest additional employment decrease in DG.
      Wholesale/retail, health/social services, transportation/storage industries show
      a significant additional drop in DG in March (1.8, 3.4 and 3.2 percent, respec-
      tively), much more so than in February, suggesting a delayed impact. On the
      other hand, the differential effect on education industries in DG disappear in
      March, which is not surprising given the nationwide delay of the school year.
          To unpack the decline in employment, we estimate equation (1) with three
      alternative dependent variables: the monthly number of hires, separations and
      vacancies, all as a percentage of the previous month’s employment. Table 2 shows
      that the February employment drop in DG caused by the outbreak is entirely
      driven by decreased hiring and not by increased separations (layoffs and quits).
   5
     Regional LFSE data are available only from January 2018, implying that γ compares 25 monthly obser-
vations with one (January 2018 to January 2020 vs. February 2020). This is a small sample, especially post
COVID-19, but most of our estimates are still highly significant.

        The top row of Table 3 shows that the causal effect of the local outbreak
    disproportionately affected small establishments (fewer than 30 employees) while
    if anything large establishments (300 or more employees) increased employment
    (first row) between January and February in DG. This result is partly driven by
    industrial composition: Most establishments in accommodation/food services,
    the industry hardest hit, are small. However, even within industries, small
    establishments lost employment by more than large establishments, especially
    in accommodation/food services and education, the two industries showing the
    largest causal impact in Table 1. In fact, in transportation/storage and informa-
    tion/communication industries, large establishments increased employment sig-
    nificantly in response to the local outbreak. The lone exception is the real estate
    industry, where the negative effect was concentrated among large establishments.

      2.2     Household survey data (EAPS)
      We now turn to our estimates from EAPS, the household survey that provides
      more worker-side information. We still use the estimation equation (1), but now
      i indexes a demographic group and the time dummy is Dt (Mar), because the
      first post-Shincheonji survey was as of March 15. This is one week before the
      launching of the social distancing advisory campaign, but after the decision to
      delay the beginning of the school year on March 2.
         Table 4 shows that employment fell by 0.6 percent nationwide and by 3.2
      (0.64 plus 2.53) percent in DG between February 15 and March 15 (not an-
      nualized). These numbers are not directly comparable to the February LFSE
      estimates (0.89 and 1.91), because of the newly confirmed infections between
      February 28 (the LFSE survey date) and March 15, and also because EAPS in-
      cludes the self-employed, not included in the LFSE.6 One noteworthy result is
      that the fall in employment did not manifest as a rise in unemployment, either
      nationwide or in DG. People who left employment instead reported themselves
      as non-participants. One possible explanation is that they are waiting out the
      epidemic rather than searching for jobs in the midst of it. Alternatively, they
      may be expecting to return to their previous job and are thus not searching for
      jobs, such as if they were furloughed.7
         Table 5 shows the nationwide change in employment, β2 , and the causal
      effect of DG’s outbreak on local employment, γ, by occupation, educational
      attainment, gender, age and employment type. We focus on the causal effect
      of local outbreaks, γ. The first panel, which stratifies the labor force by one-digit
   6
     EAPS definition of “self-employed” is non-employers with zero employees, who are not covered by the
establishment survey of employers.
   7
     While private furloughs exist, the Korean government did not implement any public furlough schemes
that some of their European counterparts did.



                                                  10
       occupations, shows that service, sales, and craft workers were hit the hardest by
       the outbreak in DG. In contrast, the number of managers actually increased by
       more than 7 percent. The next two panels show that by education, less educated
       workers lost disproportionately more jobs, while by gender, the direct causal effect
       was larger for men (-2.8 vs. -2.2 percent).8 By age, the causal effect is largest for
       younger workers (those in their twenties or younger), followed distantly by those
       in their forties and those aged 60 or older. Finally, by employment type, job
       losses were heavily concentrated among temporary workers and unpaid family
       workers, although self-employment also fell by 2.3 percent. The overall pattern
       that emerges from Table 5 is that workers of lower socioeconomic status were
       much more vulnerable to the local outbreak.
         But are the unequal employment effects across different worker groups driven
       by industrial composition? That is, do the effects differ solely because certain
       types of workers are over-represented in industries more exposed to the COVID-
       19 shock? We answer this question by decomposing the causal employment effect
       of a given demographic group, γ, into an industry component (that differs only
       between industries) and a group-specific component (that varies within indus-
       tries). A potential problem is that the EAPS only provides data by industry or
       by region, but not by industry-and-region. We sidestep this issue by computing
       what the effect on each group’s employment would have been if a shock to an
       industry in DG, estimated off LFSE in Table 1, equally affected all demographic
       groups within it, which is the industry-specific effect.9 Then for each demographic
       group, the between-industry effect is computed as the average of industry-specific
       effects using as weights each group’s nationwide employment share by industry in
       February, only available from EAPS, times employment share by industry for all
       workers in DG in January, only available from LFSE. The difference between the
       actual effect in Table 5 and this between-industry effect is the within-industry
       or group-specific effect.10 Figure 3 shows the total effect and the within-industry
       effect on the employment of worker groups. We focus on the causal effect of local
       outbreaks γ on the right panel.
          By occupation, the positive employment effect on managers is entirely an
       occupation-specific phenomenon—if anything, the hardest hit industries had
   8
     But nationwide, the drop in women’s employment was larger (-1.4 vs. -0.1 percent).
   9
     As discussed earlier, the magnitude of γ for all workers is larger in EAPS than in LFSE. Thus we also
rescale LFSE’s industry-specific γ i ’s by the ratio between the EAPS and LFSE estimates for all workers.
  10
     We do a similar exercise for the nationwide estimate β2 as well, for which we encounter no such data
problem since EAPS reports employment of each demographic group by industry.

more managers than other industries (i.e., a negative between-industry effect on
manager employment). Similarly, the industry effect alone would have cut ser-
vice worker employment by more than 10 percent, but it was partly offset by a
positive occupation-specific effect on service workers. Sales workers, on the other
hand, were negatively affected by both the industry effect and the occupation-
specific effect. That is, industries with larger drops in employment had relatively
more sales workers, and at the same time, the local outbreak disproportionately
destroyed more sales jobs, even within industries.
    By gender, comparing the light bars, we see that industries that were nega-
tively hit had a larger presence of women than men. However, the within-industry
effect is actually positive for women while negative for men, leading to our earlier
observation that the causal effect of the outbreak destroyed men’s jobs more than
women’s.
    Next, the figure shows that younger workers were not only more likely to work
in industries that experienced larger employment losses, but also more exposed
to the COVID-19 shock regardless of the industry in which they worked. For
those 60 or older, the causal effect on their employment turns out to be almost
entirely accounted for by the between-industry effect.
   Finally, the large drop in the employment of temporary workers and unpaid
family workers caused by the local outbreaks are nearly evenly divided into the
between- and the within-industry effects. Not only did such workers tend to be
employed in vulnerable industries, but they also faced similar disadvantages even
within a given industry.
   In summary, this decomposition exercise shows that the large employment
losses experienced by the less educated, young workers and temporary work-
ers were not only caused by their larger presence in industries hit harder by
the COVID-19 shock. In addition, while women were over-represented in more
vulnerable industries, the within-industry effect was such that men were more
exposed to a causal drop in employment from local outbreaks.


3     Fear of COVID-19 vs. Lockdowns
3.1    Impact on total employment
Our estimate of the causal effect parameter γ allows us to calculate how many
jobs are destroyed solely due to private responses to incremental COVID-19
infections in the absence of mandatory lockdowns. The cleanest estimate of

                                        14
       γ is -1.02, reported in Table 1 from the February LFSE, the establishment-side
       survey. Cumulative infection rates through February 28 were 0.39 per thousand
       in DG and less than 0.01 per thousand nationwide, excluding DG. Linearly
       extrapolating from our γ estimate, we find that a one per thousand increase in
       infections causes a 2.68 percent drop in employment.11 Using our estimate from
       the March EAPS, the household survey, we find that a one per thousand increase
       in infections causes a 1.85 percent drop in employment.12 This is somewhat
       smaller than the calculation based on the February LFSE, possibly because the
       nationwide delay of the school year on March 2 biases the estimated causal effect
       downward.
         These numbers based on our causal estimate, free of any contamination from
       mandatory lockdown effects, can be compared to observed labor market out-
       comes in the United States and the United Kingdom. Relative to Korea, both
       countries experienced very high infection counts with country-wide outbreaks,
       and implemented large-scale lockdowns in response.13 Since both countries im-
       plemented lockdowns almost at the same time as confirmed cases began to spiral
       upward, it is not possible to estimate a causal effect such as our γ. So we instead
       compute their counterparts to the overall effect β2 . In the US, Cajner et al.
       (2020) report a 14-percent decline in active employment between February 15
       and April 18, 2020, using ADP payroll data. The cumulative infection count for
       the US on April 18 was 738,913, or 2.3 per thousand, implying that a one per
       thousand increase in infection counts is associated with a 6.2-percent decline in
       employment, a little more than double our causal estimate from Korea. Another
       estimate of employment losses in the US comes from Tedeschi and Bui (2020),
       who report a 12-percent employment decline between March 1 and April 18 from
       Civis Analytics. This implies that a one per thousand increase in infection counts
       is associated with a 5.3-percent decline in employment, a number between our
       causal estimate and the one implied from the ADP data. For the UK, Gardiner
  11
     The cumulative infection rates through March 31 were 1.56 per thousand in DG and 0.034 per thousand
nationwide, excluding DG. Linearly extrapolating from the γ estimate, a one per thousand increase in
infections causes a 0.8 percent drop in employment. The March 31 effect is smaller than February 28’s
partly because the nationwide policies in March attenuated the causal effect of local outbreaks.
  12
     Cumulative infection rates through March 15 were 1.4 per thousand in DG and 0.02 per thousand
nationwide, excluding DG.
  13
     In the US, lockdown decisions were made by local governments. Forty-two states issued stay-at-home
orders of varying degrees of intensity. Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma,
Utah, and Wyoming never issued state-wide orders, but some of their cities still implemented localized
lockdowns. The UK mandated a nation-wide lockdown, but each country had some discretion on when to
ease restrictions.



                                                  15
       and Slaughter (2020) estimate that employment fell by 19 percent (15 percent
       furloughed plus 4 percent unemployed) based on data collected between May 6
       to 11. The cumulative infection count on May 10 was 3.2 per thousand, im-
       plying that a one per thousand increase in infection counts is associated with a
       5.9-percent decline in employment.
          The three calculations from the US and the UK yield three estimates that
       are strikingly close to one another, and they are roughly double the relationship
       between employment and infection counts implied by our causal estimate with-
       out lockdowns. Thus, our results show that even without lockdowns, infection
       counts alone would have caused employment losses half as large. Furthermore,
       lockdowns are implemented to contain the epidemic. Suppose that infection
       counts would have reached twice the levels we observed in those countries had
       they not implemented any lockdown.14 Then our causal estimate implies that
       the resulting employment losses in the absence of lockdowns would have been
       even larger than currently observed employment losses in the US and the UK.

       3.2     Impact across industries and demographic groups
       Government implementation of lockdowns specify which activities are essential
       and non-essential. As a result, any negative employment effects from a lockdown
       would be heterogeneous across industries by design, and to the extent that the
       demographic composition of workers differ across industries, the effects would
       also be heterogeneous across demographic groups.
          We compare the pattern of the causal employment effects from local out-
       breaks without lockdowns (Tables 1, 3, 5 and Figure 3) with national patterns
       with lockdowns in the US reported by Cajner et al. (2020). First, with or with-
       out lockdowns, nearly the same set of industries are hit hardest by the epidemic,
       including accommodation/food services, real estate, transportation/storage and
       education. One exception is arts/sports/recreation, which fell significantly na-
       tionwide in both Korea and the US, but the causal effect (estimated from regional
       differences) is insignificant. Second, in both cases, small establishments are hit
       hardest, controlling for industry effects. Third, nearly the same sets of work-
       ers are disproportionately affected with or without lockdowns: low-skill workers,
       young workers, and those on temporary contracts.15 Finally, in both cases, the
  14
     By all accounts, this is a lower-bound of counterfactual infection counts had no control measures been
put in place in those countries, e.g. https://covid19.healthdata.org.
  15
     Coibion et al. (2020) also report this last fact for the US, and the UK data also shows the same pattern



                                                     16
      heterogeneous effects across workers are accounted for by both between-industry
      effects and within-industry effects. One difference is the effect by gender. As
      shown in Figure 3, the between-industry causal effect is larger for women, but
      the within-industry effect is larger for men so that male workers lose more jobs.
      In the US, largely due to the between-industry effect, female employment falls
      by more, as well in the UK.16


      4     Concluding Remarks
      We estimate the causal effect of COVID-19 infections on the labor market, ex-
      ploiting regional variations in Korea. Our difference-in-differences estimate is
      uncontaminated by lockdowns, which were never pursued by the Korean gov-
      ernment, capturing only the voluntary response by private businesses and con-
      sumers. Moreover, thanks to a successful test/trace/tracking strategy, total infec-
      tion counts remained low in Korea and the epidemic was by and large contained
      to a single region, DG, which experienced a local outbreak triggered by reasons
      exogenous to any underlying economic factor.
          Our main result that a one per thousand increase in confirmed infections
      causes a 2.7-percent decline in employment is about half the magnitude of non-
      causal estimates from the US or UK, which confound the direct effects from
      COVID-19 with lockdown effects. Moreover, the causal patterns we obtain across
      industries, establishment size classes, and workers’ occupation, education, age
      and employment type tell us that the epidemic struck high-contact industries,
      small establishments, and workers of lower socioeconomic status the hardest. The
      causal patterns are very much in line with descriptive evidence from the US and
      UK as well. This suggests that the primary culprit of the COVID-19 recession is
      COVID-19 itself, rather than lockdowns, so that the lifting of lockdowns around
      the world may lead to only modest recoveries unless the infection rates fall. The
      best way to revive the labor market is to eradicate the virus.

     However, our nationwide estimate of β2 shows that women lost more jobs than men in Korea, and that
within-industry effects are much more positive for men than women.
