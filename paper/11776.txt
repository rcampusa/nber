A Century of Housing Shelter Prices: Is There a Downward Bias in the CPI?

                                           ABSTRACT

        Tenant rental shelter is by far the most important component of the CPI, because it is used
as a proxy for owner-occupied housing. This paper develops a wide variety of current and historical
evidence dating back to 1914 to demonstrate that the CPI rent index is biased downward for all of
the last century. The CPI rises roughly 2 percent per year slower than quality-unadjusted indexes of
gross rent, setting a challenge for this research of measuring the rate of quality change in rental
apartments. If quality increased at a rate of 2 percent per year, the CPI was not biased downward at
all, but if quality increased at a slower rate of 1 percent per year, then the CPI was biased downward
at a rate of 1 percent.
        Our analysis of a rich set of data sources goes backward chronologically, starting with a
hedonic regression analysis on a large set of panel data from the American Housing Survey (AHS)
covering 1975-2003. Prior to 1975, we have large micro data files from the U. S. Census of Housing
extending back to 1930. In addition to the hedonic regression data, we stitch together data on the
diffusion of important quality attributes of rental units, including plumbing, heating, and
electrification, over the period 1918-73. Our final piece of evidence is based on a study of quality-
adjusted rents in a single local community, Evanston IL, covering the period 1925-99.
        Our overall conclusions are surprisingly consistent across sources and eras, that the CPI bias
was roughly -1.0 percent prior to the methodological improvements in the CPI that date from the
mid-1980s. Our reliance on a wide variety of methodologies and evidence on types of quality change
and their importance, while leaving the outcome still uncertain, at least in our view substantially
narrows the range of possibilities regarding the history of CPI bias for rental shelter over the
twentieth century.

Introduction

       This paper develops new price indexes from a variety of sources to assess the

hypothesis that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for rental shelter housing has been

biased downward for its entire history since 1914. Rental shelter housing is the most

important single category of the CPI, especially for those years when rent data have

been used to impute price changes for owner-occupied housing. If valid, the

implications of the hypothesis of downward bias would carry over to the deflator for

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) and, in the opposite direction, to historical

measures of real PCE and real GDP.1

       The high-water mark of widespread belief in the pervasiveness of upward bias in

the Consumer Price Index (CPI) may have been reached on December 4, 1996, the day

on which the Boskin Commission Report was released on Capital Hill in front of rows

of television cameras and reporters.2 Since then the Boskin conclusion has been

tempered in at least three directions. First, the report itself was criticized for overstating

the extent of upward quality-change bias for several products including the subject of

this paper, rental shelter prices (Moulton-Moses, 1997). Second, the report appeared in

a period of rapid improvement in the CPI, particularly in its treatment of substitution


1 Before 1983 the CPI employed its own idiosyncratic method for owner-occupied housing,

while the PCE and GDP deflators used the CPI rental shelter index as the deflator for imputed
rent on owner-occupied housing.
2 The Boskin conclusion was that, as of 1995-96, the CPI was biased upward at a rate of 1.1

percent per year. Implicit in the report is the conclusion that prior to 1993 back to some
unspecified date the bias rate was 1.4 percent per year. The Boskin Commission Report is
listed in the references as Boskin et. al. (1996).
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 2


bias, so that the current CPI is substantially less vulnerable to some of the Boskin

Report’s criticisms. Third, there is increasing recognition that the Boskin results, which

explicitly referred to the situation as of 1995-96, may not be applicable to previous

historical periods.

The Logical Case for Downward Bias

       For historical analysis a basic point on the direction and magnitude of bias was

made by Chuck Hulten (1997) in his discussion of William Nordhaus’ (1997) seminal

paper on the history of the price of light. Hulten’s point is general and transcends the

Boskin report or any particular source of estimates of upward CPI bias, because it

implies that CPI (linked to pre-1914 indexes developed by economic historians) could

not logically have been upward biased by a significant amount over as long as two

centuries. If the CPI had been biased upward by, say, 1.4 percent per year since 1800, as

Nordhaus had speculated, then the implied standard of living of U. S. households in the

year 1800, Hulten argued, would have been implausibly low. Picking up Hulten’s

theme, and using the hypothetical upward bias rate of 1.4 percent per year, Gordon

(2004) calculated that the median household in 1800 would have been able to buy only

1.3 pounds of potatoes per day, with nothing left over for clothing, shelter, or anything

else. Extending the point back to the happy, well-fed and clothed Dutch burghers

depicted in the paintings of Pieter Bruegel the elder (1525-1569), the Nordhaus 1.4
                                                               A Century of Rents, Page 3


percent bias would imply the purchase of only 0.8 ounces of potatoes per day, with

nothing left over for apparel, shelter, or anything else.

       Thus there is a logical case that, if there has been an upward bias in the CPI in

recent decades, it must flatten out or even become negative before some point back into

the depths of history. If we make the plausible assumption that the CPI for durable

goods are upward biased for the entire twentieth century, as Gordon (1990) showed for

the period 1947-83, then some other major component of the CPI must have been

downward biased. This paper assesses the extent of a downward bias for rental shelter

housing, and a companion paper (Gordon, 2004) examines new evidence showing a

downward bias for apparel.3 This set of research results finding upward bias for some

products and downward bias for others echoes Jack Triplett’s perceptive suggestion

more than three decades ago (1971) that the overall CPI bias could go either way

because the bias has different signs for different products.

Circumstantial Evidence of Downward Bias

    We can compare the change in the CPI for shelter rent between the mid 1920s and

the late 1990s with scattered pieces of evidence on rents and house prices. The large

discrepancies revealed here could occur because of unmeasured CPI bias, unmeasured

quality change, and/or differences in the evolution over time of shelter rent and house



3 This line of research awaits a study of the history of food prices, which is needed to complete
the trilogy of necessities, food, clothing, and shelter, which together accounted for 79 percent of
household expenditure for wage earners in 1918 (Brown, Table 3.9, p. 78).
                                                               A Century of Rents, Page 4


prices. Subsequent sections of the paper deal with quality change explicitly, using both

formal hedonic regression analysis and a more informal assessment based on scattered

quantitative data.

    The ratio of the 1999 to 1925 value of the CPI for rental shelter is 177.5/34.6 on a base

of 1982-84 = 100, that is, a ratio of 5.1.4 The ratio for nominal gross rent per rental unit

for the same years is 19.6 (see Table 1 below). The 1999-to-1925 ratio for the median

price of existing single-family houses in Washington, D. C. is 22.5.5 Amazingly close is

the ratio for the same two years of nominal net residential capital stock per housing

unit, 22.1.6 These alternative indexes are all unadjusted for either inflation or quality

change.

       Brown’s (1994) detailed study of household expenditure patterns allows us to

narrow the comparison to a particular type of household, the “wage earner” and the

“salaried worker.” Here data can be used to compare 1988 with 1918, for which the CPI

ratio is 5.9. The Brown data have the advantage that they refer to owners and tenants

separately and to rent and utilities expenditures separately. For wage earners, the 1988-

5 For 1925 the median asking price of existing homes in Washington DC was $7809, Historical
Statistics, series N149. For 1999 the median price was $176,500, Statistical Abstract (2000),
Table 1202, p. 716.
6 For 1925 the value of net residential wealth consisted of $51.1 billion of structures (excluding

land), or an average of $2,621 per each of 19.5 million dwelling units, from Historical Statistics,
series N133. For 1998 the value was $9,405 billion, or an average of $81,783 for each of
roughly 115 million units, Statistical Abstract (2000), Table 1222, p. 726
                                                              A Century of Rents, Page 5


to-1918 ratio for rent excluding utilities is 29.1 and for rent including utilities is 25.4.

For salaried workers, the ratio excluding fuel is 26.6 and including fuel is 22.9.7

       For the 1999 to 1925 comparison, a ratio of 22 translates into an annual growth

rate of 4.18 percent per year, while the CPI ratio of 5.1 translates into 2.20 percent per

year, for a difference of 1.98 percent per year. This difference in growth rates overstates

the amount of potential downward CPI bias by the annual growth rate in quality over

the same interval. Here, the similarity of the rental and house price ratios is somewhat

puzzling, since we would expect that the quality of owner-occupied houses has

increased substantially more than that of rental apartments. For instance, there has not

been any appreciable increase in the size of apartments; the number of rooms in units

rented by wage earners was 4.9 in 1918 and by all renters was 4.3 in 1988.8

Why Rental Shelter Prices Represent an Appealing Research Topic

       One can compile a long list of reasons to place priority on research into the

historical behavior of rental shelter prices, beyond the first factor, the circumstantial

evidence reviewed above implying that the CPI may incorporate a substantial

downward bias over a long period of time. Second, rental shelter carries by far the

largest weight in the CPI, especially when one recognizes that owner-occupied housing


7 For 1988 Brown (1994, Table 3.6A, p. 62) lists annual per-household expenditures on “rent”

and “fuel and light” separately for each earner type. Table 7.8A, pp. 392-3, lists “tenant rent”
and Table 7.9, p. 398 lists “Renter fuel” and “Renter utilities”. For 1918, see Brown (1994,
Table 3.6A, p. 62).
8 Rooms per apartment for 1918 come from Brown (1994, Table 3.6A, p. 62). For 1988, we

take the average of the mean values for 1987 and 1989 from the American Housing Survey
data summarized in Table 2 below.
                                                              A Century of Rents, Page 6


prices are proxied by the rental shelter index with a different set of weights. Third,

rental units are less heterogenous in size at any given time, are more homogeneous over

time, and experience quality change along fewer dimensions than owner-occupied

housing units.9 Fourth, price changes on rental units are more homogeneous across

space than for owner-occupied units.10      Fifth, discussion of tenant rent is conceptually

simpler than for owner-occupied housing, where issues of the effect of tax-deductible

mortgages and capital gains are central to changes in the true user cost. Rent is not tax-

deductible and generates no capital gains. If changes in tax laws or capital gains affect

the incentives of landlords to supply apartments, this would be reflected (perhaps after

a long lag) in the cost of rental as measured by the CPI and any other alternative price

index.

         Because of the importance of rental shelter prices in the CPI, any finding of a

significant downward bias over a long period of time would have implications for the

history of inflation, economic growth and productivity change. Findings that the


9 In 2001 80 percent of rental units had between 3 and 5 rooms, whereas only 35 percent of
owner-occupied units fell in this range. Fully 20 percent of owner-occupied units were in the
top-end category of 8+ rooms, whereas only 2 percent of rental units fell into this top category.
See Statistical Abstract 2002, Table 937, p. 599. Over time, between 1960 and 2001 the
average number of rooms per owner-occupied unit rose from 5.2 to 6.2, while the average
number of rooms per rental unit increased only one-third as much, from 4.0 to 4.3 rooms.
These are weighted averages of size distributions given in Statistical Abstract 1962, Table 1353,
p. 753, and Statistical Abstract 2002, Table 937, p. 599. The comment about dimensions of
quality change is discussed further below.
10 The startling dichotomy between selling prices of homes in coastal “glamour” cities compared

to the rest of the U. S. is emphasized in Case and Shiller (2003). They contrast Boston, with a
9.1 percent annual rate of price increase during 1995-2002, with the mere 5.1 percent rate of
increase in Milwaukee. For rental units, however, the differential is miniscule, admittedly over
a different period of 1988-97, with annual growth rates of rents of 3.3 percent for Milwaukee
and 3.0 percent for Boston, see Goodman (2003, Exhibit 1).

degree of bias differed across historical decades would imply accelerations or

decelerations in economic growth that might be different than in the current official

data.   Evidence developed in this paper would need to be weighed against evidence of

upward bias in some other categories, especially consumer durable goods, before a final

verdict on the implications of historical CPI bias could be rendered.

Contributions of this Paper

        There are relatively few papers that study rental shelter prices using data

external to the CPI, as contrasted to those studies that have examined behavior using

the CPI data sample, e.g., Randolph (1988). No paper covers our long historical period

going back to 1914. Our paper is complementary to the recent pair of papers by Crone,

Nakamura, and Voith (hereafter CNV, 2003a, 2003b) and shares with CNV (2003b) the

development of hedonic price indexes for rental shelter based on data from the

American Housing Survey (AHS) for the period after 1975, ending in 1999 for CNV and

in 2003 for this study. However, our research strategy differs from that of CNV, who

(2003b) are primarily interested in issues of functional form, whereas we are mainly

interested in quality change. Since there is much more quantitative information on

quality change available after 1975 than before, and even more after 1985 than before,

we take advantage of the data richness of the past quarter-century to measure the rate

of quality change and its determinants. This then allows us to apply these rates of
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 8


quality change based on good data to earlier periods when we have much less detailed

evidence on some crude quality indicators (e.g., number of rooms) but not many others.

      For the period 1930-75 ours is the first published study to provide quantitative

estimates of rental price and quality change, building on an unpublished dissertation by

Weston (1972). We bridge the data gap between the end of Weston’s data in 1970 and

the beginning of the AHS data in 1975 by estimating hedonic regression equations from

micro Census of Housing data for the four years 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. Our results

are complementary to the pre-1975 bias estimates of CNV (2003a), which unlike ours are

not based on actual rental data but rather on a theoretical model of how particular

deficiencies in CPI methodology translate into price index bias.

      Three types of data allow us to push the results back before 1930. First, we use

the budget studies in Brown (1994) to create indexes of rent paid per room by different

classes of tenants; this allows us to link rent per room in 1918 with selected subsequent

years extending up to 1988. We also develop an informal analysis of quality change

from comments and data in the Brown book. Second, we compile an alternative set of

data on rent per household and per room from early NBER studies of national income

and wealth, especially Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956), allowing us to go back to

1914 and before. Third, we report on alternative rental price indexes developed by

Mandelkern and Gordon (2001) for Evanston IL covering the period 1925-99, based on
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 9


newspaper listings, and in some cases tracking rent changes for apartments having the

same street address.

      In our final analysis, we are skeptical of any mechanical attempt to adjust for

quality change. By the time the AHS data (used in our and the CNV regression

analyses) began in 1975, every apartment had central heating, a refrigerator, and a

stove. Thus no hedonic regression analysis can estimate the value of these quality

attributes. Yet we can go beyond the implicit estimates of quality change in hedonic

regression analysis by conjecturing the value of converting the average American rental

tenant from the typical 1918 apartment to the typical 1975 (or 2003) apartment. This

analysis is analogous to the problem of quantifying the value of new durable goods.

The extent of quality change over the twentieth century was not trivial and significantly

reduces the magnitude of downward CPI bias.



Comparing the CPI with Gross Rents over a Near-Century

      Table 1 provides our first systematic look at the data. The CPI for rental shelter

is available continuously for each year from 1913, and column (1) displays the CPI for

each year when we have another index to compare to the CPI. Column (2) displays the

implicit rent calculated from data in Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (hereafter GBW, 1956).

While based on aggregate data, this source implies an average monthly rent of $19.23 in
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 10


1914, which is not far from the $20.67 for 1918 reported in column (7) from Brown’s

(1994) research based on the Consumer Expenditure Survey.

       The next four columns are based on official government sources. The “Weston”

column (3) extracts mean rent from the Census of Housing for 1930 to 1970.11      The next

column (4) labeled “CNV Median Gross Rent” combines Census data through 1970 with

AHS data beginning in 1977. The subsequent column (5) exhibits mean contract rent

from the Census microdata files, and then in column (6) comes the mean contract rent

from the American Housing Survey data. Any differences between the CNV, Census,

and AHS columns reflect the distinction between the median used by CNV and the

mean values used in our calculations from the original government sources. Column

(7) extracts from Brown’s (1994) budget data the monthly cost of rent for “salaried

workers” over the five years that she examines.

       The index numbers in the top section of Table 1 are translated into growth rates

in the bottom section. Columns (8) and (9) in the bottom section show one or two

differences between the growth rate of the CPI over a particular interval minus the

growth rate of the alternative index displayed in that column in the top part of the table.

All eight of the growth rate comparisons show that the CPI grew slower than the

comparison index, except for the CNV version of the AHS index over the period 1985-

95. From 1914 to 1985, most of the alternative indexes of mean or median rent grow

11The Census of Housing began in 1940, but Weston was able to infer similar data from the
1930 Census of Population.
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 11


about 2 percent per year faster than the CPI, and this is true of the GBW and Brown

indexes that cover the pre-1935 period. Over 1930-70, the difference with the Weston-

based data from the U. S. Census of Housing is also quite large, -2.12 percent per year,

and this is identical to the difference with the CNV-calculated median contract rent

from the same Census of Housing data. The next line for 1960-90 displays a difference

between the CPI and Census of Housing mean rent at an annual rate of -2.03 percent,

almost the same as the 1930-70 difference. Finally, the next line for 1973-88 displays the

largest difference, that between the CPI and the Brown budget data of -3.10 percent per

year.

        The final three lines exhibit differences between the growth rates of the CPI and

the AHS data, both as calculated by CNV and in our study. In our calculation (column

9) the difference in growth rates between the CPI and the AHS mean rent shrinks

slowly from -1.68 percent per year in 1977-85 to -1.08 percent per year in 1985-95 to -0.73

percent per year in 1995-2003, whereas in the CNV calculation (column 8) the difference

starts higher and ends lower. These “differences” do not, of course, provide any

evidence of bias in the CPI, since in principle the differences could be explained by

quality change. Subsequently we shall estimate hedonic price indexes for the 1975-2003

period that take account of those aspects of quality change that correspond to quality

characteristics reported in the AHS data.

       If we were to conjecture that quality change advanced at a steady pace over the

twentieth century, then the differences reported in the bottom section of Table 1 are

intriguing. The differences were close to two percent per year over most of the period

after 1930 and before 1989. The difference was minor during 1914-30 in the first line

and was relatively small for 1995-2001 in the last line. Obviously, a conclusion that

quality change proceeded at a rate of two percent per year would explain the

differences displayed in the bottom of Table 1 and reject the hypothesis that the CPI for

rental shelter is downward biased over the past century. A conclusion that quality

change proceeded at a rate significantly slower than two percent per year, e.g., 1.0 or 0.5

percent per year, would support the hypothesis that the CPI is downward biased by the

difference shown at the bottom of Table 1 and the calculated rate of quality

improvement.

       The differences shown in the bottom section of Table 1 are displayed in graphical

form in Figure 1. Each horizontal line plots the difference between the annual growth

rate of the CPI compared to one of the alternative historical sources on the growth rate

of mean or median rent. The lines center around -2.0 percent, except for the Brown

budget study data after 1973, and the AHS data after 1985. Since improvements in the

measurement methodology in the CPI took place after 1985, the shrinking difference

with the AHS data is not surprising. We look at the other data sources in separate

sections of the paper below, working backwards chronologically in time.

Conceptual Issues in the Development of Rental Price Indexes

       For many years owner occupancy has been the primary form of housing demand

in the United States, in contrast to the early twentieth century when only about one-

quarter of American households were home owners.12 Accordingly, the vast majority of

research on housing demand and housing prices has focused on owner occupiers. An

advantage of this paper’s research on rental price indexes is that most of the concerns of

the literature on home ownership are not relevant. In fact, the central topic in

theoretical models of house prices is how to translate data on home ownership costs,

net of tax deductions and capital gains, into a framework of “rental equivalence.”

       The basic task of the CPI is to measure changes in the quality-adjusted price of a

rental unit. In December, 2002, the share of the total CPI allocated to the rent index was

31.4 percent, consisting of a 6.5 percent share for rent of primary residence, 22.2 percent

rental equivalence for owner-occupied housing, and 2.7 percent for lodging away from

home (Greenlees, 2003, p. 1). The crucial point is that changes in tenant rent are

imputed to owner-occupied housing by changing weights but not by creating a new

and different index of the unique costs or benefits of owner occupancy. Thus the CPI

makes the implicit assumption that any benefits of tax deductions or capital gains to




12Brown (1994, Table 3.6A, p. 62) indicates that in 1918 only 19 percent of “laborer”
households were home owners, compared to 24 percent of “wage earners” and 36 percent of
“salaried” workers.
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 14


home owners are quickly reflected in rents, as landlords in a hypothetically competitive

rental market pass along their own changes in user cost to their tenants.

       Of course, this implicit CPI assumption is dubious. Economists have long

recognized that rental prices are “sticky,” that is, slow to adjust. As documented by

Genesove (1999), 29 percent of rental apartment units had no change in rent from one

year to the next. Nominal rigidity was much higher among units where tenants

continued from the previous year as contrasted to units where the tenants changed.

Genesove also finds that units in single-unit and small buildings were much more likely

to display nominal rigidity. Because apartment rents are sticky, the underlying CPI

assumption that apartment rents can be translated into owner occupancy costs is

problematic. Fundamental changes that influence home ownership costs, e.g., a

reduction in interest rates that (as in 2001-03) allowed many homeowners permanently

to reduce their true home ownership cost, may be reflected in rental costs (and hence in

the CPI) only after a long lag, if at all.

       It is striking how many dimensions of the literature on house prices refer back to

tenant rent as a baseline for analysis. A recent example is Bajari, Benkard, and Krainer

(BBK, 2003, p. 3), who translate the dependence of house price indexes on rental

equivalence as follows:

       “Dougherty and Van Order [1982] were among the first to recognize that the user
cost could be a good measure of inflation in the cost of housing services. They note that
the user cost is a marginal rate of substitution of housing consumption for other
consumption. Further, in a competitive economy, the user cost should be equal to the
                                                           A Century of Rents, Page 15


rental price of a single unit of housing services charged by a profit-maximizing
landlord. Thus, the inherently difficult task of measuring an unobservable marginal
rate of substitution is replaced by the much easier task of measuring rents.”

The BBK paper makes a striking and controversial point, that all price increases on

transactions in existing homes are welfare-neutral, because any benefits of capital gains

to sellers are cancelled by reductions in the welfare of buyers. Welfare is increased

only by construction of new homes and renovation of existing homes. Indeed, the

structure of housing finance, at least in the United States, severely handicaps home

renters relative to home owners, not only by providing tax deductions on mortgage

interest to home owners, but also by transferring the benefits of capital gains to

landlords, at least in the short run. In the long run capital gains on rental properties, as

well as tax deductions available to landlords, should translate into an increased supply

that drives down rents, just as (more immediately) costs of home ownership are

reduced by unrealized capital gains on houses. This process of adjustment may be

inhibited by supply constraints.13 Anecdotal evidence suggests that low interest rates in

2001-03 made the purchase of condominium units so attractive that an oversupply of

apartments and softness of rents developed in many cities.

       Díaz and Luengo-Prado (2003) provide a convincing explanation of a

fundamental puzzle, which is why, in the perspective of subsidies and advantages to



13 We conjecture that supply constraints may be less significant for rental apartments, where a
relatively small parcel of land can accommodate numerous apartments in a high-rise building,
than for single-family houses that consume significant land for yards and streets.
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 16


home ownership, all households are not owner-occupiers. They estimate the effects on

the percentage of home ownership (66.5 percent in their data) of adjustment costs,

uncertainty, tax deductibility, down payment percentages, and discount rates. Their

analysis provides an intuitive explanation of why one-third of American households are

tenants and thus the subject of this research on rental prices. Renters are young, have

not yet saved the down payment necessary for home ownership, move too often to

allow the advantages of home ownership to offset transaction and adjustment costs, and

are subject to capital market constraints based on credit histories and “permanent”

income.

      The dominance of the rental equivalence concept is pervasive across papers that

attempt to determine whether a particular region or country is experiencing a housing

price “bubble”. Ayuso and Restoy (2003) provide an example of research that bases a

measure of the overpricing or underpricing of house prices on an underlying concept of

rental equivalence. Using data for Spain, the UK, and the US, they interpret changes in

house prices as overshooting or undershooting of house prices relative to the

fundamental level of rents. The fundamental measure of deviations of house prices

from “equilibrium” is based on the ratio of house prices to rents.

      Another example of the fundamental role of rents in the analysis of house prices

comes from Sinai and Souleles (2003), who demonstrate that the demand for home

ownership responds positively to “rent risk,” that is, the perceived variance in rental
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 17


prices. If a prospective tenant anticipates that rents will be variable in the future, he or

she is more likely to hedge that risk by buying a home. The Sinai-Souleles analysis

seems to be limited in applicability to the U. S. housing markets with its unique

institution of fixed-rate long-term mortgages. In this environment, home buyers can

eliminate almost all uncertainty about the cost of mortgage finance (not, of course,

energy or maintenance costs or property taxes) by switching from uncertain future rents

to home-ownership with a fixed-rate mortgage. Likewise, the analysis is quite

dependent on a past environment when inflation in rents was relatively rapid. In a

hypothetical future environment of low overall inflation, implying low nominal rent

inflation, the advantages of home ownership would diminish accordingly.



The Analytical Case for Downward Bias in the CPI for Rent

       Throughout its history the CPI has measured tenant rent. Beginning in 1983 (for

the CPI-U, 1985 for the CPI-W), the BLS adopted the “rental equivalence” approach to

measuring price changes for owner-occupied housing. This attempts to measure the

change in the amount a homeowner would pay to rent his or her home in a competitive

market. The index used for homeownership does not collect new data but rather

reweights the rent sample to apply to owner-occupied units. Between 1987 and 1997

the prices of owner units were moved by rent changes for rental units that are matched

to a CPI owner sample based on similar location, structure type, age, number of rooms,
                                                            A Century of Rents, Page 18


and type of air conditioning. Beginning in 1998 the owner sample was dropped due to

the difficulty of finding renter-occupied units in neighborhoods consisting mostly or

entirely of owner-occupied units and the methodology returned to the same as during

the 1983-86 period, namely to reweight the rent sample to represent owner-occupied

units.14

         The ex-ante assumption of downward bias in the CPI is based on more than the

circumstantial evidence reviewed above. The BLS itself studied and then, beginning in

1988, corrected aging bias that results from the neglect of the fact that a given rental unit

systematically experiences a decline in rent as the result of depreciation. The extent of

aging bias was initially revealed in a BLS research paper based on the hedonic

regression methodology (Randolph, 1988), and since 1988 the CPI for rental shelter has

been corrected by location-specific aging factors based on the hedonic regression. The

annual correction for depreciation ranges from a high of 0.36 percent in major

northeastern cities to 0.17 percent in the south (Lane, Randolph, and Berenson, 1988),

and so the CPI for shelter is presumed to be biased downward by this amount prior to

1988.

         Less well known is the nonresponse bias, which is the major focus of CNV

(2003a).     Beginning in 1942 the BLS began collecting data on rent changes from tenants

rather than landlords. This poses the major problem that rent increases tend to take


14   Facts in this paragraph come from Placek and Baskin (1996).
                                                            A Century of Rents, Page 19


place when one tenant departs and another arrives, but the departing tenant is not

reached by the BLS survey while the arriving tenant may have no knowledge of the rent

paid by the previous tenant. CNV (2003a) estimate that over the period 1942-77 roughly

one-third of rent increases failed to be recorded, leading to a major downward bias that

they estimate to be roughly 1.5 percent per year.

         Methodological improvements in the CPI gradually eliminated nonresponse

bias.15 Beginning in 1978 the size of the BLS sample was reduced with the explicit

intention of giving field agents more time to capture rent increases that occurred when

a tenant moved, and also giving them the latitude to interview landlords and building

managers to obtain data on rent changes. In 1985 a correction was introduced for the

bias associated with vacant units, involving the imputation of rent changes for vacant

units based on rent changes experienced in occupied units in the same location.

Finally in 1994 the method was changed to eliminate a recall bias that had been

introduced in 1978 when respondents were asked not only about the current month’s

rent but also the previous month’s rent. Now the monthly rate of rental inflation is

calculated as the sixth root of the average six-month inflation rate (since the previous

interview taken six months earlier), and this results in roughly a three-month lag in

reporting of changes in the rental inflation rate (Armknecht, Moulton, and Stewart,

1995).


15   This history of CPI improvements is taken from CNV (2003a), pp. 11-12.
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 20


       We have seen in Table 1 that over the period from 1930 to 1985 or 1988, the CPI

for rent increases more slowly than unadjusted mean rent at a differential rate of greater

than two percent per year. CNV (2003a) present adjustments based on a theoretical

model of nonresponse bias; their average bias correction for 1930-85 is 1.6 percent per

year for their basic estimate and 1.4 percent per year for their “conservative” alternative

estimate. We shall return to a discussion of these bias corrections when we present our

own evidence for sub-periods that overlap with the CNV results.



Hedonic Regression Estimates of Rents from AHS Data

       All hedonic regression studies share the standard issues that arise in estimation

using cross-section data, including coping with colinearity, potential nonnormal errors,

variables subject to measurement error, and choice of functional form in relationships

that may be nonlinear. Most of the literature on hedonic price index methodology for

housing, e.g., Wallace (1996), Meese-Wallace (1991, 1997), and Sheppard (1999), refers to

the sales price of houses, not rents paid by tenants. Nevertheless, some of the issues

confronted in studies of house prices apply to tenant rents as well. Housing markets

are characterized by search, imperfect information, and the competition between newly

constructed homes and existing units.

       Housing, both owner-occupied and tenant-occupied, is very heterogeneous,

having in common with such products as automobiles extreme complexity but with the
                                                           A Century of Rents, Page 21


added dimensions of location across regions, rural vs. urban, and location within

metropolitan areas. Houses tend to cost less in the south and more in the west, and

they tend to cost more in the suburbs than in the central city, partly because the

quantity of land that comes with the house is seldom revealed in the data. As noted by

Sheppard (1999, p. 1616), “it is surprising how many hedonic models lack either a

variable for land area, or a variable that explicitly identifies the location of the

structure.” The importance of location in determining house prices leads to the related

problem that observations may lack stochastic independence due to spatial

autocorrelation, the tendency of the error in one observation to be correlated with those

observations that are located nearby. We might find, for instance, that house prices are

higher in a particular suburb or enclave that has any combination of excellent schools,

unusually good public services, or unusually low property taxes.16

       Our hedonic study of rents from the AHS shares with CNV (2003b) the absence

of data on location, except for four regions of the country and urban vs. nonurban

location. Thus we are unable to include factors determining the value of land, the

quality of local schools, or nearby amenities including oceans, lakes, parks, or open

space. To the extent that these left-out determinants of house prices and rent are

correlated with included variables, then coefficients on those variables will be biased.

Fortunately, the issue of missing information on land value and other location-related

16Two classic “enclaves” with high house prices are Piedmont, tucked inside Oakland,
California, and Kenilworth, wedged between Winnetka and Wilmette, Illinois.
                                                           A Century of Rents, Page 22


variables is less serious for this study of rents than for studies of house prices, since

rental units typically have little or no attached land and are more homogeneous than

owner-occupied units in many dimensions.17

Mean Values

       The AHS data examined in our hedonic regression study extends from 1975 to

2003 and covers only odd-numbered years. Details of sources and data construction,

and a discussion of problems and weaknesses in the AHS data, appear in the Data

Appendix. A problem with the AHS data set that determines our method of

presentation is that the data consists of three separate panel data sets covering,

respectively, 1975-83, 1985-95, and 1997-2003. The number of variables included jumps

in the second data set. As CNV (2003b, p. 8) also found, estimated regression

coefficients for the time period 1983-85 are problematic because of the lack of

homogeneity of the panels between 1983 and 1985, and we have further found that the

1985-95 panel cannot be merged with the 1997-2003 (see further discussion in the Data

Appendix).

       Table 2 displays for 1975, 1985, 1993, and 2003, the mean values of rent, of four

quantitative explanatory variables, and percentage means for a host of additional

variables represented in the regression analysis as dummy variables. The top row


17 Randolph (1988) has additional locational data, namely a large number of separate
metropolitan area locational variables. Unfortunately Randolph’s estimates are of little value
for this study, as he uses only a single year of data (1983) and thus cannot estimate the
variation in a hedonic price index over time.
                                                            A Century of Rents, Page 23


showing mean rent corresponds to the “AHS” column in Table 1 above. Particularly

interesting on the second line is the size of the rental unit measured in square feet

(available only starting in 1985), and this changes remarkably little in contrast to the

much more rapid growth in the size of new single-family houses, with a 1970-2001

increase in median square feet of 52 percent and in mean square feet of 55 percent.18

Other measures of size also show little increase between 1975 and 2003. There is a large

jump in average age which presumably reflects changes in the panel of units.

       The quality characteristics in Table 1 are divided into five sections, at the top

those representing quantitative attributes like square feet, and then below an array of

dummy variables representing location, positive quality attributes, negative physical

and environmental characteristics, and finally special aspects of rental finance, e.g.,

whether the unit is in public housing and/or carries a subsidy. While the size of rental

units does not increase appreciably over time, there is a marked improvement in several

other measures of quality between 1975 and 2003. The presence of air conditioning

increases from 15 percent of the units in 1975 to 46 percent in 2003, while multiple

bathrooms increases from 7 to 20 percent. Units having no sewer connection decreased

from 16 percent in 1975 to 6 percent in 2003. There is a modest improvement in the

variables in the bottom of the table measuring negative externalities.


18Statistical Abstract, 1987, Table 1273, p. 706, and 2002, Table 922, p. 591. The median
went from 1385 square feet in 1970 to 2103 square feet in 2001. By comparison a sample of
new houses started in the first half of 1950 had an average floor area of only 983 square feet
(Grebler-Blank-Winnick, 1956, p. 119).
                                                           A Century of Rents, Page 24


Regression Estimates

       Estimated coefficients for the full set of available variables are shown separately

in Table 3 for three periods, the first panel covering 1975-83, the second panel covering

1985-1995, and the third for 1997-2003. Explanatory variables are listed in the same

order as in Table 2. All regressions are estimated in double-log form and thus differ

from the Box-Cox flexible functional form estimated by CNV (2003b) and the semi-log

form used by Randolph (1988).19 All coefficients displayed in Table 3 are significant at

the 1 percent level or better (except for scattered negative attributes in 1997-2003),

which is perhaps not surprising in light of the large sample sizes of between 30,000 and

52,000 observations in the three regressions. All coefficients appear to have correct

signs, except for two negative environmental variables (“Noise Problem” and

“Neighborhood bothersome”) which have small positive coefficients. The regional and

urban coefficients are quite large, and estimated hedonic price indexes that omit

regional effects will miss changes in prices due to the shift of the population from the

Northeast and Midwest to the South and West (although the rent-lowering movement

to the south is partly or entirely cancelled by the rent-raising movement to the west). A

few of the coefficients are surprising – the coefficient on central air conditioning seems

small and declines rapidly to a negligible 5 percent, whereas the coefficients on

dishwasher and fireplace seem surprisingly large and may be correlated with other

19CNV (2003b, Table 5) shows that the average rate of increase of their hedonic price index is
insensitive to alternative functional forms.
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 25


unmeasured attributes, for instance high-grade kitchen cabinets and countertops in the

case of “dishwasher” and a higher general level of amenities and trim in the case of

“fireplace.”

       The time dummy coefficients at the bottom of Table 3 provide an alternative

measure of inflation for every two years over the period 1975-2003, except for 1983-85

and 1995-97. After completing our discussion of the regression results, we will examine

the implications of these estimated time dummy coefficients for annual rates of change

over specified intervals. At that point we will compare our results with the CPI and the

hedonic regression results of CNV (2003b).

The Effects of Quality Change: A “Stripping Exercise”

       In addition to estimating hedonic price indexes using all the available AHS data,

we also want to look more closely at the sources and magnitude of quality change. Our

basic question is “by how much we would overstate the rate of change in rents if we

had fewer or no quality change variables?” Asking this question another way, what is

the difference between changes over time in the hedonic price index versus mean

contract rent, and which explanatory variables contribute to this difference? In this

exercise it is important to distinguish between true changes in quality and changes in

other explanatory variables that do not represent changes in quality, i.e., locational

variables and government-related variables (public housing and subsidized housing).
                                                            A Century of Rents, Page 26


       To implement this distinction between quality and non-quality explanatory

variables, we remove variables in several steps. This is done for 1975-83 in Table 4,

1985-95 in Table 5, and 1997-2003 in Table 6. Starting from the full regression in column

(1), the first step is to remove all quality variables other than those available in Weston’s

analysis of the 1930-70 period (discussed below). Thus column (2) retains the number

of rooms, age, and incompleteness of plumbing fixtures, as well as regional location.

The housing subsidy variables are added back in columns (3) and (4), while column (4)

removes all remaining quality variables. Column (5) removes all explanatory variables

other than the time dummies.

       Comparing columns (1) and (2) provides evidence on the effect of quality

variables not available to Weston, especially multiple bathrooms, air conditioning, and

presence of an elevator. For 1975-83 these quality variables explain 0.75 percent per

year of price change, and a comparison of columns (1) and (4) indicates that removing

all quality variables (while leaving in the regional and subsidy dummies) explains 0.88

percent per year of price change. The regional and subsidy effects, dropped in going

from column (4) to (5), contribute -0.25 percent per year, indicating that apartment rents

were pulled down by a movement to the south and an increased share of subsidized

rental housing.20 Since the CPI controls for location and such attributes as public


20These annual rates of change are calculated by converting the time dummy coefficients,
which are in the form of decimal log changes, into percents and dividing by the eight years
covered in Table 4. Thus the cumulative 1975-83 price increase in the first column is 63
percent and in the last column is 68 percent, implying a difference of 0.63 percent per year. Of
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 27


financing, we want to include those variables in the regressions compared with the CPI,

as in columns (1), (3), and (4).

       Table 5 carries out the same exercise for the subsequent decade 1985-95 when our

set of explanatory variables is considerably richer. The result in going from column (1)

to (2) is slightly larger, 0.9 percent per year of price change is explained by the

combined effects of the long list of variables not available to Weston. Surprisingly,

omitting the remaining quality variables in going from the second to fourth column

actually reduces the cumulative price increase, probably reflecting the jump in the

average age of rental units shown previously in Table 2. For the 1985-95 decade, a

comparison of the final two columns indicates that removing the regional and subsidy

variables does not make any difference even though the positive coefficients on “west”

and “urban” are considerably higher in Table 5 than in Table 4.

       Table 6 prevents results for 1995-2003. The annual rate of price change

explained by quality change in going from column (1) to (2) of Table 6 is 0.67 percent

per year, but again going from column (2) to (4) reveals a quality deterioration of 0.50

percent per year that may be explained by increasing age. Since the sharp jump in age

in going from 1975 to 2003 (see Table 2) is implausible, it may reflect an inconsistency

in the AHS sample for which we have not yet found an explanation.21 Removal of the


this, 0.88 percent represents the contribution of quality variables and the remaining -0.25
percent reflects the contribution of regional and subsidy variables.
21 One source of inconsistency in the AHS sample is that the 1975-83 panel contains six age

subcategories of which the oldest is “built before 1939” while the 1985-2001 panel contains
                                                           A Century of Rents, Page 28


regional and subsidy dummy variables raises price change by .67 percent per year.

Overall, the regressions reduce the change in the hedonic index by 0.83 percent below

the raw price change in the sample, of which just 0.16 points is attributable to quality

change and 0.67 points to the regional/subsidy effects.22




Hedonic Regressions Based on Census Microdata

       A supplementary set of hedonic regressions is estimated from the Census of

Housing microdata file, and here we have an amazing sample size of over 750,000, but a

much smaller set of quality change variables, lacking even any control for air

conditioning. In Table 7 we present in column (1) the full hedonic regression result, in

column (2) the effect of removing the quality variables, and in column (3) the effect of

removing the regional variables. The regional variables make no difference throughout,

and removing the quality variables has an effect that varies over time. Looking only at

1960-70, the price increase in column (2) is 10 percent faster than in column (1),

indicating a quality effect of 1.0 percent per annum. However the quality effect declines

to 0.60 percent per annum for 1960-80 and to 0.37 percent per annum for 1960-90.




nine age subcategories of which the oldest is “built before 1919.” This inconsistency would
cause approximate age to jump spuriously from 1975 to 1985 but not after 1985.
22 To check on the stability of the results during 1997-2003, we ran separate adjacent-year

regressions for 1997-99, 1999-2001, and 2001-2003. Not surprisingly in light of the large
samples, the quality and time coefficients in the adjacent-year regressions were almost
identical to the six-year regression results shown in Table 6.
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 29


Decade-by-decade, the implied quality change was at a rate of 1.0 percent per annum in

1960-70, 0.2 percent in 1970-80, and -0.1 percent in 1980-90.

       The results in Table 4-7 are converted to annual growth rates and summarized in

Table 8. The four lines represent the period of the Census data (1960-90) and the three

sub-periods of the AHS data (1975-85, 1985-95, and 1995-2003). A comparison of

columns (2) and (5) in the first line indicates an annual growth rate of quality over 1960-

90 of 0.37 percent per year and a difference between the CPI and Census hedonic

(column 8 minus 1) of -1.67 percent per annum.

       The next three lines of Table 8 summarize the results using the AHS data. The

years of data gaps. 1983-85 and 1995-97, are bridged by assuming that each AHS variant

index grew at the same rate as the CPI during those two pairs of years. Thus for the

1975-85 and 1995-2003 intervals shown in Table 8, the results shown in columns (2)

through (6) are biased toward zero by construction. Column (1) displays the baseline

regression results of CNV (2003b), also based on AHS data but ending in 1995. Their

price increase in column (1) is substantially faster than ours in column (2) for 1975-85

but is very close in 1985-95. As discussed above, removing the quality variables other

than rooms, age, and plumbing completeness yields measures of the annual rate of

quality change in the three AHS periods of 0.60, 0.88, and 0.37 percent, respectively, an

amazingly consistent record. Removing all quality variables in column (5) implies, in

comparison with the full hedonic results in column (2), respective rates of “total”
                                                           A Century of Rents, Page 30


quality change of 0.70, 0.38, and 0.09 percent per year. The implied CPI bias (comparing

column (8) with column (2)) is -1.05, -1.03, and -0.78 percent per annum.

       Figure 2 summarizes the hedonic regression results, displaying the Census and

AHS-based hedonic price indexes and the CPI for the period 1960-2003. The Census

hedonic indexes and the CPI are expressed on a basis of 1970 = 100, and the AHS index

is linked to the Census index in 1975, which amounts to expressing the AHS index on a

1970 base year with the Census average growth rate for 1970-80 used to proxy the

missing AHS observations for 1970-75. During the overlapping period of 1975-90, the

Census and AHS indexes are surprisingly close in light of the much longer list of

explanatory variables in the AHS data set, indicating that the location and subsidy

variables essentially offset the effect of the quality variables.



Additional Evidence Not Based on Regression Analysis

The Weston Data and Analysis

       Our main source of changes in rent for the period 1930-70 comes from an

unpublished dissertation by Rafael Weston (1972). His data originate in frequency table

form published in the 1940, 1950, and 1960 Census of Housing volumes and preliminary

data for 1970. While 1940 was the first year in which the Census of Housing was

conducted, he was able to obtain corresponding data from the 1930 Census of

Population.
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 31


      Weston’s quality characteristics are based on whether a unit was inside or

outside a SMSA, its Census geographic region, the age of the unit, the number of rooms,

completeness of plumbing, and ‘condition,’ which in turn is either “dilapidated” or

“not dilapidated” as subjectively assigned by the Census interviewer. The published

frequency tables contain these characteristics cross-classified by rent and region but not

by one another. An important advantage of the data is that the number of rental units

in each quality category is provided, and this allows us to calculate rental expenditure

in each category and thus to develop a price index based on expenditure weights. To

generate a full cross-classification from this limited data set, Weston supposed a

multinomial model for each variable and fit the data to log-normal distribution using a

complex ANOVA based methodology. He then conducted an analysis of quality

change, measuring the implied quality change associated with each variable and its

interaction terms. Weston produced price indexes for both house prices and rents.

      Table 9 in the first column copies from Table 1 the mean gross rent data that

Weston obtained from the Census. As calculated in Table 1, this series increases 2.1

percent per year more rapidly than the CPI for rent over the period 1930-70. Displayed

in the second column is a quality-corrected price index that Weston calculated from his

own data. Because Weston’s explanation of his methodology is quite obscure, we have

calculated an alternative quality-adjusted “Tornqvist” price index that calculates the

rent change separately for each of Weston’s cells (e.g., two rooms, complete plumbing,
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 32


not dilapidated) and then aggregates the separate log rent changes by the average

nominal rental expenditure in each cell in the first and second year of the comparison.

Thus log rent changes in each cell from 1930 to 1940 are aggregated using the nominal

expenditure share of that cell averaged between the 1930 and 1940 value.

       The two right-hand columns compute an implicit quality index as the ratio of an

index of mean gross rent to each of the two price increases. If rent increases faster than

a price index, this implies that quality has increased. Quite surprisingly, there was no

improvement in quality between 1930 and 1960. A deterioration in quality during the

1930s was just offset by a small improvement in quality in 1950-60. Only in the final

decade 1960-70 did quality improve rapidly.

       The bottom part of Table 9 calculates annual growth rates for each decade and

for the four decades taken together. Over the full period 1930-70, the Weston price

index increases at 0.44 percent per year less than mean gross rent, and the Tornqvist

price index increases at 0.33 percent per year less, implying implicit quality change

indexes of the same magnitude.

       This leaves us with the puzzle as to why quality change was so slow in the

period 1930-60 and then accelerated so much from 1960 to 1970. Several answers are

suggested in Table 10, which provides means of the main Weston quality variables.

First, due to lack of construction during the Great Depression, average age increased

sharply from 1930 to 1940, with a drop in the number of units of 10 years or younger
                                                            A Century of Rents, Page 33


from 30 to 11 percent. Going in the same direction, and probably more important, was

a decline in the average number of rooms from 4.65 in 1930 to 3.81 in 1950, followed by

a slight recovery to 3.91 in 1960 and then a big jump to 4.89 in 1970. The other two

quality variables improved steadily, with a decline in “dilapidated” from 17 percent in

1930 to 3 percent in 1970, and in partial or no plumbing from 43 percent in 1930 to 7

percent in 1970. Shown below the plumbing percentages is the implicit value of

plumbing, measured as the ratio of the rent of a unit with complete plumbing to a unit

lacking plumbing, calculated cell-by-cell and weighted by the number of units in each

cell.23 Below we attempt to make a rough correction for the value of improvements over

time in heating, plumbing, and electrification.

       Because Weston’s quality correction for 1960-70 is so much larger than for the

other decades, it is worth checking Weston’s results against the Census microdata that

was used to develop the hedonic regressions of Table 7. As shown in Table 9, the

unadjusted annual growth rate of rent for 1960-70 is 4.35 percent for Weston and in

Table 11 is 4.62 percent for the Census microdata. The Weston price index based on the

Tornqvist method increases at 2.73 percent per year compared to 3.6 percent for the

Census hedonic price index of Table 7. The implicit increase in quality occurs at a rate

of 1.5 percent for Weston and 1.0 percent for the Census. An interesting similarity is the

implicit value of plumbing. The bottom line of Table 10 shows that the average value of

23 Each “cell” shows the rent and the number of units in every combination of quality attribute,
e.g., a two-room apartment more than ten years old, not dilapidated, and with full plumbing.
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 34


plumbing is to make rent 1.77 times higher than without plumbing, or to make the log

0.57 higher. This is remarkably close to the coefficient for absence of plumbing of -0.62

in the Census microdata regression in Table 7.

       The major discrepancy between Weston and the Census microdata concerns the

change in the number of rooms from 1960 to 1970. There was virtually no change in the

Census, only from 3.93 total rooms to 3.99 total rooms, in contrast to Weston’s jump in

Table 10 from 3.91 to 4.89. It is possible that the Weston data on mean rooms reflect a

coding error, or the fact that he was using a preliminary summary of 1970 Census data.

We note from Table 2 that total rooms in the AHS data were much closer to the 1970

Census figure throughout 1975-2001, ranging from 4.08 in 1975 to 4.40 in 2001.

Accordingly, we discount the Weston conclusion on quality change in the 1960-70

decade and prefer the conclusion of the hedonic price index developed from the Census

microdata.

Brown’s Evidence on Quality Change

       In Table 1 we have already examined Brown’s rental prices from five budget

studies based on CES data spanning the period 1918-88. We found that over the 1918-73

period, Brown’s rental price per unit increased at about 1.9 percent per year faster than

the CPI, quite similar to the difference of about 2.1 percent per year exhibited by the

Weston data and the CNV calculation of median gross rent from the Census of
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 35


Housing. Going beyond raw rent data, Brown’s book contains a wealth of information

on quality change.

       An initial problem is that all of Brown’s data from the CES on household

expenditures by type (types of food, types of clothing, shelter, fuel, home furnishings

etc.) are listed separately for different classes of workers – laborers, wage earners, and

salaried workers. Managerial employees and owners of small businesses are excluded

from the CES source. As a first attempt to extract some useful information about

changes in shelter quality, we average together the percentages displayed for wage

earners and salaried workers. This omits laborers at the low end and managerial and

self-employed business people at the high end. Also, the data generally refer to urban

and nonfarm rural families and omit living conditions on farms, where to be sure the

role of rental tenancy was quite different than in nonfarm households. Brown’s study

explicitly discusses the “abysmal” living conditions experienced by black households

but does not provide enough information to provide weighted averages for the rental

tenant population as a whole.

       Of the quality changes that Brown quantifies and/or discusses over the five years

of her study (as shown above in Table 1), we are primarily interested in electrification,

heating, plumbing, and household appliances. Of these only the presence or absence of

“complete” plumbing facilities is taken into account in the Weston study summarized

in Tables 9 and 10. The best that we can do to extract data from the Brown study is
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 36


presented in Table 12. As shown there, the definitions of variables tend to differ from

one year to the next, and there is progressively less detail shown on the quality of rental

apartments in each year after the initial year of 1918.

       Two surprising facts are listed at the top of Table 12. Rooms per rental unit were

5.3 in 1918 and 5.2 in 1935, as compared to Weston’s figure for 1930 of 4.7 rooms. The

second surprise, doubtless related to the first, is that more than half of the rental units in

both 1918 and 1935 were houses rather than apartments. Thus the 1918 households

surveyed by the CES cannot be accurately characterized as living in dark, dank

tenements, since more than half of them lived in houses. Presumably these were small

houses typical of Chicago’s “bungalow belt” and similar areas of other cities, but at least

these rental tenants did have small yards and outside windows on all four sides.24

Even in the lowest “laborer” class houses accounted for 56 percent of rental units. In

contrast in 2001 “single-family detached and attached units and mobile homes”

accounted for only 36 percent of rental units.25

       As of 1918 electrification of the urban and nonfarm rural population had reached

the halfway mark, and the task of spreading electrification to the nonrural population

was largely complete by 1935 and totally complete by 1950. Electrification came sooner

to large cities than smaller towns, and since rental units were predominately located in


24 Brown (1994, p. 40) indicates that median household income in the CES sample was $1400
in 1918. The mean income for her three classes are $1037 for laborers, $1344 for wage
earners, and $2272 for salaried workers.
25 Statistical Abstract 2002, Table 937, p. 599.
                                                           A Century of Rents, Page 37


large cities, it is likely that the data on the third line of Table 11 understate the spread of

electrification to tenant-occupied units in 1918 and 1935.

       In contrast central heating was still rare in 1918 and even in 1935. Roughly half

the rooms in tenant-occupied units in 1918 were “equipped for heating,” but this

usually meant some kind of stove that heated a single room, often fueled by coal.

Central heating did not reach a penetration of 50 percent until sometime between 1935

and 1973.

       Indoor plumbing came to the rental unit earlier than central heating. By 1918

almost 80 percent of units had an indoor toilet and almost two-thirds had a bathroom.

By 1935 80 percent had not just electricity but also both hot running water and a flush

toilet. Thus, while there was a substantial further spread of indoor plumbing after 1918,

much of the transition had already taken place in prior years. The data exhibit a

contradiction for 1950, since it cannot be true simultaneously that 84 percent of all units

were equipped with a bathroom, hot running water, and a flush toilet, while at the

same time 34 percent “lacked full plumbing.” The mean percentage lacking full

plumbing in the Weston data in Table 10 for 1950 was 32 percent; the Weston number of

18 percent for 1960 agrees roughly with the Census number of 16 percent in Table 11.

       Some additional insight into the quality of housing units (both tenant-occupied

and owner-occupied) in 1935 can be obtained the description of a “typical American

home” from U. S. BLS (1935) as quoted by Brown (1994, p. 126):
                                                       A Century of Rents, Page 38


      “single-family dwelling, about 19 years old, of wood or frame
      construction containing five rooms. It is equipped with either bathtub or
      shower, indoor water-closet, uses electricity for lighting and gas for
      cooking. For the country as a whole, reliance is placed predominantly on
      heating stoves for heat, although over 31% of all dwelling units use warm-
      air furnaces. Coal is the principal fuel used.”

Not much change was registered in 1950, except for the conversion to central heating,

and the addition of appliances:

      “The typical urban home had four to six rooms for three persons.
      Amenities included running water, private toilet and bath, central heating
      (except in the South), gas or electric stove, and mechanical refrigerator.
      The rent for such a home was estimated by one study to be about $38
      monthly” (Brown, 1994, p. 215).

Other Evidence on Quality Change

      When we combine the Brown, Weston, and Census data, we are faced with a

conflict between an improvement in quality characteristics involving electricity,

heating, plumbing, and appliances, but a decline in the average number of rooms per

unit. This decline is verified by Grebler-Blank-Winnick (1956, pp. 119-21), who display

a special tabulation from the 1950 Census of Housing showing a decline from 4.76

rooms per urban and rural nonfarm dwelling unit for units built before 1919 to 4.26

rooms for units built after 1945. They argue convincingly that this decline understates

the true decline because of conversions that created more units per multi-family

building over the years between the construction date and the data source in 1950.

They argue that, since conversions to increase the density of multi-family buildings

occur mainly in older buildings, then the pre-1919 buildings were originally built with
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 39


more rooms per unit than the 4.76 figure cited above. Overall, the authors conclude

that this decrease in average dwelling size “was probably more than enough to

compensate for the addition of new equipment and facilities since the twenties” (G-B-

W, p. 121).

Quantifying Quality Change

       To summarize our findings on quality change to this point, we found that quality

attributes available in the 1975-2003 AHS data but not available in the Weston or

Census of Housing data contributed an average of 0.67 percent per year to explaining

price change (Table 8 above, comparison of columns (2) and (3)). On balance the

characteristics available for the pre-1970 Census years, primarily rooms per unit and

age, exhibit a quality deterioration after 1975 due to increasing age. This result is highly

suspect, because age does not increase nearly as much in the Census microdata (Table

11, line 3) as in the AHS data (Table 2, line 4). Quality change is also measured to occur

at an annual rate of about 1.0 percent in the Census microdata for the decade 1960-70,

but at a negligible rate of 0.05 percent per year during 1970-90.

       The Weston analysis exhibits no net quality change between 1930 and 1960,

because a decline in rooms per unit and an increase in age offsets the benefits of

improved plumbing and reduced “dilapidation.” But Weston does not include key

aspects of quality improvement reported in the CES budget studies summarized by

Brown, who documents a transition from 1918, when most tenant units lacked central
                                                             A Century of Rents, Page 40


heating, half lacked electricity, one-third or more lacked full plumbing facilities, and

virtually none had electric appliances, to 1973 when central heating, electricity, full

plumbing, and a refrigerator and stove were standard equipment in apartments.

       How much were these quality improvements worth? Both the Weston data and

the Census regressions estimate the value of full plumbing as increasing the log of rent

by about 0.6. The AHS regressions for 1975-85 yield a coefficient of 0.8, while after 1985

the coefficient on plumbing is much lower, presumably because it had become almost

universal. At least in principle the Weston quality change measures incorporate a

plumbing effect back to 1930. If during 1918-1930 the extent of complete plumbing

increased roughly from 0.6 to 0.75, a coefficient of 0.6 would imply a quality

improvement of 9 percent, or 0.75 percent per year during the 1918-30 interval.26

       An analogy to the value of central heating can be taken from the example of

central air conditioning, for which we have coefficients in the range of 0.05 to 0.17 in

Table 3, averaging out at 0.11. Over the period 1975 to 2003, the percentage of units

with central AC in the AHS sample increased from 15 to 46 percent, and this can be

translated into an annual rate of improvement of quality of 0.11 percent per year.27 It



26 A coefficient of 0.6 means that the presence of full plumbing compared to the absence of full

plumbing raises the log of rent by 0.6. This full effect of 0.6 would occur if the presence of full
plumbing went from zero to 100 percent. A 15 percentage point increase would be 15 percent
of this, or 0.15 times 0.6, or 0.09.
27Following the procedure in the previous footnote, a complete conversion from 0 percent to

100 percent central AC would raise the log value of the average apartment by 0.11. The
observed increase of 29 percentage points raised the log value by 0.11 times .29, or 0.031, and
this occurred over 28 years for an annual rate of improvement of 0.031/28, or 0.11 percent per
year.
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 41


could be argued that the value of central heat was less than the value of air

conditioning, since housing units were already heated, albeit inconveniently, before

central heating became pervasive, whereas before the invention of residential air

conditioning around 1950 people just sweltered. The convenience and cleanliness

advantage of the transition from coal to fuel oil and natural gas raises the value of

central heating, so let us consider a coefficient of 0.25, more than double the average

1975-2003 coefficient of 0.11 on central AC. An increase in the percentage use of central

heating from 15 percent in 1918 to 100 percent in 1973 would represent an annual rate of

quality improvement of 0.39 percent per year.

       It is more difficult to speculate about electrification. Once a rental unit had

electricity, then households could bring lighting into the home for the cost of a few

inexpensive light fixtures. Later on, as home appliances were invented and improved,

homes with electricity had access to refrigerators and washing machines. The benefit of

electricity must have been as great as that of central heating, say a coefficient of 0.25,

implying that the increase in electrification from 50 percent in 1918 to 100 percent by

1950 represented an annual rate of quality change of another 0.39 percent per year.

       Adding up only these three aspects of quality change, we have for 1918-30 0.75

for plumbing, 0.39 for heating, and 0.39 for electricity, for a sum of 1.53 per year. After

1930 there is no separate adjustment for plumbing, which is taken into account in

Weston’s analysis, but the heating and electricity contributions continue, adding up to
                                                       A Century of Rents, Page 42


0.78. Gradually in the 1950s and 1960s the heating and electricity contributions die out

but are replaced by other contributions of quality change, as indicated in our regression

analysis of the Census and AHS data. Overall, there seems ample evidence to support a

rate of quality improvement in rental apartments of 1.0 percent per year, with perhaps a

greater rate of improvement in the first half of the twentieth century when the impact of

indoor plumbing, electricity, the conversion to central heating and away from coal, and

the inclusion of a refrigerator and a stove as standard equipment had their maximum

effect. By coincidence, a completely independent analysis of the relationship between

rent, age, and maintenance costs of commercial office buildings arrives at an estimated

rate of technical progress for structures of 1.0 percent per year (Gort, Greenwood, and

Rupert, 1999, p. 225).

Merging the Pre-Hedonic and Hedonic Results into a Century-Long Perspective

       Thus far the discussion in this paper has combined two quite different

perspectives on quality change, those based on hedonic regressions from Census data

for 1960-90 and AHS data for 1975-2003, with more impressionistic evidence on the pre-

1960 period. Table 14 provides a systematic summary of all the results in the paper,

with the columns representing the seven sub-periods suggested by breaks in the data

sources. The first three lines exhibit a summary of the information already presented in

Table 1 about the annual growth rate over these seven intervals in the CPI and mean or

median nominal rent unadjusted for changes in quality or location, and the difference
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 43


between the growth rate in the CPI and average rent, which is negative in all seven

periods, with an average difference of about -2 percent over the interval 1914-85, with a

smaller difference after 1985.

       Line 4 of Table 14 has six sections that extract from all of our previous results the

implied rate of quality change in rental units. For 1914-35 we have conjectured

estimates of the contribution of improved plumbing, central heating, and electrification,

based in part on coefficients from hedonic regressions for the post-1960 period. For

1935-60 we drop the plumbing estimate, since plumbing is one of the quality

characteristics explicitly controlled in Weston’s approach. He also controls for location,

age, and condition, characteristics that may have either a positive or negative influence

on rent and which are not taken into account in the pre-1935 period.

       Our hedonic regressions provide most of the evidence on quality change after

1960, except that we add an explicit allowance for heating, which (along with air

conditioning) is one of the variables missing from the Census data used to cover the

1960-75 period. After 1975 the quality estimates are entirely based on the “stripping

exercise” carried out for the AHS data in Tables 4, 5, and 6 above, in which we removed

quality variables from the regressions to isolate the separate effects of the Weston

quality variables, other quality variables, and the location and subsidy variables.

       In Table 14 line 5 sums the various sources of quality change, line 6 adds in the

effects of the location and subsidy variables in the hedonic regressions, and the final
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 44


comparison of lines 1 and 7 provides the “bottom line” estimates of the CPI bias, which

is uniformly negative in each of the seven periods. The average bias for 1914-2003 is

-0.97 percent per year. For the period before major improvements in CPI methodology,

1914-85, the average bias is -1.09 percent per year. For the period emphasized by CNV

as involving the tenant non-response problem, represented here by 1935-85, the average

bias is -1.19 percent per year.

       Over the entire 1914-2003 period, the average annual rates of change are mean

rent 4.37, CPI 2.54, and this CPI-rent different of -1.83 is divided between a 0.86

contribution of quality (including a small contribution of location/subsidy) and a

remaining -0.97 estimated CPI bias. Thus our initial conjecture that the 2 percent

difference between the growth of mean rent and the CPI might be explained roughly

half-and-half by quality and CPI bias appears to be roughly validated by the results.



A Study of Apartment Rents in a Specific Locality

       A final piece of long-term historical evidence on tenant rents comes from a

project designed to collect at the local level in order to assess historical changes in the

CPI for rent. This has the advantage that it allows us to control for many types of

quality change discussed above, including type of heat, electrification, and plumbing

equipment. Just as important, by its limitation to a single locality, the resulting index is

free of the effects of changing regional and metropolitan location on average rents paid.
                                                             A Century of Rents, Page 45


         Evanston, Illinois, is the location for a pilot project to determine the feasibility of

this kind of research.28 Most important, data were readily available in the archives of

the local suburban newspaper, which has published continuously since the 1920s. In

addition, the housing stock in Evanston combines aspects of city and suburb, serving as

a microcosm for a range of different types of apartments and houses. The closest

northern suburb of Chicago along Lake Michigan, Evanston had a population in 2000 of

about 72,000. The population ranges from very wealthy to poor, and homes range from

mansions to tiny houses and modest apartments. The city was founded in the mid-

1800s and was well established by 1925, the year for which our data begin. These

factors allowed us to collect data on tenant rent and prices for a variety of living units

over the past 75 years.

         The first phase of our research involved collecting apartment prices over the

interval 1925-99 from classified advertisements in the Evanston Review, a weekly local

newspaper. In order to control for quality change, data were collected on apartments

for which the advertisement provided detailed descriptions, including number of

rooms and bathrooms, proximity of public transportation, schools, and/or shopping,

parking, heat (type and whether included in rent), air conditioning (first appearing in

the 1960 ads), and whether anything else was included (such as appliances). We noted

other descriptive attributes, such as wood floors or garden view, and terms such as

“luxury building.” Because of space limitations, each ad did not contain information

for each of the mentioned categories. When possible we chose buildings that listed the

specific address, and only considered unfurnished apartments. Data were collected for

every five years from 1925 to 1999. September was chosen as the month for each

sample because many buildings advertise at this time, possibly to attract returning

college students, although August and October were also used as a supplement if the

September issues did not contain enough data. Our ideal was to find the same building

addresses repeated from sample to sample. In some instances this was possible, and a

ʺSpecific Addressʺ index was compiled. However, for several time periods, insufficient

data containing specific address information were available. This was particularly a

problem for 1945 and 1950, when there was a housing shortage. This problem affected

comparisons for the surrounding periods.

      To analyze our data, we matched apartments as closely as possible over each

five-year interval. When possible, we matched apartments in the same building and

with the same description (especially number of rooms and bathrooms), so that our

resulting rent index is equivalent to the ʺmatched modelʺ indexes used in previous

research on durable goods, apparel, and computers. We were able to find between

three and eleven exact address matches for each interval other than 1925-1930, 1940-

1955, and 1965-1970. Because of the small number of matches in some instances and the

lack of information in others, we filled in the gaps in the “Specific Address” index by
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 47


borrowing from the Median Index (discussed below). The five-year change in rent for

each matching apartment was averaged together with equal weights, yielding a log rent

change for each five year period. This series of changes was then cumulated into the

ʺSpecific Addressʺ rent index, which is displayed and compared with the CPI for rent in

Table 13.

      It is important to note that while our Evanston indexes are “matched model”

indexes like the CPI, we have the important advantage that we have no problem with

tenant “non-response” bias as emphasized by CNV. All of the price information that

we have collected is based on newspaper ads and thus is obtained directly from

landlords, not tenants.

      To supplement the first index, we grouped apartments into categories based on

the number of rooms for 3, 4, 5, and 6 room apartments. To make the sample as

accurate as possible, we included as many apartments for which we could find data

(generally at least ten, but fewer for the intervals previously mentioned for which data

were limited). Starting with the 1960 ads, some ads contained information about the

number of bedrooms rather than the number of total rooms. This alternative method of

counting rooms extended through 1999 and became the norm in the ads. It was not

clear whether an apartment listed only as a “1 bedroom” was better averaged with the

“3 room” or “4 room” categories. However, many ads included wording such as “1

bedroom, 4 room apartment” during the transitional years. By using this transitional
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 48


information and by comparing listed rents, we decided to convert between the listings

on the following scale: 1 bedroom=4 rooms, 2 bedroom=5 rooms, 3 bedroom=6 rooms.

      After compiling the mean data for 3, 4, 5, and 6 room apartments for 1925-1999,

we used the same raw data to compile several other indices. In the years from World

War II to the present, there were sometimes insufficient listings for 3 room and 6 room

apartments. To make up for this, we compiled an index including only 4 and 5 room

apartments (for which data were plentiful). To compare with our other indices, we also

compiled an index using the median, instead of the mean, for 3, 4, 5, and 6 room

apartments. Since the median, mean and the 4-5 room indexes were very close, Table 13

displays only the Specific Address index and the Median index for 3,4,5, and 6 room

apartments.

      Differences between the CPI and the two new apartment rent indexes are

summarized at the bottom of Table 1, which displays average annual growth rates over

the intervals 1925-50, 1950-75, and 1975-99. Differences between the two new rent

indexes are relatively minor, and both display growth rates faster than that of the CPI in

all three periods. The difference for the Specific Address index is 1.78 percent per year

in 1925-50, 0.98 percent per year in 1950-75, and a much smaller 0.29 in 1975-99. The

average annual growth rate for the entire period is 1.03 percent faster than the CPI for

the Specific Address index and 1.23 percent faster for the Median index.
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 49


       The primary weakness in the new rent indexes is the potential for unmeasured

quality change. Presumably the Specific Address index is more accurate than the

Median index (the latter is used to proxy the former for those time intervals when

insufficient Specific Address information was available). The most important types of

quality differences among apartments are carefully controlled in the new indexes,

especially number of rooms, bathrooms, location, and presence or absence of air

conditioning. There may be some downward bias, because the indexes do not make

any explicit allowance for age, and many of the apartments were new in the 1920s and

more than 70 years old in 1999. While this source of bias was corrected after 1988, it has

been estimated that the downward bias for aging in the CPI prior to 1988 is 0.3 percent

per year (Randolph, 1988). Since our new indexes share with the CPI the method of

following the same apartments over time, they share both the aging bias and also the

lack of explicit allowance for renovations and modernization that may largely or

entirely offset the aging bias.

       Overall for the 1925-75 period, the difference between the CPI and our two

indexes are -1.38 and -1.49 percent, respectively, and this compares with the average

CPI bias in Table 14 for 1914-75 of -1.07 percent. The smaller bias in the national results

in Table 14 could indicate that rents have risen faster in Evanston than in the nation as a

whole, and/or that our Evanston indexes may miss important improvements in heating,

plumbing, or central air conditioning.

Conclusion

          We have examined a wide variety of data on the historical behavior of tenant

rents over the entire history of the CPI from 1914 to 2003. We began from the

hypothesis that the CPI is biased downward over its history and have linked that

hypothesis to complementary work on CPI methodology by Crone, Nakamura, and

Voith (CNV, 2003a) that traces the downward bias primarily to nonresponse by tenants

who moved just as rents were raised. CNV pinpoint the period of greatest bias as 1942

to 1988, and in our data the CPI rises less rapidly than mean or median contract rent at

an annual rate of exactly 2.00 percent between 1940 and 1987.29 Our initial examination

of data finds that the 2 percent difference extends to other time periods and data

sources, as summarized in the bottom section of Table 1 and in Figure 1. The difference

was much less after 1987, reflecting presumably an improvement in CPI methodology.

          Any difference, no matter how large, does not imply a bias in the CPI if quality

change were sufficiently rapid. We have gathered a rich set of data sources to assess the

importance of quality change in rental housing units over our long historical period of

study. We begin with a hedonic regression analysis on a large set of panel data from

the American Housing Survey (AHS) covering 1975-2003. Our primary focus is on

understanding the contribution of quality characteristics to differences between

estimated hedonic price indexes and raw unadjusted changes in apartment rent. We

29   See Table 1, where we take for 1940 the average of the values in columns (3) and (4).
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 51


segregate the explanatory variables into traditional quality measures (number of rooms,

age, and presence or absence of full plumbing), nontraditional quality characteristics,

and variables for regional location and government subsidies that do not themselves

measure quality. We find that the traditional quality measures contribute little, or even

a negative amount, to the explanation of price change, primarily because of large

increases in the age of apartment units that may be partly spurious. The nontraditional

quality characteristics consistently contribute about 0.7 percent per year to the

explanation of price change.

       The major challenge in the paper is to assess the importance of quality change

prior to the beginning of the AHS data in 1975. We create an overlap measure of

quality-adjusted price change from Census of Housing microdata for 1960-90, giving us

a chance to run a regression with 750,000 observations. The Census data have the defect

that they are limited to the traditional quality measures, and these yield an estimated

rate of quality increase of 1.0 percent per year for 1960-70 but negligible rates after that,

at least in part because of the influence of the increasing age of rental units. Also

available for the pre-1975 period is Weston’s study based on Census data for 1930-70.

We extract a price and quality index from his data, and these indicate virtually no

quality change between 1930 and 1960 and then a rapid rate of about 1.50 percent per

year for 1960-70. Aspects of the Census data look more plausible to us for the 1960-70

period, and we prefer the Census quality change estimate of 1.0 percent for that decade.
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 52


       For earlier periods we rely on two types of analysis. First, we rely on Weston’s

cross-classification of rents and quality characteristics to develop a basic measure of

quality change for 1930-60. Second, we stitch together data on the diffusion of

important quality attributes of rental units, including plumbing, heating, and

electrification, over the period 1918-73. Applying guesstimates about the value of these

attributes based in part on the post-1960 hedonic regressions, we conclude that quality

change in the 1918-73 period must have been substantial. Our guesstimates yield larger

estimates of the growth rate of quality as we move further back, because the impact of

indoor plumbing was largely completed by 1935 and that of electrification by 1950. As

summarized in Table 14, we estimate that quality improved at an annual rate of about

1.2 percent during 1914-35 and 0.9 percent during 1935-60.

       Our final piece of evidence is based on a study of rents in a single local

community, Evanston IL, covering the period 1925-99. Here we control for location

effects by limiting the project to a single small area and control for such quality

attributes as number of rooms, number of bathrooms, type of building, heating, and air

conditioning. One of our indexes is analogous to repeated-sales indexes of housing

prices (Case and Shiller, 2003), in that it measures changes in rent for apartments having

the same specific street address over time. This study yields a difference between the

CPI and the two Evanston indexes of 1.38 and 1.49 percent per year for 1925-75, about

0.4 percent more than the CPI bias estimates based on the nationwide data.
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 53


       Our overall conclusions are surprisingly consistent that the CPI bias was roughly

-1.0 percent prior to the methodological improvements in the CPI that date from the

mid-1980s.30 Our reliance on a wide variety of methodologies and of evidence on types

of quality change and their importance, while leaving the outcome still uncertain, at

least in our view substantially narrows the range of possibilities regarding the history of

CPI bias for rental shelter over the twentieth century.




30Hence we reject the CNV (2003a) conclusion of a bias of roughly 1.8 percent between 1940
and 1985 as excessive and making insufficient allowance for quality change.

Data Appendix

American Housing Survey, AHS

       This paper uses 15 cross-sections of American Housing Survey31 microdata for

1975-2003, courtesy of the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research,

and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. We would also like to

thank Theodore Crone of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank for providing AHS

datasets which were used in preliminary stages of this investigation. The AHS provides

detailed cross-sectional microdata in two survey forms, metropolitan and national. The

metropolitan survey is conducted during even years and the national survey in odd.

This study makes exclusive use of the national survey. Each year a consistent basic

panel is sampled and units are followed year to year whenever possible. Panels are

updated for new construction in areas where building permits are required, and units

missed in the reference census year. Interviews were done in person on paper form

until 1997 when laptops were introduced to enhance speed and accuracy in data

collection. The resulting datasets provide a robust set of characteristic and quality

variables that are well suited for the estimation of hedonic price equations.

       The original 1973-83 AHS panel was based on the 1970 Census of Housing. In

1985 the panel and survey form were redesigned to improve data quality and




31 Before 1983 the AHS was known as the Annual Housing Survey. We use only the new title
in this work.

incorporate the 1980 Census results. This basic 1985 panel has been used every year

since.

Data Quality Issues in the American Housing Survey

         The most important variable for our analysis is clearly rent. The AHS records

contract rent in a continuous fashion from $0 up to a different topcode in each year.

Although this will inevitably cut off the tail of the distribution, it is unlikely to

adversely influence our results. Units in the highest price echelon are likely to have

highly specialized attributes which cannot be recorded in basic characteristic data and

thus cannot be priced by a traditional hedonic approach.

         The year a unit was built is not continuous in the AHS. Irregularly shaped bins

are used in place of discreet years. The 1973-1983 panel has 6 such bins and the 1985-

present panel has 9. Our calculations estimate a unit’s approximate age using the

midpoint of each bin. The last bin is unbounded and creates a catchall for older units.

End bins were problematic; their final coding treats the end bins as if they were the

same size as the earlier bins. The approximate age variable cannot be viewed as an

ideal measure of mean unit age. While the first panel was in use between 35-45% of all

rental units fell into the end bin, making age estimates very susceptible to the

approximation. The problem is ameliorated in the 1985-present panel by the

introduction of more bins covering older build dates.
                                                        A Century of Rents, Page 60


      While generally of very high quality, the AHS data occasionally suffers when a

malformed survey question creates double counting or, oppositely, underestimation.

For example, before 1984 respondents were asked a single question asking for the total

count of rooms. This caused acute underreporting of rooms because of the dubious

definition for exactly what constituted a room. When the survey was redesigned this

was established and the current counts are more accurate.

      Differences between the 1973-1975 and 1985-present surveys make some

variables non-comparable. Those describing a unit’s location relative to a city or metro

area changed due to the methods used to assign status as within a metropolitan area.

Privacy concerns previously disallowed identification in any area with a population

under 250,000 persons. This rule was relaxed to any area under 100,000. Similarly, data

for plumbing was made useless in the 1985 data when a malformed survey question

unreliable answers. This resulted in an unreasonable drop (and subsequent rise upon

correction) in the quantity of units with incomplete plumbing facilities.

      Also particularly problematic in the first panel are the data on neighborhood

characteristics. Respondents were asked if certain attributes – for example: crime,

littler, noise – were earmarked as bothersome instead of merely present, thereby

making the measurement of these already difficult to measure characteristics near

impossible. Surveyors were also instructed to collect some neighborhood variables for

certain kinds of dwelling units. This makes comparisons for variables such as having
                                                         A Century of Rents, Page 61


crime, littler, and noise problems unreliable. Our work includes these variables, but

focuses more on unmeasured quality change due to basic characteristic variables. CNV

(2003b) came to a similar conclusion with respect to the AHS’s coverage of these

variables.

       At a late stage of this research, we determined that it was impossible to treat the

post-1985 as a single panel because of data discontinuities between 1995 and 1997. This

accounts for the fact that our results are presented as three sets of regressions (1975-83,

1985-95, and 1997-2003) with no regressions spanning 1983-85 and 1995-97. As

discussed in the text and tables, we use the CPI for those intervals, thus assuming that

the CPI was an accurate measure of rent changes during those two pairs of years and

hence biasing toward zero our final estimates of the difference between CPI growth and

the growth of an alternative hedonic price index fully adjusted for quality, location, and

subsidies. Further discussion of the background and reasons for the 1995-97 data

continuity can be found at:

Decennial Census Data Microdata

       To make comparisons to older measures of quality change and specifically Rafael

Weston’s PhD thesis, our study makes use of Census of Housing microdata files

spanning from 1960-1990. These data are used courtesy of the University of Minnesota
                                                          A Century of Rents, Page 62


at Minneapolis’s Historical Census Project. The Integrated Public use Microdata

Series32, provides easily accessible datasets and codebooks, and maintains information

on the comparability of each variable in their series over time. Compared to the AHS,

census data does not contain nearly as robust a set of variables and is thus less useful

for understanding the breakdown of quality change over time. The longer time sample

for census data allows us to extend the analysis into history with relative ease.

       Rent and age information is encoded into discrete bins similarly to the AHS’s

build-year variable. This creates artificially low variability in the continuous estimated

rent and age variables used in the hedonic price regressions. This is responsible for the

very high level explained variation seen in each of the Census regressions.

Correspondingly these data also suffer from the same top and bottom code problems

thus eliminating the tails of the distribution as discussed above. They are similarly not

the ideal basis for measures of implied quality change but will perform adequately well.

Sources for Table 1 by column:


1. CPI for rent, 1982-84 = 100, BLS web site, series CUUR0000SEHA, “U. S. City Average, Rent of Primary
Residence, 1982-84 = 100.”


2. Grebler-Blank-Winnick (1956). Total nominal expenditures on aggregate rental expenditures from Table
I-1 on p. 407, averaged together as appropriate. For instance, 1914 is based on the line labeled “1909-19”,
1920 is the average of the lines labeled “1909-19” and “1919-29”, etc. Number of nonfarm households from
Table 23 on p. 82. Mean Gross Rent is aggregate rental expenditures divided by total nonfarm households.


3. Weston (1972), mean rents calculated from Tables 3-3 and 3-4. Table 3-3 contains the number of units
cross-classified by type. Table 3-4 contains rents for each of the types. The mean rent was calculated by
multiplying each cell from those tables to yield rental revenue, summed to equal total revenue in each
year, and then divided by the total number of rental units.

4. Calculated from CNV (Table 11), starting with our 1977 value in column (5) from the AHS data, and
working forward and backward by calculating the CNV annualized growth rates into changes in levels
using antilogarithms (the exponential function). This conversion introduces an unknown degree of error,
because the growth rates calculated by CNV in their appendix 2 (where both levels and growth rates of the
CPI-W are shown) are not accurate calculations of compound growth rates using natural logs.

column (4). 1960-70 from the Census mean contract rent, Table 1, column (5). 1970-75 is the
growth rate from the 1970 Census figure in Table 1, column (5) to the AHS figure in Table 1,
column (6). Growth rates after 1975 all come from the AHS data in Table 1, column (6).

       3. Line 1 minus line 2.

      4abc. See text discussion. Note that the plumbing adjustment is incorporated in the
Weston quality index after 1930, which for this discussion we take to mean 1935.

       4d. Average growth rate of the two quality indexes in Table 9 between 1935 and 1960,
with 1935 interpolated linearly between 1930 and 1940.

        4e. Time dummy coefficient for 1970 vs. 1960 from Table 7, column (2) minus column
(1). 1970-75 is taken as the annual growth rate of 1980 vs. 1970 from Table 7, column (2) minus
column (1).

       4f. From Tables 4, 5, and 6, the annualized growth rate of the time dummy coefficients
in column (4) minus column (1).

       5. The sum of all lines in section 4.

      6. For 1960-70 and 1970-80, the annualized growth rate of the difference in the time
dummy coefficients in Table 7, column (3) minus column (2). For 1975-2003, the annualized
growth rate of the difference in the time coefficients in Tables 4, 5, and 6, column (5) minus
column (4).

       7. Line 2 minus the sum of lines 5 and 6.

       8. Line 1 minus line 7.
