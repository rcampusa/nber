                                          ABSTRACT

This paper examines the implications of a carbon-constrained future on coal-reliant county
governments in the United States. We review modeling projections of coal production under
reference and climate policy scenarios and argue that some state and local governments face
important revenue risks. Complex systems of revenue and intergovernmental transfers, along with
insufficiently-detailed budget data, make it difficult to parse out just how exposed jurisdictions
are to the coal industry. A look at three illustrative counties shows that coal-related revenue may
fund a third or more of their budgets. When the results of regression analysis of 27 coal-reliant
counties are extrapolated outside the sample to the demise of the industry, they suggest these
counties could lose on average about 20 percent of their revenue. This does not account for the
potential downward spiral of other revenues as the collapse of the dominant industry erodes the
tax base. Coal-dependent communities have issued a variety of outstanding bonds that will
mature in a time frame in which climate policy is likely. Our review of illustrative bonds
indicates that municipalities have not appropriately characterized their coal-related risks. Ratings
agencies are only now beginning to document the hazardous exposure of some local governments
to the coal industry. Climate policies can be combined with investments in coal-dependent
communities to support their financial health. A logical source of funding for such investments
would be the revenues from a price on carbon dioxide emissions, a necessary element of any cost-
effective strategy for addressing the risks of climate change. We discuss how a small fraction of
revenue from a federal carbon price in the United States could fund billions of dollars in annual
investments in the economic development of coal-dependent communities and direct assistance to
coal industry workers.

1. Introduction
Some governments across the United States rely heavily on revenues that derive directly or
indirectly from fossil fuel production. Those most reliant on coal face a particularly risky fiscal
future. Coal production in the United States has already declined significantly over the past
decade, and if federal climate policy is implemented, coal production is likely to decline even
more precipitously. In that scenario, coal-dependent jurisdictions will experience a steep fall in
economic activity, shrinking revenue, falling property values, and a dislocated workforce.
Policymakers may be able to head off some of this disproportionate burden with the right mix of
offsetting policies, but much research remains to ascertain the most effective approaches.
We begin with a review of the history of US coal production and projections with and without
new policies, including evidence on where in the United States climate policy will have the
greatest impact on coal production. Then we analyze revenue and budget data for select county
governments across the United States to understand their dependence on coal and how their
fiscal conditions are likely to deteriorate in a carbon-constrained future. We find that coal-related
revenue may fund a third or more of their budgets. Regression analysis of 27 coal-reliant
counties outside the same suggests they could lose on average about 20 percent of their revenue
with the demise of the industry. To learn from other contexts, we consider previous instances in
which geographically concentrated industries have collapsed and explore the extent to which
policy responses buffered the impact. 1
Coal-dependent communities have issued a variety of outstanding bonds, and the risk of collapse
of the coal industry threatens their ability to repay them. Our review of illustrative bonds
indicates that municipalities have not appropriately characterized their coal-related risks. Ratings
reports are only now beginning to document the risks associated with the exposure of some local
governments to the coal industry.
Climate policies can be combined with investments in coal-dependent communities to support
their financial health. A logical source of funding for such investments would be the revenues
from a price on carbon dioxide emissions, a necessary element of any cost-effective strategy for
addressing the risks of climate change. We discuss how a small fraction of revenue from a
federal carbon price in the United States could fund billions of dollars in annual investments in
the economic development of coal-dependent communities and direct assistance to coal industry
workers.
2. Quantifying the fiscal exposure to coal

To understand the coal industry's profound effects on economic conditions in coal-producing
jurisdictions, it helps to reflect on how dramatically production has shifted in recent years and
how climate policy could hasten the decline of the industry. As shown in Figure 1, US coal
consumption nearly tripled between the early 1960s and 2000s, with growth disproportionately
in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. The abundant resource led to fiscal
systems that depended on it, and from a distributional standpoint it made sense to pass the

incidence to out-of-state coal buyers. But between 2007 and 2017, the tide turned, and total coal
production in the United States declined by 32 percent.

As shown in Figure 2, coal remains the second-largest fuel for electricity generation in the
country, trailing only natural gas, and generates over one quarter of all US electricity (EIA
2019a). The United States has not had a federal climate policy, but much like a carbon price
would, the declining price of natural gas over the past decade has made coal-fired power plants
less competitive relative to natural gas-fired power plants (Cullen and Mansur 2017). This has
been the primary driver of the decline in coal use (Conglianese et al. 2020). To a lesser extent,
other factors also drove coal's decline, including declining costs of renewable power, slower-
than-expected increases in US electricity demand (caused by the Great Recession and improved
efficiency), weak exports, and air quality regulations (Houser et al. 2017; Kolstad 2017). Coal-
fired power plant retirements peaked in 2015 when the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards
(MATS) rule went into effect (EIA 2018), but retirements in 2018 were not far behind. As shown
in Figure 3, industrial uses of coal have not offset its decline in the US power sector.

Employment declines for coal workers have largely mirrored coal production levels, but mining
productivity improvements have amplified the trend. At coal's employment peak in the 1920s,
860,000 Americans worked in the industry. In the second half of the 20th century, improvements

in technology began to cut into the coal industry's labor demand, and by 2003, only 70,000 US
coal workers remained. Labor productivity in US coal mining (i.e., tons of coal production per
hour of work by miners) has not increased since the early 2000s (Kolstad 2017), suggesting the
recent decline in employment has been caused primarily by the decline in production levels. As
shown in Figure 4 below, as of March 2020, coal mining employed only about 50,000 people.

The most concentrated job losses have been in Appalachia. Employment in the coal mining
industry declined by over 50 percent in West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky between 2011 and
2016. State-level impacts mask even more severe effects at local levels. In Mingo County, West
Virginia, coal mining employed over 1,400 people at the end of 2011. By the end of 2016, that
number had fallen below 500. Countywide, employment fell from 8,513 to 4,878 over this period
(Houser et al. 2017), suggesting important labor market spillovers from mining to the broader
economy.

                       2.1. The Future of US Coal Production
The decline of the US coal industry thus far begs the question of its future. A wide range of
future outcomes are possible. Even if natural gas prices do not fall further and no new policies
are adopted, projections suggest that coal consumption and production will continue to decline
over the next decade, perhaps to 15 to 25 percent below 2018 levels (Larsen et al. 2018; Energy
Information Administration 2019c). The long run effects of the coronavirus pandemic and its
economic consequences are uncertain, but in the short run, coal demand is down significantly.
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that 2020 US coal production will
total 537 million short tons (MMst) in 2020, down 22 percent from 2019. Lower production
reflects declining demand for coal in the electric power sector, lower demand for US exports,



                                                               6
and a number of coal mines that have been idled for extended periods as a result of COVID-19. 2
To the extent that the sinking global economy also reduces steel demand, a decline in the
production of metallurgical coal is also in the picture.
If policymakers adopt measures to control greenhouse gas emissions, estimates suggest future
declines in coal are likely to be much larger and permanent. This is the even more fraught
scenario facing coal-reliant local governments. An extensive literature explores the potential
effects of different climate policy options in the United States. EIA uses the National Energy
Modeling System (NEMS) to project policy outcomes relative to a no-new-policy reference case.
In its 2018 Annual Energy Outlook, EIA examined the implications of putting a price on
emissions of CO2 from the power sector only. This "side case" imposes a price of $25 per metric
ton of CO2 in 2020, rising at 5 percent over inflation each year thereafter. Under this side case,
EIA projects a rapid decline in total US coal production such that by 2030, total US coal
production will be 77 percent below 2016 levels (see Figure 5).
Figure 5. U.S. Coal Production under EIA $25+/ton Scenario




Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration
EIA projects that the sharpest reduction in coal mining would occur in Wyoming's Powder River
Basin, currently the source of nearly 40 percent of US coal. In EIA's carbon price side case,
Powder River Basin coal production declines by 95 percent between 2016 and 2030. One
explanation is that Powder River Basin coal is overwhelmingly subbituminous coal from surface
mines that is burned at power plants in the United States. EIA projects that coal produced
elsewhere in the western United States would experience a similarly dramatic and rapid decline.

The EIA projections for the $25/ton carbon price scenario also show a collapse in coal
production from the midwestern and southeastern United States, although not quite as rapid as in
the western region. As shown in, coal production from northern Appalachia (accounting for 16
percent of current US production and comprised of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and northern
West Virginia) declines by nearly 80 percent between 2016 and 2030, while production from
central and southern Appalachia and the Eastern Interior region (accounting for a quarter of US
production and comprised of southern West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Virginia, and Tennessee) falls by roughly half over that period.

One should interpret the results from any single energy model with caution given the large
uncertainties in future technologies, economic activity, and behavior of consumers and


                                               8
producers. We focus here on projections from the NEMS model because of its prominence and
its publicly available and regionally disaggregated results.
Other modeling teams have analyzed policies like the EIA side case. They also project that
climate change policy would cause large and rapid declines in the US coal industry, though not
necessarily as rapid as projected by EIA. For example, as part the Stanford Energy Model
Forum project 32 (EMF 32), 11 modeling teams analyzed the impacts of an economy-wide US
CO2 tax starting at $25 per metric ton in 2020 and increasing at 5 percent over inflation per year
(McFarland et al. 2018). Figure 8 displays the results that show that on average, national coal
consumption would fall relative to current levels by about 60 percent by 2030 as compared to a
decline of nearly 80 percent over a similar time period in EIA's power-sector-only $25 per ton
scenario.

Notes: Blue bands represent the range of model results. Darker blue lines show the individual model
results, and the red lines show the average value. The column titles report the initial carbon tax rates per

Few of the EMF 32 modelers estimated the policy's effects on US coal production by region.
One exception is the NewERA model, from NERA Economic Consulting. 3 NERA's results are
similar on a nationwide basis to those of EIA (see Figure 9), although the authors find the
decline is more equally distributed across the east and west regions of the country.

Some may hope that with appropriate research and development, coal could be saved by
deploying carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which strip CO2 from waste gases
and sequester them permanently underground. At one point, this may have been plausible. In
the late 2000s when Congress last seriously debated comprehensive climate change policy, the
American Clean Energy and Security Act 4 included numerous provisions intended to preserve
coal use with CCS technologies. However, the decline since then in coal's economics relative to
natural gas and renewables suggests CCS cannot save the coal industry.
Modeling bears this out. By the time the carbon price is high enough to warrant CCS, coal is
already largely displaced, and CCS comes in with natural gas. Only one of the eleven models
participating in EMF 32 showed any significant deployment of coal-fired electricity with carbon
capture and storage between 2020 and 2040, even in the highest carbon tax scenario
(Environment and Climate Change Canada's multi-sector, multi-region Computable General
Equilibrium model (EC-MSMR)) (McFarland et al. 2018). Another recent study of a federal US
carbon tax that rises to $115 per metric ton by 2030 shows that such a policy could result in
significant deployments of natural gas with CCS (about 15 percent of US generation by 2030)
but no significant deployment of coal with CCS (Kaufman et al. 2019, 17).
To be sure, strong national climate policy in the United States is not certain. Experts have long
recommended strong policy action to reduce emissions, and for years, policy makers have
largely ignored their advice. Nevertheless, with growing support by the public and policy
makers, meaningful climate policy in the United States may be on the horizon, and those
dependent on coal have new risks to manage.

How might the projected declines in coal production translate into revenue declines for state and
local governments? Ideally, we would project coal production in both no-policy and climate
policy scenarios, estimate the respective revenue streams that coal generates, and compare the
two outcomes. This is harder than it sounds.
For one thing, the way state and local governments collect and spend coal revenue varies widely,
and the types of revenue instruments, tax rates, and intergovernmental transfers differ across
states and substate governments (Headwater Economics 2017). For example, in some places and
for some taxes, coal revenue goes directly to county governments and local school districts. In
other cases, it flows to counties or school systems via coal-funded state trust funds, and some
states use coal revenue to pay directly for public services that would otherwise fall to counties,
such as construction and maintenance of county roads. This means that the translation between
coal production and fiscal flows to local governments is complicated.
Even tracking revenues just from sources directly tied to coal is challenging. 5 Typically, state
mineral severance taxes are a percentage of gross or net value at the point of production, but
some states apply it to the volume of production. 6 Severance tax rates and bases vary widely
across and within states, by type of mineral or well or by volume of production. 7 Severance taxes
can apply to production on both private and public land. Owing to variations in both production
quantities and commodity prices, revenue from severance taxes can be volatile. It can also
amplify the fiscal effects of a downturn in the coal industry. For example, in West Virginia,
severance taxes raised $483 million in 2011, or 12 percent of general revenue. In 2016,
severance taxes fell to $262 million, or 6 percent of general revenue.
States also receive royalties, lease bonuses, and rents from mineral production on state lands, and
the federal government gives states a cut of the royalties from production on federal lands in
their jurisdictions. Royalties are a payment for extracted resources, determined by a percentage
of the resources' production value. 8 A lease bonus is a payment to the landowner upon the
signing of the mineral lease. Royalty rates to state governments are typically set in law, but lease
auctions often determine the bonus payments. Lessees may also be subject to annual
administrative fees and rent payments, which are usually a small share of their overall payments
to the state. Royalty receipts vary significantly, owing in part to variation in the patterns of land
ownership across states, even ones that are major fossil energy producers. For example, over 61
percent of the land in Alaska is administered by federal government agencies, whereas the
federal government administers less than 2 percent of Texas land (Vincent, Hanson, and Argueta
2017). As documented by Fitzgerald (2014), western states have retained relatively more state-
owned land and are more likely to have active leasing programs.

The typical federal royalty rate is 12.5 percent of the gross value of production (US Government
Accountability Office 2017). According to Tax Foundation calculations, state governments
receive about 17.5 percent of the royalties the federal government collects (Malm 2013).
Finally, in some cases states set local tax rates and bases, collect taxes, and/or distribute the
revenues. So even when the volume of dollars flowing is clear, who controls the spigots may not
be. Given the wide variation in the channels of fiscal exposure of substate governments to coal,
we focus on the finances of a few illustrative jurisdictions and learn what we can through their
particulars. We chose three illustrative counties in three different states: Campbell County in
Wyoming, Boone County in West Virginia, and Mercer County in North Dakota.

   2.3. Finances of Illustrative Coal-Reliant Counties
The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Economic Research Service defines a county as
"mining dependent" if 8 percent or more of its employment is engaged in the mining industry
(US Department of Agriculture 2019). Applying that threshold to 2015 employment data (the
most recent year available), 27 counties across 10 states in the United States are coal-mining
dependent. Figure 10 shows the top 12 counties, each with more than 13 percent of their 2015
labor force tied to coal mining.

              Figure 10. Top Twelve U.S. Counties by Coal Employment Share




Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
Figure 10 shows that Boone County, West Virginia, and Campbell County, Wyoming, have the
highest labor shares in coal mining. To choose a third county in another state, we skip over tiny
Oliver County, North Dakota (population 1,898) to its larger neighbor, Mercer County




                                                12
(population 8,267). 9 These are three of the most coal-mining dependent counties in the United
States, so they represent the most coal-exposed economies. Further research is necessary to
consider the fiscal implications of climate policy in coal-reliant counties that are also dependent
on natural gas and oil production. Our focus is strictly on coal because modeling suggests that
coal would be the fossil fuel most rapidly and dramatically wrung out of the economy under
climate policies, but we do not intend to suggest that dependence on the other fuels is
unimportant, particularly over the longer run.
While we primarily discuss revenues to the county governments themselves, each county also
contains a collection of municipalities, school systems, and special districts, such as for libraries
and fire departments. Each of these has its own exposure to the coal industry via state funds,
property tax revenues, and the like.
         Boone County, West Virginia
Boone County (population 22,000) lies in southern West Virginia and forms part of the Central
Appalachian coal basin. Along with other southern West Virginia counties, it has long been a
center of coal extraction (US Department of the Interior 2019). The county revenue directly from
coal is primarily from property and severance taxes. Because coal production has already fallen
dramatically in Boone County, its challenges illustrate the trouble that may face other coal-
reliant jurisdictions. Property taxes fund both county governments and school systems in West
Virginia. Proceeds from coal severance taxes flow to local governments primarily via transfers
from the state; percentage points of the 5 percent severance tax goes to the state government. 10
The state distributes 75 percent of the remaining 0.35 percentage points to coal-producing
counties and 25 percent to other counties and municipalities. 11
Coal-producing counties in West Virginia can recapture some of the state's share when they face
budget shortfalls, a policy known as a reallocation tax. This revenue funds the county
commission, jails, community programs, public transit, the health department, and trash
collection activities. The most recent data that distinguish coal-related revenue from other
revenue are from 2015. The numbers suggest that about a third of Boone County's revenues
directly depended on coal in the form of property taxes on coal mines and severance taxes. In
2015, 21 percent of Boone County's labor force and 17 percent of its total personal income were
tied to coal. 12 Coal property (including both the mineral deposit and industrial equipment)
amounted to 57 percent of Boone County's total property valuation. 13 Property taxes on all

   The total assessed valuation for Boone County for 2015 is $1.5 billion as per Levy Rates for the County and Cities
in Boone County 2015, p. 2. The total valuation for coal industrial and mineral property is $840 million, as
calculated from Kent (2016), pp. 13­14. This implies that coal forms about 57 percent of total Boone County
valuation. This is in line with the findings of O'Leary (2011), p. 6, that coal forms about 60 percent of the total
property tax revenue for Boone County.


                                                         13
property generated about half of Boone County's general fund budget, 14 which means that
property taxes just on coal brought in around 30 percent of the county's general fund. Property
taxes on coal also funded about $14.2 million of the $60.3 million school budget (24 percent). 15
In total, coal-related property taxes generated approximately $21 million for Boone County's
schools, the county government, and specific services. 16 In addition, Boone County received
over $1.6 million from severance taxes and an additional $800,000 from the reallocation tax. 17 In
2012, 31 mines in the county produced 16.4 million short tons of coal. Just five years later in
2017, only 11 mines remained, producing only 5.0 million short tons, a 70 percent decline. 18
This resulted in a 50 percent decline in property tax revenue for the county government and a 38
percent decline in its total revenue. 19 Coal prices were fairly flat over the period, so the
relationship is mostly a function of the volumes of coal produced.
Revenue declines have driven painful spending cuts. In 2015, Boone County closed three of its
ten elementary schools (Jenkins 2015). Bankruptcies of coal companies left the county with $8
million in uncollected property tax revenue in 2015 (Kent 2016), and West Virginia passed an
emergency bill for school funding in 2016 to provide for a $9 million shortfall due to one such
bankruptcy (WSAZ News 2016). To make up for these shortfalls, Boone County cut back services
such as its solid waste program. To attract more investment and employment by coal companies,
West Virginia passed two bills in 2019 giving tax breaks to the coal industry. House Bill 3142
reduces for two years the severance tax rate from 5 to 3 percent on coal that is used in power
plants. 20 House Bill 3144 creates a 35 percent investment tax credit that would offset up to 80
percent of a coal company's severance tax liability. 21
        Campbell County, Wyoming
Campbell County (population 46,170) lies in northeast Wyoming in the Powder River Basin. 22 It
is home to the largest coal mine in the world, and mining is its largest sector, employing about 20
percent of the county's labor force (Campbell County Board of County Commissioners 2017). In
Wyoming, coal generates government revenues through four main instruments: property taxes,
federal mineral royalties, coal lease bonuses, and severance taxes. The generation and flow of

these revenues to local governments is complex. 23 Some coal-related revenue goes directly to
local governments. Coal-related revenues to the state travel via various trust funds to a myriad of
substate jurisdictions. Some are targeted to specific local expenditure categories, and some
amounts are contingent on whether a certain revenue threshold is exceeded. If one wanted to
design a fiscal system to obscure local governments' full dependence on coal production, it
would be hard to improve on the current approach in Wyoming.
The composition of 2018 revenues to the Campbell County government appears in Figure 11. 24
The property tax generates more than half of the county's tax revenue. It includes the county tax
on assessed property values and an ad valorem tax on the value of minerals extracted in the
county, including coal, natural gas, and oil. The next-largest revenue sources are the sales and
use tax and intergovernmental transfers.

The coal-specific share of the wedges in Figure 11 are difficult to parse out, but they include the
coal share of the property and production tax, the coal-related share of sales and use tax
proceeds, and some of the transfers from the state and federal governments. According to the
county's 2018 audit statement, mineral production taxes comprise about 81 percent of the
property and production tax, but how much was from coal is not specified. 25
A 2017 special report by the Campbell County Board of Commissioners sheds some light on
this. Of the $5.3 billion in total county assessed property valuation (which includes the value of
minerals produced) in the 2016­17 fiscal year, 89 percent was oil and gas production and coal

mining and their associated production and transportation facilities. 26 More narrowly, 79 percent
was from mineral production, and coal was 75 percent of that, meaning in that year, about 59
percent of the county's overall property and production valuation was directly associated with
coal mining. 27 In that same year, 29 percent of the county's total sales and use tax revenue came
from mining, but the share from coal per se is not reported. Likewise, it is unclear what shares of
intergovernmental transfers flow from state coal-related revenues.
Coal revenues are falling. In 2018, including revenues to the county government, the school
system, and other special districts within the county, the property and production tax in Campbell
County raised over $266 million. This was a sharp decline from 2016, when those collections
were over $317 million. 28
County officials recognize the challenge of a declining coal-related tax base. The county's fiscal
year 2017­18 report addresses the issue directly: Assessed valuation for the 2015­2016 fiscal
year (derived from 2014 calendar year production and property) was $6.2 billion. The assessed
valuation for the 2016­2017 fiscal year declined to $5.3 billion and then to $4.2 billion for the
2017­2018 fiscal year. Proactive decisions by this board, and previous boards, helped to make
this transition as painless as possible because of substantial investments in savings and reserves,
a relatively new age of facilities and plants, and an early retirement incentive that lowered
employment expenses. It is important for Campbell County to effectively plan for a future with
significantly less coal production and the ad valorem taxes that it pays. 29
To prepare for a future with lower coal production, the county established reserve and
maintenance funds for capital replacement, vehicle fleet management, buildings, and recreation
facilities. Nonetheless, concerns are rising that coal production in Wyoming is declining faster
than the area can absorb (Richards 2019). Wind power development in the Midwest is
dampening demand for coal in key markets, and natural gas prices remain low. Layoffs at
Powder River Basin coal mines follow the pandemic-driven declines in power demand.
Like Boone County, Campbell County has experienced the costs of coal-related bankruptcies,
and more could be on the horizon. The 2015 bankruptcy of coal producer Alpha Natural
Resources left Campbell County with over $20 million in unpaid taxes. Campbell County
litigated and collected most of the money, but its legal expenses were significant. Subsequently,
local leaders have called for changes in laws and tax collection structures in Wyoming to place
the interests of taxing entities above investors and creditors (McKim 2018; Campbell County
2018).
        Mercer County, North Dakota
Mercer County is in central North Dakota. Along with its neighbors, McLean County and Oliver
County, Mercer County is home to the largest mines in North Dakota. These counties primarily

produce lignite coal, nearly 80 percent of which is used to generate electricity. In 2015, the
mining sector employed about 15 percent of Mercer County's labor force. 30
Compared to Wyoming and West Virginia, the North Dakota government is less dependent on
the coal industry. 31 However, coal-producing counties like Mercer are highly dependent on coal
and would face major shortfalls if the industry collapses. Three main county revenue streams
derive from coal-related revenue at the state level that the state then transfers to counties and
other substate jurisdictions. The most important is the coal severance tax. The state deposits 30
percent of the revenue from the severance tax into a permanent trust fund that distributes
construction loans to school districts, cities, and counties impacted by coal development. 32 The
remaining 70 percent is distributed to counties. The state also imposes a coal conversion tax on
operators of facilities that produce electricity from coal or convert coal to gaseous fuels or other
products. 33 Third, North Dakota distributes half of its share of federal mineral royalties to
counties in proportion of their mineral production and the other half to school districts. 34
The North Dakota state government provides documentation of its payments to substate
jurisdictions, so we can quantify the flows to Mercer County. According to the North Dakota
state tax website, in 2018, Mercer County government received $1.3 million in coal severance
tax distributions, $0.84 million in coal conversion taxes, and $0.37 million in mineral royalty
distributions.35 We do not know how much of the mineral royalty distribution is related
specifically to coal.
The most recent Mercer County audit report is from 2016, so we can put the coal revenue in
context for that year. According to the audit statement for the year ending December 31, 2016,
the Mercer County general fund received $1.71 million from coal severance taxes, $1.25 million
from coal conversion taxes, and $0.76 million from mineral royalty revenue. 36 Overall county
general revenues were $7.5 million, making the three sources about half of all county revenues.
The exposure is compounded because school districts and other special districts within Mercer
County also receive coal-dependent revenue.

3. Analysis of revenue's relationship with coal production
The three counties illustrate the variety of coal-related fiscal flows in specific areas. Next we
endeavor to generalize the relationship between county-level revenue and coal production across
a broader set of coal-intensive counties. We first calculate county-level revenue from the US
Census Bureau's Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances for the years 2012
through 2017. Revenue includes taxes, intergovernmental transfers, utility and alcohol tax
revenue, and social insurance revenue. In some regressions, labeled "county government
revenue," we include only revenue that goes directly to the county government. In others, labeled
"total revenue," we also include revenue to special (e.g. sewer) and school districts in the county.

We exclude revenue to townships in all cases. We adjust all revenue figures to 2018 dollars
using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers.
We aggregate EIA's mine-level coal production data, which include both surface and
underground coal mines, to compute county-level coal production for each year from 2012 to
2017. We lag the coal production variable by one year to reflect the typical delay between coal
production levels and the subsequent revenue collections. We include in our regression state-
level fixed effects to control for the different revenue structures across states and other time-
invariant state characteristics. We also include year effects to account for broad trends in coal
markets and the macroeconomy.
We include all 27 counties that had (as of 2015) at least 8 percent of their labor force in coal
mining, mirroring the definition of a mining-dependent jurisdiction used by the USDA. The
summary statistics appear in Table 1.

Mean total revenue is roughly triple mean county revenue, demonstrating that revenue to school
and special districts is a large share of overall local fiscal flows.
The regression equation is:
   Revenueit = c + (coal production)it-1 + Si + Yt + it
Revenueit is the total real revenue to county i in year t. The variables Si are the state indicators for
each county. The Yt are the year indicators, and the variables it are the error terms that reflect
random variation in revenue. The estimated coefficient  is the relationship between lagged coal
production and revenue to the county. We specify the relationship as linear rather than log
because many of the revenue sources tied to coal, such as severance taxes and royalties, are
linear functions of production levels. Of course, by the time the revenue gets to counties the
relationship is not that simple, but in principle linear should be a better fit than log.
The results from the regressions appear in Table 2. The two columns show the results for all 27
counties. Column 1 includes the expansive measure of revenue (for example including school
district revenue), and column 2 includes only revenue that goes directly to the county
government.

In both regressions, the estimated coefficient on coal production is positive and significantly
different from zero. 37 The magnitude of the coefficient is more than double for total revenue as
it is for the more limited county revenue. This suggests that coal features significantly in the
revenue streams for schools and other special districts.
The regression coefficient of 0.812 on the coal production variable indicates that a decrease in
coal production of 1,000 short tons will decrease expected total revenue by $812. In 2018, the
national average sale price for coal was $36 per short ton. 38 At that price, a decrease of 1,000
short tons is a decrease of $36,000 in coal sales, holding everything else constant. The average
decrease in coal production for the mining-intensive counties from 2012 to 2017 was 3.5 million
short tons per county. Applying the estimated coefficient, this would have produced an average
decrease in total revenue of $2.8 million per county from 2012 to 2017. Given that mean total
revenue is over $95 million, this is not that worrisome. On the other hand, this relationship (if it
holds outside the sample) would imply that if all coal production were eliminated in a county
with mean coal production of about 22.9 million short tons, as shown in Table 1, expected total
revenue would decrease by about $18.6 million, or about 20 percent of mean total revenue.

In the context of the total collapse of the industry locally, one might expect non-linear revenue
declines as a downward spiral in non-coal revenues (such a property and sales taxes) and
economic conditions develops. As explored in the next section, experiences from other contexts
illustrate how the rapid demise of a dominant industry can create negatively reinforcing
deterioration in local fiscal conditions, including tax capacity, credit worthiness, and public
service provision.


37
   We also perform the analysis with data from only the top 20 most coal mining dependent counties, which all have
more than 10 percent of the labor force in coal mining. For the regressions on total revenue, we find that the
estimated coefficient on coal production is statistically significant and a little larger for the full set of 27 counties
(0.74) than it is for the top 20 most coal-intensive counties (0.54). For county revenue, the estimated coefficients are
nearly the same.

4. Experience from other contexts
The previous section illustrated how certain counties in the United States are directly dependent
on the coal industry for revenue. Indirect dependencies are important as well but are more
difficult to quantify. But we do know from experience, when a major industrial employer
collapses, service sector economic activity could also collapse, leading to lower revenues from
sales taxes and amplifying the fiscal stress. In addition, as residents migrate out of the area in
search of jobs, they may leave behind unsaleable vacant homes, further depressing property
values and tax revenue. The social safety net in the United States has arguably shown its
weaknesses in such circumstances, and in the next section we consider the policy implications of
the risks for coal country.
Instructive examples of these downward spirals abound through history, both in the United States
and abroad. In many cases the collapse begins in a resource industry, such as silver, whaling,
fisheries, old growth forestry, and kelp. Often, exacerbating factors include technological change
and shifts in comparative advantage across different locations. For example, coal-producing
areas of the United Kingdom, steel towns in Pennsylvania, and Detroit, with an economy
dominated by the automobile industry, all endured the decline of their major industry, and they
all experienced a collapse in fiscal conditions, resulting in prolonged periods of attempts at
revitalization and dependence on external financial support. While each decline arose from
different factors in very different geographies, the fiscal impacts have strong parallels.
A search for successful precedents for the kind of economic transition that will be necessary in
coalfield areas comes up wanting. Although policymakers have targeted federal assistance to a
number of abrupt economic transitions, the most successful examples are quite different than the
challenges facing coal country. For example, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, 39
a.k.a. the GI Bill, offered an extraordinary opportunity for soldiers returning from World War II
to get an education, buy a home, start a business, and build a new future. The program was a
major political and economic success and arguably set the course for strong post-war economic
growth. However, the opportunities available to healthy twenty-somethings who can move
anywhere to work or study are not the same as those facing small rural towns and older families
that have had the whole economic rug pulled out from under them.
One might look the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program, which provides
assistance for those negatively affected by freer trade. The results of TAA assistance are mixed.
Some data suggest that program participants who leave the labor force for extended training
(particularly older workers) can lose ground relative to otherwise similar non-participants. This
research suggests that job training programs must be carefully designed and delivered to ensure
they truly benefit their participants.
Another possible model arises in the way the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) assists local
economic transitions when it closes military bases, makes major adjustments in workforce levels,
or ends large defense contracts. In most instances, communities have the advantage of advance
notice of the major DoD changes and can plan ahead to minimize the economic dislocation.
Also, unlike with most abandoned mines, in many cases the DoD leaves behind buildings,

airports, and other infrastructure that communities can convert to commercial purposes.
Nonetheless, technical and financial support for local economic diversification planning appears
to be a useful coordinating role for the federal program.

5. Municipal Bonds
Local governments are not the only ones with risks tied to coal. To the extent that they have
issued bonds or taken on other debt, those creditors could share in their jeopardy. Municipal
bond market participants have only begun to acknowledge the unique risks facing jurisdictions
that rely on coal production. In part this may be because municipal bonds are generally
considered safe assets. According to analysis by the ratings agency Moody's, recent default rates
in this market were approximately 0.18 percent, a rate that is significantly lower than that of
corporate bonds (Muni Facts 2019).
Governments that issue bonds are legally required to disclose risks that could affect their ability
to pay back investors, both when the bonds are issued and throughout their lifetimes. In primary
offerings, the bond issuers must produce an "official statement," a document informing investors
about the issuer and the project. Bonds from coal-reliant jurisdictions make up a small share of
overall subfederal US debt. In 2018, the issuances for top coal-producing state governments
comprised only about 10 percent of the national total of $388 billion. The share of bonds issued
by regions in coal-dependent communities within these states is even smaller. Table 3 lists some
of the active bonds issued in two of the three coal-dependent counties discussed in section 2.3. 40
The Boone County government had no active issuances. 41

Most bonds fund construction of facilities such as hospitals and solid waste disposal facilities,
for which repayment would ostensibly come from the income and fees associated with the
facility. Principal amounts range from $3.5 million to $445 million. The bond terms range over
20 to 30 years, maturing between 2022 and 2039. In the climate policy projection in Figure 5.
U.S. Coal Production under EIA $25+/ton Scenario, US coal production in 2030 falls by about
77 percent below 2016 levels. Thus, much of the bond interest payments and the principal
payment could be due during a period of precipitous decline in the coal industry.




                                                 22
The official statements for the bonds in Table 3 document their amounts, maturity provisions,
trustees, underwriters, and other details. The statements vary widely in their discussion of
bondholders' risks. There is no standard format for the statements, and it takes careful reading
to dig out any important details disclosing material risks. Some statements allude vaguely to
exposure to government policy and economic conditions, while others make no mention of risks
of any kind. Only two describe the potential for policies that regulate CO2 to have "a significant
impact" on the relevant facilities. None discuss the important connections between climate
policy, coal production, and the economic and fiscal conditions of local communities.
For example, the statement for the first bond in the table, which funds a hospital construction
project, highlights bondholders' risks such as changes in Medicare and Medicaid policies. With
regard to other risks, it reads as follows:
       Future economic and other conditions, including demand for
       healthcare services, the ability of the District to provide the services
       required by residents, public confidence in the District, economic
       developments in the service area, competition, rates, costs, third-
       party reimbursement and governmental regulations may adversely
       affect revenues and, consequently, payment of principal of and
       interest on the Series 2009 Bonds.
So it notes the relevance of "economic developments in the service area" but does not explain
what that might mean. The statement lacks any recognition of the prospects or local impacts of
greenhouse gas regulation, which in 2009 was a lively debate in Congress. Indeed, an appendix
describes the local coal-based economy in positive terms:
       Campbell County, known as the energy capital of the nation, is located in the heart of
       the resource rich Powder River Basin. Over 30% of the nation's coal is produced in area
       surface mines. Over 25% of Campbell County jobs are mineral-based, directly attributed
       to coal mining, oil and gas extractions, and supporting operations.
The statement also lists mining and energy companies as the top ten taxpayers in the county.
Let us consider the other bonds in the table. The second bond finances costs related to a facility
that handles waste coal. The third bond finances costs of pollution control facilities at a power
plant. Neither of the official statements discusses bondholders' risks.
The fourth bond funds solid waste disposal and sewage treatment facilities at Dry Fork Station,
a coal-fired power plant. The risk factors the issuance discloses are reasonably comprehensive
and, although not quantitative, characterize the broad array of environment-related factors that
could affect the net revenue from the power plant. The documented risks include the large
amount of long-term debt the power company is incurring, along with potential delays or
termination of the project owing to opposition from environmental groups and/or regulatory
measures. The statement also notes that the company may rely on technology that becomes less
competitive, and it describes how laws and regulations related to climate change may
"adversely affect our operations and future financial performance." It even mentions the cap-
and-trade legislation passed by the House of Representatives in June 2009 and potential
environmental regulation in states that purchase power from the project. However, the


                                                 23
document does not address risks to the economy of the surrounding community. If the coal
economy collapses and demand for power declines along with it, we have no information about
what that would mean for bondholders' risks.
The fifth bond in the table, a general obligation bond issued by Mercer County, North Dakota,
includes just one sentence describing risks (p. 80): "Mercer County is exposed to various risks
of loss relating to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and omissions;
injuries to employees; and natural disasters." It lists the major employers, which include energy
and mining companies, and the Revenue Obligations page notes that "[d]ebt is supported by
coal severance and conversion tax receipts." Most of the ledgers reporting tax receipts do not
break down tax revenues related to coal and other sources, but one that does (p. 16 of an
attached audited financial statement for 2013) shows that of about $7 million in general
revenues for Mercer County, about $3.3 million came from the coal severance and conversion
taxes. This extreme dependence on coal production seems an obvious material risk, yet the
statement includes no discussion of it.
The statement for the sixth bond, another pollution control issuance for energy operations, reads
much like the fourth bond, including a discussion of climate and water quality regulations. It
also highlights risks associated with natural gas prices and Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission policy. However, like the fourth bond, the document does not address risks
associated with the economy of the surrounding community.
The seventh bond lists factors affecting the business operations of the company:
       Future Economic Conditions. The Company's operations and financial performance may
       be adversely affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the
       Company's ongoing involvement in diversification efforts, the timing and scope of
       deregulation and open competition, growth of electric revenues, impact of the
       investment performance of the utility's pension plan, changes in the economy,
       governmental and regulatory action, weather conditions, fuel and purchased power
       costs, environmental issues, resin prices, and other factors discussed from time to time in
       reports the corporation files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It is interesting that resin prices rise to the significance of specific mention, whereas the
potentially calamitous effects of climate policy on coal production do not.
In principle, investors can turn to ratings agencies for guidance. Ratings agencies have assessed
most of the bonds in table 3, ranging from Baa to Aaa, with most bonds falling somewhere in
between. In some instances, ratings reports are not much better than official statements in
describing the risks, and sometimes they are worse. For example, Fitch gave the seventh bond in
the table an A+ rating in 2015, highlighting only the upside potential of energy development
and indicating no risk associated with climate or other environmental policies.
That said, some ratings are shifting and ratings agencies are paying new attention to coal-
dependent regions. Two of the seven bonds in the table received systematic downgrades from
ratings agencies, with exposure to coal cited as a factor in the ratings agencies' reviews. None
have received an upgrade. For example, in 2018 Moody's downgraded the fifth bond in table 3
to Baa1 "based on the county's narrowed financial position following consecutive years of


                                                  24
declines in liquidity driven by negative expenditure variances. The rating also reflects the
county's moderate tax base with consecutive years of tax base growth, but with some
concentration in coal mining and power generation, strong demographics, low fixed costs and
debt burden with moderate pension burden." Still, even Moody's downgraded rating places the
security as "investment grade" with only "moderate credit risks." 42
According to a 2019 report from S&P Global Ratings, "For nearly a decade, U.S. coal
production has been on the decline. Global efforts to stem emissions of carbon dioxide from
fossil fuels and the availability of cheap alternative renewable energy sources will limit future
growth of coal production. In S&P Global Ratings' opinion, reliance on coal-related revenue
and economic activity, absent diversification, may result in long-term credit deterioration for
some U.S. government entities...Severance tax volatility, eroding property tax assessments, and
economic decline are the major credit factors affecting coal-reliant regions (2019)."

6. Conclusions and implications for policy

Coal industry jobs in the United States have declined for decades due to labor-saving
automation. In recent years, coal demand and production have begun to fall as well, owing
primarily to lower cost alternatives. Economic modeling shows this decline will dramatically
steepen under a price on carbon or regulatory program. While obstacles remain, momentum for
federal climate change policy is growing in the United States and threatening the fiscal future of
coal-reliant areas.

Several policy implications arise. First, diversifying a rural economy that is deeply integrated
with a particular industry is a difficult task, but it is central to long run sustainability ­ as is a
more diverse revenue base. Attracting new non-fossil business investment may bring new
residents and demands on public services. Unless the tax system includes non-mineral revenue
instruments like property and sales taxes, an inflow of residents can be a net negative on district
budgets. Some jurisdictions may be able to attract new businesses by offering favorable
business environments and by investing in local infrastructure that makes the area a more
desirable place to live. The town of Greenville, South Carolina, is one example. Once the
"textile center of the world," a combination of incentives and attractive amenities helped
Greenville transform into a popular destination for new businesses. 43
Second, economic revitalization will require large investments and thus significant external
support for already-struggling coal-dependent communities and workers. A federal carbon tax
could provide tens to hundreds of billions of dollars per year in new federal government
revenues, a small fraction of which could be devoted to coal communities and workers. For
example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates that a greenhouse gas tax starting at
$25 per ton of CO2 equivalent, rising at 2 percent over inflation each year could raise over $1
trillion over 10 years. 44 Polling suggests that American households would be willing to spend
carbon tax revenues on assisting displaced workers in the coal industry by enough to

compensate each miner nearly $146,000 (Kotchen et al. 2017). External support does not
necessarily need to be funded with carbon pricing. For example, in 2019 some Democratic
presidential candidates pledged generous support for displaced fossil fuel workers, including
wage supplements, healthcare, housing, relocation assistance, and job training.
The question arises how and how much money should be spent to best ameliorate the burdens in
coal country. Relatively straightforward options include temporarily backfilling lost state and
local coal-related revenue, supplementing miners' pension and health benefits, replenishing
funds for black lung disease benefits, and paying to reclaim areas mined by bankrupt companies.
Other options, such as workforce and community development and water quality remediation,
may be important to a successful transition but the optimal approaches may vary widely across
different locations. Health needs also vary locally. As discussed in Metcalf and Wang (2019),
some coal-reliant areas are pummeled by opioid addiction. To the extent feasible, it could make
sense to bolster health benefits and economic development with additional substance abuse
assistance.

Further research is needed to elaborate these and other approaches as well as to estimate
appropriate funding levels. A brief review suggests spending in some categories would range in
the tens of billions of dollars cumulatively over the coming decades -- still quite small relative
to potential carbon pricing revenue. For example, the Black Lung Benefits Act 45 provides
monthly payments and medical benefits to coal miners disabled by lung disease from their job.
Currently under-financed by an excise tax on coal, the Black Lung Liability Trust Fund's
cumulative outstanding shortfall could exceed $15 billion by 2050. 46
Mine reclamation is another potential line item that could also create local jobs. By law, mine
operators must restore the land (federal or private) to a condition no worse than that supporting
the uses the land could support before mining. However, some firms have not appropriately
planned for their cleanup liabilities, both because they have insufficiently bonded and because
some states have allowed them to "self-bond," that is to underwrite the reclamation guarantees
with the assets of the firm rather than through third-party contracts. According to the US
Department of the Interior, total unfunded costs for reclamation of about $10.7 billion could fall
to states and tribes (Congressional Research Service 2020). This number could grow
substantially with more coal mining bankruptcies.

Environmental and cost effectiveness arguments also support prompt and thorough reclamation.
Ongoing drainage from coal mines can contaminate drinking water and soil, causing long-term
health damages, disrupting aquatic organisms, and corroding infrastructure. If residents cannot
even drink their local water, attracting new investment could be nearly impossible. About 28
percent of coal-rich Central Appalachian water streams are impaired by mine drainage. 47 In West
Virginia, the cost of correcting acidic mine drainage-related problems with currently available

technology is estimated at $5 to $15 billion.48 Rapidly addressing water quality can minimize
damages and lower overall cleanup costs (Kefeni et al. 2017).
Some may argue that if states have to absorb under-funded cleanup costs, it is the natural
consequence of allowing industries to capture their regulators and federal taxpayers should not
bail them out. However, lifting the reclamation burden from coal states (perhaps with the proviso
of no further self-bonding) and otherwise ameliorating the disproportionate burdens of climate
policy on coal-reliant areas may be critical elements of a deal that enables the adoption of federal
climate policy.
