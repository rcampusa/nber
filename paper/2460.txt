                International Capital Mobility and Tax Evasion




                                  ABSTRACT




    This paper studies the welfare effects of international investment to evade

domestic taxes on domestic investment income. Capital mobility for tax evasion

eliminates distortions in the intertemporal allocation of consumption, but

introduces distortions in domestic production. Conversely, a regime where

residents pay taxes on all investment income, domestic and foreign, introduces

distortions in intertemporal consumption allocation, but leaves domestic

production distortion-free. The relative magnitude of the interest elasticity

of savings and the interest elasticity of domestic investment determines the

welfare effects of capital movements for the purpose tax evasion.

1.    Introduction

       In an open economy, foreign investment is often used as a means of evading

taxes on wealth, or on capital assets' income. The purchase of foreign assets

makes it easy to evade taxes for three reasons: (a) ownership of foreign assets

by domestic residents cannot always be verified and tracked by tax authorities;

(b) some governments (like the US government currently) do not levy withholding

taxes on income from domestic securities accruing to foreign residents; (c) in

many countries it is possible to defer the payment of taxes on foreign assets'

income, by deferring the repatriation of such income. The complexity of

national tax codes, and the differences of tax codes from country to country, in

many cases blur the distinction between (illegal) tax evasion, and (legal) tax

avoidance, and multiply the opportunities of the private sector to minimize tax

payments through international transactions   1
       This paper presents the simple analytics of tax evasion through

international capital mobility. It discusses the general-equilibrium effects of

tax evasion and evaluates its impact on domestic welfare, under the assumption

that the distortionary taxes on capital income cannot be removed.

       International capital mobility and the constraints it imposes or'

macroeconomic policies are the central issues of theoretical and empirical




1
     In this paper I use the term "evasion" to denote all transactions motivated by
     the desire to minimize tax payments. Given the current state of international
     tax laws, many such transactions are in fact legal. This paper is not
     concerned with the resource cost of breaking the law, and the resources used
     to enforce the law. For the purpose of my analysis, the distinction between
     tax avoidance and tax evasion is inconsequential.

research in international economics.2 Surprisingly, however, few papers have

analyzed the repercussions of changes in taxes on international capital flows,

and, as a consequence, on the domestic economy. Among the recent examples,

Aizensnan [1985] studies the optimal combination of the inflation tax, capital

controls, and tariffs, for the purpose of raising a given amount of government

revenue, in an economy without production;3 Stockman and Hernadez [1985]

discuss taxes on the purchase of foreign currency in a general-equilibrium asset

pricing model, while Gordon and Varian [1986] consider the optimal structure of

capital-asset taxes in an international capital asset pricing model; Frenkel and

Razin [1987] analyze the effects of tax reforms on international borrowing and

lending in a two-country world; Tornell [1987] and Velasco [1987] argue that

capital controls might be desirable as second-best devices in the presence of

distortionary taxation.

       International capital flows to evade domestic wealth and capital-income

taxes are likely to be a widespread phenomenon, especially among developing

countries.4 Tanzi [1983], reviewing the structure of tax revenues in developing

countries, notes that (i) income tax revenue is accounted for almost exclusively

by taxation of wages; (ii) in poor countries the revenue from corporate income

taxes is very low; (iii) wealth taxes account for an almost insignificant

    For a recent survey on international capital mobility, see Obstfeld [1986].

    Extending the optimal tariff literature to account for international capital
    mobility, Kemp [1966] and Jones [1967] study the optimal combination of
    tariffs and taxes on international investment.

    See, for example, Walter [1986].

2. The Model

      I consider a one-good, two-period model of an open economy.6 Domestic

residents consume in period 1 and period 2, and can transfer wealth

intertemporally by investing in domestic capital or by purchasing (or selling)

foreign bonds. The government taxes only income from domestic investments. Tax

revenues are used to finance "infrastructures" that provide a positive

externality to domestic residents. The government does not spend in the first

period: thus there is no government debt. Taxes, however, are known by domestic

residents at the time investment decisions are made.

      I study a small country, and assume that the foreign interest rate is

given. This case is both a useful theoretical benchmark, since it helps to

highlight all the basic effects that are at work also in a two-country world,

and a reasonable empirical paradigm, since in many countries the size of

international capital flows is too small to affect the world rate of interest.

Foreign residents can lend resources to domestic residents, but do not have

direct access to the domestic technology. Any taxes paid to the local

government, on income from loans to domestic residents, are instantaneously

rebated through international tax treaties. These assumptions imply that

domestic residents can borrow from the rest of the world at a given rate of

interest, which I take to equal the world lending rate.

      The consumers' problem is:




6
    This model is also used by Obstfeld [1987]. Bhagwati [1978] stresses the
    importance of the effects of taxation and exchange controls on savings for
    welfare analysis.
                                       3



fraction of total tax revenue. These facts are in principle consistent with the

view that international capital mobility imposes severe constraints on fiscal

authorities. Dornbusch [1987] argues that the repeal of withholding taxes on US

government securities might have been an important determinant of capital flight

from Latin American countries. Giovannini [1987], discussing the interwar

experience in Italy, indicates that, during those years, international capital

flows to evade wealth taxes were possibly very large.5

     Section 2 of this paper presents a two-period model of savings, investment,

and the current account, where government spending can be financed only by

levying distortionary taxes. The welfare effects of international investment

for tax evasion are discussed in section 3. Section 4 endogenizes government

spending, showing the open-economy effects of dynamic inconsistency and

"discretionary" equilibria studied by Fischer [1980] and Kydland and Prescott

[1980] in closed-economy models. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.

An appendix proves the equivalence between quantitative controls on

international investment and a regime of uniform taxation of income from

domestic and foreign assets.




 Although, to my knowledge, there is no systematic econometric evidence
 relating international capital flight to tax evasion and changes in tax rates,
 there is a substantial literature attempting to quantifying tax evasion in the
 US. See Poterba [1987] for a review and tests relating capital-gains tax
 evasion to capital-gains tax rates.

Where C1 and C2 stand for consumption in the two periods; C is government

spending; A represents the stock of foreign assets accumulated in period 1, i.e.

the current account surplus in period 1; K2 is the stock of productive capital

in period 2, which equals the rate of investment in period 1, and K is the

exogenous initial allocation of resources. f(K2) is a decreasing-returns-to-

scale production technology, yielding output in period 2. In the production
                                                                        *
process,   the capital stock depreciates completely. r is the tax rate; r the

world interest rate. In this section and in section 3 I analyze the effects of

tax evasion by assuming that r--or C--is exogenously given. As equations (1)-

(3) suggest, the government could clearly optimize tax collection and spending:

in section 4 I study equilibria in the presence of a maximizing government.

     Equations (4)-(5) and (2)-(3) are the first order conditions for the

consumption-savings and portfolio-allocation problem of the consumer:



                                      1+r*                                  (4)
                       f'(K2)(l-r)

                       U1(C1,C2) =                                          (5)
                                     (l+r*)U2(C1,C2)


Equation (4) determines domestic investment: the domestic capital stock is such

that its after-tax marginal productivity equals the world interest factor, l+r*.

This portfolio allocation rule insures that the net return on savings is always

equal to the world interest rate. Equation (5) is the standard Euler equation,
                                        6


setting the marginal rate of substitution between present and future consumption
                                                   *
equal to the marginal rate of transformation, l+r .    Given domestic investment,

equation (5), together with (2) and (3), determine consumption, savings and the

current account.

     Figure 1 shows the determination of equilibrium with r=O. The bowed-out

production-possibility frontier characterizes the domestic technology. Maximum

consumption at time 1 equals the stock of available resources, K, plus the

present discounted value (at the world rate of interest) of future investment

income. The investment in domestic capital is determined by the equality of the

marginal return on domestic and on foreign investment, i.e. the tangency of the

production possibility frontier with the world interteniporal terms of trade- - the
                         *
BB line with slope -(l+r ).   Savings, the current account, and consumption in
the two periods are determined by the tangency of the consumption indifference

curve and the BB line.

     Figure 2 illustrates the effects of distortionary taxes in the presence of

tax evasion. Equalization of the after-tax return on domestic investment with

the world interest rate decreases the domestic capital stock and domestic

production: the fall in K2 is caused by tax evasion, which takes place because

domestic residents can substitute home capital with foreign securities. The

production distortion originating from the tax, however, does not affect the

marginal rate of substitution between present and future consumption, since the

fall in domestic investment insures that the net return on savings is r*. The

budget line shifts further down and to the left, from B'B' to B"B", since tax

revenue is not rebated in a lump sum fashion to consumers, but is used to

provide for utility-generating "infrastructures." At the consumption point C',
                                             7



the vertical distance between the lines B'B' and B"B" is equal to tax revenue

and government spending. Consumption at time 2 is accordingly decreased, for

every level of investment. What is the effect of the distortionary tax on

savings? If present and future consumption are normal goods, an increase in r

increases savings, whereas savings decreases if future consumption is an

inferior good. Since portfolio substitution insures that the rate of return on

savings is unchanged, savings is here affected exclusively by the income effect

of the tax increase.

     The effects of tax evasion can be evaluated by studying the case where

residents cannot evade domestic taxes by purchasing foreign securities: income

from all assets, domestic and foreign, is taxed at the same rate. When tax

evasion is not possible, the intertemporal budget constraint has to be changed.

Equation (3) becomes:



                       C2 =   (lr)[A(l+r*)   +
                                                 f(K2)]                    (3')




Equation (3') implies that domestic residents can deduct foreign interest

payments- -when A is negative- -from taxable income. The first-order condition

for the consumption and portfolio-allocation problem are:



                               f'(K2) =   l+r*                             (4')

                  U1(C1,C2) =     (l+r*)(lr)U2(C1,C2)                      (5')




Figure 3 illustrates the effects of the tax distortions in this case.

Investment and the domestic capital stock are now unaffected by changes in r.
                                       8


Thus international capital mobility now prevents capital income taxes from

distoring the production side of the economy.7 By contrast, as indicated by

(5'), the relevant rate of interest for savings is now the after-tax world

interest rate.

     The BB" line shows the consumption possibilities of domestic residents. At

point B, first-period consumption equals the sum of the present discounted value

(at world interest rates) of second-period output and the initial endowment K,

second-period consumption equals zero, the revenue from taxation of domestic

production identically offsets the tax rebates on foreign interest payments, and

government spending is zero. The vertical distance between the BB" line and the

production point P is the revenue from taxation of domestic production.

Equilibrium consumption, government spending, and the structure of tax revenues

can be easily characterized as indicated in the figure. Line B'B' shows the

consumption possibilities of domestic residents before taxation of foreign

assets' income. The vertical distance between BB and B'B' is the revenue from

the tax on domestic income, while the distance between BB" and B'B' is the

revenue (or outlay) from foreign interest income (or payments). What is the

response of savings to an increase in taxes? In the absence of tax evasion,

intertemporal substitutability in consumption tends to decrease savings, while

the income effect- -if both periods' consumption levels are normal goods- -

increases savings. Thus the response of savings to an increase in the tax rate
is ambiguous, because of conflicting income and substitution effects, just like




 Notice that this would not happen in a closed economy, see, for example,
 Diamond [1970]
                                        9



in the standard partial-equilibrium exercise.




3. The Welfare Effects of Capital Flows for Tax Evasion

      A comparison of two regimes described in section 2. allows to determine

whether tax evasion through international capital mobility lowers national

welfare. The literature on optimal taxation provides the framework for the

comparison.8 The problem studied by the optimal taxation literature is finding

the structure of taxes that minimizes the deviation (in terms of welfare) from

the nondistorted, pre-tax equilibrium.9 The general prescription is to tax

those goods with a smaller demand elasticity: this criterion insures that the

after-tax allocation of resources is closest to the pre-tax, nondistorted

optimum.

      To carry out the welfare comparison of the two regimes, it is convenient to

assume that both taxes on savings and capital income are available. The budget

constraint can be rewritten after solving out the current account in the first

period:




8
    For surveys of the optimal taxation literature, see Sandmo [1976], and
    Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980] . Horst [1980] and Findlay [1986] use the same
    techniques to evaluate double taxation of international income flows and the
    optimal structure of international tax treaties.

    The same question can be asked with the model in this paper, since the utility
    function is assumed to be separable in consumption and government spending.

                                                                                     (6)
                       (1-r2)(1+r*)                   (lr2)(1+r*)


The tax rate on income from domestic investment is r1, while the savings tax

rate is r2. Equation (6) comprises the two extreme cases studied above. In the

presence of tax evasion,     =   0 and     0 0. With uniform taxation,             = 0 and

   o 0. As above, the required rate of return on domestic investment is

determined by the international arbitrage condition:



                    f'(K2)(l-r1-r2) =    (1+r*)(ir2)                                 (7)




Maximization of (1), subject to (6) and (7), leads to the following indirect

utility function:


                                        *
                            W((l-r2)(l+r ), K+Y)                                     (8)




where Y is the net present value of domestic investment projects- -i.e. the last

two terms on the right-hand side of equation (6)--a function of r1, r2 and r*.

An application of the envelope theorem shows:



      dY/dr1 =   - [(lr2)(l+r*)],        dY/dr2 =    ri/[(l+r*)(lr2)2I               (9)




     Since C is exogenous, the welfare effects of tax evasion can be analyzed by

minimizing the welfare loss of raising a given tax revenue.               The problem is
                                                11


formally stated as follows:



                             MAX W((lr2)(l+r*), K+Y)                                                (10)

                             s.t. r2[A(l4r*) +                 +               =   G                (11)
                                                     f(K2)]        r1f(K2)


(l0)-(ll) can be solved using (7) and (9). The first order conditions are:



            W2r1         =            *                           *           +    df(K)

And equation (11). Wi and W2 are the partial derivatives of the W function with

respect to its first and second argument, respectively. A is the Lagrange

multiplier associated with the revenue constraint (11).

     Equations (12) and (13) do not have a closed-form solution, even assuming

special functional forms for W and f. Furthermore, the optimal r1 and                                 are

normally both different from zero, i.e. neither of the regimes studied above is

optimal according to the criterion just outlined. However, the immediate

implication of the optimal-tax solution is that tax evasion is welfare-inferior

when the optimal level of          is much smaller than optimal r2.

     The structure of the problem, and in particular the determinants of tax

revenue, provide some intuition for the conditions that make                              = 0 and          0

(no tax evasion) preferable to      ' 0 and      — 0 (the tax evasion case). The

left hand side of equations (12) and (13) are affected by the parameters of the

indirect utility function. Notice that the larger the intertemporal

substitution elasticity, the larger the (positive) effect of an increase in the

after-tax world interest rate on indirect utility (the larger is W1), and

consequently the smaller the optimal level of the savings tax. The right-hand

side of (12) and (13) are affected by the marginal tax revenue. In the presence

of tax evasion, an increase in taxes generates a fall in the domestic capital

stock that is larger, the closer the production technology is to constant

returns to scale. Differentiating equation (7) when           0 and r2 =   0, we
obtain:



                                               f' (K2)
                                                                               (14)
                              dr1            (lrl) f"(K2)


     The closer the production technology to constant returns the smaller (in

absolute value) the denominator on the right-hand side of (14), and therefore

the larger the fall in the domestic capital stock after an increase in taxes.

The elasticity of returns to scale of the domestic investment technology

determines, in this open economy, the interest elasticity of domestic

investment.

     In the presence of tax evasion, an increase in r brings about a fall of

domestic investment, and of second-period GDP, that is positively related to the

elasticity of returns to scale of the domestic investment technology. In a

regime of uniform taxation (r1 = 0 and r2       0), by contrast, a clmnge in the tax
                                        13


rate does not affect the domestic capital stock, but gives rise to a large

deviation from the initial allocation of resources if the Lntertemporal

substitution elasticity is large. An increase in the tax rate decreases the

rate of return on savings. With a positive interest elasticity of savings,

domestic residents borrow from abroad, thus reducng the second-period total tax

bill. The response is larger, the larger the elasticity of intertemporal

substitution in consumption. Therefore, a regime of uniform taxation should be

preferable if domestic and foreign investment opportunities are similar, so that

the interest elasticity of domestic investment is large, while the interest

elasticity of savings is relatively small.

     Since closed-form solutions to (12) and (13) cannot be obtained, I perform

numerical simulations by assuming the following funactional forms for U and f:



                     U(C1,C2) = [        +

                     f(K2)    (l/a)K


Under these assumptions, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and the

elasticity of returns to scale are constant, and equal to 1/0 and a,
                                             *
respectively.   In the simulations, K    1, r = 0.3, and &   0.25.   I study the

effects of varying a and 9 by computing the welfare loss of tax evasion for C

equal to 10, 20 and 30 percent of first-period GNP. The welfare loss is the

difference of U(C1,C2) under uniform taxation and U(C1,C2) with tax evasion,

scaled by the marginal utility of first-period consumption (in the uniform

taxation regime), and divided by first-period GNP.

     In the top panel, with a=0.4, 0=4 and G=30 percent of GNP, international
                                      14


tax evasion makes second-period GDP fall by roughly 10 percent, and gives rise

to a loss equivalent to 1.2 percent of GNP. In the second panel I double the

elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, with the result that

the welfare loss of tax evasion at C = 30 percent of CNP is roughly halved. The

two bottom panels in the table show the cases where domestic investment and

production are almost unaffected by tax evasion and changes in taxes, because

is very small. In these cases tax evasion is welfare-superior to a regime of

uniform taxation, especially when the intertemporal substitution elasticity

equals 2 (9=0.5), as in the bottom panel of the table.1°




10 Clearly, these simulations give more than a fair chance to tax evasion: the
   welfare cost of tax evasion should be computed relative the the solution of
   the optimal-tax problem outlined above, where both domestic-investment income
   and savings are taxed, i.e. both r1 and r2 are different from zero.

4. The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans: Capital Levies and Capital Flight

        In this section I make the tax rate endogenous, and discuss optimal fiscal

policies. The government maximizes the representative individual's utility

function, taking the optimal responses to taxation as given. As Kydland and

Prescott [1980] and Fischer [1980] show, in this type of problem the optimal

plans of the government are in general reneged as time goes by, since the ex-

ante price elasticity of the demand for capital goods differs from the ex-post
                11
elasticity.

        What are the government's incentives to impose a capital levy and their

effects on investors' behavior? I consider here the case where foreign assets

are not taxable. The government's problem at time 1 is:


                                          *
                              MAX    W(l+r , Y+K)        +   v(G)                   (15)

                               s.t. rf(K2)        G                                 (16)

                                      f'(K2) -        (1+r*)/(lr)                   (4)

                                     Y =                                 - K2
                                           f(K2)(l-r)/(l+r          )               (17)




the first-order conditions are:




              v (G)[ 1
                              '2'
                            f''K '
                                       '2                                  2
                             f(K2) If"(K2) I      l-r                   1 +    r*   (18)



and equations (16), (4) and (17). The solution of the problem yields a value of

r    that   investors would use in their portfolio and savings decisions. At time 2

     This problem is also disussed by Krugman [1987].

the government might want to renege on the announced tax rate. The problem at

time 2 is:



                               MAX 1.J(C1,C2) +   v(G)                     (1)

                               s.t. C1        K - A   -                    (2)
                                    C2 —      A(1+r)      +   (l-r)f(K2)   (3)

                                    rf(K2) — C                             (16)

                                    A, 2 given


Since both A and K2 are given at time 2, C1 and f(K2) are given as well.

Therefore, the first order conditions are:



                                v'(G) = 8U/8C2                             (19)




and equations (2), (3) and (16).   (18) and (19) are unlikely to give rise to the

same value of r.   In the first period, the marginal government revenue from an

increase in taxes--the second term on the left-hand side of (18)--times the

marginal utility of government spending, has to equal the welfare cost of the

tax distortion. In the second period, by contrast, the tax rate is such that

the marginal utility of consumption is equal to the marginal utility of

government spending.

     Are the optimal ex-post taxes higher than ex-ante? The right-hand side of

equation (18) equals U1/(l+r*), since the derivative of the indirect utility

function with respect to the present discounted value of available resources

equals the Lagrange multiplier associated with the present-value budget
                                      17



constraint, and in turn, the marginal utility of period-one consumption.

Therefore, given the consumption Euler equation (5), the right-hand side

expressions in equations (18) and (19) are identical. Thus, a comparison of the

left-hand sides of the two equations shows that ex-post government spending and

taxes are always grater than ex-ante, if the marginal utility of government

expenditure is decreasing.

     Equations (18) and (19) also reveal that the government's incentive to

raise higher taxes ex-post is stronger, the larger the response of international

capital flows to future taxes, i.e. the more "similar" the domestic and foreign

investment technologies: in this case the marginal tax revenue term in equation

(18) is relatively small, thus driving a larger wedge between the ex-ante and

ex-post marginal utility of government spending.

     By a similar argument it is possible to show that, in the uniform taxation

case, the government's incentives to raise higher taxes ex-post are positively

related to the response of the current account to the savings tax rate: the

higher the intertemporal elasticity of substitution the larger the difference

between ex-post and ex-ante taxes.

     Historically, examples of extraordinary taxation, like capital levies,

debt repudiation, or exchange-rate "maxi" devaluations, are numerous. For this

reason, and since the "fooling" equilibrium just described is unlikely to be

self-replicating, it is plausible to study equilibria where the public

anticipates the government's actions. Define a discretionary equilibrium as one

where the the public perfectly anticipates future taxes, and the government has
                                       18



no incentives to renege on previous committments.12 In the government's problem

at time 2, the values of C1, A, and K2--that the government takes as given--are

functions of taxes expected at time 1. To make sure that the government will

have no incentives to change the announced tax rate, the public has to choose A,

C1, and K2 conditional on a value of r consistent with the solution of the

problem (l)-(3) and (16) above. Since ex-post taxes are always greater than

their ex-ante optimal values, the discretionary equilibrium is characterized by

"over-accumulation" of foreign assets.13 The accumulation of foreign assets in

the discretionary equilibrium is larger, the more similar are the domestic and

foreign investment technologies. Therefore, the arguments for preventing

international capital flows for tax evasion are the same even when the

endogeneity of government spending, and the effects of dynamic inconsistency,

are explicitly accounted for:14 if the interest elasticity of domestic

investment is large relative to the interest elasticity of savings, tax evasion

lowers national welfare relative to a regime where domestic and foreign

investment income are taxed at the same rate.

     See Fischer [1986] for the a complete discussion of the welfare ranking of
     "first best," "time inconsistent" and "discretionary" equilibria.
13
     An interesting historical example of this phenomenon is provided by the
     Italian experience in 1919. A capital levy was passed by the Italian
     government in November, and was publicly debated since the beginning of the
     year. The dollar price of liras in New York fell by 52% from December 1918
     to December 1919, and many contemporary observers argued that capital flight
     for fear of the capital levy reached serious proportions in that year. See
     Giovannini [1987]

     Since the logical structure of the proof of this proposition- -as well as its
     intuition--are clearly the same as in section 3, I nmit it for brevity's
     sake.

      Table 2 illustrates these arguments, by reporting simulations of the full

time-consistent discretionary equilibrium, assuming v(C) =   G   °'/(l-0), and

0=l.5. When a=O.4, the public's anticipations of future confiscatory taxes

much worsens the production distortions in the presence of tax evasion: output

falls 25 percent below the first-best optimum of 210. Similarly, when a=O.2 and
                                                                    15
0=2, the relative ranking of the two regimes is sharply reversed.




5. Concluding Remarks

       This paper has studied the simple analytics of tax evasion through

international capital flows. The main result is that the welfare costs of

international capital outflows to evade domestic taxes are larger, the larger

the interest elasticity of domestic investment, relative to the interest

elasticity of savings. Thus the relative importance of portfolio substituion

and intertemporal substitution provide a simple criterion to evaluate the

welfare effects of international tax evasion from an individual country's




15
     This result stresses the large costs of savings taxation, rather than the
     superiority of tax evasion, with high intertemporal substitution, and low
     interest-rate elasticity of domestic investment. Tax evasion is of course
     still inferior to the regime where both domestic investment income and
     savings are taxed at differential rates. See footnote 10 above.
                                        20


perspective:16 this general criterion should not be overturned in more

complicated models that account for uncertainty, many assets, a much richer menu

of taxes, including taxes on labor income, and differential tax schedules on the

various capital assets.

       The analysis of this paper has implications for the desirability of

"capital controls." Capital controls decrease welfare in economies free of

distortions,17 but can be welfare-improving when some distortions are

unavoidable. Empirically, taxes are one of the most important distortions that
                        18
cannot be eliminated.        This paper suggests that the application of the

"public finance" approach to normative questions like the optimal design of

"controls" or taxation of international capital flows might prove fruitful.

                                    Atpendix:

   Quantitative Capital Controls Can Achieve the Uniform Taxation Solution



    A regime of uniform taxation like the one described in section 2 might be

difficult to achieve, since, for many governments, monitoring international

trade in assets and evaluating foreign assets holdings of domestic residents is

too costly. Traditionally, outright prohibitions of purchases of foreign assets

are a frequently-used form of capital controls. Below I show that

appropriately-set quantitative controls achieve the same allocation of resources

as a regime of uniform taxation. Consider the following problem:



                     MAX   U(C1,C2) +   v(C)                             (al)

                     s.t. K2+C1+A=K                                      (a2)

                           C2 =   A(1+r*)    +
                                                 f(K2)(1-r)              (a3)

                           AA                                            (a4)




Equation (a4) represents the quantitative controls on purchases of foreign

assets. The first-order conditions for the problem (al)-(a3) plus (a4) are:



                 U1(C1,C2) =                                             (a5)
                               U2(C1,C2)f'(K2)(l-r)
                 U1(C1,C2) =   U2(C1,C2)(l+r      )   -p                 (a6)




and the intertemporal budget constraint (2)-(3), together with the

"complementary slackness" condition:
                                              22



                              p(A-A)      0                                        (a7)




In this problem, A can in fact be set at a level such that distortions on the

production side of the economy are avoided. Let rf'(K2)U2(C1,C2) = p:             from

equations (a5) and (a6), it follows that f'(K2) —         l+r*,   as in equation (4') in

section 2, and p =                            Substituting into equation (a6) yields
                     r(l+r*)1J2(C1,C2).
equation (5') of section 2, the other first-order condition from the uniform

taxation problem. Solution of (4')-(5') and the two budget constraints (a2)-

(a3) produces the values for consumption, savings, and foreign asset

accumulation that are obtained in the uniform-taxation problem. Furthermore,

given the value of p, auctioning the rights to purchase foreign assets generates

the same revenue as in the case where foreign assets' income is taxed.

Therefore, even when foreign assets' income cannot be taxed, appropriately-set

quantitative restrictions can achieve an allocation of resources identical to

that obtainable with a system of uniform taxation.

Notes: All variables, except tax rates, are expressed as percent of first-period
GNP (=K). Columns (1) denote the regime where foreign assets' income is not
taxed, columns (2) denote the regime of uniform taxation. U(2)-U(1) is the
difference between U(c1,c2) in the regime of uniform taxation and U(c1,c2) in
the tax-evasion regime. This difference is also expressed as percent of first-
period GNP.
