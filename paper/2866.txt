             DEVALUATION CRISES AND THE MACROECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
                OF POSTPONED ADJUSTMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES


                                   ABSTRACT




     This paper develops our analytical model to explore the relationship

between the dynamics of macroeconomic adjustment and the timing of the

implementation of an adjustment program featuring an official devaluation.

The effects of postponing adjustment depend on the source of the original

shock,    In the case of fiscal expansion, postponement implies a larger

eventual official devaluation and greater deviations of macroeconomic

variables from their steady-state values.     For adverse terms of trade

shocks,   postponement does not affect the size of the eventual official

devaluation, but does magnify the amount of post-devaluation overshooting by

key macroeconomic variables.

     An important issue in the design of stabilization programs refers to

the :iminz of different policies.      In particular,   determining the consequ-

ences of alternative timings of devaluations has for a long time concerned

policymakers in the developing countries. In spite of this policy

interest the literature on stabilization and devaluation has not analyzed

this issue in detail.     The purpose of this paper is to develop a general

equilibrium dynamic model to explore the relationship between the dynamics

of macroeconomic adjustment and the timing of the implementation of a

stabilization program that includes a nominal devaluation as its principal

component.   /   In   particular, we explore the effects of postponing

adjustment on the cumulative deviations of key macroeconomic variables

from their steady-state values and on the degree of overshooting of these

values following the implementation of adjustment measures.

     The model is derived from well-articulated micro foundations and

distinguishes between equilibrium and disequilibrium movements in real

exchange rates.   We investigate the characteristics of two different types of

exchange rate crises:      (a) those provoked by inconsistent fiscal policies

and (b) those generated by exogenous terms of trade shocks.       A central

aspect of our discussion is determining conditions under which a nominal

devaluation will be required to render the adjustment process effective.


  j/ A number of authors have investigated the process of macroeconomic
adjustment in developing countries.  Most studies, however, have focused
on a particular aspect of the adjustment process, without providing a
general and integrated picture that "fits" (or is consistent with) the
more salient stylized facts. See, for example, Blanco and Garber (1986),
Connolly et al. (1987), Rodriguez (1978), Khan and Lizondo (1987), Krugman
(1979) and Edwards (1983).
This is, indeed, an important policy issue, since the cole of devaluations

has for some time now been at the centet of conttoveraies surrounding the

so-called orthodox adjustment programs.           L   An important      innovation   of   our

analysis         is that it relates the timing of adjustment to the size of the

(corrective)        devaluation, and thereby to the path of a number of key macro-

economic variables during the disequilibrium process and the adjustment

period.

             In developing our model we make a special effort to capture the more

important stylized facts associated with balance of paymenta crises, devalu-

ations and stabilization programs.            For this reason, ye start in Section Il

with a brief exposition of those facts,           in Section ill      ccc   present the

model, while in Section IV ye illustrate how the model works.                  Here ye con-

centrate on two possible causes of devsluation crises:                fiscal shocks and

exogenous shocks to the international terms of trade.                The central part of

this section deals with the consequences of postponing adjustment and

devaluation,          Finally, Section V contains the concluding remarka, including

some thoughts regarding directions for future research.

                    II.   Macroeconomic Polity, Real Exchange Rates and
                           and Devaluation Crises: The Stylized Facts

             In this section we briefly analyze the circumstances preceding 20 major

devaluation crises in developing countries.            Our main interest is to provide

a simple "list' of the most salient atylized faota            that, we believe, should

be captured by a unified model that deals with devaluation crises and macro-

economic adjustment processes. We focus both on policy induced disturbances

-   -   shocks   to domestic credit as well as fiscal polity- - and on external

        j/    See, for example,   Buire (1983).
shocks in the form of terms of trade changes. We then analyze the behavior

of the following endogenous variables:         (1) real exchange rates; (2) the

current account; (3) the monetary system's foreign assets position;

(4) the black market premium; and (5) real wages.

1.      The Sample

        Table 1 contains the list of the 20 devaluation episodes analyzed in

this paper.     The choice of countries in the sample was basically determined

by data availability; only those major devaluation episodes for which data

on (most) of the variables of interest were available were incorporated into

the analysis.        All these countries devalued their currencies by at least    J.57


after having maintained a fixed (official)       exchange rate with respect to the

tJ.S,   dollar for two or more years.     Thirteen of them implemented a stepwiae

devaluation, where after the nominal exchange rate adjustment they attempted

to once again fix the parity (Panel A of Table 1),        Many of them did not

succeed and experienced recurrent devaluations.        Seven of the countries

adopted a crawling exchange rate after devaluing (Panel B).        This table also

contains data on the amount of each nominal devaluation measured as the

percentage change of the official exchange rate with respect to the U.S.

dollar.     It is interesting to note that all of these devaluations were fol-

lowed by some kind of predetermined regime (either fixed or passive crawl)

and not by a freely floating nominal rate, as most theoretical models of

exchange rate collapse have assumed (Krugman, 1979; Flood and Garber 1984;

Obstfeld 1986)   .    In   the model we developed below we take this important

stylized fact into account and deal with exchange rate crisis where the of-

ficial exchange rate is fixed at a new (higher) level after the devaluation.

the case of multiple rates the IFS reports the most common of them.
        The data in Tab       1 refer to the official exchange rate.     Many of these

countries, however, had an active parallel market during the period sur-

rounding the devaluations. In subsection 11.5 below we discuss the behavior

of the parallel market exchange rate.           The existence of this parallel market

is another important stylized fact not captured by traditional models, but

explicitly incorporated in our unified model.

2       Fiscal and Credit Policies and Devaluation Crises

        Table   2   summarizes the behavior of domestic credit and fiscal policies

for the period immediately preceding the 20 devaluation crises.            In addi-

tion,    data for a control    zrou   of countries that maintained a fixed rate

for 10 or more years are also presented. L/          The following indicators can be

found in this table:        (1) rate of growth of domestic credit (Panel A);

(2) rate of growth of domestic credit to the public sector (Panel B)

(3) percentage of credit received by the public sector as proportion of

total domestic credit (Panel C)       ;   (4) fiscal deficit as proportion of GD?

(Panel D)   ;   and (5) growth of domestic credit to the public sector as a

proportion of CNP.        All these indicators have been constructed using data

from various issues of the International Financial Statistics as well as

several IFS tapes.        For the devaluing countries these indicators are

reported for 3 years, 2 years, and 1 year prior to the devaluation as well

as for the year of the devaluation. While Panel          A   deals with monetary (or

domestic credit) policy, the rest of the panels take us beyond the monetary

realm and into the fiscal side of the economy.          Indeed,   these panels provide

four different ways of looking at fiscal pressures.

        A   number of revealing facts emerge from this table.      First, macro-

economic--and in particular fiscal- -policies became increasingly expansive

in the devaluing countries immediately preceding the year of the devalua-

tion.       Second,   the devaluing countries as a group behaved quite differ-


ently than the control group of fixers.          This is particularly clear for the

fiscal policy indicators,          For example, during the year prior to the

crisis half of the devaluing countries allocated one quarter or more of

total domestic credit to the public sector; the median for the control group

countries, on the other hand, was only slightly more than 10 percent.

Formal.        tests indicate that the probability of these policy indicators

for the devaluing countries coming from the same population as the control

group is very low. j/          This strong empirical evidence suggests a third

feature     that any model that attempts to capture the dynamics of crisis and

stabilization should possess, i.e., it should have a well developed fiscal

side.

3.      Terms of Trade and Devaluation Crises

        Of course, balance of payments difficulties are not always the result

of inconsistent domestic macroeconomic policies; historically, exogenous

shocks have sometimes been the sources of serious external imbalances,             in

our sample there is a wide variety of experience.         While in some episodes

the terms of trade       did   not change in the period preceding the exchange rare

collapse,    in others there was a substantial change.    In aix of the fxteen

episodes for which there are data there was a significant worsening in

the terms of trade before the devaluation (see Appendix,      Table   Al).   1/

Existing models of exchange rate collapse,    however,   have ignored the

possibility of terms of trade shocks being the generating cause of

devaluations. This possibility is explicitly taken up in our model.

4.      Real Exchanze Rates, The External Sector and Devaluations

        In the vaar majority of our 20 devaluation episodes the external aecror

experienced a aerious deterioration in the period leading to the criaia.          In

16 out of the 20 episodes the ratio of net foreign assets to money experi-

enced a steep decline during this two year period (see Appendix, Table A.2).

This,    of course, is in acrord with the traditional modela of exchange rare

crises developed by Krugmen (1979) and others, where the devaluation takes

place when the level of international reserves hire a lower threshold. 2/

Also,    in 14 of the 20 episodes the current account ratio experienced a

worsening in the two years before the crisis,     In fact, in some of these

episodes the current account to GDP ratio reached remarkable levels.         In

Kenya and Israel 1971 the deficit was approximately equal to one-fourth of

GDP!     An important characteristic of these devaluation episodes ia the

tendency,    present in most countries, for the ratio of net foreign assets to

return to its pre-crisis level following the devaluation. This suggests

that countries have a well-established desired level of reserves to which

trade of at least 5%.

they seek to return.   This characteristic, which has been ignored in the

literature, is explicitly incorporated in our model.

      Regarding real exchange rates, in 15 out of the 19 countries wsth

relevant data the bilateral real exchange rate experienced a real apprecia

tion in the three years prior to the devaluation; in 13 out of the 19 cases

there also was a real appreciation of the multilateral RER during the period

immediately preceding the crisis.   The average real appreciation during the

3 years preceding the devaluation crisis was almost 9.2 percent, while the

real multilateral appreciation was 9.01 (see Appendix,    Table A.3). 1/   These

real appreciations were the result of domestic rates of inflation that

increasingly exceeded the world rate of inflation.   A set of   x2   tests,   in

fact, indicate that as the crisis date approached the rate of CPI inflation

in the devaluing countries became more distinct from that of the fixed rate

control group.   This evidence is particularly important for determining our

modelling strategy. What these data suggest is that devaluation decisions

are based on the behavior of (at least) two indicators:    foreign reserves

and the real exchange rates.   It is possible to think of some devaluations

as undertaken in order to improve a country's competitive position rather

than because reserves have disappeared Indonesia in 1978 comes to mind)

This means that, contrary to the traditional literature,   a model that


attempts to capture the stylized facts surrounding crises in the LOGs should


  j/ Naturally, to the extent that there have not been changes in the
equilibrium RERs, this appreciation reflects a disequilibrium situation
(i.e., real overvaluation). Notice that the extent of real exchange rate
appreciation before the crisis not only varied across countries, but also
was more marked in recent years (i.e., in the l980s). This has been parti-
cularly the case for the countries that after the devaluation became
crawlers.

          Critics of orthodox stabilization programs have argued that devalu-

ations result in important reductions in real wages.                       /      In   order to

manufacturing sector           in the period surrounding our devaluation crises (see

Appendix, Table A.5).            Since these data have not been corrected by product

ivity gains, they should be analyzed with care.                These figures show no

clearcut behavior of real manufacturing wages in the period surrounding the

devaluation        crises.    In only 8 out of 18 episodes for which there are data,

real wages increased in the period preceding the crisis.               In all of these

eight cases real wages dropped after the devaluation.               in the other

episodes for which there are data, real wages did not decline after the

crisis.      Thus, the popular belief that all devaluations are          followed by a
wage reduction is not sustained by our                 data.

7,      Summary

        The data discussed in this section provide a fairly clearcut pattern

regarding the stylized facts surrounding a large number of devaluation

crises in the developing countries. These facts--which we believe an

adequate model of devaluation crises should capture--can be briefly

summarized        as follows:
       a.   Historically the vast majority of devaluation crises have been

preceded by loose and inconsistent macroeconomic policies.               In particular,

the    evidence shows        that fiscal policy in the devaluing countries as a group

was significantly more expansive than in a control group of fixers.

       b.In a nontrivial number of episodes we detected a significant
worsening in the international terms of trade immediately before the crisis.
This   suggests chat         historically   some collapses may have been caused by

exogenous external shocks.

       c    lfl   the period    preceding the devaluations we observed (a) a

significant       real exchange rate appreciation; (b) the depletion ad the s0c5
                                           22   -



of   international reserves; (c) a deterioration of the current account

defioit and;     (d)   a decline in the ratio of        for   gn   assets of the

monetary system.

      d.   Devaluations crises have been preceded by very steep increases in

the black market premium.       Moreover, the evidence shows that ir.mediately

following the devaluation the premium experienced a significant decline.
                                                                        There are some

indications, however, that in acme countries reel wages followed an

inverted   U   path.    They increased in the years preceding the crisis, and

dropped    in the years that followed.
                                    III.    The Model

       In this section we develop a model of a typical developing country

which is designed to trace the dynamic response of certain key macroeconomic

variables to a variety of shocks that eventually culminate in a devaluation

episode.    The model is able to generate dynamic responses which mimic quite

                                                    It turns out that, for a given

shock whioh eventually results in adjustment-ca-devaluation, the primary

determinants of the path followed by domestic macroeconomic variables are

the nature of the eventual macroeconomic adjustment to the shock and the

magnitude of the associated devaluation.

1.     Surely

       We consider a small open economy which produces exportables (X)

importables     (Z) and    nontraded goods (N) using sector-specific capital and
                                                     -   13




oomogeneous labor. L/                Labor    is available in fixed supply,      and all prices

are flexible; full employment prevails continuously. The labor market

equilibrium condition               is:



         (1)    Lx(w/p) +      L(w)       +   L(we)           I.




ere w          is the real wage measured in terms of importables, p                is   the

domestic price of exportables in terms of importables (i.e.                        the external

ter'ns    of trade), and e is the real exchange rate, defined as the ratio of

the domestic price of importables to that of nontraded goods; e
                                                                                         sP/P;,
where s is the predetermined nominal exchange rate applicable to comlnerciai

transactions and         P     is the world price of importables. Lj is the demand

for labor           n sector   i,   and LI      0,       Equation (1) implies   relationship

between p, e, and the equilibrium real wage:

         (2)    w      w(p,e),

                wl      (w/p2)/(/p+L+Le)> 0;                       w2   -(Lw)/(/p+L+Le)        < 0

Since    each sector employs only one variable factor, conventional secroral

supply functions that relate output in each sector to the two relative

prices p and e can be derived.

         (3)    1X     yx(pe);        yz       yZ(Pe); yN          yN(pe)

        Consequently, an improvement in the terms of trade increases output of

exportables while reducing that of importables and nontraded goods.                           A real

exchange rate depreciation, on the other hand, increases output of import-

ables and exportables while reducing that of nontraded goods.


  1/ This model is partially based on Khan and Montiel (1987). It differs
from Khan and Montiel in that it incorporates a dual exchange rate market
and ignores the bond market. Kiguel and Lizondo (1986) and Edwards (1988)
present models somewhat similar to that developed here,

2.   Demand

     a.       Household Sector

     We assume that households consume only importables and noncradable

goods.     To simplify the analysis we suppose that households'                           utility

functions         are Cobh-Douglas.               This implies constant expenditure shares

(denoted      6       for importables and 1-6 for nontradable goods) and permits us to

write an 'exact" price index P as:
                                 1-6       6-1
     (4)          P =                    P5e

where    P and          P4 are the domestic-currencyprices of importables of non-

tradables,            Letting c denote real consumption measured in units of the

consumption bundle with price                           P,       the household demand functions for


importables           and nontradable goods can be written as:
                                                6-1 c
     (5a;         tz       —
                               fiPc/Pz     be

     (Sb)             c4       (l-6)Fc/PN         (l-6)e8c

     Real household consumption,                             in turn, is taken to depend on real

disposable factor income and real financial wealth:

     (6)          c        c(y-t,a);       c      > 4,           c>0
where y is real factor income, t is real (lump sum) taxes, and a is real

financial wealth, all measured in terms of the consumption bundle.                                Real

taxes on households are taken to be exogenous.

     Real factor income can be expressed as the product of the relative

price of imports measured in terms of the consumption bundle and real factor

income in terms of importables:
                        18    x z                            =
        (7)       y — e    (py +y +e              y     )        y(p,e).
From equation              (7)    it follows that an improvement               in the terms of trade
                                             -   15   -



increases        real factor income, while a real exchange depreciation has an

ambiguous impact on this variable. j/

         Household financial wealth consists of domestic money and foreign

exchange.           The economy is assumed to operate under a dual nominal exchange

rate system,         consisting of a predetermined official exchange rate for cur-

rent transactions and a freely-fluctuatingrate which governs                   transactions

.n foreign exchange among private citizens.                /     Consequently changes   re
desired        stock of foreign money will result in changes in the freely floacir.g

rate without accompanying capital flows.                  In that sense the stock of foreign

exchange in private hands at any one time reflects past central bank inter-

vention in the dual exchange market, i.e., it is exogenous when measured in

foreign currency units.           Letting H denote the stock of money, F the

foreign-currencyvalue of the stock of foreign exchange held by the private

sector and d the dual exchange rate, real household financial wealth is:

a       M+dF)/F.       it is convenient to write this as:

         (8)    a

where m         M/P    and v —   dF/P.     Finally, we assume that households continu-

ously maintain their financial portfolios in their desired composition,

which is specified in conventional fashion as a function of the nominal rate

of return on the money substitute and of income:


        (9)                      m(d,y);    m1< 0, m2
                                                      >     0,

                                                                     country
is initially neither a net international debtor nor creditor, since in this
case (l-)y     y/e (see   Khan and Montiel (1987)).

quite extensive. For recent expositions, see Lizondo '1.987a,b) and
Dornbusch (1986).

where a   is    the expected rate of depreciation of the dual exchange rate,

which under the assumption of perfect foresight                          is equal    to the actual rate

of devaluation.

     To complete the description of household behavior,                             the accumulation of

domestic money is given by the household budget constraint:

     b.     Public Sector

     The    government           levies taxes          on households and purchases      both

importables and nontradable goods. It finances any resulting deficit by
borrowing      from the central bank,                      Its budget constraint is given by:

     (11)      def          g5   + eJgN     -



where g5 and gN denote government spending on importables                            and nontradable

goods respectively and                def       is the government deficit measured in terms of


importables.             Initially,    the government is assumed to allocate its spending

in the same proportions as households:

     (12a)          gZ      Oe0g
     (12b)          gN      (1-9)e8g,

where g is cotal real government spending meaaured in units of the

consumption bundle,

     The final agent in the model is the central bank, which issues money to

finance government deficits and to purchase foreign exchange in the offitial

market generated by trade balance surpluses.                          The balance of trade measured

in terms of imporcables, denoted b, is given by:
                                                        -   17   -




        (13)       b   —   py   +         - cZ     gZ

Thus,    at any instant the stock of money in domestic currency units (M) is

given by:


       (14)    M           5    (b(u)     +   def(u)) P(u)du.

The domestic-currency value of the stock of international reserves (which we

denote R) depends on the current official exchange rate, rather than on the

rate that prevailed at the time the foreign exchange was purchased by the

central bank:



        (15)   R           Sf       b(u)P*(u)du.


3,     Equilibrium

       Since the economy in question is small, domestic-currency prices of

exportables and importables are governed by the law of one price:

        (16)   P           sP;       Pz

as we abstract from world inflation and assume that the exchange rate for

current account transactions is fixed, the domestic currency prices of X

and Z are constant.

       Equilibrium in the nontradable goods market is given by:

                       + gN

Using (3), (5b), (6), (7) and (8), this becomes

       (17)    yN(p,e)              (l-O)e8      c[y(p,e)-t,e(m+v)J   +

This   equation can be solved for the real exchange rate chat clears the

market for nontradable goods.                     To do so, it is convenient to assume that the
                                                             -    18       -

                                    IV.           The Role of Devaluation

      To analyze the workings of the model, we consider the effects of the

two types of shocks which in Section II we associated with a devaluation

crisis- -an expansionary fiscal shock consisting of an increase in govern-

ment spending on nontradable goods, and an adverse terms of trade shock.                                          We

begin this section by analyzing the role of a nominal official devaluation

in our model.       We then analyze the effects of an expansionary fiscal shock

and of a permanent adverse terms of trade shock in consecutive subsections.

1.     The Role of Devaluation

       A steady-state        configuration        such as A in Figure          1 is characterized by

     — 0.   By differentiating equation (14), this can be shown to imply that

b —    -def.    However,     this condition is not sufficient to ensure that a point

like A will be sustainable.               Assuming that the authorities are unwilling to

permit      their stock of foreign exchange reserves to fall outside some

prescribed range of values, equation (15) suggests that nonzero values of

def    are not sustainable, since such values of                        def   Sust eventually drive

the   stock of international          reserves held by the Central Bank (R/s) to its

upper or lower bounds.            Sustainability of a fixed nominal official parity

thus requires def            0 in steady state.

       Although a balanced government budget is a necessary condition for

sustainability in our model, not all paths that satisfy the steady-state
condition def = 0 are feasible.                 This condition will indeed guarantee

convergence of (R/s), but not necessarily to a value which lies inside the

authorities'     preferred range.              For a given time path of the fiscal vari-

ables, the role of a nominal devaluation in this model is to alter the

steady-state value of (R/s).               To see this, suppose that a devaluation of

the official rate takes place at time to, at which the economy may or may

not be in steady state, but at which time the condition def — 0                          is ful
filled.       From (14), (l6b), and the fact that a nominal devaluation does not

alter the steady-state value of                 rn(m*),       we have


       (22)         m*   —            +   5     [b(u)+def(u)Jdu

                                          -   21    -




(recall      that Pf is constant).     From (15) and (22) and since d(cef(ufl/ds

0, we have that a nominal devaluation will affect the stock of international

reserves as follows:


       (23)                      5 b(u)P*du             =
                                                            M0/stP*
                                                                      >   0.


That   is,    since   the path of the fiscal deficit is unaltered,                  and since

capital gains on reserves are not monetized, the original teal money suoply

can be restored only by running cumulative trade surpluses--in other words,

by reserve accumulation.         It follows        that, in      the      case of a tublic   spending
shock, a path rendered infeasible by reserve inadequacy may he sustainable

if the eventual fiscal adjustment is accompanied by                        a   sufficiently large

devaluation of the official rate.             The reason for this is that such a

devaluation will reduce the cumulative loss of reserves during the

transition to the new steady state.                A    similar analysis applies to the case

of a terms of trade shock,           'e now examine the effects of fiscal and terms-

of-trade shocks under adjustment-own-devaluation

2.     Fiscal Shocks and Devaluation Crises

       The effects of an increase        in government spending on nontraded goods

are depicted in Figure 2.         An increase in             g shifts the i          0 locus to the


right, by:


                                     (l-8)e6(m+v)e 2
                      din.

                                  (l-6)e5(m±v)e4±l

The          0 locus is undisturbed.      If the increase in government spending

were perceived to be permanent, the dual rate would depreciate on impact by

an amount such as to place             the new short-run       equilibrium at a point directly

above   A   on the saddle path S'S'           from then on, the new steady state B would

be approached.

        Whether such a path is feasible, however, depends on how the increase

in spending is financed.          Notice that, since t             has   been held constant in

(20), tax financing has implicitly been ruled out.                       The alternatives are a

reduction in spending on importables or central bank financing. We will

examine the case in which the latter option is initially                       chosen,   consistent

with the pre-devaluation stylized facts presented in Section II. 1/

        Since we are explicitly examining a devaluation crisis, at                       the moment

that government spending increases the private sector is assumed to know not

only that adjustment will eventually be necessary (i.e., that the spending

increase is temporary)       ,   but   also that the eventual adjustment in spending

will be accompanied by an official devaluation.                      Since the eventual official

devaluation is assumed to be anticipated at the time of the initial shock,

the exchange rate in the dual market cannot jump when the official exchange

rate is actually devalued.             Recalling that v =          dF/sP and m      M/sP,     this


means that at the instant of devaluation,                  v   and m must decrease in inverse

                                                       at the moment the devaluation takes
proportion to the change in             s.   Thus,

place the economy must move inward along a ray from the origin such as OR

in Figure 2.       From a point such as           D,   at the instant of adjustment the

economy jumps to E.        The point E must be on SS, which governs the economy's

post-adjustment;trajectory. The location of 0, on the other hand, is

determined by the condition that DE/E0                     as/s,   i.e., by the size of the

devaluation.          To see how the position of D is determined,               suppose AS/S
takes on some known value, say          ir       Consider the family of rays from the

origin of which OR is a member.              Each such rsy will contain a point such as

E where the ray intersects SS and a point like D with the property DE/ED

it.   The set    of all auth points D traces out a locua LL located above SS and

with slope given by:


                      —
                      dv              —
                              = (l+ir) dv
                                       dm
                      dmILL

       Notice    that there will be one such locus for aach rate of devaluation

it.   If   it is knovn that the fiscal expansion will last for t periods and

that ita termination will coincide with a                 it

then the location of the point 0 will be determined by the intersection of

the lorua LL and a path such as CD which takes exactly t periods to reach

LL from some initial point C.           The point C must lie directly above A and

above the saddle path 5'S' - -which passes through the supposed long-run

equilibrium B- -as well aa below LL.              The reason for this is that from points

below 5'S' or above LL there are no continuous trajectories that would take

the economy to LL.         In the case under discussion, therefore,                the dual rate

will depreciate on impact, causing v to jump to point C.                        From this point,

v will continue to depreciate,          and at least temporarily, m will rise,

Notice that the dual rate depreciates continuously and eventually must do so

at an increasing rate (since v/a rises as the economy approaches 0 and, from

equation (19), in increase in this ratio increases 3)                     in   anticipation of the
eventual devaluation,         which is consistent with the stylized facts presented

in Section      II.    At the moment of adjustment the economy jumps from 0 to F

behavior of other key macro variables under the adjustrnent-cum-devaluation

path   CDEA.

       To examine the nature of        reserve behavior,   use equations (3), (5a),

(6),    (7), and (8) in the trade balance equation (13).
                                                                   The result   is:

The sign of b1 assumes that the term in square brackets
                                                        is             positive, which
will    be the case if the substitution effects of a real devaluation on

household demand for importables exceed wealth effects.

                                        and noticing        that   m+v rises
        Using equations (18) and (24) ,

continuously along the range GD, we can

 into deficit on impact and the deficit increases over time until adjustment

 is undertaken,         at which point a surplus must emerge (point E in Figure       2)


 Similarly,       the price level jumps on impact and continues to      rise in the
                                                  Thus the pre-devaluation period is

     Notice   that, given that the price level rises continuously during the

predevaluation period, the real exchange rate simultaneously appreciates.

Since there have been no changes in the determinants of the equilibrium real

exchange rate, this real appreciation represents a misalignment situation.

8y equation 2), the real wage in terms of tradables rises.             Moreover,   if the

share of tracables in the consumption bundle is sufficiently large, the real

wage measured in terms of the consumption bundle will also rise in the period

leading up to the devaluation.       Under this assumption,    the devaluation of the

official rate results in a sharp decrease in the real wage which causes it to

fall below its pre-shock level.       This is followed by a gradual increase in

the real wage    until its   original level is restored.    Finally,   as can be shown

from equations    (6), (7), end (8), the same condition (a large value of 8)

ensures   that private real consumption also rises over this period. 1/

3.   Devaluation Postponement and Macroeconomic        Adiustment

     Pc now examine how the dynamics of adjustment are affected by

postponing the eventual measures.         Consider first a postponement of

adjustment which holds constant the size of the devaluation.           Pc can show

that as the fiscal expansion is prolonged,         the point C in Figure 2 moves

closer to the saddle path       S'S' --i.e., the initial depreciation in the dual

rate is dampened.   J    Moreover,   since the ratio v/m is smaller at points

  j/ Notice that m+v rises up to point D. Although e falls, if 1-8 is
small, equation (8) indicates that a will increase,  Since by (7), y is
unaffected by changes in e, the behavior of c will depend on that of a.
  21 Notice that, if the economy jumped above C, the new path would
intersect LL to the southwest of D. Since the increase in v along this
path (call it CD') is smaller than that along CD, and since for each valne
of v on this path   exceeds its value along CD (because the ratio v/rn is
greater), such paths must be traversed in less time than CD, which is
contrary to the assumption of delayed adjustment.
                                            -   26 -




below   C, the initial rate of depreciation of the dual rate is also smaller

in this case.        However,      since paths that begin below C must intersect     LL to

the northeast of D, the peak values of both             v   and m. as well as of v+m, in

this case exceed those in the case of more rapid adjustment.               The larger

peek value of v+m (reached just prior to adjuatment) means that the increase

in the domestic price level--and thus the eventual degree of real exchange

rate misalignment--is larger the longer adjustment is postponed.                It follous

from the arguments presented above that peak deviations of the current

account,       the real wage, and real consumption from their steady-state values

are also larger the more that adjustment is postponed.

        Moreover,    postponing adjustment also diminishes the steady-state stock

of foreign-exchangeresources.             To see this, use (14) and (15) to write:




                           R/s1 +
        (25)         a
                           —p---  (s0/s1)P*      5 def(u)du,


where    o and l denote the pre- and post-devaluationofficial exchange
rate.    Since m and P are unchanging across steady states, for a given

value of       O/l       the larger the cumulative fiscal deficit (which dependa

only on how long devaluation is postponed),             the smaller must F/s1 be.

        If the authorities pursue a reserve target, the consequences of post-

ponement are more dramatic.             As can be verified from equation (25)   ,
                                                                                    for   a

given value of F/a1, an increase in t requires a reduction in sp/s1--i.e.

a larger official. devaluation.            Thus,   in the presence of a reserve target,

postponing adjustment implies a larger eventual official devaluation. To

see the consequences of this for the economy's dynamic behavior,               return to

Figure 2.        An increase in r causes the locus LL to shirt upwards and become

steeper.        Holding the duration of the fiscal expansion constant,                this would

in itself increase the initial value of C and the peak values of both v and

v+m (at the point D).            Thus an increase in the size of the eventual official

devaluation increases the peak deviation of macroeconomic variables at the

instant       just preceding adjustment from their steady-state values.                 More-

over,    since the ray OR rotates counterclockwise in this case, the point E

moves to the southeast along SS.             This implies that the peak .,g-adjust-

ment deviations of v, v+m and the other macroeconomic                     variables from their

steady-state values is also increased by a larger official devaluation.

        Putting together the longer duration of the fiscal expansion and the

larger official devaluation that it implies, the following picture emerges:

        a.    Since the longer fiscal expansion tends to lower the initial value

of v (is.       ,   the point   C)   while the larger official devaluation tends to

raise it, the        impact   effects of postponing adjustment in the presence of a

reserve target are ambiguous.

        b.    Over time, however, the longer adjustment is postponed, the larger

the cumulative deviations of the macroeconomic variables of interest from

their steady-state values,

        c.    Then adjustment is finally undertaken,                 these variables will tend

to overshoot their steady-state values                 (i.e.   ,   the economy will be at E,

rather       than at A)   ,   and the degree of overshooting will be magnified by

postponing the adjustment.

        d.    Finally,    since postponement requires a larger official devaluation

in the presence of a reserve target the legacy of postponement will be a

higher steady-state price level.

4.   Terms-of Trade Shocks and Devaluation Crises

     The analysis of an adverse (permanent) terms of trade shock is slightly

more complicated, since in this case k2th the         t   = 0 and   th   =   0 loci are


affected.   j/   The shift in *      0 is given by:




                 -r        Thv       -m2y1v<O.




while that in i = 0       is:

                         m—O

                                 g4


Since both loci shift to the left, in the new steady state m will unambigu-

ously fall, but v may either increase or decrease.            The reduction in real

income attendsnt upon the terms of trade deterioration causes domestic

agents to seek to shift theit portfolios away from money and into foreign

currency,   thus increasing v.      On the other hand, the reduction in real

income reduces saving, and to restore saving to its steady state level of

zero, wealth must fall.         This is partly brought about through a reduction in

v, lesving the net change in v ambiguous.         In Figure    3,   we illustrate the

case in which the portfolio-compositioneffect on v dominates the wealth

at B is in principle viable, since in ohis exercise no fiscal deficit

exists at that point to generate continuous reserve depletion,

       In the absence of devaluation, the economy would jump to a point such

as F on the new saddle path 5'S' and gradually converge to     B.   This path is

characterized by trade deficits and      serve depletion. Given a reserve

target,   the auchoritiea may instead prefer a path which involves an

official devaluation. However, unlike in the previous section, the sire of

the required official devaluation is unaffected by its timing.       This con   he.



verified from equation (25), recalling that in this case the fiscal deficit

remains at zero during the entire transition path between steady states.

Since the second term on the right hand aide of (25) drops out, the reserve

target will determine the size of the official devaluation, but the final

reserve outcome will be independent of when the devaluation takes place.         On

the other hand,   as will be shown below, the timing of adjustment (in the

form of the official devaluation) again aatters in determining the paths

followed by the main macroeconomic variables.

       Suppose, for concreteness,   that the authorities ohooae the magnitude of

the official devaluation such as to preserve the original level of reserves

measured in terms of foreign currency.     Then,   if the terms of trade deter-

ioration is accompanied by an immediate official devaluation of (aq-a1)/aq

oercenc (Figure 3), the economy will immediately move from the original

steady state at A to the new one ac B, without undergoing an intervening

sequence of trade deficits. If the exchange rate adjustment is postponed,

however, again m and v must contract along a ray from the origin at the
instant of devaluation, from a point such as D on the ray OR1, to a point
such   as F on the new saddle path B'S'.   For this no be possible, the
Initial jump in v must be to a point        ge      this saddle path. and since t'               -




implies        a sequence of trade deficits (because ru is falling)            it must be

 ffset     by eventual surpluses--i.e.      the post-devaluation point must be

located to the southwest of B along S'S'        .   The implied     transition      path    is


CDEB      with an initial depreciation of the dual rate, 1/             This is followed

 y    gradual     appreciation and then by an accelerating depreciation.

         The behavior of the remaining macroeconomic variables that concern us

 ver     the   range CD of the adjustrent tath cannot be determined unambiguous-

1y     since     the terms of trade deerioration    and the depreciation in the dual

 atkt      have conflicting effects on the real exchange rate and therefore on

 enables such as         the price level, the real wage,    and real consumption.

 owever,        at the moment of devaluation, the real exchange rate undergoes a

 tap depreciation, accompanied by a reduction in the real wage and real

 onsumption, this again assuming a sufficiently large share of tradables in

'he    consumption bundle.      As the trade balance goes into surplus with a

epreciating dual rate over the final segment EB, real exchange rate appre-

ciation is accompanied by a rising real wage and rising real consumption.

         In tne event that devaluation is further postponed, the ray OR will

rotate counterclockwise, to OR2, say, as the point C moves along the locus

LL (derrvd as in the previous section',.            In this case,    the initial


lepreciatiori must be to a point between F and C           such as    C,   and the economy

poe-devaluation       period is characterized by trade deficits and increasing

premiums in the dual exchange market which increase at an accelerating race

(since     v/rn rises).

      The effects of postponing adjustment on the deviations of macrovari-

ables from their steady-state values is quite different in the present case

from the case of a temporary fiscal expansion.         Since LL has a positive

slope,     the peak values reached by both v and v+rn in the period leading up

to the officiaL devaluation are smaller when the devaluation is postponed.

Thus the peak deviation of the macrovariables from their steady-state values

during this period is diminished when adjustment is postponed, in contract

to what is observed under a temporary fiscal expansion. However, at the

point H the cumulative reserve loss exceeds that at D (notice that m is

smaller),        so that larger cumulative trade surpluses are needed in the poso-

adjustment period.          Thus the point I is to the southwest of E on S'S' in

Figure     3,    and the   -sdjustment deviations of   macrovariables from their

steady-state values are magnified, as in the previous section.

      In the case of a permanent terms of trade shock, in which "adjustment

consists of an official devaluation designed to meet a reserve target. we

therefore conclude that:

      a.        Postponement of adjustment g.g.g the impact effect of the shock on

macroeconomic variables.

      h,        Similarly, with the exception of foreign exchange reserves and the

money supply,        the cumulative deviation of macrovariablea from their steady-

state values prior to adjustment is smaller when adjustment is postponed.



(Contd.     from page 29) of prolonged adjustment, the initial jump from point
A   must be   to a path below CD, rather than to one above It.
      c,    dowever,   as in the case of a temporary          fiscal,   expansion, post-

ponement magnifies post-adjustment overshooting.

      d.    In this case, postponement does not affect the steady-state vol

of domestic nominal variables.

                              7.         'one i'd' nz   Remarks

      Adjustment   programs in     developing      countries are usually the conseque
of   severe macroeconomic crises.           Thesc crises have tended to share a number

     common features, such as      are   accc.Lrration in the rate of inflation.

continuous appreciation of the oefictal real exchange rate, an increase in

tbm current account deficit,        the sustained depletion of foreign exchange

reserves, ano a continuously-increasing premium in the black market for

foreign exchange.      When adjustment is undertaken it usually includes a

substantial devaluation of the official rate, following which the parallel

market premium shrinks appreciably. The purpose of this paper has been to

derive a dynamic model that is able to capture these common features of

balance of payments crises.         An important property of the model is that it

allows us to analyze the consequences of different timings of adjustment.

      The opening section of the paper contains a brief discussion of 20

major devaluation episodes in the developing countries. From this analysis

we derive a list of "stylized facts" that we believe models of macroeconomic

aj'astment should account for.            In Section III the model is presented. The

model is based on fully articulated micro-principles and considers an

economy that produces three goods              The public holds domestic and foreign

money, and there are dual exchange rates.                An important feature 0f the model

is that the Central Bank has a well-defined demand for international

reserves.     In Section IV we use the model to analyze how the economy reacts
to two types of shocks:     (1) an increase in government consumption of

nontradables financed with domestic credit creation;      and (2) a negative

shock to terms of trade.     We show that in this model the adjustment path

followed by inflation,    the current account,   the real exchange rate,   waqes.

the parallel market premium and net foreign assets correspond closely oo the

stylized facts described in Section II of the paper.

        A central result of our analysis refers to the consequences of post-

poning the adjqstment when the Central Bank has a well-defined target for

international reserves.    We show that the effects of postponement will

depend on the type of shook.     If the disturbance is a fiscal expansion.

postponing the adjustment will require a larger official devaluation. boy-

ever,    this relationship between the timing of the devaluation and its

magnitude is not linear.     If the postponement period is doubled the cequited

magnitude of the devaluation will not double.     '    Delaying   the adjustment

will affect the path followed by the endogenous variables.        In partiouloc.

the longer adjustment is postponed, the larger will be the deviations of the

matro variables from their steady-state values,       When adjustment is finally

implemented the macro variables will tend to overshoot their steady state

values.     The extent of overshooting will depend on the postponement period:

a delayed adjustment magnifies the extent of the overshooting.

        For the case of a negative terms of trade disturbance, the size of the

official devaluation will be unaffected by the timing of the adjustment.

Furthermore, the longer the adjustment is postponed, the smaller will be the

peak deviation of the macrovariables (except for reserves and money) froa


  j/     This can be verified by implicitly differentiatina equation (25)
                                       -   34




 their steady state values.      However,       as in the case of fiscal shock, folIov

 ing adjustment the required degree of overshooting of the macro variablea

will be magnified by postponement.

      An    mportant conclusion of our analysis on the effects of the timirg

of adjustment is that the observed pattern of continuously rising black

market premla, rising inflation, and increasing current account deficits

can be unambiguously inferred only in the context of
                                                     sufficiently post-
poned adjustment.       The suggestion it that "devaluation crisis" episodes

in developing countries have resulted not so much from the occurrence of

domestit or external shocks, but from a failure to adjust promptly in

response to such shocks.

      Although the model presented here goes a long way toward tying

together the more salient features of devaluation crises in developing

countries     it has some limitations.      In particular, it fails to incorporate

at least two important issues,       First, since there      is no capital mobility

the   official rate is available only for current transactions and there

are no Leacagea between markets) the role of capital flight is not investi-

gated.     Second    since our model exhibits continuous full employment,      the

dynamics of real output over the course of the crisis-adjustment period have

been omitted.       while both phenomena are of substantial empirical and

anslytica, interest,      their incorporation into our framework would add

substantially to the model'       complexity and they therefore remain topics

for future research, j/


  1/ In particular adding endogenous capital flows triggered by perceived
interest rate differentials would result in a system with three state
variables,
