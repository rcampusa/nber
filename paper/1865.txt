           The motives of a small country for borrowing to purchase capital
equipment on international markets are studied. The country produces tradable
capital and a nontradable consumption good and borrows or lends capital to
achieve higher levels of welfare. A shift in time—preference favoring future
over current consumption has an ambiguous impact effect on foreign debt.
Whether the country lends or borrows immediately depends upon whether the
consumption goods sector is capital or labor iitensive. Thedytiam±hirav-io-r--of
the current accouxit for an initially capital—pocr country is also derived. Our
results contrast with those of previous studies of optimal indebtedness in which
                                        -
consumables are borrowed directly.

 1.   Introduction




      This paper investigates the motives of a small country for borrowing in

order to purchase capital equipment on international markets. The country

produces capital and a non-traded consumption good, hut may wish to borrow or

lend capital to achieve a higher level of welfare. This analysis can be

distinguished from most examinations of optimal international indebtedness,

which focus on a consumption motive for borrowing.1 Although ultimately our

country would like to enjoy high levels of consumption, it cannot borrow

consumption goods directly.

      We are particularly interested in the change in borrowing patterns as the

time horizon of individuals in the small country changes, and find

paradoxically that in some cases as a country saves more, it borrows more

internationally. A move toward giving more weiqht to the future might be

interpreted as a desire to forego current felicity in order to develop and

achieve higher long—run levels of well-being. Under the assumptions in this

paper, such a shift would lead to higher steady—state consumption at the

expense of current consumption.   In a model where borrowing is for consumption

(e.g., Obstfeld (1982)) such a cut would lead immediately to less borrowing or

more international lending by the small—country. In our model, in order to

cut current consumption, the capital stock employed in the consumption goods

industry must be reduced. If the consumer goods industry is capital—intensive

the country would reduce its capital stock immediately by lending abroad.

However, if consumption goods are labor—intensive then the overall capital

stock of the country must rise, which requires international borrowing. This

latter case offers a possible explanation for why a country that becomes more

future-oriented and wants to increase its long—run wealth may wish to increase
                                    —2-

its foreign inlebtedness.

     A second issue deals with the literature on stages in the balance of

payment. Fischer and Frenkel (1974) discuss a traditional argument which

asserts that a capital—poor country will go through stages in its balance of

payments as it grows. Initially the country borrows from the rest of the

world, hut as it matures it becomes a lender. It may reach a stage where it

has accumulated claims on other countries and finances a trade balance deficit

with earnings from those claims. Fischer and Frenkel demonstrate such a

phenomenon in a two—sector model in which consumption goods only are traded.

They assume a saving function which depends only on wealth. Bazdarich (1978),

however, shows that in the same context, but with optimizing consumers, there

are no stages of borrowing. This conclusion is reversed when borrowing occurs

to obtain capital. We show that optimizing agents in a capital poor country

may indeed initially borrow to increase their capital stock, but then run down

their debts over time. They could eventually become net owners of claims on

the rest of the world.

     The two industries, capital goods and consumption goods, have constant

returns to scale technology and use labor and capital in the production

process. Both factors are freely mobile between industries. Capital can be

borrowed internationally at a qiven interest rate. Identical individuals

maximize discounted utility of consumption. The discount rate is determined

endogenously, and is parameterized as in Uzawa (1968). The endogeneity of the

discount rate is essential in allowing this economy to achieve steady—state.

With a constant discount rate, a small country with an infinite time horizon

that borrows at a given world interest rate will not have a convergent

consumption path toward a steady state (see Bardhan (1967)). The type of

preferences described by Uzawa allow convergence. In the international
                                        —3—


 context, Findlay (1978) and Ohstfeld (1981, 1982) have successfully modelled

optimal foreign borrowing under these assumptions.

       The availability of capital at an exogenously determined world interest

rate fixes the shadow wage and rate of return to capital. When time

preference changes and the country wants to cut current consumption, its

pattern of borrowing is determined by the Rybczynski theorem.2 If the

consumption goods industry is capital intensive, a reduction in the country's

capital stock will shrink consumption and expand capital output. If capital

goods production is capital intensive, an expansion of the capital stock

through borrowing will reduce consumption output and increase manufacture of

capital goods.

       It is also interesting to examine how the steady state rate of capital

imports is affected by a shift in time preference. In the long run, new

production of investment goods is used to replace capital that is depreciating

in both industries. If new investment is not sufficient to cover

depreciation, capital must be imported from abroad. When the country moves to

a higher level of steady—state consumption, steady—state production of

investment goods falls. This tends to raise the rate of capital flows from

abroad. Furthermore, if the consumption goods industry is capital intensive,

its expansion requires an expansion in the country's steady-state capital

stock. This, in turn, increases the amount of new capital required in order

to offset the depreciation of the capital stock, thus reinforcing the need for

more inflows of capital. On the other hand, if the consumption goods industry

is labor   intensive, steady-state capital,   and hence steady-state depreciation,

must   fall.   This reduces the need for imports of capital but this effect will

not outweigh the effect of reduced production of new investment goods.

Capital imports in the steady state must rise.

        The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the

model and derives conditions for optimality. Section 3 examines the steady

state. The dynamics of foreign borrowing and capital accumulation are studied

in Section 4. Concluding remarks are in Section 5.




2. The Model



        Identical individuals maximize discounted infinite horizon utility.

Utility is derived from a consumption good which is produced domestically and

is not traded. Capital and consumption goods are produced domestically using

capital and labor as inputs. Both factors are freely mobile between

industries. Each good has a constant returns to scale production function.

Capital may be borrowed internationally. The country is small, so that it

takes    the interest rate as given.
        An individual 's    utility Ut at     each moment in time is related to
consumption ct:



            Ut =    u(ct)


We assume



            u'(ct) > 0       and       uu(ct) < 0 •                               (1)


To avoid corner solutions, we postulate



             Urn u(ct) =           .                                              (2)

The individual maximizes the integral


                       =
           V   =
                       f ue tdt                                      (3)
                        0


where


                        t
                       f      ôds                                    (4)
                           Os
and     is the instantaneous subjective discount rate at time s. Following

Uzawa, we take 6 to be a function of utility at time s:



                   =
                       o(u)   .                                      (5)


We also assume



           o > 0 ,          0' > 0 ,   0 —   O'u > 0 ,   0" > 0 ,    (6)


as in Uzawa.

      For simplicity the total labor force is 1, and v is the amount of labor

employed in the sector that produces capital goods. The total amount of

capital in the economy is k, and in each sector k1 and k2, where the subscript

1 is for the investment goods industry and 2 for the consumption good. So,



          k1 + k2 = k             .                                  (7)


We assume output in the capital goods industry is a function of the quantity
                                                 —6-

of labor and capital goods employed in that industry,



                =
                     F(k1,    v)




and likewise for the consumption good



                =             1—v)
                     G(k2,


The production functions are homogeneous of degree one, and satisfy the usual

convexity conditions and Inada conditions.

      The homogeneity of the production functions allows us to define




           f(v/k1)           F(1, v/k1) =     --- F(k1,       v)




and




           g((1-v)/k2)             G(1, (1-v)/k2) =            G(k2,   1-v)
                                                          2




It is convenient notationally to define




                     v/k1 and £2          (1—v)/k2



      We assume that capital in both industries depreciates at a rate n. The

total capital stock for the economy evolves according to



          k =                 -    nk +                                       (8)
                    k1f(1)                .
                                             —7—



 In this equation -r represents the rate at which capital is imported from

abroad. If the country lends abroad, it acquires an asset, b. The rate of

 return on lending is assumed to be exogenously given to the small country as

r-n. Therefore, the path of b is determined by



          b =    (r-n)b    —    -t •                                  (9)


Equation (9) gives the current account for this country.

     We must impose the constraints



         c>0, k>0, k2>0, v<1, k1>0, v>0

Given assumption (2), the first four constraints are never binding. The last

two may be binding. There could be specialization of production in the

consumption good. This possibility will he ignored in the text, and taken up

in Appendix 2.

     Individuals also face the lifetime constraint:3



          bt -    S
                          tse          _t)ds > 0   .                  (10)
                      t



This constraint says that the amount of the small country's debt (_bt) must be

less than or equal to the sum of the discounted amount the country plans to

pay back each period (_-r). Without such a constraint, with the infinite

horizon planning problem an arbitrarily high level of utility could be

achieved by borrowing an arbitrary amount each period and meeting interest

payments through further borrowing. Given (11) we have
                                                —8—




           : te_tds
                                       =
                                           bt
                                                -   urn



So, the constraint (10) may be written as



          urn
                 bse_(r_n)s
                               > 0 .                                                 (11)


It will be shown that along the optimal trajectory described in this section

and section 4, condition (11) is satisfied.

     From (4) we have the fact that



          dt =                                                                       (12)
                  ó(u(ct))dt

so that (3) may be rewritten as




         V =      5                                                                  (13)




     Using (12) and (13) necessary conditions for an optimum can be found by

choosing c, , k1, and v to naximize the Harniltonian:4



          H(c, , k1, v, k, b, q1, q2, X) =                     o(uc)T   [u(c)

Equations (15) — (19) maximize the Hamiltonian given the fact that u(c)/ô is

concave (which is assured by conditions (6)). The motion of the system is

described by (8), (9) and



             = (8 +      -                    -

     Equation (15) defines the shadow value of consumption. Equation (16)

states that no consumption goods are wasted. The condition that new capital

have an equal shadow value if it is used at home or lent abroad is given by

(17). Equality of the values of the marginal product of capital between

the implicit price of consumption goods relative to capital goods.

or that the marginal product of capital in industry 1 equals r. Equation (23)

defines          implicitly      as a function of r. With the value of r given

exogenously to the small country,



                                                                                 (24)
                   =11.


Next, using (18), (19) and (24) we can write




             g(2)                  f(11)
                                                                                 (25)
             g      21
                                   f'(T11)




This implies

We   see that the availability of foreign capital at a fixed interest rate nails

down the labor—capital ratios in both industries. As new capital is injected

into (or drained out of) the economy, labor adjusts between the two industries

so as to maintain the labor—capital ratios at               and

      it is now a straightforward exercise to solve for the control variables,

c, v, 'r and k1 in terms of the state variables k and b.

      Since




            k111 + k212 =              1   ,                           (27)


we have

                         £1       £2


      Using (7)

                         £i - £2


So, it follows from (16) that



            c     =  kT-1
                     £1 - £2
                                   g(12)       •                      (30)


      The amount of labor in industry 1 is simply

                                 £i - £2


       The shadow prices can also be solved as functions of the state

variables. Equations (17) and (19) imply


                                  g'(I)
            q1 = q2 = Xó                         .                      (32)

                                      I




Equations (22) and (32) can be solved simultaneously to give X, q1, and q2 as

functions of h and k.

       The rate of borrowing from abroad is given from (8) as


                                      1-ky
                = k + nk - (                                            (33)
                                      £1 - £2
                                                 )f(T1)    .




In order to express r as a function of the state variables alone, k must be

solved for the state variables. The constancy of the marginal products of

labor and capital imply that the (shadow) price of capital goods relative to

consumption goods must remain constant. By equation (32) we have



                     =
                         (Xo)/Xo


or,   using equations (17) and (21),



            a   +n   —   r   =
                                 (Xo)/Xô         .                      (34)


      Taking the time derivative of equation (22) yields
                                                 - 13       -




            (xo)/o      =
                            c(l,   b, k, b)                            (35)




where      is a very non-linear function. Equations (8) and (9) give us



            b = (r—n)b — k — nk +                       .              (36)
                                             k1f(11)


So,   we can write


            (xo)/?o = 2'           k,   b) .                           (37)


Recognizing from (30) that c is a function of k alone, (34) and (36) imply



           k =   1(k,   b) .                                           (38)


(See Appendix 1 for the derivation of (38)). Plugging (38) into (33)

solves    in terms of k and b:




                                        1 —
                                               k12
             = I.'(k,   b) + nk     —
                                        (_      —)f(11) .              (39)
                                        £i - £2




Equation (39) says that the excess of the country's growth in capital stock

plus depreciation over its new production of capital must be made up by

borrowing from abroad.

      It is now possible to obtain a value for the objective function that

depends only on kt and bt. Substituting (15), (28), (30), (31), (32) and (39)
                                         - 14   -




into   (14) gives the Hamiltonian at time t as an expression in kt and bt:



            Ht(c, r, k1, v, k, b, q1, q2, ?) =      Ht(kt,   bt)



       The next section examines the steady state of the model. The effect on

the steady state of a change in time preference is studied. Section 4 looks

at the dynamic evolution of the system given by (9), (38) and (39).    In both

of those sections (as in this section) attention will be focussed on the

economy when there is incomplete specialization in production.




3. The Steady State



       It will be shown in the next section that the economy converges to a

steady state in which k, b and q are all zero. It is useful to examine the

properties of the steady state because the economy will, in the absence of

shocks, spend only a finite time outside a neighborhood of the steady state.

       The condition that the costate variables be stationary in the long run

tells us from (21):



            ô(u(c*)) =   r   —   n   .                                 (40)


Given the monotonicity of ô and ii, there is a unique level of consumption

associated with each real interest rate in the long run. Since consumption is

a function only of the capital stock, equation (40) also pins down the long—

run total domestic capital. More specifically, we have from (40) and (30)

that
                                                    — 15   —




            k* =
                   1-1
                    1         2
                                       -1-1
                                  u (& (r — nfl] —              1
                                                                                         (41)
                         £1                                     £i




We   will assume that k* lies between 1/ and 1/12. The case when k* lies

outside these bounds is taken up in Appendix 2.                      (If the consumption goods

sector is capital intensive it can be shown that k* < i/li and if the

consumption goods sector is labor intensive k* > i/1. This follows because

assumption (2) rules out specialization in the investment good.)

       The steady state rate of capital imports can be gotten directly from (39)

as




                              1 -
                                       k*12
               =   nk*   —
                              ( —                   .                                    (42)
                                       - —)f(11)
                                  Li    £2



This   country imports capital in the steady state if the rate of depreciation

exceeds the rate of production of new capital.

       The steady state holdings of foreign bonds is given by




                                                   1 -   k*1
            b* =              =         [nk*   -
                                                   (_    - 2)f(11)]
                                                                       .                (43)
                                                    Li     £2



If   there are capital imports from abroad in the steady state, then we must

hold a positive stock of foreign assets. The interest payments on these bonds

equals the amount of capital imports.
                                         - 16   -




        In section 2 the values for the control variables and the shadow prices
were determined as functions of the state variables. Their long run values

are therefore determined as the values of the functions evaluated at the

steady state levels of b and k.

        We can now ask how steady state levels of consumption and capital imports

change as time preferences change. We will consider a shift in the ô function

so that the instantaneous discount rate             is lower for every level of

consumption. This is a movement toward giving more weight to the future. For

example, if a planner changed his behavior so as to value future consumption

more relative to current consumption, his discount rate would have fallen. We

might then say that this shift in the 6 function represents a policy shift

toward "development" -    if   by development is meant higher long run levels of

well-being.

        It follows immediately from (40) and the assumptions made on 6(u(c)) in

(6) that



             dc*/dÔ < 0



where      is a shift parameter in the 6 function. A shift down in the discount

rate must lead to higher steady state levels of consumption if relation (40)

is to hold.

        An increase in steady state consumption requires from (16) an increase in

k2 given the constancy of £2. However, an increase in the capital used in the

consumption goods industry may require either an increase or decrease in the

economy's total capital stock. Figure 1 illustrates this point. The graph

shows the determination of k1 and k2 as the intersection of the lines of

equations (7) and (27). The top figure, in which the consumption goods

industry   is capital intensive, shows that an increase in the total capital

stock k yields an increase in k2. However, when the consumption goods

industry is labor intensive, as in the bottom figure, k2 can increase only if

k falls. This is simply Rybczynski's theorem. Formally, from (29) we have



           dk*_Li 2 ><0               —   >—
                 —               as
             2
                    Li


     The steady state level of capital imports is determined by the size of

the total capital stock and by the amount of capital devoted to the investment

goods industry. The shift down in ô(u(c)) reduces the size of the investment

goods sector, and thus increases the need for imports of capital to maintain

the nation's capital stock. If, in addition, the consumption goods sector is

capital intensive, then, from above, the total steady-state capital stock will

he larger. This implies even more imports to maintain the depreciating

capital stock. Thus, if the capital goods sector is labor intensive,

increasing patience will unambiguously raise steady state capital imports. By

equation (43) it will also increase the holdings of foreign bonds required in

the long run to maintain a zero current account.

     If the consumption goods sector is labor intensive, then the increase in

the weight given to future consumption lowers the steady-state capital

stock. While this tends to reduce proportionally the need for capital imports

(in order to offset depreciation), the output of the local investment goods

industry shrinks more than proportionally, by the Rybcznski theorem. So,

steady—state capital imports still increase. The change in steady—state

capital imports for a given change in k2 (which is monotonically related to

the change in the level of consumption) is given by
                                                         - 18   —

4. Dynamics



        In this section we examine the dynamics of the system outside the steady—

state. We are particularly interested in how                                the   system adjusts in response

to a shift towards more patience. We saw in section 2 that the system could

be solved in terms of the two state variables h and k.                                  It is convenient in

this section to define the total wealth of the small country, w = b +                                 k.
        The rate of change of k is given by equation (38). To find w, we add

equations (8) and (9) and use (28) to obtain




                         12f(11)
            b + k = (n +      —         ) (k         -
                                                         k) +   (r      -
                                                                            n) h ,                   (46)

                n(Ii       £2)       12f(11)

The , = 0 line is linear in b, k space. We have from (46) that
                                                           - 19   -

 and




              db/dkf          < -1           if        < £2



 The latter inequality follows from (23) which implies




              L2f(L1)                             ——

         The stability properties of this system near the steady state can be

 obtained by linearizing (38) and (46): (see Appendix 1)

The products of the eigenvalues, X1 and X2, are given by the determinant of

the above matrix:

                        I)




Hence, one eigenvalue, say X1, is positive and the other is negative. Since



                +     =r   — n       ,




we have




                > r — n



There is a single stable saddle path given by




          w -   w      —  .9.1f' (91)g(2)
                                 -

                                     12)g'(12)


     Possible phase planes are depicted in Figure 2. (The k = 0 line is drawn

for the case in which 6 is concave in c, although none of the analysis depends

on this. Also, note that the steady-state level of b can be either positive

or negative in both figures 2(a) and 2(b).) The slope of the saddle path near

the steady-state can be shown to be positive if the investment goods sector is

     We   know that the long—run effect of increasing patience is to raise the

steady state capital stock if consumption is capital intensive and lower the

steady state capital stock if consumption goods are labor intensive. To get

the effect on the initial changes in the capital stock (and hence the initial

borrowing) we simply differentiate (48) holding wt constant. Recognizing that




           w     =     11f'(11)g(12)
                                                k*   —       f(11)

we have that


                          x
           dk*           r—n

Thus the initial change in the capital stock is always in the opposite

direction of the eventual change in the steady state capital stock. This

implies that initially there is a drop in consumption.

     If the consumption goods industry is labor intensive, there must be an

initial increase in the capital stock that expands investment goods production

and contracts consumption goods production. In this case, the shift down in

the discount function (increased concern for the future) leads to foreign

borrowing initially. In the case in which consumption is capital intensive,

there will be foreign lending on impact.

    These results can be understood more completely with the help of the

phase diagrams. Figure 3(a) is for the case in which consumption goods are

capital intensive. Here, the w = 0 line must slope upwards, and the shift

down in ó(u(c)) must lead to a higher steady state capital stock. The initial

labor   intensive), bond holdings, b, decline so that for all non—negative

levels of wealth, production in the consumption goods sector is positive.5

This follows because the marginal felicity of consumption is unbounded as

consumption falls to zero. Integrating backwards in the opposite direction,

consumption rises until the entire labor force and capital stock are employed

in the consumption goods sector (k =    1/12).   Thereafter, the economy is

completely specialized in the production of the consumption good and both

consumption and the capital stock rise backwards along an optimal path for

complete specialization in the consumption goods sector. The equations of

motion for k and b under complete specialization are given in Appendix 2.

     Sufficient conditions for a path of k and b to be optimal are given by6



           lim e q1k =    0   ,   lirn e q2b1 =   0   .                  (49)


The path that leads to the steady state is an optimal path. Thus, we will

concentrate on the dynamics along the saddle path. Notice that along the path

the intertemporal budget constraint expressed in (11) is satisfied. If

initial conditions are given which are not on the saddle path, then there will

be a jump in the state variables b and k, such that wealth remains constant.7

     We now consider the effects of a change in time preference on the capital

stock and foreign bond holdings from an initial position of steady-state

equilibrium. There will be a jump in the state variables b and k at the time

of the changes in the 5 function, but total wealth, w, cannot jump

immediately. There may be at first a trade of some capital for some foreign

bonds (leaving wealth unchanged) or vice—versa. After this, state variables

will adjust smoothly.

steady state was at a point such as a. The change in time preference moves
the economy up the w = 0 line to a new steady state at point h.

(The w = 0 line does not shift with the change in the 5 function.) In order

to get onto the new saddle path from position a, this country must lend abroad

the amount of capital given by the distance aa'.    It then accumulates capital

and foreign bonds along the path to the steady state.

     When consumption goods are labor intensive Figure 3(b) applies.

The w = 0 line slopes down, and the change in tine preference leads to a lower

steady state capital. However, initially there must be some foreign borrowing

that allows the capital stock to jump from a to a'. This is the case in which

a more future oriented economy would resort at first to some international

borrowing. After the jump to a', capital stocks fall, hut foreign bonds and

wealth accumulate along the path to steady state.

     Next, consider a capital—poor country which initially has no external

debt or foreign bond holdings and begins to exchange freely capital goods and

bonds with the rest of the world. The country should initially issue debt and

import capital until it is on the saddle path with wealth equal to its initial

capital stock. It will then have a capital stock which is greater (less) than

the steady-state capital stock if the investment goods sector is capital—

intensive (labor—intensive). Adjustment towards the steady—state occurs as

the country runs a current account surplus and reduces its debt. In the

steady—state, the country has a balanced current account and can be either a

net debtor or creditor. In the latter case, it will have a trade account

deficit and service account surplus. If the country were capital rich, the

dynamics would follow a pattern opposite to the one described above. However,

the country may completely specialize in the production of the consumption

 good until its capital stock falls sufficiently through depreciation so that

the value of the marginal product of caital is equal across sectors.

     Figure 4 depicts a sequence of events that is consistent with Fischer and

Frenkel 's description of stages of the balance of payments. The country is

initially at a point such as x when its markets open up to free trade.    It

immediately runs a current account deficit and acquires capital as it moves

from x to y. This stage would correpsond to the young debtor stage described

by Fischer and Frenkel. As the country moves from y to z, it reduces its debt

to the rest of the world. It is a mature debtor in this stage. From z to the

steady—state, the country is a young creditor. It is a net creditor and is

increasing its claims on the rest of the world. At the steady—state the

country finances a deficit on trade account with interest payments on its

holdings of foreign debt.   It is a mature creditor with a balanced current

account.




5. Conclusion



     This paper builds a simple framework in which factors are mobile within a

country, and only capital can be traded abroad in return for promises to repay

more capital in the future. In this set-up we found that a shift in time

preference toward a more future orientation leads to a cut—back in current

consumption levels as a means of obtaining higher long—run levels of

consumption. In a model in which only consumption goods can be lent or

borrowed this would imply an increase in lending abroad. But in our model the

drop in the level of activity in the consumption sector is accompanied by an

increase in domestic production of investment goods. In the case in which the

amount of capital that can profitably be reallocated from the consumption

sector is insufficient (the case in which capital goods production is capital

intensive) borrowing of machines from abroad must occur.

     This model makes several special assumptions which could be relaxed.

Neary (1978) has criticized the assumption of perfect inter—sectoral factor

mobility in this type of model. Short-run specificity of capital might lead

to an adjustment motive for borrowing. It might also be useful to test the

robustness of the results of this paper by considering models with richer

trading opportunities.

it   follows that

Since s is a function of k and b only, and c is a function only of k, this is

equation (38) of the text.

      To derive the linearization of k at the point where k = 0 and s =    0,   we

use the fact that


                                                  +
         d          =   —c; — 12)(ô"u'2

Near i    = 0,   this derivative equals zero. Hence, the k = 0 line has a slope of

—1 in b, k space near equilibrium.

    Here we study the behavior of the system when the economy completely

specializes in production of the consumption good in steady state.

    The first—order conditions in this case are



     k =i-nk

     b = (r     —       n)b   —     t

                                                                        —

                                                                  n)b       nk)



      c = kg(1/k)


      q = (6    + n)q -             X6[g(1/k)    -   (1/k)g'(l/k)]

      q    = (6 +       n —    r)q


     The   first-order conditions differ from the case of non—specialized
production in that the marginal products of labor and capital in the
consumption goods industry exceed those in the (non—existent) investment goods
industry. The marginal products, the labor/capital ratios in each industry

and the relative shadow price of the goods were all constant in the non-

specialized case, but all vary over time here.

     Steady—state consumption is determined by



                    =    r    — n
 Steady—state capital is given by



       c = k*g(1/k*)


Finally,



       nk* =   (r   —       n)b*


gives us steady-state bond holdings.

      As in the non—specialized case, dynamics can be studied by focusing on

the equations for k and w. We have immediately



       w = k + b        =
                            (r   —
                                     n)w   —   rk


The equation for k will require more work. Much of the derivation parallels

that in Appendix 1. The definitions of some of the symbols used here, and

some missing steps in the derivation are supplied in Appendix 1.

      First, note that



       rq = X8(g —          g'Jk)


Therefore



      q/q =    [d(Xo)dtJ/xo           +    d(g      -
                                                        g'/k)/dt]/(g   -
                                                                           g'/k)


But
         q/q =    ó(u(c(k)))      + n -      r


So, we have from the first-order conditions that X6 can be solved as a

function of k and w. This means the time derivative of Xô is a function of

k, w, k and w. But, we have already seen that w is a function of k and w.

So, the equation



         6 + n —    r   =   [d(Xo)/dt]/Xo        +   [d(g     —   g'/k)/dt]/(g   —
                                                                                     g'/k)

gives k implicitly as a function of k and w.

        We have



         [d(g -    g'/k)/dt]/(g         -   g'/k)    =
                                                         [(g"/k3)/(g    -   g'/k)]k


        Next



         Xo =   [(u'/ô)(ô     -   ô'u)]/[l       +   (ô'u°/ô)s]

         s = (g -   g'/k)[((r       —
                                         n)/r)w      —   k]


Then

as in Appendix 1.              In the case of specialized production we have



      c = (g -         g'/k)k


Some calculations can show



           =
               (1/)[As(g               -       g'/k)k       -
                                                                 (ô'u'/ô)(g           -
                                                                                              g'/k)k

           +   (ô'u'/ô)(r              -       n)s +    (ô'u'/ô)s((g"/k3)/(g                            -
                                                                                                             g'/k))k]

All of this can be combined to give



      (ô + n -         r)      =   D(g          -
                                                    g'/k)k        -
                                                                      As(g      -
                                                                                     g'/k)k         +       (o'u'/o)(g      -   g'/k)k

                           -       (ô'u'/ô)(r           -       n)s   -
                                                                          (ô'u'/o)s[(g"/k3)/(g                    -   g'/k)]k

                           +       A[(g"/k3)/(g             -     g7k)]k


or




      o   +n   —   r   +   O'u's           =
                                                (D +    o'u'fO)(g           —       g'/k)k


                       +   (D(O'u'/O)               -   A)s(g -           g'/k)k          +    [(g'7k3)/(g        -
                                                                                                                      g'/k)]k

     So, solving for k



      k = (0 + n -             r   +   O'u's)/[(D + As)(g                       -    g'fk)      +       (g"/k3)/(g      -    g'/k)]
This can be linearized around the steady state as



      k   [ô'u'((r -   n)/r)/(D   +   (q/k)/(kg   -   g')2)](w   -
                                                                     w)



The coefficient on w - w is negative. Thus, the k and w equations yield a

phase diagram qualitatively identical to that of Figure 2(a) —            the case in
which the consumption good is capital intensive. Here, moving backwards in

time from the steady—state, there may he a period in which both the

consumption good and capital good are produced.

     As in Figure 3(a), an increase in concern for the future (a shift down in

the 6 function) leads to an immediate drop in the domestic capital stock as

capital is lent abroad.

      'See, for example, Bardhan (1967, 1970), Obstfeld (1981, 1982) or

 Dornbusch (1983). There are many similarities between the model in this paper

 and the one in Obstfeld (1982). Obstfeld considers an economy with a constant

 flow of non—produced income. His model is equivalent to a model in which a

 schmoo good (can be used as consumption or capital) is produced. If capital

 can be traded freely, output is constant at the level where the marginal

 product of capital equals the world interest rate. Borrowing only occurs for

 consumption purposes once output is fixed.

     A previous paper that has investigated international borrowing in a

context in which capital goods are traded is Fischer and Frenkel (1972).    They
point out that if the capital stock is costlessly adjustable, and there is

free trade in consumption, capital and securities, that a country's capital

stock is indeterminate. They introduce an investment function, which suffices

to determine the stock of capital at any time. Here, we avoid the

indeterminacy because the consumption good is non-traded. Fischer and Frenkel

study the dynamics of capital accumulation with the assumption of a constant

saving rate. This paper investigates international borrowing under the

assumption that agents maximize utility of consumption.

     A recent paper by Nunes (1983) considers a model in which capital goods

can be traded and there is optimal borrowing. The paper assumes a constant

discount rate and that the knife-edge condition holds that the discount rate

equals the world interest rate, so that there are no dynamics in consumption

expenditure.
      2Rybczynsi1s (1955) theorem states that at constant prices, an increase

in one factor endowment will increase the output of the good intensive in that

factor more than proportionally and will reduce the output of the other good.



      3See Arrow and Kurz (1970) and Obstfeld (1981, 1982) for discussions of

similar conditions.



      4See Arrow and Kurz (1970). Equation (17) follows from the Kuhn—Tucker

conditions if borrowing is finite.
