Price Regulation, Price Discrimination, and Equality of Opportunity in Higher Education:
Evidence from Texas

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the importance of price regulation and price discrimination to low-income
students' access to opportunities in public higher education. Following a policy change in the
state of Texas that shifted tuition-setting authority away from the state legislature to the
governing board of each public university, most institutions raised sticker prices and many began
charging more for high-return undergraduate majors, such as business and engineering. We use
administrative data on Texas public university students from 2000 to 2009 matched to earnings
records, financial aid, and new measures of tuition and resources at a program level to assess how
deregulation affected the representation of disadvantaged students in high-return institutions and
majors in the state. We find that poor students actually shifted towards higher-return programs
following deregulation, relative to non-poor students. Deregulation facilitated more price
discrimination by increasing grant aid for low-income students and also enabled supply-side
enhancements such as more spending per student, which may have partially offset the detrimental
effects of higher sticker price. The Texas experience suggests that providing institutions more
autonomy over pricing and increasing sticker prices need not diminish the opportunities available
to disadvantaged students.

I.      Introduction
The large private and social returns to educational investment are well documented (Oreopoulos and
Salvanes, 2011) and human capital investment is a key factor in both economic growth and inequality
(Goldin and Katz, 2008; Autor, 2014). The public role in supporting postsecondary educational
investment is long-standing; for example, states spent $173 billion on higher education in 2012,
permitting public institutions to provide postsecondary education to millions of students at a price well
below cost (NASBO, 2013). Recently, however, tight state budgets have challenged states’ ability to
maintain a commitment to both ensuring broad access and delivering programs of high quality. State
spending on higher education was cut substantially over the past two decades, with large cuts particularly
during the Great Recession (Barr and Turner, 2013). Spending cuts that trigger tuition increases could
widen the existing large gaps between high- and low-income students in college enrollment (Bailey and
Dynarski, 2011), particularly at the most selective institutions (Hoxby and Avery, 2013). This would be
problematic given the large returns to a college education generally (Zimmerman, 2014) and for the most
selective institutions and majors specifically (Hoekstra, 2009; Hastings, Neilson, & Zimmerman, 2013;
Kirkeboen, Leuven & Mogstad, 2014). Spending cuts that reduce program quality may additionally
reduce degree completion (Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner, 2012; Cohodes and Goodman, 2014). How
public higher education institutions balance their dual access and quality objectives thus has important
economic consequences.
        In Texas, short-term state spending cuts in 2003 were accompanied by a permanent shift in
tuition-setting authority away from the state legislature to the governing board of each public university,
termed “tuition deregulation.” Most universities subsequently raised prices and many began charging
more for high-demand or costly undergraduate majors, such as business and engineering. Kim and Stange
(2016) found that price increases in Texas outpaced those in other states following deregulation and were
largest for the most lucrative programs and at the most selective institutions. The presidents of major
research universities claimed that tuition-setting flexibility enables institutions to expand capacity and
help students succeed by enhancing program quality (Lim, 2002; Yudof, 2003). Detractors worried that
price escalation would limit access to the most selective institutions and most lucrative programs for low-
income students (Hamilton, 2012). More than a decade later Texas lawmakers continue to debate the
merits of deregulation without hard evidence of its consequences. This study fills this gap by assessing
how tuition deregulation – and the subsequent price increases – affected the representation of
disadvantaged students in high-return institutions and majors. In the only study that examines this policy
change, Flores and Shepard (2014) found that at seven Texas institutions, institution-level price




                                                      2
accelerated following deregulation, but effects on overall enrollment of underrepresented minority
students and Pell Grant recipients was mixed.
        To more completely assess the consequences of deregulation, this paper uses administrative data
on the universe of Texas public high school graduates at public universities from 2000 to 2009 matched to
earnings records, financial aid, and new measures of tuition and resources at a program level. Our
analysis proceeds in three parts. In the first part, we document substantial earnings differences across
postsecondary programs in Texas, both within and across institutions. These differences persist even after
including rich student controls. Throughout we stratify programs by these predicted earnings, as a proxy
for programs’ price elasticity of demand. The worry was that those programs with the greatest market
power (as measured by low price elasticity) would raise prices considerably after deregulation and attract
only high-income students, given low-income students’ greater price responsiveness (Jacob, McCall,
Stange, 2013).
        In the second part, we directly examine this concern with a reduced-form analysis of how the
nature of student sorting changed following deregulation. We show that poor students are
underrepresented in the highest-return programs, again even after accounting for differences in student
characteristics between poor and non-poor students. Our main finding is that poor students actually
shifted away from the least lucrative programs following deregulation, increasing their representation in
higher-earning programs relative to non-poor students. On average poor students enter programs that
generate earnings gains that are 3.7% lower than non-poor students, after controlling for demographics
and achievement test scores. This gap closes by more than one-third following deregulation. This broad
finding that poor students gained relative to non-poor students following deregulation is quite robust to
various controls for changes in student characteristics and also does not appear to reflect pre-existing
trends. We also rule out alternative policies – such as delayed effects of the Top 10 Percent Plan, targeted
outreach, and affirmative action – as explanations for these patterns. A supplemental analysis comparing
the Texas experience to other states reinforces our conclusion that poor students in Texas gained relative
to non-poor students following deregulation.
        Decomposing the effect into across- vs. within-institution shifts suggests that almost all of the
change can be explained by gains in the relative quality of institutions attended by poor students, with
very modest shifts across majors. Encouragingly, the positive shift in initial program choice by poor
students persists for at least two years following initial enrollment, so it is likely to result in real relative
improvements in the economic wellbeing of low-income students.
        Finally, in the third part we investigate the various channels through which deregulation alters the
sorting of students across programs. Consistent with pricing theory, we find that price increases were
largest for the highest-return programs following deregulation; that is, the price increases were largest for




                                                         3
those programs with the greatest amount of market power. However, need-based grant aid increased
considerably, particularly in programs with large price increases, such that the net price that low-income
students paid fell relative to the price that non-poor students pay. For some programs, we find that the
absolute price that poor students pay falls following deregulation. Program resources (number and salary
of faculty per student, class size) also increased the most for the programs with the highest returns.
Greater income-based price discrimination permitted these programs to retain (or even expand) low-
income student representation while simultaneously raising sticker price and program quality. The
overall conclusion is that deregulation in Texas universities does not appear to have harmed low-income
students’ access to the most desirable state university programs.
          Our findings contribute to three distinct literatures. First, we conclude that institutions’ ability to
price discriminate with both higher sticker prices and increased provision of need-based grant aid has
important consequences. Our findings align with prior work that finds that price discrimination can be
beneficial to low-income individuals both in higher education (Fillmore, 2014) and other industries by
lowering relative prices. Price discrimination means that the greater price and resource differentiation
seen among U.S. colleges (Winston, 2004; Hoxby, 2009) does not necessarily exclude low-income
students. Ours is the first study to look at a broad shift from a regime of broad-based subsidies (low
sticker price) to one of specific subsidies (higher sticker price plus greater aid) in higher education.
Second, we provide some of the first evidence on the effects of deregulation – and university autonomy
more generally – on the higher education market. Deregulation increases differentiation, which may have
efficiency gains that we have not measured. Prior work has found that university autonomy is positively
associated with research output (Aghion, Dewatripont, Hoxby, Mas-Colell, & Sapir, 2010), but the equity
or efficiency consequences of greater institutional autonomy in undergraduate education have not been
previously examined. Finally, we provide further evidence that heterogeneity of human capital investment
opportunities is materially important (Altonji, Blom and Meghir, 2012), even within the context of a
public university system in a single state. Thus, the sorting of students across programs and institutions
materially affects how a states’ higher education system alters the intergenerational transmission of
income.
          From a policy perspective, our study is both timely and of broad importance beyond the state of
Texas. Florida and Virginia also recently decentralized tuition-setting authority; and New York,
Washington, Wisconsin, and Ohio have considered similar proposals (McBain, 2010; Deaton, 2006;
Camou and Patton, 2012). Just this year, voters in Louisiana rejected a plan that was quite similar to
Texas’ system. The Texas experience suggests that deregulation need not adversely affect the
opportunities available to vulnerable students, as many critics worried. Two potentially key features of the
Texas case are the requirement that institutions channel some of the incremental revenue towards need-




                                                         4
based aid for students and the presence of a large state-financed need-based aid program that shielded the
poorest students from price increases. How deregulation would have evolved in the absence of these
features remains an open question.
         This paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides background on tuition deregulation in
Texas, its need-based financial aid programs, and prior literature. Section III describes our data and
sample. Methods and results are presented in three parts. Section IV documents large differences in
student earnings across programs. Section V documents large socioeconomic disparities across programs
and assesses changes in student sorting following deregulation. Section VI investigates mechanisms, such
as program prices, resources, and student grant aid. Section VII concludes.


II.      Background
A. Texas Context and Deregulation
Texas has a large and diverse public higher education system, with 50 community college districts and 33
traditional public four-year colleges, which range from very selective top research universities to
relatively unselective regional campuses. As in many other states, these institutions have historically
relied heavily on state appropriations as the main source of funding. In Texas, appropriations are
determined by a formula that reimburses institutions at a fixed rate for the number of weighted semester
credit hours (SCH) its students earn, with weights varying by level and discipline area based roughly on
cost differences. 1 Importantly, weights are the same across all institutions; a flagship institution receives
the same appropriation for a lower-division liberal arts course as a less selective institution, despite
potentially investing more resources. Thus institutions whose students would demand (or benefit from) a
greater level of investment in a given discipline-level will find it difficult to make such investments with
state appropriations alone.
         Higher tuition and fees are a means via which institutions could potentially fund greater levels of
investment than is supported by the state. In Texas, tuition consists of two components, statutory and
designated tuition (THECB, 2010), which were controlled by the state legislature. Statutory tuition
(authorized under Texas Education Code (TEC) 54.051) is a fixed rate per credit hour that differs only by
residency status, but is otherwise constant across institutions and programs. Designated tuition is a charge
authorized by TEC 54.0513 that permits institutions to impose an additional tuition charge that the

  The five levels include lower division undergraduates, upper division undergraduates, graduate students, doctoral
students, and professional students. The twenty discipline areas are liberal arts, science, fine arts, teacher education,
agriculture, engineering, home economics, law, social sciences, library sciences, development education, vocational
training, physical training, health services, pharmacy, business administration, optometry, teacher education
practice, technology, nursing, and veterinary medicine. Weights are normalized to 1.00 for lower division liberal arts
courses, and are updated every few years (THECB, 2010a).



                                                           5
governing board of the institution deems appropriate and necessary. Though designated tuition charges
were determined by institutions, the legislature historically capped designated tuition at the level of
statutory tuition. 2
         Due to the economic downturn in 2001, the state made significant cuts to appropriations in 2002,
leading many institutions to advocate for more flexibility in setting tuitions (Hernandez, 2009). Leaders of
the flagship universities argued that the revenue model in existence at the time did not provide sufficient
pricing options for the array of services offered and did not consider differences between institutions such
as; tier, market demand, types of programs offered or the national prominence of these programs (Lim,
2002; Yudof, 2003). They believed that tuition flexibility would maintain existing levels of service and
would increase institutional agility to anticipate and meet state-wide educational and economic
development needs. In September 2003, the legislature passed HB 3015, which modified TEC 54.0513 to
allow governing boards of public universities to set different designated tuition rates, with no upper limit.
Furthermore, institutions could vary the amount by program, course level, academic period, term, and
credit load and any other dimension institutions deem appropriate. Since annual price-setting occurs in the
prior academic year, the Fall 2004 was the first semester that institutions could fully respond to
deregulation.
         Figure 1 depicts the price changes following deregulation. As Figure 1 highlights, post-
deregulation tuition is marked by a higher growth rate and a greater spread relative to pre-deregulation
tuition. Panel B shows that the standard deviation in tuition across programs increased substantially after
2003. In particular, the standard deviation in tuition increased by about 50% immediately after
deregulation – from $300 in 2003 to $450 in 2004. This can, in part, be explained by universities shifting
to differential pricing across programs, particularly for Engineering and Business, as described by Kim
and Stange (2016). Texas institutions thus followed an aggregate trend of adopting pricing schemes that
charge more for more costly and/or lucrative majors (Stange, 2015). To address concerns that tuition
increases would disproportionately burden low-income students, institutions were required to set aside a
share of deregulation-induced tuition for financial aid for needy students (which we describe in detail
below). In addition, the legislature mandated that every institution participating in tuition deregulation
had to meet performance criteria and show progress toward the goals outlined in graduation measures,
retention rates, affordability measures, and financial aid opportunity in order to monitor institutions
performance and access (McBain, 2010).



2
 Universities are also allowed to charge mandatory and course fees for costs that are associated with services or
activities. In fall 2002, the average mandatory fee in the state was $454, ranged from $160 (University of Houston –
Victoria) to $1,175 (UT-Dallas), while the average course fee charged was $61.



                                                         6
    These abrupt changes in pricing and state support came against a backdrop of several other broad
efforts to impact student choices and success. For instance, the “Top 10 Percent” rule guaranteeing
admission to any public institution for students ranked in the top decile of their high school went into
effect in 1998 and increased enrollment at the state’s flagships (Domina 2007; Cortes 2010; Niu and
Tienda 2010; Daugherty, Martorell and McFarlin 2012), particularly from high schools with little history
of flagship enrollment (Long, Saenz, and Tienda, 2010). There was also a broad effort to improve access
and graduation rates for underrepresented minorities, which was codified in the state’s “Closing the
Gaps” initiative. Finally, Texas had a number of targeted financial aid and outreach programs, such as the
Longhorn Opportunity Scholars and Century Scholars Programs aimed at improving access to UT-Austin
and Texas A&M among low-income students (Andrews, Ranchhod and Sathy, 2010; Andrews,
Imberman and Lovenheim, 2016). We implement various sample restrictions that rule out the potential
contribution of several of these policies.


B. Financial Aid in Texas Before and After Deregulation
The financial impact of deregulation on low-income students was a central concern. The state’s numerous
financial aid programs, Federal Student Aid programs, and various provisions of the deregulation law
combined to help shield low-income students from the price increases that followed deregulation. Here
we briefly describe three of these programs and discuss how these programs interact with tuition
deregulation.
        The Towards EXcellence Access and Success (TEXAS) Grant program was established in 1999
to provide funds for higher education to academically prepared Texas high school graduates with
financial need. The TEXAS Grant, which is funded by appropriations from general revenues, is the state
of Texas’s largest financial aid program. For the fiscal year 2009, more than one hundred ninety-three
million dollars of TEXAS grant funds were distributed to 39,686 students at Texas’s public four-year
universities (THECB 2010b). The average and maximum award amounts were $4,864 and $5,280 for the
academic year, respectively, though lower in earlier years. Student eligibility is determined by need
(currently the student’s expected family contribution must be less than 4000 dollars) and having met high
school curricular requirements (for initial grantees) or basic college performance (for continuing
grantees). Total TEXAS Grant funds are allocated by the state to each institution annually (based on
estimated number of needy students), but then institutions have discretion for determining which eligible
students receive awards (if any) and how much (up to the maximum). Importantly, if an institution
decides to award a TEXAS Grant to a student, regardless of the award amount, then the institution is
obligated to provide non-loan financial aid to cover the student's full tuition and fees up to demonstrated
financial need. This feature of the TEXAS Grant program is what makes it one pathway through which



                                                      7
tuition deregulation affects student funding. Deregulation allows Texas institutions to determine the
designated tuition rate which in turn increases the cost of attendance. Given the increase in the cost of
attendance, the amount of TEXAS Grant for which a student is eligible also increases. But this may also
increase the institution of higher education's obligation as it must provide non-loan aid for TEXAS Grant
recipients whose award is insufficient to cover tuition and fees.
        House Bill 3015 (which enacted deregulation) required that 15 percent of the funds generated
from designated tuition charges in excess of 46 dollars per semester hour be set aside to provide aid for
financially needy undergraduate or graduate students in the form of grants or scholarships. 3 Institutions
have complete discretion in determining which students receive financial aid from this source within the
constraint that recipients must be needy. These funds can also be used as a source of non-loan financial
aid to close gaps in financial aid packages for TEXAS Grant recipients.
        The Texas Public Educational Grant (TPEG), enacted in 1975, is funded from a 15 percent set-
aside from statutory tuition charges at each institution. A student is eligible for a TPEG award if the
student has financial need; is a Texas resident, non-resident, or foreign; and has registered for the
selective service or is exempt from this requirement. Institutions have complete discretion in selecting
which eligible students receive an award. For fiscal year 2009, TPEG distributed 88.4 million dollars to
60,681 students in public colleges and universities in Texas. TPEG funds could also be used as a source
to close gaps in financial aid packages for TEXAS Grant recipients. Importantly, TPEG funds are derived
from statutory tuition rates, which continued to be set by state legislature following deregulation with no
variation across institutions, so we do not expect TPEG grant allocations to respond to deregulation.
        Finally, the Pell Grant Program (established in 1972) is the federal government’s largest grant
program to help low-income students attend college. To be eligible for a grant an individual must meet
certain residency requirements, be enrolled in an eligible program at a participating postsecondary
institution, and be determined to have sufficient financial need. For the later years in our sample, the
maximum Pell award amount increased by 25 percent, to $5,124 dollars. For the fiscal year 2009, nearly
$438 million was awarded to 135,623 students in Texas’s Public Universities (THECB 2010b).
        These programs together represent a considerable investment in making college affordable for
low-income students. The TEXAS Grant and HB3015 Set-aside programs in particular created a specific
mechanism through which low-income students could be shielded from price increases following
deregulation by tying need-based aid dollars directly to additional tuition revenue.



3
  An additional five percent of the proceeds were to fund the Texas B-On-Time Loan Program, a no-interest loan
that can be fully forgiven upon graduation if students graduate with a minimum average, though few students
participated in this loan program.



                                                        8
C. Prior Literature
Prior research has established the returns to a college education, even among academically marginal
students (Zimmerman, 2013). The benefits of a college degree are quite heterogeneous, however, as
students that attend better-resourced colleges are both more likely to graduate (Bowen, Chingos, &
McPherson, 2009; Cohodes and Goodman, 2014) and have higher earnings (Black and Smith, 2006;
Hoekstra, 2009). Furthermore, there are substantial earnings differences across majors. For instance,
Carnevale, Cheah, and Strohl (2012) show that median earnings are more than $20,000 per year higher
for recent college graduates in engineering than in communication, education, or humanities. In fact,
earnings differences across different majors may be comparable to the earnings gap between high school
and college graduates (Altonji, Blom and Meghir, 2012). These substantial differences remain even after
controlling for the non-random nature of college major choice (Arcidiacono, 2004; Hastings, Neilson,
Zimmerman, 2013; Kirkeboen, Leuven & Mogstad, 2014). Using student data similar to this study,
Andrews, Li, and Lovenheim (2016) also find large returns to college quality and show that these returns
are quite heterogeneous across students. This suggests that higher education could either narrow or widen
economic inequalities depending on the nature of the institutions attended by low-income and non-poor
students.
        Price (sticker and net) is one factor that prior evidence has demonstrated is closely linked to
college enrollment, institutional choice, and persistence (Dynarski 2000; Long, 2004; Hemelt and
Marcotte, 2011; Jacob, McCall, and Stange, 2013; Goldrick-Rab et al., 2011; Castleman and Long, 2013).
However, prior work has produced mixed evidence on whether tuition is actually higher when public
universities have more autonomy (Lowry, 2001; Rizzo and Ehrenberg, 2004) and this work neither
examines the impact of autonomy on students nor does it examine differences across programs within
institutions. The only exception is Flores and Shepard (2014), who found that at seven Texas institutions,
institution-level price accelerated following deregulation but effects on enrollment of underrepresented
minority students was mixed, with increased representation by blacks but reductions for Hispanic
students. Pell Grant recipients increased their college enrollment rates following deregulation.
        Looking at public universities nationally, Stange (2015) found that differential (higher) sticker
prices for engineering and business degrees is associated with fewer degrees granted in these fields,
particularly for women and racial minorities. However, this analysis examined differential pricing
stemming from a number of sources, not strictly the differences due to deregulation. Furthermore, the
setting and data was not capable of determining whether increased aid or other supply-side factors could
mitigate any adverse effects of higher program-specific price nor was it possible to look at effects on
inequities in much detail.




                                                     9
         A small number of studies have directly examined price discrimination by higher education
institutions and its implications for poor students. Using a structural equilibrium model of the college
market, Fillmore (2014) finds that reducing institutions’ ability to price discriminate based on income
lowers prices for middle- and high-income students, but raises prices for low-income students and also
prices some low-income students out of elite institutions. Price discrimination is thus beneficial to low-
income students. Epple, Romano, and Sieg (2006) also find that price discrimination significantly affects
the equilibrium sorting of students into colleges, though they do not assess differential effects by income
directly. Finally, Turner (2014) finds that institutions’ price discrimination behavior reveals a willingness-
to-pay for Pell Grant students, particularly for public institutions. Public institutions actually crowd-in
institutional aid for students receiving the Pell Grant. This highlights another channel through which poor
students might gain from the greater price discrimination enabled by tuition deregulation.


III.     Data Sources and Sample
We use administrative data covering all Texas public high school graduates and postsecondary enrollees
from 2000 to 2009 matched with quarterly earnings records. This student level data is paired with a
unique panel dataset of all programs offered by public universities in the state that contains new
information on the prices and resources at a department level each year. The data comes from the Texas
Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Texas Education Agency, and the Texas Workforce
Commission.


A. Student Data and Sample
Our student-level data includes all graduates of Texas public high schools from 2000 to 2009, assembled
as part of the Texas Schools Project at the University of Texas at Dallas Education Research Center.
Administrative data from the Texas Education Agency, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, and
Texas Workforce Commission are combined to form a longitudinal dataset of all public high school
graduates.
         From the Texas Education Agency, data include information on students’ socioeconomic
disadvantage during high school, high school achievement test scores, race, gender, date of high school
graduation, and high school attended. 4 Information on college attendance, major in each semester, college
application and admissions, and graduation are obtained for all students attending a public community or
four-year college or university in Texas from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. We

4
 High school exit exam scores for math and English are standardized to mean zero and standard deviation one
separately by test year, subject, and test type (as the test changed across cohorts) among all test-takers in the state.
Since our sample is restricted to four-year college enrollees, average test scores are well above zero.

identify disadvantaged students based on eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch in secondary school.
Finally, quarterly earnings are obtained for all students residing in Texas from the Texas Workforce
Commission and are drawn from state unemployment insurance records. Thus, we expect them to be
measured with little error, though they only include students who remain in the state of Texas and are
covered by UI. 5
    We assign students to the first four-year institution they attend and to the first declared major.
Students whose first major is “undeclared” are assigned the first non-undeclared major in their academic
record. Students who drop out without ever declaring a major are coded as “Liberal Arts.” We restrict our
analysis to students that enrolled in a public four-year institution in Texas within two years of high school
graduation. Since we condition on four-year college enrollment, we are abstracting from effects of
deregulation on the decision to enroll in any four-year college. 6 Further, students that enroll in an out-of-
state or private college are also excluded. Our full sample includes approximately 63,000 individuals in
each cohort, or 628,616 individuals across all cohorts. We also drop individuals with missing values for
key covariates, leaving 580,253 total students in our final analysis sample.
     Table 1 presents characteristics of the full sample. Approximately 19% of the sample is economically
disadvantaged (“poor”) across all cohorts of the decade. The middle rows of Table 1 describe the nature
of the first program attended by students in our sample. As we describe in more detail later, we rank
programs according to the average log earnings of students that entered each program in 2000-2002,
conditional on covariates and relative to students that did not attend a public college in Texas. Poor
students are underrepresented among the “top” earnings programs and overrepresented among the lower-
earning programs. Poor students also attend programs that have lower tuition levels.
    We are able to estimate total need-based grant aid (and thus net price) using micro data contained in
the Financial Aid Database compiled by THECB. This micro data consistently contains financial aid
award information for all students who receive need-based aid and enrolled in a Texas public institution
from 2000 to 2011. From this data we obtain the total need-based grant aid received in the first year of
enrollment for students in the 2000 to 2009 cohorts. We divide this amount in half to convert it to a
semester equivalent. Unfortunately aid received by students that did not perform a needs assessment is not
consistently included in the database over time. So we are unable to create measures of net price that

 Andrews, Li, and Lovenhiem (2016) find that coverage in the earnings records is quite good.

  Table A8 in the appendix shows little effect of deregulation on students’ likelihood of attending any public college
in Texas (including community colleges), any 4-year public institution, and inclusion in our analysis sample. Thus
we believe that changes in sample selection has little impact on our results.



                                                          11
incorporate non-need-based aid, such as merit and some categorical grant aid. 7 The bottom of Table 1
describes the need-based grant aid received by students in our sample. Unsurprisingly, poor students
receive much larger amounts of need-bases grant aid than non-poor students, nearly $2500 per semester.
The largest components are the Federal Pell Grant ($1330), TEXAS Grant ($870), and TPEG ($130).
Average grants from the HB3015 set-aside is small ($70), though this is misleading as these grants are
mechanically zero prior to deregulation and are small for schools that did not raise tuition. Net tuition for
poor students is very close to zero as a consequence of need-based grant aid alone. 8


B. Program-level Data and Sample
To track changes in college price following deregulation, we have assembled detailed information on
tuition and fees for each public university in Texas since 2000 separately by major/program, credit load,
entering cohort, residency and undergraduate level. This level of granularity is critical, as many
institutions adopted price schedules that vary according to all of these characteristics, and no prior source
of data captures these features. 9 Our main price measure is the price faced by in-state juniors taking 15
credit hours, which is the minimum number of credits students would need to take in order to graduate
within four years. We convert tuition prices to real 2012 dollars using the CPI.
         To measure program-level resources we utilize previously unused administrative data on all the
course sections offered and faculty in each department at each institution since 2000. This information is
obtained from Reports 4 and 8 published by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. This data is
used to construct various measures of resources, quality, and capacity (average class size, faculty per
student, faculty salary per student, capacity of course offerings) for each program at each institution in


7
  The financial aid data is not ideal as the target sample for the database changes over time. From 2000 to 2006 the
database includes only students who received any type of need-based aid, or any type of aid which requires a need
analysis. From 2007 to 2009 the database included students who are enrolled and completed either a FAFSA or
TASFA (Texas Application for State Financial Aid), some of which may not have received any aid. Since 2010, the
database was expanded to also include students who did not apply for need-based aid, but received merit or
performance-based aid. Thus the number of students represented in the database grows substantially over time. In
order to keep our measures of aid consistent, we first identify students that received a positive amount of grant aid
from at least one need-based aid program (Pell, SEOG, TEXAS Grant, TPEG, or HB 3015). Any student who did
not receive grant aid from one of these programs or who was not matched to the FAD database is assumed to have
zero need-based grants. The number of students with a positive amount of grant aid from one of these sources is
relatively constant at about 21,000 students per high school cohort.
8
  As a robustness check, we also examine grants from other sources received by need-eligible students (including
categorical aid and merit-based aid). Including these does not alter our estimates much. These items are not
consistently available for students that did not also have a needs assessment done.
9
  This information was assembled from various sources, including university websites, archives, and course catalogs.
Kim and Stange (2016) describe the price data in more detail.



                                                         12
each year before and after deregulation. We aggregated the merged course-faculty micro data to the level
of academic program at each Texas university from Fall 2000 to Fall 2009. Since the breadth of academic
programs vary by institution, we standardize them using 2-digit Classification of Institutional Program
(CIP) codes. Two-digit CIP codes often translate to what are conventionally known as “departments” (e.g.
Mathematics and Statistics) but sometimes are broader (“Social Sciences” or “Engineering”). We have
separately broken out Economics and Nursing from their larger categories (Social Science and Health
Professions, respectively) as they are sometimes housed in units which price differently. We restrict our
analysis to programs (defined by 2-digit CIP codes) that enroll at least one student from each high school
cohort from 2000 to 2009. Thus we exclude programs that are introduced or discontinued during our
analysis window or that have a very small number of students. In practice, this restriction drops fewer
than 5% of the student sample across all cohorts. Our final program-level sample includes 641 programs
tracked over ten years, for a total sample size of 6,431. Some analysis will have fewer observations due to
missing data on prices or program resources in some years. 10
     The program-level panel dataset is summarized in Table A1, with each observation weighted by
program enrollment from the 2000 high school cohort. The average program has about 4,800 course
enrollments, with the majority being upper-division. 11 Average tuition is $2,853 for the semester. Many
resource measures we normalize by the number of course enrollments divided by five. This makes these
measures on a per-student basis, assuming that each student takes approximately 5 classes in a semester.
The average program has about 1 faculty member per 10 students and spends $2989 on faculty salary per
student. The average FTE salary of the main course instructor is $30,500 per semester and the average
class size is about 30 students per section. More expensive programs are larger, more lucrative (which we
define later), and have greater levels of faculty salary per student, though also tend to have larger classes.
A full description of how resources vary across programs is beyond the scope of this paper, but Figures

10
   There may be some discrepancies between the level at which the price and resource measures are captured.
Tuition price is typically reported for each “school” or “college” within each university. We have applied this tuition
level to all two-digit CIP codes that appear to fall within this school/college at this university. The school-CIP
relationship often varies across universities. For instance, some universities include the Economics major in the
College of Liberal Arts (typically a low-priced program) while others include it in Business (sometimes a high-
priced program). Since we treat Economics as a stand-alone category, it receives the Liberal Arts or Business price
depending on the university. Resource measures, by contrast, are generated from course-level data. CIP codes are
directly available for each course from 2005 onwards. Prior to this, we generate a two-digit CIP code based on the
course subject prefix or administrative code of the faculty member teaching the course. Faculty are assigned to CIP
codes based on the most common major code among the courses they teach. Non-teaching faculty are assigned CIP
codes based on the two-digit CIP code most commonly associated with each administrative code.
11
   Since the statistics are weighted by the number of enrollees from the 2000 high school class, these statistics give
the program characteristics experienced by the “typical” student rather than the characteristics of the typical
program. Thus the typical student will be in a much larger program than the typical program.



                                                          13
A1 and A2 briefly depict the resource differences across and within fields in our sample. Engineering
tends to be among the most resource-intensive, with high-paid faculty, modest class sizes, and high
faculty salary per student. Business, by contrast, has very large classes, which offsets the high faculty
salaries. These patterns echo prior descriptive work by Johnson and Turner (2009). Interestingly, while
there are consistent patterns by field across institutions, there is also substantial variation across
institutions for a given field.


    IV.      Earnings Differences Across Programs
    A. Empirical Approach
We first characterize each program at each institution by the average post-college earnings (ten years out)
of its enrollees prior to deregulation, using regression analysis to control for student selection into
particular majors. Specifically, for all individuals who graduated from a public high school in Texas in
2000, 2001, or 2002 and were observed working in the state ten years later, we estimate models of the
following form:
                  𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 +𝛽𝛽2 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘   (1)
where 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a full set of fixed effects for each program (major j and institution k) and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is a vector of
student characteristics: achievement test scores, race/ethnicity, limited English proficient, and
economically disadvantaged. The outcome 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the average log quarterly earnings residual
for person i ten or more years after high school graduation, after netting out year and quarter effects. The
set of program fixed effects provides an estimate of the average earnings of each program (relative to the
earnings of high school graduates that did not attend public higher education in Texas) purged of any
differences in student characteristics. Though our background characteristics are rich, estimates of
earnings differences using this “value-added” approach could still be subject to bias if unobserved
characteristics affect both institution-program choice and earnings. Thus, as a robustness check we also
control for admissions behavior (Dale and Krueger, 2002) by controlling for a large set of indicators for
all the Texas public universities to which the student applied and was accepted to. Program rankings by
earnings that account for application behavior are quite similar to those that only account for student
demographics and test scores, so we mostly rely on the latter throughout our analysis. Cuhna and Miller
(2014) employ a similar approach to estimating the “value-added” of each Texas institution and find
sizable earnings differences across institutions remain even after controlling for selection.
    Students in our analysis are assigned to the first four-year institution attended and the first declared
major, regardless of the major or institution they ultimately graduate from (or whether they graduate at
all). Thus, the estimates of 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 should be interpreted as the ex-ante expected returns from enrolling in




                                                                      14
each program (major j and institution k), which includes any earnings effects that operate through changes
in the likelihood of graduating.


     B. Earnings Differences Across Programs
Figure 2 shows the distribution of predicted program-level earnings. Programs are weighted by
enrollment in 2000, so the graph reflects the distribution of students from the 2000 high school class
across the distribution of program earnings. Though most programs are clustered around the median of
0.30, some have returns that are much larger or smaller. A small but non-trivial number of students enroll
in a program associated with earnings no higher than students who do not attend public college in Texas.
Figure 3 shows how program earnings vary by field and institution. Participants in engineering, business,
math, and nursing programs typically have the highest earnings. For example, students in the median
engineering program in the state earn about twice as much as students in the median biology program;
those in the typical business program earn about twice as much as those in the typical psychology
program. Though there is also quite a bit of variation across institutions for a given field. Earnings are
also highest at the state’s research institutions – Texas A&M, UT Austin, U Houston, and UT Dallas –
though again there is significant variation across programs within the same institution. 12
         Table 2 reports estimates of conditional earnings for the combinations of institution and program
that produce the ten highest earnings impacts and the ten lowest earnings impacts. The first column
conditions on demographics and test scores. The top ten is dominated by programs from Texas A&M and
University of Texas at Austin, the state’s flagship institutions, with seven of the top ten programs being
associated with these two institutions. For example, students in both universities’ business programs
earn, on average, 113 percent more than a graduate from Texas's high schools with no contact with the
postsecondary educational system. 13 In sum, the highest predicted returns are typically associated with
students in business and engineering, programs that typically enjoy large earnings premia, that are located
in the most selective public institutions in Texas. The basic pattern holds after we adjust for application
behavior. Though a handful of smaller programs also have large earnings returns. In contrast, the
programs associated with the ten lowest returns are mainly from less selective institutions-for example,
the University of Texas El Paso. Programs in the bottom ten include visual/performing arts, English
language, and social science (excluding Economics). For example, students associated with the
Visual/Performing Arts program at UT El Paso earn 33 percent less, on average, relative to Texas high


12
   Our preferred earnings estimates conditional on student demographics and achievement test scores. Figure A3 in
the Appendix depicts the median program earnings for each field and institution with different sets of controls (and
none). The ranking of fields and institutions by earnings are generally not sensitive to the student controls used.

   Note that exp(0.76) equals 1.13.

school graduates who do not enroll when we condition on demographics and test scores. Conditioning on
application and admissions behavior has little impact on the rankings.
      We conclude that there are substantial differences in earnings impact of programs across fields and
institutions in Texas. Where one attends and what one studies has a profound impact on labor market
outcomes. Thus disparities in access to these programs could impact economic inequality.


      V.          Baseline Disparities and Changes in Student Sorting Following Deregulation
      A. Socioeconomic Disparities at Baseline
In order to characterize student choices more easily, we assign each program to one of twenty quantiles
based on the program’s predicted student earnings (controlling for student demographics and achievement
test scores). Since quantiles are constructed with student-level data, each ventile accounts for
approximately five percent of all enrollment.14 An additional benefit of grouping programs into equally-
sized ventiles is that this accounts for size differences across programs that can make interpretation
difficult. Figure 4 shows the distribution of student enrollment across program earnings ventile, separately
for poor and non-poor students in 2000. Poor students are noticeably overrepresented in the least lucrative
programs – those in the bottom six ventiles, which account for 30% of all enrollment. Poor students are
much less likely to enroll in one of the more lucrative programs in comparison to non-poor students.
Simply put, poor students do not appear to be accessing the most profitable opportunities in higher
education in Texas. The central question addressed in this paper is how deregulation altered the
distribution depicted in Figure 4 and through which mechanisms.

      B. Assessing Changes in Disparities
To assess whether the representation of poor students across the distribution of majors changed post-
deregulation, we estimate models of the form:


𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (2)


where 𝑂𝑂𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) captures the earnings potential of the program (major j at institution k) that
individual i from cohort t enrolled in. Earnings potential is time-invariant and estimated by equation (1)
using the first cohorts in our sample. We first examine the outcome 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) , an indicator for
individual i in cohort t enrolling in a program jk whose predicted earnings place it in the Qth ventile. For
instance, 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉20𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) indicates enrollment in programs that have the highest 5% (enrollment-weighted)

14
  Table A2 in the Appendix lists the specific programs contained in each ventile among programs that have at least
100 students from the high school class of 2000.



                                                                              16
of predicted earnings. The coefficient 𝛽𝛽2 captures any differential change in the likelihood of poor
students enrolling in such programs relative to non-poor students following deregulation. We also
examine 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) , the predicted earnings of the program chosen by individual i in cohort t. In this
case 𝛽𝛽2 captures the differential change in average predicted earnings of the programs attended by poor
students relative to non-poor students following deregulation. To account for differential changes in the
characteristics of poor and non-poor students, we control for achievement test scores, race/ethnicity, and
whether the student is limited English proficient, though controls do not materially impact our qualitative
conclusions. As a robustness check, we also control for high school fixed effects to account for the
possibility that the high schools attended by college-goers is changing in a way that may correlate with
college and program choice. Though these background characteristics are rich, this approach could still
be subject to bias if unobserved student characteristics are also changing differentially. Thus, we also
control for application and admissions behavior by including a large set of indicators for all the Texas
public universities to which the student applied and was accepted to. Models including a set of cohort
fixed effects in place of the linear time trend and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 dummy are quite similar, so we mostly focus on
the more parsimonious specification. To account for the possibility that state-wide shocks may affect all
students making college choices at the same time, we conservatively cluster standard errors by high
school cohort.
           In order to interpret our estimates as the causal effect of deregulation on the sorting of students
across programs, there must not be trends or simultaneous policy changes that differentially affect poor
vs. non-poor students and more vs. less lucrative programs following deregulation. State-wide economic
shocks or broad initiatives to increase postsecondary participation among all students will be absorbed by
year fixed effects or time trends and is thus not a source of bias. However, delayed effects of other
policies such as the Top 10 Rule (which guaranteed flagship admission to students in the top 10 percent
of their high school class) or targeted scholarship and recruitment policies (e.g. the Longhorn Scholars
program at UT Austin) could potentially confound our estimates of the effects of deregulation.
           To address this issue, we also estimate event-study models with some outcomes. This model
includes an indicator for poor, the poor indicator interacted with a set of cohort fixed effects (omitting
2003), and a full set of cohort fixed effects and individual controls.


𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + ∑2009
                                                     𝑐𝑐=2000 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐 1(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝑐𝑐) ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (3)



The coefficients 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐 can be interpreted as the change in poor student representation relative to non-poor
students in year c relative to the year prior to deregulation (2003). For c = 2000, 2001, and 2002 these
coefficients measure any pre-trends in the outcomes that couldn’t possibly be due to deregulation.



                                                                        17
Whether these pre-deregulation coefficients are equal to zero provides a suggestive test of the main
assumption of specification (2).


     C. Main Results
Figure 5 depicts our main results on baseline student sorting. Two aspects are noteworthy. First, the stark
pattern of unequal distribution of students of different economic means across programs seen in Figure 4
remains even after controlling for differences in student demographics and achievement test scores. This
is shown by the dark bars. Poor students are 1 to 2 percentage points more likely to enroll in programs in
each of the bottom six ventiles and consequently much less likely to enroll in programs with medium to
high predicted earnings. However, this pattern changed in the years following deregulation, as shown by
the light bars. Relative to non-poor students, poor students shift away from these low-earning programs
after 2004 and make gains throughout the rest of the distribution. Large gains are seen particularly in
ventile twelve, which includes Liberal Arts at UT Austin, one of the largest programs in our data. But
important gains are made at many other programs with above-median earnings potential. 15
         This broad pattern of sizeable shifts away from the bottom of the distribution is remarkably
robust to different student controls. Figure 6 presents estimates for models with fewer or richer controls
than our base model. Including controls for students application behavior and admissions outcomes,
which may pick up some unobservable student traits (Dale and Krueger, 2000), or high school fixed
effects has little impact on the estimates. In fact the only place where controls alter the qualitative result is
for the very top programs. Controlling for achievement test scores attenuates a negative shift at ventile
nineteen and turns a negligible change at the very top quantile into a sizeable positive one with controls.
Because of the importance of controls at these two ventiles, we are cautious about making strong
conclusion about movements at the very top. But poor students’ gains throughout the rest of the
distribution are otherwise quite robust. Given the unimportance of controlling for observed
characteristics, this gives us confidence that the results may be robust to changes in unobserved
characteristics as well.
     Table 3 summarizes these results for several alternative outcomes. Our preferred specification that
includes controls for demographics and test scores, but not high school fixed effects or application
behavior, is show in column (3). On average poor students enter programs that generate earnings gains
3.7% lower than non-poor students, after controlling for demographics and achievement test scores. This
gap closes by more than one-third following deregulation (Panel A). The gains on average come from a

15
  Appendix Figure A5 shows raw histograms for poor and non-poor students in 2000 and 2008. The relative gains
of poor vs. non-poor students are driven both by shifts in where poor students enroll (e.g. away from the lowest
earnings programs) and the enrollment choices of non-poor students.



                                                       18
clear movement of poor students away from the least lucrative programs – a reduction of 3.5 percentage
points in the relative likelihood of enrolling in a bottom quintile program (Panel D). Some of this
movement may be to programs in the top quintile, though the magnitude does depend on controls for
student test scores (Panel C). Regardless, there is no evidence that low-income students became less
represented in top programs following deregulation.
     One concern is that deregulation may have altered the first program attended by low-income students,
but that poor students may not persist and graduate in these programs. Students that enter lucrative
programs but fail to persist in them may in fact be worse off. To investigate this, we identify the program
that students are attending two years after their first enrollment in a four-year college. 16 Students that are
no longer enrolled are assigned the program they last attended before dropping out. We then estimate
predicted earnings for each program separately for students that are still enrolled and those that have
dropped out, using a modified version of equation (1) that interacts each program dummy with whether
the student is still enrolled in college. Thus each program receives a predicted earnings estimate
separately for continued enrollees and for dropouts. 17 Column (6) of Table 3 reports sorting results for the
program students attend two years after initial enrollment, where continuing enrollment and dropout are
distinct outcomes for each program. The patterns are quite similar to those for initial program enrollment.
On average poor students are in programs that generate earnings gains 5.5% lower than non-poor students
two years after initial enrollment, after controlling for demographics and achievement test scores. This
gap closes by more than one-fifth following deregulation. These results suggest that deregulation induces
poor students to not only enter more lucrative programs, but to also remain and persist in them.
         Figure 7 presents event-study estimates, as described in equation (3). Though estimates are
imprecise, there is no noticeable trend in average program earnings of poor relative to non-poor students
leading up to deregulation, but a noticeable and persistent uptick afterwards (Panel A). Similarly, we see
no pre-existing trends in the difference between poor and non-poor students in the likelihood of enrolling
in a top 20% or bottom 20% program (Panels B and C), but clear shifts following deregulation. This gives
us confidence that our main estimates are not merely picking up the effects of pre-existing trends.




16
   We examine persistence and program choice two years after college entry (roughly junior year) rather than
graduation as this outcome is available for all cohorts in our analysis sample. Later cohorts have not yet had time to
realize full graduation outcomes.
17
   The predicted earnings estimates are qualitatively similar to those that do not distinguish between continued
enrollees and dropouts; students in engineering and business programs and at the most selective institutions have the
highest post-college earnings among both persisting and non-persisting students. Unsurprisingly, students that
persist through two years have higher earnings (more than 0.30 log points) than those in the same programs that do
not persist.



                                                         19
     D. Alternative Explanations and Robustness
In order to interpret our estimates as the causal effect of deregulation on the sorting of students across
programs, there must not be simultaneous policy changes or aggregate trends that differentially affect
poor vs. non-poor students following deregulation. In Table 4 we systematically rule out several of the
most well-known policies (column (1) reports our base results). 18 It’s worth noting that most of these
policies were enacted several years prior to deregulation, so would only be a source of bias if they had
delayed effects on the relative program enrollment of poor and non-poor students. In column (2), we drop
all students from the 110 high schools that participated in the Longhorn Opportunity Scholars or Century
Scholars programs, which provided financial aid and enhanced support services for low-income students
attending UT-Austin and Texas A&M, respectively. Though these programs started in 1999 and 2000,
respectively, delayed effects could be a source of bias since the LOS has been shown to have large
impacts on attendance and completion at UT-Austin (Andrews, Imberman, Lovenheim, 2016a). Another
policy that could have had delayed effects is House Bill 1403, otherwise known as the “Dream Act.”
HB1403 granted in-state residency status (and lower tuition) to undocumented students in Texas, who are
disproportionately poor but ineligible for federal financial aid. Flores (2010) found that the
implementation of the law in 2001 was associated with an increase in college enrollment among foreign-
born non-citizen Latino/a students in Texas. In an attempt to rule out delayed effects of this policy,
specification (3) drops the small number of Limited English Proficient-classified students in our sample
(high school graduates enrolled in a Texas university). This is an imperfect proxy for students most likely
to be affected by HB1403; unfortunately, citizenship status is not available in our data.
     The “Top 10 Percent” rule guaranteeing admission to any public institution for students ranked in the
top decile of their high school went into effect in 1998 and increased enrollment at the state’s flagships
(Domina 2007; Cortes 2010; Niu and Tienda 2010; Daugherty, Martorell and McFarlin 2012). While we
cannot identify students eligible for admission based on the Top 10 because we do not possess high
school grades, in specification (4) we drop all students that scored in the top 30% of their high school on
the high school exit exam. While not perfect (since test scores do not inform Top 10 admission), this
sample restriction likely drops most students admitted under the Top 10 given the positive correlation
between high school test scores and grades. 19 Prior work has also found that one important Top 10
channel was to expand the number of high schools sending students to the state’s flagships (Long, Saenz,

18
   Tables A2 and A3 in the Appendix shows that results for the program enrolled in students’ second year reported
in Column (6) of Table 3 are also very robust to these same sample restrictions.
19
   Tables A5 and A6 in the Appendix shows how the sample of institutions and majors chosen by our sample
changes with this restriction. As expected, dropping students in the top 30% of each high school’s exit exam score
distribution greatly reduces the representation of UT-Austin and Texas A&M in the analysis sample (from 32% to
11%) and also reduces the share of students in Engineering and Biology (from 22% to 11%).



                                                        20
Tienda, 2010). Models which include high school fixed effects (reported in Table 3) control for this
particular channel and generate results that are quite similar to our main results. Finally, race-conscious
admissions was restored on a limited basis at UT-Austin in 2003. In column (5) we restrict our sample
only to white students. Encouragingly, all of our main results are qualitatively (and often quantitatively)
unaffected by these s ample restrictions. Thus, we conclude that these other major policy shifts that
altered the enrollment of low-income students are unlikely to explain the large shift we observe
coinciding with deregulation.
     In the final three columns, we examine the robustness of results to alternative ways of defining
students as “poor.” Our base model characterizes students as “poor” if they were eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch during 12th grade. However, this may be an imperfect measure of students’ economic
circumstances because it does not capture intensity of poverty (Michelmore and Dynarski, 2016), which
may be changing over time with changes to the student lunch program or economic shocks. In particular,
we might be worried that students classified as “poor” by our measure are less disadvantaged after
deregulation than before and that this is responsible for the sorting patterns we find. In fact, our estimates
are quite similar regardless of how we identify “poor” students in our sample. If Pell grant receipt is used
to identify poor students (specification (8)), the estimates are also quite similar. This is important as we
use Pell grant receipt as a marker for poor in supplemental analysis when free or reduced-price lunch is
unavailable. Though not shown, results for average earnings of first program are also robust to the set of
controls used to construct earnings estimates for each program. 20 Finally, we also performed all analysis
on a restricted sample of students that enrolled in a four-year university directly after high school. Results
are quite similar, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
     E. Multiple State Comparison
Our single-state analysis cannot account for any aggregate trends altering the representation of poor
students relative to non-poor students at high-earning programs and institutions. For instance, if poor
students were making relative inroads at high-earnings programs around the country because of
expansions to Pell or other changes differentially affecting the enrollment of poor vs. non-poor students,
our Texas-specific estimates will overstate the gains experienced due to tuition deregulation. To address
this, we complement our main analysis with a cross-state comparison between Texas and other states. We
test whether the gap in mean predicted earnings of institutions attended by poor and non-poor students
changes in Texas relative to other states after tuition deregulation in Texas.



20
  The coefficient on Post X Poor in Panel A are 0.0192, 0.0177, and 0.0112 when the earnings equation has no
controls, only demographic controls, or full controls + application dummies, respectively. These are all significant at
the 1% level and are quite similar to our base model estimate of 0.0129.



                                                          21
      Comparably rich micro student data is not available for other states in a way that is easily combined
with our Texas data. However, total undergraduate enrollment and Pell student counts for each four-year
institution in each year is available, as is mean earnings ten years after entry from the College Scorecard.
From this, we construct for each state and each year the predicted earnings of public 4-year institutions
attended by Pell students and non-Pell students, as well as the difference. 21 Across all years and states in
our sample, the mean Pell-NonPell difference is about -$2,650 and is -$4,640 in Texas prior to
deregulation. Estimates of deregulation’s impact using control states are reported in Table 5. Across a
number of different specifications, we find that this gap shrinks in Texas following deregulation, while
actually widening modestly in other states. The control state estimate of deregulation’s impact on the
closing of the poor vs. non-poor gap is thus even larger than the Texas-only estimate (reported in column
1).
      Finally, we implement the synthetic control method described in Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller
(2010). This method finds a set of states whose weighted behavior most closely matches the treated one
(here, Texas) on a number of characteristics in the pre-treatment period. We match on the Pell-NonPell
earnings gap (our outcome), the Pell share of students, the overall mean predicted earnings (for all
students), and the number of institutions per student (to capture the level of differentiation in the public
higher education sector). 22   The Pell-NonPell gap for Texas and this synthetic control group over time is
displayed in Figure 8. The two groups do not deviate much from each other prior to deregulation, but
diverge noticeably from 2004 onwards. The implied treatment effect of deregulation from this method is
$450 (reported in column (8) of Table 5), which is quite comparable to our standard cross-state estimates.
      This analysis suggests that our main within-Texas comparison is not conflating deregulation with
aggregate trends shifting the institutions attended by poor vs. non-poor students nationally. In anything,
our results are strengthened by including other states as a comparison group. Simply put, Texas is unusual
in having the Poor-NonPoor gap close following deregulation relative to other states that did not
deregulate tuition. Our sample, methods, and results for this supplemental analysis are described in more
detail in Appendix B.


      VI.     Possible Channels




21
   Our analysis sample excludes New York (because Pell students are not disaggregated by institution) along with
D.C. and Wyoming (which only have one public four-year institution).
22
   For Texas, this algorithm assigns a weight of 31.2% to California, 26.3% to Delaware, 12.3% to Mississippi,
10.4% to New Mexico, 2.4% to Virginia, 1.1% to Georgia, 1.0% to Oklahoma, and less than 1% to all remaining
states.



                                                        22
Having shown that poor students shift to (and persist in) higher-returns programs following deregulation
relative to the behavior of non-poor students, we now investigate the how program characteristics (such as
price and instructional resources) and financial aid possibly explain this shift. Critics of deregulation
worried that price escalation would limit access to the most selective institutions and most lucrative
programs for low-income students following deregulation. However, sticker price increases also
generated additional revenue that could have been reinvested in the quality or capacity of programs or in
financial aid for needy students. Indeed, the legislation that authorizes tuition deregulation requires that a
portion of the funds be set aside for poor students in the form of financial aid. Given the countervailing
forces that could flow from tuition deregulation, the net effect on the size or student composition of high-
return programs is theoretically ambiguous. 23
     A. Price Changes
The most obvious effect of deregulation was to induce substantial price increases for many public
bachelor’s degree programs in Texas. To quantify the price changes, we estimate difference-in-difference
type models comparing changes in sticker price between the most and least lucrative programs following
deregulation.
         Our outcome is tuition price for in-state juniors taking 15 student credit hours. Our main
specification interacts Post with a measure of the earnings potential of each program, controlling for
                                                                                                                    𝑞𝑞
program and year fixed effects. Our two measures of program earnings potential are 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , which

indicates that program jk is in predicted earnings ventile q, and 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , the predicted earnings (in
2000) for program jk.
                                                                                            𝑞𝑞
                           𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + ∑20
                                                            𝑞𝑞=2 𝜋𝜋𝑞𝑞 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗   (4)


                           𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + π𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗     (5)

This model includes both program and year fixed effects, so the coefficient 𝜋𝜋20 quantifies the change in
price experienced by the most lucrative programs relative to the least lucrative programs post-
deregulation. Similarly the coefficient π quantifies the change in price experienced by high returns
programs post-deregulation, above and beyond that experienced by zero-return programs. The year fixed
effects will absorb the effects of economic shocks or broad price trends that affect all institutions and
programs. We further investigate the robustness of our estimates by replacing the year fixed effects with
a post indicator and linear time trends (with slopes varying before and after deregulation). We also


23
   Given the numerous channels via which tuition deregulation impacts choice, we do not use the onset of tuition
deregulation to instrument for price. The various uses to which institutions and programs can use the revenue that
flows from tuition deregulation means that the exclusion restriction would fail to hold.



                                                                23
consider a specification that includes interactions between 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 , and Time, which

determines whether high returns programs have differential trends pre- and post-deregulation. To
account for the possibility that errors are serially correlated (within program over time), we
cluster standard errors by program. We also weight each program observation by the number of
students enrolled in it from the high school cohort of 2000. We should note that since our
comparisons are all within-Texas, comparing the most and least lucrative programs, we could be
understating the total impact of deregulation on price if the least lucrative programs are also
affected by deregulation.

       Figure 9 plots the point estimates from equation (4), with the bottom ventile omitted and serving as
the reference category. 24 Indeed, the price increase was largest for the most lucrative programs. Programs
in the top half of the earnings distribution all increased tuition by a larger amount than those in the lower
half, with particularly large increases among the top 15% of programs, which increased tuition by more
than $400. Similarly large increases were also seen in ventile twelve, which includes the University of
Texas at Austin Liberal Arts program. This is a large increase relative to the overall average tuition of
$2160 prior to deregulation. Table 6 presents estimates of equation (5). In our base specification,
programs with high predicted earnings (1 log point) increased their tuition price by $728 more than those
whose enrollees earn no more than high school graduates. The next specification instead uses time
(linearly) and a post-deregulation dummy in place of year fixed effects with no impact on the magnitude
of the point estimates. Finally, the fourth specification lets high returns programs have a different initial
and post-deregulation growth rate. Price increased immediately post-deregulation for the most lucrative
programs ($441), and also grew at a faster rate ($57 more per year, though insignificant) following
deregulation relative to the pre-existing trend.


       B. Financial Aid and Net Price
To address concerns that these tuition increases would burden low-income students, 15% of the proceeds
from resident undergraduate rates greater than $46 per SCH were required to be set aside for need-based
grant aid administered by the institutions. More price discrimination – a higher sticker price combined
with more aid for low-income students – could potentially increase the representation of low-income
students in the traditionally more costly programs by lowering the net price.
           To quantify whether deregulation facilitated greater price discrimination, we estimate models
similar to equation (2) but separately by earnings ventile. Our outcomes are total need-based grant aid,


24
     Estimates with the bottom five ventiles omitted and serving as the reference group are nearly identical.



                                                            24
grant amounts for specific need-based aid programs, and net tuition (tuition minus need-based grants).
Now the coefficient on Poor quantifies the difference in aid or net price between poor and non-poor
students prior to deregulation. The coefficient on the Poor X Post interaction measures the change in this
difference following deregulation. Panel A of Figure 10 documents baseline differences in grant aid
between poor and non-poor students. Across all programs, poor students receive about $800 more in Pell
Grant and $400 in TEXAS Grant support than non-poor students, with little systematic relationship to
program earnings. Panel B shows the change in relative grant aid following deregulation. HB3015 set-
aside grants increased dramatically following deregulation, but only for students in the highest return
programs which experienced the largest sticker price increases. TEXAS Grants also increased
considerably across the board, but particularly for students in the highest return programs. This is partially
by design; institutions must fully cover tuition and required fees for any TEXAS Grant recipients with
non-loan sources, including Pell Grants, TPEG, HB3015 set-asides, or other institutional sources, though
institutions can choose not to provide TEXAS Grants to otherwise qualified students. Thus the TEXAS
Grant forces institutions to shield recipients from sticker price increases. A moderate Pell Grant
expansion has no obvious pattern across programs. The net result of these expansions is a widening of the
gap in net tuition between poor and non-poor students following deregulation, particularly at higher
return-programs. In fact, poor students actually experienced a decrease in net tuition following
deregulation at several programs while non-poor students saw increases of several thousand dollars per
semester. 25 This additional grant aid can likely be attributed to the additional revenue and incentives
created by deregulation. Note that this analysis likely understates the effect of deregulation on need-based
aid, as institutions were not required to spend additional aid revenue for students in the programs that
generated it. For instance, additional aid dollars generated by higher business program prices could have
been used to subsidize students in liberal arts.
     These results should be interpreted cautiously, however, as data limitations require us to exclude non-
need-based aid, which disproportionately benefits non-poor students. There is no specific provision of
deregulation that would cause merit- or other non-need-based aid to alter following deregulation, but we
cannot entirely rule this out.


     C. Program Resources
We saw that the most lucrative programs increased their prices once deregulation provided them with
more flexibility for doing so. But the sorting of students across programs should also respond to other
factors, namely program quality and capacity. Institutions that supported deregulation hoped to use the

25
  Figure A6 in the Appendix plots the net tuition for poor and non-poor students separately by program ventile,
demonstrating the widening gap at the upper ventiles.



                                                        25
additional revenue generated from higher tuition to improve program quality. To examine the role in
deregulation of various mediating supply-side factors, we estimate (4) and (5) on several program
characteristics that potentially respond to deregulation, including class size, faculty salary, and course
offerings.
        Figure 11 displays estimates from equation (4) for many different measures of program resources,
with the bottom ventile omitted and serving as the reference category. 26 Most programs in the top half of
the earnings distribution saw larger increases in resources than those in the lower half. A useful summary
measure is total salary of all faculty per student enrollment, as improvements in several dimensions –
more faculty, more highly paid faculty, more tenure-track faculty, smaller class sizes – would be reflected
in this measure. 27 Estimates suggest that total salary per enrollment increased noticeably for many of the
highest-earning programs and also those in ventile twelve. This was accomplished both via expanding the
total faculty size and also by increasing pay for instructors (either by shifting to a more expensive rank of
instructor or increasing pay within rank). Class sizes were also reduced at several of the most lucrative
programs, though these estimates are imprecise. 2829
        Though many of the individual estimates are not statistically significant, collectively they point to
an increased level of resources for the more lucrative programs following deregulation. These greater
levels of instructional inputs may partially offset the detrimental effects of the price increases used to
generate them. It should be noted that aggregate trends in demand or other factors that may influence
these measures of supply are absorbed by the year fixed effects and time trends.


     D. Institutions, Major, and Admissions
The sorting of students into specific postsecondary programs unfolds in several stages: students’ decision
to apply to a set of institutions, institutions’ admissions decisions, students’ choice of institution, and
finally major choice. To determine how much of the deregulation-induced re-sorting operates via shifts
across- vs. within-institution, we re-estimate equation (2) but with institution- or major-average predicted
earnings as the outcome (rather than institution-major predicted earnings). Estimates using institution-


26
    Estimates with the bottom five ventiles omitted and serving as the reference group are nearly identical.
27
   Per-student resource measures are divided by (number of course enrollments divided by 5) to be comparable to
unique students, which assumes each student takes approximately 5 classes.
28
   Table A9 in the Appendix reports estimates of equation (5) for these same seven resource measures. Results are
qualitatively similar to those reported in Figure 11, with higher-earning programs exhibiting larger improvements in
total salary per enrollment, faculty salary, and class size.
29
   For total salary and total faculty per enrollment we exclude the top 1% and bottom 5% of observations to account
for a few extreme outliers (e.g. $500,000 salary per enrollment), which result from faculty and salary information
coming from a different source than the student enrollment counts.



                                                         26
average predicted earnings are quite similar to our main model (Table 7), suggesting that almost all of the
change can be explained by gains in the relative quality of institutions attended by poor students. Shifts
across majors explains none of the relative improvement in programs attended by poor students. 30
         One channel through which institutions could mitigate adverse effects of price increases on poor
students is by changing admissions processes to favor poor students or by encouraging more to apply. We
are not aware of any systematic changes in admissions policies that differentially affected poor vs. non-
poor students at the time (other than those discussed earlier), but we also assessed this quantitatively by
estimating institution-specific versions of equation (2) and report results in Table 8. 31 We examine both
the unconditional likelihood of enrolling or applying to each institution (columns (1) and (2),
respectively), and the likelihood of being admitted (conditional on applying) and of enrolling (conditional
on admission). There is a clear relative increase in the likelihood that poor students enroll at a higher-
return institution following deregulation and a corresponding decrease at lower-return institutions.
However, these gains do not appear to be systematically related to increases in the relative likelihood that
poor students are admitted to these institutions (conditional on applying). Some of the institutions that
account for the relative enrollment shift experienced modest admissions changes (e.g. UT-Austin, UT-
Arlington, Texas Woman’s), but others do not (Texas A&M, Texas Tech). Furthermore, some programs
(most often Business) within institutions practice selective admissions (Andrews, Imberman, and
Lovenheim, 2016b). The stated GPA cut-offs for admissions to these programs do not appear to change
following deregulation. 32


     E. Program Size
Our main analysis suggests that the gap in earnings potential of the programs attended by poor students
relative to non-poor students closes modestly after deregulation, despite fears that tuition increases would
widen it. In Appendix C, we examine changes in program size as a potential mechanism through which
these shifts occurred. Total enrollment in low-earning programs grew throughout our analysis period, but
did not experience above-trend growth following deregulation. Enrollment in more lucrative programs


30
   We also estimated our base model, but including first school and first major fixed effects separately, with a similar
conclusion. Including first school fixed effects completely eliminates the deregulation effect but major fixed effects
(without school fixed effects) has no impact on the Post X Poor coefficient.
31
   Admissions data is incomplete for our first cohort, so this analysis only includes the 2001-2009 high school
cohorts. Appendix Table A10 reports means for all the outcomes examined here.
32
   The required GPA for admissions to the undergraduate Business programs at UT-Austin (GPA = 3.0), Texas
A&M (3.0), University of Houston (2.75), and Texas Tech (2.75) remained constant from 2003 to 2005. That at UT-
Arlington increased from 2.0 to 2.5 in this time period. Texas A&M Engineering’s admission standard also
remained constant (at 2.0).



                                                          27
was mostly stagnant both before and after deregulation. These program size patterns suggests two
proximate channels through which the relative shares of poor and non-poor students across programs are
changing post-deregulation. For the most lucrative programs, the lack of any aggregate enrollment change
suggests poor students are (modestly) displacing their non-poor counterparts. For programs from the
bottom half of the distribution of predicted earnings, there is growth in the enrollment of poor students
and non-poor students, but enrollment for non-poor students is occurring at a faster rate. We also observe
no systematic patterns to the post-deregulation growth in non-resident students (domestic or
international).


     F. Separating the Contribution of Different Channels
We do not attempt to isolate the contribution of each individual channel to the overall change in
enrollment across programs, but we do explore this question by comparing ventile-specific estimates of
the change in poor student representation, tuition costs, resources, and grant aid. A benefit of such a
ventile-specific analysis is that this accounts for size differences across programs that can make it difficult
to interpret magnitudes for program-level analysis. Figure 12 demonstrates that the ventiles that
experienced the greatest sticker price increase following deregulation - those with higher-than-average
returns – also saw the greatest increase in the relative share of poor students. Panel A of Figure 13 shows
the “first-stage” relationship between these tuition increases and two key mechanisms: program-level
resources and need-based aid provided to poor students (relative to non-poor students). Since sticker price
for poor and non-poor students is the same within program, this latter measure captures the extent of price
discrimination practiced by institutions. 33 Increases in resources and price discrimination were the largest
for programs that had the largest tuition increases following deregulation. Figures A7 and A8 in the
Appendix show that multiple resource measures improve most for programs that saw the greatest increase
in tuition and that only expansions in HB3015 and TEXAS Grant programs are related to tuition
increases, as expected. Panel B shows the “structural” relationship between changes in resources and
grant aid and poor students’ representation in these programs. Though noisy, the results do suggest that
programs that saw the greatest increase in resources and price discrimination also saw the largest gains in
the representation of low-income students. Thus resource improvements and greater price discrimination
(need-based grant aid for poor students) appear to be important potential mechanisms for the shifts we
observe.



33
  Though poor- and non-poor students may attend different programs within each ventile, the tuition differences
within ventile are negligible so grant differences map directly to net tuition differences. The one caveat to this
analysis is the absence of non-need-based aid, which is not available for students without need-based-aid.



                                                         28
    VII.    Conclusion
In this paper we have examined the consequences of a massive change in the responsibility for setting the
price for public undergraduate education in Texas, from the state legislature to the institutions themselves.
Public universities in Texas responded to this new autonomy by increasing price levels and dispersion;
increases were particularly sharp for the highest-return programs, including the business and engineering
programs at the most selective universities in the state. Despite this, using administrative data on all
students and undergraduate programs in the state we find no detrimental impact on the representation of
economically disadvantaged students in these high return programs. In fact, we find pretty consistent
evidence that poor students shifted relative to non-poor students away from the least lucrative programs
into more lucrative programs throughout the distribution of program earnings. Importantly, these shifts in
initial program choices are persistent, as we see similar improvements in the relative quality of programs
that poor students are enrolled in two years after initial enrollment.
        Two countervailing responses appear to have partially offset the detrimental effects of price
increases on demand by poor students. First, substantial increases in need-based aid reduced the net-price
faced by poor students relative to non-poor students, increasing price discrimination. Second, additional
revenue enabled supply-side improvements such as more spending per student and reduced class size,
which made lucrative programs more desirable even as they became more expensive. These results
underscore the importance of examining the use of funds generated by tuition increases when assessing
effects on students. In Texas, a significant share of deregulation-induced tuition revenue was channeled
back into financial aid for needy students, shielding them the consequences of price increases. Our
findings also echo those of Deming and Walters (2015) who find that state subsidies have a larger impact
on student enrollment and degree production at unselective colleges when used to boost spending and
program quality than if used for sticker price reduction.
        Our reduced-form results highlight three directions where more research is clearly needed. First,
we have not isolated the independent contribution of the various possible mechanisms – sticker price,
financial aid, program resources, and program capacity – to the sorting of students to programs following
deregulation. Each of these attributes changed following deregulation, so their contribution is difficult to
separate with reduced-form methods. We are currently estimating a discrete choice model of program
demand by students in order to quantify the role of various mechanisms and to perform simulations of
counterfactual changes in these program attributes. This analysis will let us say, for instance, what the
sorting of students would have looked like in the absence of changes in need-based grant aid. These
simulations will inform the effects of deregulation in other contexts, where some additional revenue is not
required to be used for need-based aid. Second, we have taken institutions’ pricing and resource
allocation decisions as exogenous. Modeling the supply-side responses to this large change in the




                                                      29
regulatory and economic environment as an endogenous process could shed light on the objectives of
public universities, their production process, and the constraints they face. The fact that the institutions
took some steps to partially shield low-income students from price increases suggests a desire to maintain
some socioeconomic diversity at these institutions. Finally, how these countervailing factors – prices and
resources – impact the success of students actually enrolling in these programs or student loan debt are
questions with important welfare implications. Future work should examine these long-run consequences
too.

580,253 students in the high school classes of 2000 to 2009 that enroll in a Texas public university within two years of high school graduation.
Outcome is the predicted earnings or indicator for predicted earnings rank of the university program (institution X major) the student first
enrolled in (columns 1‐5) or in third year after enrollment (column 6). Predicted earnings is estimated using 2000‐2002 cohorts and applied to all
cohorts (see text). Standard errors are clustered by high school cohort.

Notes: Controls include gender, race/ethnic indicators and indicator for limited English, and scaled reading and
math scores. Sample includes 580,253 students in the high school classes of 2000 to 2009 that enroll in a Texas
public university within two years of high school graduation. Outcome is the predicted earnings or indicator for
predicted earnings rank of the university program (institution X major) the student first enrolled in. Predicted
earnings is estimated using 2000‐2002 cohorts and applied to all cohorts (see text). Standard errors are clustered
by high school cohort.

Notes: Controls include gender, race/ethnic indicators, indicator for male, and indicator for limited English,
and scaled reading and math scores. Sample includes 580,253 students in the high school classes of 2000
to 2009 that enroll in a Texas public university within two years of high school graduation. Outcome is the
predicted earnings or indicator for predicted earnings rank of the university program and persistance
category (institution X major X persist) the student is enrolled in two years after four-year college entry.
Predicted earnings is estimated using 2000-2002 cohorts and applied to all cohorts (see text). Standard
errors are clustered by high school cohort.

                                      Appendix B. Control State Analysis

Our single-state analysis cannot account for any aggregate trends altering the representation of poor
students relative to non-poor students at high-earning programs and institutions. For instance, if poor
students were making inroads at high-earnings programs around the country because of expansions to Pell
or other changes differentially affecting the enrollment of poor vs. non-poor students, our Texas-specific
estimates may overstate the gains experienced due to tuition deregulation. To address this, we
complement our main analysis with cross-state triple-difference comparison between Texas and other
states that did not deregulate tuition-setting authority. We test whether the gap in predicted earnings of
institutions attended by poor and non-poor students changes in Texas relative to other states after tuition
deregulation in Texas.

Unfortunately comparably rich micro student data including extensive student controls does not exist for
many states (and cannot be easily combined with our Texas data). Instead, we compare the public 4-year
institutions attended by Pell students to non-Pell students in each state. We combine three data sources to
characterize the average predicted earnings of institutions attended by Pell and non-Pell students at a state
level over time. First, we start with the universe of public 4-year institutions from IPEDS, which includes
total undergraduate enrollment. Second, we merge on the number of Pell recipients at each institution in
each year. 1 Finally, mean earnings of students working and not enrolled 10 years after entry for each
institution was obtained from the College Scorecard data for the 2001 and 2002 entering cohorts. 2 Having
average mean earnings by institution for all institutions in the country was not possible prior to the release
of the College Scorecard data in 2015. From these sources we construct for each state and each year the
predicted earnings of institutions attended by Pell students and non-Pell students, as well as the
difference. Across all years and states in our sample, the mean Pell-NonPell difference is about -$2,650,
but is -$4,640 in Texas prior to deregulation. 3 The question we ask is how this gap changes following
deregulation in Texas.

Table B1 presents our results. In column (1), we approximate our main (micro-sample- based) analysis
using data just from Texas. We find that the Pell-NonPell gap shrank by $270 following deregulation in
Texas. While not directly comparable to estimates from our micro sample, the pattern is directionally
consistent with our earlier analysis. Pell students attended slightly more lucrative programs following
deregulation relative to non-Pell students. 4 The next five columns include other states, which are used to

  The student sample includes financial aid students in AY2001-02 and AY2002-03 pooled cohort measured in
CY2012, CY2013, inflation adjusted to 2015 dollars. Average earnings may be misleading to the extent that the
average earnings of aided and non-aided students are different. We drop the state of New York, as the number of
Pell recipients is not broken out by individual CUNY and SUNY institutions in the early years. Wyoming and the
District of Columbia are also excluded because they do not have multiple public 4-year institutions.

  This average weights each state-year observation by the total number of students. Unweighted average is similar.

  Results may not be directly comparable to our main analysis for four main reasons. First, our main analysis relies
on eligibility for free- or reduced-price lunch in 12th grade as the marker for poor. Results using Pell receipt as a
marker for poor are similar, but not identical. Second, our measures of Pell and non-Pell enrollment do not
distinguish by residency status or undergraduate level. These measures include both in- and out-of-state students,
from freshmen to seniors. Our main analysis tracks the enrollment choices of students that attended public high
schools in Texas and enrolled in university within two years. Treatment here will thus not be as “sharp” as in our
earlier analysis. Third, the earnings measure pertains to the raw average earnings of students receiving financial aid

control for aggregate trends that could have altered the Pell-Non-Pell institutional gap using a triple-
difference. The coefficient on PostXTexas quantifies how much the Pell-NonPell gap in Texas changed
post-deregulation relative to the Pell-NonPell gap in other states over the same time period. The pattern is
remarkably robust across multiple specifications: Pell students in Texas gained relative to non-Pell
students following deregulation at a greater rate than in other states. This pattern is robust to flexibly
controlling for year effects (specification 3), weighting states by total enrollment (4), and restricting the
control group to geographically proximate states (5 to 7). We exclude Florida in the last two
specifications as that state also experienced deregulation towards the end of our sample.

Finally, we implement the synthetic control method described in Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller
(2010). This method finds a set of states whose weighted behavior most closely match the treated one
(here, Texas) on a number of characteristics in the pre-treatment period. We match on the Pell-NonPell
earnings gap (our outcome), the Pell share of students, the overall mean predicted earnings (for all
students), and the number of institutions per student (to capture the level of differentiation in the public
higher education sector). For Texas, this algorithm assigns a weight of 31.2% to California, 26.3% to
Delaware, 12.3% to Mississippi, 10.4% to New Mexico, 2.4% to Virginia, 1.1% to Georgia, 1.0% to
Oklahoma, and less than 1% to all remaining states. The Pell-NonPell gap for Texas and this synthetic
control group is displayed in Figure B1. The two groups do not deviate much from eachother prior to
deregulation, but diverge noticeably from 2004 onwards. The implied treatment effect of deregulation
from this method is $450 (reported in column (8) of Table B1), which is quite comparable to our standard
triple difference estimates.


who are working and not enrolled, anywhere in the U.S.. Our Texas-specific analysis uses log earnings for all
enrollees working in Texas ten years after enrollment. Finally, we are unable to control for changes in student
characteristics, either in the earnings estimates or when assessing changes in program choice. So the estimates from
the cross-state analysis are most comparable to column (1) in Table 3 that does not control for changes in student
characteristics.

To assess whether the experience of Texas (relative to the synthetic controls) is atypical of the variation
one would see, we repeat the synthetic control analysis but assign treatment to all other 47 states as a
placebo test. Figure B2 plots the treatment minus synthetic control difference for Texas (in bold) and all
other 47 states (in gray) . The Texas experience of modest and sustained gains for Pell students relative to
non-Pell students is fairly unusual relative to what would be expected by chance.

All together, this analysis suggests that our main within-Texas comparison is not conflating deregulation
with aggregate trends shifting the institutions attended by Pell vs. NonPell students. In anything, our
results are strengthened by including other states as a comparison group.

                                              Appendix C. Program Size Analysis
Our main analysis suggests that the fraction of poor students that enroll in higher-earning programs in
post-deregulation increases relative to non-poor students and that the fraction of non-poor students
increases relative to poor students at lower-earning programs. This supplementary analysis will determine
whether the relative increase in the fraction of poor students enrolled is a result of either enrollment
growth in these programs with more growth in the poor student population, enrollment declines with non-
poor students leaving high-earning programs at a faster rate than their poor counterparts, or that the
fractional changes are a result of poor students displacing non-poor students in the programs with higher
earnings. For this analysis, we construct a balanced program-level dataset containing the number of
juniors enrolled each program in each academic year, overall and by residency status. 1 We also merge the
predicted earnings for freshmen enrolled in these same programs from our main analysis.
To flexibly determine whether program enrollment changed following deregulation, we estimate the post-
deregulation deviation from enrollment trend separately for each program earnings ventile using models
of the form:
                                               𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the log junior enrollment for program j at time t, overall and by residency status. 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 is a linear
time trend, 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 is a program fixed effect, and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 is an indicator variable which takes a value of 1 for
those observations that occur after 2006 and zero otherwise. We weight observations by the level of
junior enrollment in 2001 in order to adjust for the influence of small and volatile programs and also
cluster standard errors by program.
Figure C1 plots the ventile-specific coefficients on Time, which shows that overall enrollment in public 4-
year institutions has been steadily growing over time, particularly for programs in the bottom half of the
earnings distribution. Higher-earning programs have seen very little growth over the decade. For non-
resident students there is little evidence of changes in overall student enrollment, with slight increases in
the middle ventiles (Panel B). Figure C2 plots coefficients associated with the Post dummy. This figure
suggests that the enrollment of students in Texas – overall and non-residents - in the post-period do not
differ substantially from the pre-period growth trajectory. Nor is there any obvious systematic relationship
between the post-deregulation enrollment change and the earnings potential (as measured by the ventile)
of the program.
Since ventile-specific estimates are noisy, we also estimate a more parsimonious model that assumes any
differences across programs in the time trend or post-deregulation change are linear in predicted program
earnings. Specifically, on the entire sample of programs we estimate the following regression:

             𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑋𝑋 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 ) + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽4 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑋𝑋 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 � + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

 where 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 is the level of predicted earnings for program j, after controlling for student demographics
and test scores. The mean of this variable in our analysis sample is 0.29. Again we weight observations


1
  We determined residency status based on the receipt of in-state tuition; all students who receive in-state tuition are
considered residents, and all other students are non-residents. From this measure, approximately 93% of our sample
is made up of Texas Residents. We use Pell Grant receipt to distinguish poor from non-poor students as this measure
is available for all enrolled students; free-lunch eligibility is only available for students that graduated from in-state
public high schools. We drop programs that have zero total, Pell, or non-Pell enrollment in any year. Our balanced
panel contains 556 programs from 2001 to 2008.

by the level of junior enrollment in 2001 in order to adjust for the influence of small but highly volatile
programs and also cluster standard errors by program.
Table C1 displays the results from this pooled model, which echo the results shown in the figures. We
find that overall enrollment is increasing over time for the average program (predicted earnings = 0.29)
and that total program enrollment increases just slightly above trend following deregulation (column (1)).
These two features are most substantial for the least lucrative programs (with predicted earnings no
greater than high school graduates), with little growth or change post-deregulation for the most lucrative
programs. Non-resident enrollment, by contrast, experiences a steeper pre-deregulation growth rate and a
more positive change post-deregulation, particularly for the more lucrative programs (though estimates
are imprecise). This suggests that some of the programmatic changes following deregulation (e.g. higher
prices and more spending) coincided with greater non-resident enrollment.
These program size patterns combined with our main sorting results suggests two proximate channels
through which the relative shares of poor and non-poor students across programs are changing post-
deregulation. For the most lucrative programs, the lack of any aggregate enrollment change suggests poor
students are (modestly) displacing their non-poor counterparts. For programs from the bottom half of the
distribution of predicted earnings, there is growth in the enrollment of poor students and non-poor
students, but enrollment for non-poor students is occurring at a faster rate.
