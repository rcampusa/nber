Consumer Response to Tax Rebates

                                             ABSTRACT

        Many households received income tax rebates in 2001 of $300 or $600. These rebates represented
advance payments of the tax cut from the new 10 percent tax bracket. Based on a survey of a
representative sample of households, this paper finds that only 22 percent of households receiving the
rebate would spent it. Instead, they would either save it or use it to pay off debt. This very low rate of
spending represents a striking break with past behavior, which would have suggested a much higher rate
of spending. The low spending rate implies that the tax rebate provided a very limited stimulus to
aggregate demand.

Standard economic theory has specific predictions about how consumers will respond to

changes in disposable income. For example, the response of consumers will depend on

whether the changes are expected or unexpected, and on whether they are temporary or

permanent. When the change in disposable income arises from a change in tax policy,

the theory predicts that consumer responses also depend on whether they perceive the

changes in taxes to be accompanied by changes in government spending.

       This paper advances survey techniques to estimate the marginal propensity to

consume. In July through September 2001, many households received tax rebates of

$300 or $600. These rebates were advance payments of the tax reduction associated with

the creation of the new, 10 percent income tax bracket. We conducted a survey of a

representative sample of U.S. households during August, September, and October 2001

to determine how the receipt of the rebate checks would change behavior. We find that

only 22 percent of those receiving the rebate reported that it would lead them to mostly

increase spending. This propensity to spend is remarkably low, both from a theoretical

prospective and when compared to previous estimates.

   ·   The propensity to consume from a permanent tax cut should, in the standard

       model, be close to one. Moreover, households that are liquidity constrained

       would consume at a high rate even if they perceive the tax cut to be less than

       permanent.

   ·   Previous estimates of the propensity to consume, either from aggregate or

       individual data, generally point to a much higher propensity to consume.
Hence, the evidence from the consumer response to the 2001 tax rebate represents a sharp

break with previous evidence. The time-series evidence suggests a propensity to

consume of about one-half even from expected changes in income. The cross-sectional

evidence is more varied, but even for changes in income where theory would suggest a

propensity to consume of close to zero, the evidence typically suggests a high propensity

to consume.

       The lower propensity to consume we find cannot be attributed to our survey

methodology. In 1992, we fielded a similar survey question to measure the propensity to

consume from the 1992 changes in income tax withholding. Both the 1992 and 2001

survey questions were included as modules on the University of Michigan Survey

Research Center’s monthly Survey of Consumers, so the procedures for drawing the

sample were the same in both surveys. For the 1992 withholding change, we found that

over forty percent of households would spend the extra current income from the

reduction in withholding, despite the fact that the increase in take-home pay would be

offset by either a lower tax refund or higher final payment. While that behavior is

inconsistent with unconstrained optimization, it is quite consistent with the broad range

of evidence that a high fraction of income goes to households who act myopically or

liquidity constrained with respect to changes in income. Because the methodology used

to study the 2001 rebate so closely mirrors that of the 1992 study, the surprising results of

the 2001 study appear to represent a genuine departure from past behavior and are not an

artifact of our methodology or the specific details of the survey.

       Whether consumers behave according to the standard theory has substantial

implications for both the understanding of economic fluctuations and for predictions




                                              2
about the likely impact of changes in government policy. If consumers are foresighted

and unconstrained, their spending behavior may either damp or magnify the response to a

current shock to income depending on the relationship of the income shock to changes in

future income.

       There are a number of reasons why households might not increase spending from

a putatively permanent tax rebate. They might not believe that it is permanent, or they

might believe that it would be offset by some other government action (e.g., a cut in a

benefit or a future increase of another tax). In designing the survey, we included

questions to shed light on these hypotheses. Moreover, there is a substantial degree of

heterogeneity in consumer behavior. Again, the survey is designed to elicit information

to systematically account for this heterogeneity. A strength of the survey methodology is

that it allows direct tests of hypotheses that might account for the behavior.

       The present study is intended to extend our understanding of consumer response

to fiscal interventions. One goal is simply to assess the extent to which the rebate

induced consumers to spend more than they otherwise would have, on what kinds of

goods, and over what time periods. An equally important objective is to test various

hypotheses about what motivates the variation in behavioral response to the rebate, and to

discriminate among reasonable alternative explanations. For example, a taxpayer who

does not increase spending upon receiving the check may do so because of a Ricardian

belief that it signals no increase in their well-being. Alternatively, someone who

increases spending upon receiving the check may do so because he or she is liquidity

constrained or because the new tax law, of which the rebate is a small part, implies a

large increase in permanent after-tax income.

       The plan of the remainder of the paper is as follows. Section I describes the

change in tax policy in 2001. Section II gives details of the survey. Section III presents

the results. Section IV surveys the literature on propensity to consume in the context of

these results. Section V presents our conclusions.


                                       I. The Policy

On May 25, 2001, the congressional conference committee approved the Economic

Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. President George W. Bush signed

the bill into law on June 7, 2001. Under the bill, taxpayers were entitled to a credit in tax

year 2001 up to $300 for single individuals and up to $600 in the case of a married couple

filing a joint return. Most taxpayers received this credit in the form of a check issued by

the Department of the Treasury. These checks were sent out beginning the week of July

23, 2001 and continued until the week of September 24, 2001. Those taxpayers who as

of these dates had not filed their 2000 tax return did not receive the check until the IRS

had processed the 2000 return. These payments were commonly referred to as tax

rebates, although the IRS referred to them as advance payments of a 2001 tax credit.

       The tax rebates were substantial, both from the point of view of the representative

household or in aggregate. They amounted to $38 billion, or approximately 0.4 percent

of annual GDP. Median family income in 2000 was about $41,000, so a $600 rebate

represents about 1.5 percent of median annual income and a greater share of disposable

income for the typical household. Because the size of the rebate is capped, it declines as

a fraction of income as income rises once a family receives the maximum rebate.

       The rebates are a small part of the overall tax package, although the most

significant part of the tax cuts implemented in 2001. The official revenue estimate



                                              4
produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation put the cost over 11 years at $1.349

trillion. In terms of revenue impact, the largest component was a phased-in reduction in

all of the marginal tax rates. By 2006, the top 39.6 percent bracket would be 35 percent,

the 36 percent bracket would be 33 percent, the 31 percent bracket would be 28 percent,

and the 28 percent bracket would be 25 percent. The new law also included such items as

a phase-out of limitations on itemized deductions and restrictions on personal

exemptions, an expansion of the child and dependent care tax credits, and an increase in

the standard deduction for married couples. The estate and gift tax exemption levels

were gradually increased and the rate structure gradually lowered, leading to a complete

abolition of the estate tax in 2010.1 Clearly, high-income households and those with

large estates had future taxes reduced by substantially more than the amount of the

rebate.

          The rebate corresponds to a new 10 percent income tax bracket for a portion of

taxable income that was previously taxed at 15 percent, effective for taxable years

beginning January 1, 2001. The 10 percent bracket applied to the first $6,000 of taxable

income for single individuals, $10,000 of taxable income for heads of household, and

$12,000 for married couples filing joint returns. The tax rebate scheme was designed to

deliver the benefit of the new 10 percent income tax rate in a highly visible way during

calendar year 2001. Thus, the maximum rebate for a married couple filing jointly was 5

percent of $12,000, or $600. The rebates for taxpayers with other marital status were

calculated in the same manner.




1
 Strikingly, both the income tax and the state tax were designed to sunset, i.e., return to
pre-2001 law, after December 31, 2010.


                                              5
       Although the rebate was an advance credit for a reduction in tax year 2001 tax

liability, its amount was calculated on the basis of taxable income in tax year 2000. In

the case of taxpayers who would have received a lower credit based on actual taxable

income in 2001, the difference was forgiven, and no reconciliation was required. Those

taxpayers who were entitled to receive a larger rebate on the basis of actual 2001 taxable

income could claim it when they filed their 2001 tax year return in calendar year 2002.

       Beginning in mid-July, the Treasury sent out notices to families informing of the

amount of their rebate and providing documentation to be used in filing 2001 tax returns.

The actual checks were mailed over 10 weeks, from the weeks of July 23 to September

24. Which week a taxpayer received the check depended on the second to last digit of the

Social Security number.2 The Treasury calculated that 92 million taxpayers would get a

rebate check, with 72 million receiving the full amount, and the rebate checks totaling

$38 billion.




2
  In addition, a one percentage point reduction in the 28, 31, 36, and 39.6 percent brackets
was effective on July 1, 2001. Starting at that time, the standard amount of employer
withholding was reduced for taxpayers at the (new) 27 percent bracket and above. (Tax
liabilities were reduced effective January 1, 2001 by reducing the 28 percent rates and
above by 0.5 percentage point.) For a married couple with two exemptions, this
withholding bracket was reached at $55,700 of annual payroll income. See Internal
Revenue Service (2001). For income above that threshold, withholding was reduced by 1
percent of income beginning in July 1. Annual household income of about $56,000 is
about at the 63rd percentile of the income distribution. See U.S. Bureau of the Census,
Census 2000 Supplementary Survey Summary Table P069 (download from Census
Bureau WWW site). Thus, for most households withholding was not changed. For all
but the highest-income households, the decrease in withholding in 2001 was low relative
to the rebate. For example, a married couple would have to have an annual payroll
income of about $175,000 in order for the change in withholding over the last six months
of 2001 to be $600, the usual size of the tax rebate check. Hence, the receipt of the
rebates was confounded by a change in withholding, but this change was significant only
for a few high-income households.

                                 II. Survey Methodology

In this paper, we study consumers’ response to the income tax rebates of 2001. We

conducted a survey of a representative sample of households to measure whether or not

they would spend the rebate. Our survey instrument was a rider on the University of

Michigan Survey Research Center’s Monthly Survey, also known as the Survey of

Consumers. The survey’s core content contains questions about expectations of

economy-wide and family economic circumstances that are the basis of the Michigan

Consumer Sentiment Index. The expectations components of the sentiment index can be

used to test for liquidity constraints as an explanation of the pattern of spending.

Additionally, we designed questions to shed light on specific economic or behavioral

hypotheses that could explain the pattern of consumer response. Hence, the survey

approach promises not only to quantify the response of spending to a change in income,

but also to provide evidence on the underlying behavior that drives the spending

response.

       The Monthly Survey provides a representative sample of households in the

contiguous 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It is conducted by telephone

throughout the month. The Monthly Survey begins with core questions used to construct

the Consumer Sentiment Index. The core content is followed by several modules

concerning spending and finances. The tax cut module immediately followed the core

content. The Monthly Survey concludes with some questions about household

demographics.

       Our survey was conducted in August, September, and October 2001. The first

two months of data were collected while households were in the midst of receiving rebate




                                              7
checks. By October, most households entitled to checks should have received them. The

Monthly Survey provides both a representative sample of adult individuals and of

households. We use the weights that enable us to construct a representative sample of

households. These weights correct, among other things, for the over-sampling of

households with more than one telephone line. They also exclude responses by adult

children residing with their parents on the grounds that these respondents are uninformed

about their families’ finances. See Richard Curtin (no date).

       The tax rebate survey module begins by briefly summarizing the policy and the

rebate. The survey then asks whether the household will spend the rebate, save it, or use

it to pay debt. Specifically, the key question was as follows:



       Earlier this year a Federal law was passed cutting income tax rates and

       expanding certain credits and deductions. The tax cuts will be phased in

       over the next ten years. This year many households will receive a tax

       rebate check in the mail. In most cases, the tax rebate will be $300 for

       single individuals and $600 for married couples.



       Thinking about your (family’s) financial situation this year, will the tax

       rebate lead you mostly to increase spending, mostly to increase saving, or

       mostly to pay off debt?



Respondents are allowed to volunteer that they will not receive the rebate, although they

are not prompted for that response. (This is question A31 of the survey. See the




                                             8
Appendix for the exact wording and order of the survey questions.) This question closely

follows that used by Shapiro and Slemrod (1995) to study the 1992 change in

withholding.3

       The remainder of the survey module was designed to elicit responses that would

be useful for testing various theories that explain spending behavior. These questions

were designed within the limits of a telephone survey of the general public. There are

limits—owing to survey costs, the attention span of respondents for a particular question,

and the willingness of respondents to complete the whole survey—on the number of

questions and the length of explanatory material. Moreover, it is necessary to map as

best as possible economic concepts into everyday terms. Because the framing of

questions may have an effect on responses, we attempted to design questions that would

give unbiased responses.

       The next question (A32) was designed to elicit (for those who said they would

spend the rebate) whether it was for a particular purchase (a durable for example, but also

a lumpy non-durable such as a trip) or for non-durables. This question illustrates issues

that need to be confronted in crafting the survey. Terms such as “durable” or “lumpy”

have technical meaning to economists, but are not necessarily meaningful to respondents.

Of course, using non-technical terms in the survey leads to questions of interpretation




3
 The 1992 question was as follows: “The federal government has recently changed the
amount of income tax that is being withheld from paychecks. On average, the change in
withholding should increase your take-home pay by about $25 per month, or by a total of
about $250 for all of 1992. It also means that next year your tax refund will be about
$250 less than otherwise, or you will have to pay about $250 more in taxes next year than
otherwise. How do you think you will use the extra $25 per month—do you think you
will spend most of it, save most of it, use most of it to repay debts, or what?”


                                             9
when analyzing the responses. We settled on “particular item” and “day-to-day

expenses” to describe these alternatives.

       The next questions are relatively straightforward queries about the timing of the

receipt of the rebate and timing of spending. (See A33, A34, and A36. A35 is an

interviewer checkpoint.) Question A37 asks whether the household expects larger,

similar, or smaller tax cuts in future years compared to the rebate. This information is

critical for testing standard theories of consumption behavior. If future, credible, tax cuts

are at least the size of the rebate, then the permanent income model of consumption

would warrant an increase in consumption that could be at least the size of the rebate.

Under the 2001 tax law, the median household will indeed get a tax cut in future years

that is, in nominal dollars, exactly the size of the rebate.4 Many high-income households

will get substantially larger tax cuts. This question also allows us to compare the

respondents’ prediction about their future tax cuts to an estimate of the cuts based on

their economic and demographic circumstances. Behavior could differ from the

permanent income model because respondents perceive the tax cuts to be short-lived.

       The Barro/Ricardo hypothesis is that households will integrate the governments’

budget constraint into their own decision-making, and therefore treat a tax cut as an

increase in lifetime resources only if it is matched by a cut in government spending.

Question A42 asks whether respondents think that the tax legislation as a whole will

increase or decrease government spending. The responses to this question can be used to



4
  To get a larger tax cut, households will have to reach the income level of the old 28
percent bracket, which as noted above is reached at well above the median level of
income. To get a smaller tax cut, the individual would have to have a decline in income
and have a level of income lower than that of the new 10 percent bracket ($12,000 of
taxable income for a family). The tax cuts are scheduled to disappear in 2011.


                                             10
examine whether the Barro/Ricardo hypothesis accounts for the decision to spend the

rebate. The next question (A43) asks whether the tax legislation would improve the

family’s personal financial situation over the next ten years. This question is designed to

elicit the respondent’s expectation about the permanent impact of the tax cut, potentially

including the changes in government spending asked about in the previous question.5

        The survey also includes questions to explore alternative theories of spending

behavior. In particular, we were interested in testing for the importance of rule-of-thumb

behavior in spending or saving the rebate. Designing questions that elicited meaningful

information about such behavioral considerations proved a challenge. One cannot ask

“Into what mental account did you deposit your rebate?” or “Did you add the rebate to

your buffer stock? or “Do you have a spending or saving rule of thumb?” Our approach

to elicit information about the procedures respondents used in forming their spending

plans was first to ask whether the family had a budget (A38) and then to ask whether the

budget had a spending target, a saving target, or a debt repayment target (A39). (Multiple

answers were accepted, but not prompted for.) The specific aim of this question is to see

if a budgetary rule of thumb could account for variations in consumer response to the

rebate. One rule of thumb is to set expenditures and let blips in income add or subtract to

cash balances or, more generally, savings. Another is to save a specific amount of

periodic income (e.g., through a payroll savings plan) and spend the rest. The first rule of

thumb leads to saving an infusion of income while the second leads to spending it.

Neither involves high-frequency reoptimization of spending versus saving decisions.



5
  These questions, together with Question A41 that asks about the impact of the rebate on
the economy, are grouped together at the end of the survey module. We grouped together
the questions that bear on the overall impact of the policy.


                                            11
Either could be near-rational, depending on the process followed by shocks to income

and consumption.

          Finally, we asked how the respondent financed a hypothetical shock to

consumption needs, specifically whether he or she would finance a major, unexpected car

repair by using savings, by cutting back other expenses, or by borrowing (A40). Cutting

back other spending could indicate liquidity constraints for individuals with little assets.

For individuals with assets, cutting back spending might be interpreted as due to mental

accounting or spending targets.


                                         III. Results

                                     A. Tabular Analysis

Of those that had already received or expected to receive the rebate, only 21.3 percent of

survey respondents said they had or would mostly spend more because of the rebate

check. When the responses are weighted as described in Section II, this figure rises

slightly to 21.8 percent. All subsequent figures in the paper refer to weighted responses.

(The counts of weighted responses in the tables are rounded to the nearest integer. The

percentages are based on unrounded data.) Of those who would not spend, 59 percent

said they would repay debt and 41 percent said they would devote the rebate to increased

saving.

          The 21.8 percent figure is far below the percentage that reported spending most of

the increased after-tax income from the elder Bush’s withholding change, and well below

what most other research would suggest. It is in line, though, with what some other

commercial surveys had suggested prior to the rebate program, although the wording of

the question always differed. For example, in a Gallup Poll released on July 24, 2001, 17



                                              12
percent of those surveyed said they would spend the tax rebate, 32 percent said they

would save or invest it, and 47 percent said they would use it to pay off bills.

       Table 2 begins our investigation of what explains differences in spending

propensities across households by displaying the responses by the level of income and the

value of stocks owned. 6 The spending fraction shows no trend within the bottom three

income groups. It is higher for the top two income groups. Hence, the commonly

expressed view that lower-income individuals have relative high propensity to spend (see

Paul Krugman, New York Times, October 24, 2001) is not supported by our findings.

Finally, not surprisingly, Table 2 reveals that low-income households were much more

likely than higher-income households to expect not to receive the rebate.

       The relationship of the consumer response to the tax rebate and stock ownership

is strikingly non-monotonic. Among the slight majority of respondents that own no

stock, 20.4 percent say they will spend it. Among those who do have a small amount of

stock, the spending percentage is lower than for non-stockholders, but it is higher for

those with more than $50,000 of stock. This pattern can be rationalized as follows. Non-

stockholders tend not to be savers, while stockholders are savers. (See Mankiw, 2000,

for the spender/saver dichotomy.) Those stockholders with low wealth are trying to build

wealth and therefore have a powerful saving motive; those with higher wealth may

already have adequate assets, and therefore are spenders on the margin.

       To the extent that income is a (negative) indicator of the presence of liquidity

constraints, the results of Table 2 are counter-indicative. Those people who are more



6
  High stockholding is not a sufficient statistic for high wealth. Many high-wealth
individuals do not hold stock. See Mankiw and Zeldes (1991). We focus on stock
holdings simply because these are the only data on wealth in the survey.


                                             13
likely to be constrained (i.e., have lower income) are those that are more likely to mostly

save, rather than mostly spend, the rebate. Table 3A pursues this explanation by cross-

tabulating the spend-or-save responses with the answers to three questions designed to

pick up the presence of liquidity constraints. We believe that a person is more likely to

be liquidity constrained if he or she is financially worse off compared to the previous

year, is financially worse off compared to what is expected for next year, or if they expect

higher income next year. In none of these three cases is there a relationship between the

answer to this question and the answer to the spend-or-save question that would indicate

the importance of liquidity constraints. In fact, to the extent that any patterns emerge,

they run in the reverse direction. People who are in worse financial condition than last

year are less likely to spend more because of the rebate. The most surprising pattern of

results applies to the question about this year’s financial condition compared to what is

expected next year. Here the relationship to spend-save plans is non-monotonic. The

least likely to spend are those who expect to be worse off. That finding in and of itself is

consistent with the liquidity constraint story. But the group second most likely to spend

are those who expect to be better off next year, while the group most likely to spend are

those who expect to be about as financially well off next year as this year. The liquidity

constraint story suggests that the most likely to spend would be those who expect to be

better off next year. The same pattern of results appears when the question asks about

income next year rather than financial condition next year compared to this year.

       Table 3B uses the joint distribution of retrospective and expected financial

condition to provide a more powerful test of the liquidity constraint hypothesis. For

example, if liquidity is a key determinant of spending behavior, households who are




                                             14
temporarily in bad financial condition (worse off than last year, but expecting to be better

of next year) should have particularly high spending rates. In contrast, those who are in

temporarily good financial condition (better off than last year, but expecting to be worse

off next year) should have particularly low spending rates. Households in temporarily

bad financial condition have a spending fraction of 16.0 percent, while those in

temporarily good financial condition have a spending fraction of 22.0 percent. The

liquidity constraint hypothesis predicts the opposite pattern. Under the liquidity

constraint hypothesis, one would expect higher spending rates as one reads down the

columns of Table 3B and lower rates as one reads across. These patterns are not apparent

in the results.

         In our previous survey-based study of the elder Bush’s withholding change, we

were also unable to relate spend-save intentions with any indicator of liquidity constraint,

and we speculated that the explanation might be related to whether people used budget

rules, or rules of thumb, to govern their behavior. Thaler (1990) argues that such rules of

thumb, or mental accounts, are important for understanding specific decisions by

consumers. Mankiw (2000) suggests that a behavioral dichotomy between spenders and

savers is useful for understanding aggregate behavior and the effects of fiscal policy. Our

questions about budgeting are an attempt to quantify such behavior.

        The set of five questions detailed in Table 4 was designed to further investigate

these hypotheses. About two-thirds of households report having a budget. Those who

have budgets are slightly more likely to spend the rebate, though not statistically

significantly so. Among households who have a budget, those who target spending are

more likely to spend the rebate, those who target debt repayment are less likely to spend,




                                             15
and those who target saving are intermediate. (The survey allowed multiple targets to be

mentioned, so the target categories are not mutually exclusive.) These findings are

different that what one might have expected from an economic model of targeting, in

which a household that spends a routine amount would save residual income and vice

versa. The survey evidence is the opposite: target spenders tend to spend on the margin

and target debt payers tend to save on the margin. There is no substantial difference in

spending rates for target savers.

         We included a question on the survey asking how a hypothetical unexpected,

nonrecurring expense would be financed. The last group of results in Table 4 shows that

those who would use saving to finance the expense are more likely to spend the rebate

than those who would cut other spending or use credit. Those who would cut back

spending for the unexpected expense might be liquidity constrained. If so, then one

would have expected a high spending rate from the rebate for this group. Again, the

liquidity hypothesis is rejected. Both those who would use saving or use credit for the

unexpected expense are smoothing consumption, yet they spend the rebate at different

rates.

         Table 5 provides information about the relationship between spend-or-save plans

and the respondents’ outlook for the economy and fiscal policy. The first set of results

relates the expected size of the tax cut to spending. Very few respondents expect to

receive larger tax cuts, though those who do so do not have particularly high spending.

As discussed in Section II, the tax rebate corresponds to the tax savings from the new 10

percent bracket, currently legislated to be in place for ten years. For most households, the

only tax cut received from the 2001 legislation will be this rate cut. To get the benefit of




                                             16
the phased-in rate cuts on the higher brackets, taxable income will have to reach the level

of the former 28 percent bracket. Hence, presuming the current legislation stays in place,

the future benefit depends on expected future income. Since the higher tax brackets

apply only to levels of income well above the median, most respondents should expect to

receive future tax cuts no larger than their rebate under the 2001 tax law. Moreover,

there is uncertainty about whether the currently legislated rate reductions will be the

future law.

       Table 6 takes a closer look at the expected size of the tax cut and its relationship

to spending. It shows the fraction mostly spending the rebate by two objective indicators

of the size of expected future tax cuts: current income level and expectations of future

financial condition. (The expectation variable is for the next year. Though it does not

capture fully the long-run outlook, it does control for whether current income is high or

low relative to the future.) The first three rows of each cell show the fraction of

respondents expecting a larger, same, or lower tax cut. We know from Table 5 that only

a small fraction of respondents expects a larger tax in the future. Reading across columns

of Table 6 shows that households that expect their financial condition to worsen generally

expect smaller future tax cuts; the pattern is clearest for the middle three income groups.

Reading down the panels shows that households that have higher income generally

expect larger future tax cuts. Both these findings accord with current law. Yet, even of

those households with high and rising income that are very likely to see higher tax cuts in

the future, only a fairly low fraction—at most 0.31—say they expect a larger tax cut.

Hence, either they misperceive the current law or expect it to be changed. In either case,




                                             17
this pessimism about future tax cuts might explain the low spending propensity from the

current rebate.

       Returning to Table 5, the second panel shows that most households expect the tax

legislation to have no effect on their overall personal finances over the next decade. The

third panel shows that most households are equally pessimistic about the prospects for the

tax cut improving short-run economic performance. There is also no statistically

significant relationship between these expectations and the propensity to spend more

because of the rebate.

       The bottom panel of Table 5 investigates the role of expectations of future

government spending. Under the Barro/Ricardo hypothesis, households should not spend

their rebate unless the tax cut is accompanied by a cut in government spending. Only 19

percent of households expect that a cut in government spending will accompany the tax

cuts. This expectation could help explain why, on average, the propensity to spend the

tax rebate is low. Yet in the cross-section, there is little support for the Barro/Ricardo

hypothesis because the spending propensity has no significant relationship with

expectations of future government spending.

       Table 7 shows some details about the spending plans of those who expected to

spend the rebate. About 40 percent reported planning to spend the rebate on a particular

item versus 60 percent for day-to-day expenses. Recall that we meant these categories to

contrast durables or other lumpy items with nondurables. The next panel considers the




                                             18
timing of spending. More than three-quarters of the respondents expected to spend the

rebate within a month and few planned to defer it to 2002.7

              B. Timing of the Survey and Timing of Receipt of the Rebate

The attacks on New York and Washington on September 11, 2001 occurred during the

data collection period of the survey. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index had

already fallen in the early part of September prior to the attack. It bounced up somewhat

after the attack, although it ended the month at a much lower level than at the beginning

of the month. Did the attack have an effect on spending the rebate? Table 8A appears to

suggest that it did. For those who responded to the survey prior to September 11, 18.4

percent said they would spend the rebate. After September 11, the spending rate

increased to 25.1 percent.

       Interpreting the effect of singular events, even ones as significant as the attack,

can be misleading. The change in the spending propensity following the attack might, by

coincidence, arise from some other factor. The next panel in Table 8A shows such a

confounding factor. There is a substantial and statistically significant impact of having

already received the rebate on whether a respondent reports planning to spend it. There

are a variety of reasons why a higher spending rate might be reported for those who have

the rebate in hand. The rebate might be more salient if it is hand, though it is not clear

why salience would favor spending over saving. Another possibility is that receiving the

rebate confirms that the household is entitled to it and hence can add it to its lifetime

resources available for spending. Having received the rebate has a large effect on



7
 The survey question refers to the lag in spending from the time of survey. The lag in
spending from receipt of the rebate needs to be adjusted up or down depending on
whether the rebate had been received at the time of the survey.


                                              19
spending, though it does not appear to matter whether the rebate was received very

recently or not.

       Table 8B shows how timing of survey responses and timing of receipt of the

rebate are confounded. During August, the first month of survey, relatively few

households had received the rebate. By September, the majority had received it. By

October, the overwhelming majority reported having received it.

       To sort out these effects, we use a regression analysis. Table 9 reports the results

of estimating a linear probability model for the propensity to spend the rebate.8 In

column (A), the coefficient of the post-attack dummy is 6.7 percentage points and is

statistically significant. Column (B) shows, however, that all the incremental spending

comes from people interviewed in October. Distinguishing pre- and post-attack

September in Column (C) does not change the conclusion that high spending is

associated with being surveyed in October, which happens to be after the attack.

Of course, by October, most respondents had received the rebate. Column (D) includes

controls for having received the rebate. The estimated coefficients of having received the

rebate are sizeable and jointly significant. Moreover, including the dummies for receipt

of the rebate makes the October coefficient shrink and become insignificant. The

September coefficient gets larger in absolute value, but remains insignificant. The post-

attack variable has a small and insignificant estimated coefficient.




8
 The dependent variable in these regressions equals one for those who reported mostly
spending the rebate and zero for those who report saving or paying debt. An alternative
would be to estimate a probit model. But recall that we argued above that the data should
be weighted. Weighting induces heteroskedasticity and therefore renders the probit
analysis inconsistent. Hence, we estimate linear probability models and use
heteroskedastic standard errors for inference.


                                             20
        Although the pattern of coefficients on the three receipt dummy variables might

suggest a decay, the difference is not statistically significant (p=0.34). Moreover,

although the month dummies have small t-statistics, they are marginally significant

jointly (p=0.10). In Column (E) we thus present results including the month dummies

and including a single dummy for having received the rebate regardless of timing of

receipt. This is our preferred specification, and it strongly suggests that having already

received the check increases the probability of responding that it would be mostly spent

by nearly 8 percentage points. The last column shows the estimate of the effect on

spending of having received the rebate leaving out the month controls—more than 9

percentage points. Given the marginal significance of the month dummies, this probably

overstates the effect of receipt of the rebate.

        About 60 percent of respondents reported receiving the rebate at the time of the

survey. According to Column (E), receipt of the rebate adds 7.9 percentage points to the

spending rate. Hence, one might add 3.2 percentage points (.4 x 7.9) to the spending rate

to correct for the effect of ultimate receipt of the rebate on those who had not received it

at the time of the survey. This would increase the estimated spending rate from 21.8

percent to 25.0 percent.

        This analysis demonstrates the utility of the survey approach. The effect of

receipt of the rebate is confounded with the effect of the attack. Our ability to control for

receipt of the rebate among individuals responding to the survey after the attack allows us

to avoid the incorrect inference that the attack changed spending. In contrast, a

researcher with only aggregate time series might well have concluded that the effect of

the attack was significant.




                                              21
       The next section presents a more complete econometric analysis of the

determinants of spending the rebate. In light of the results in Table 9, we include controls

for the month of survey and the receipt of the rebate in these equations.

                                 C. Econometric Analysis

The cross-tabulations suggest that the propensity for the rebate to increase spending is

higher for those with higher incomes, is higher for those with more stock market wealth

(although also relatively high for non-stockholders), but is not associated with indicators

of liquidity constraints or how the tax cut legislation affected people’s long-run financial

position. It is correlated with budget rules, but not in a way that one would expect. In

this section we further explore the determinants of the spend-or-save response with a set

of regression analyses. In the analysis, we pool the save response with the repay debt

response and contrast it with the spend response.

       The main advantage of this approach is that we can investigate whether the simple

correlations revealed in the cross-tabulations may be picking up, or masking, an

association with a correlated variable. For example, Table 3 reveals that people who

expect to be worse off next year are less likely to use the rebate as an opportunity to

spend more. But, if those who expect to be worse off are generally low-income, then it

may be the association with income, rather than with expected future financial condition,

that is driving the relationship with the spend-or-save response. The regressions are

estimated as linear probability models using the weighted data.

       As a baseline, Table 10 presents the results of a regression analysis with only log

income, dummies for levels of stockholding (no stock is the excluded category), for the

respondent being married, for the presence of children in the household, and for levels of




                                             22
education of the respondent (less than high school is the omitted category).9 Tables 11,

12, and 13 focus additionally on each of the three sets of explanations of the spend-or-

save response: personal financial condition, budgeting, and the outlook for the economy

and policy.

          The positive relationship with income found in Table 2 appears in Table 10 as

well, although it remains statistically insignificant. Relative to non-stockholding,

spending is U-shaped in stockholding, as is found in Table 2.

          Being married raises the spending propensity and having children reduces it,

although only with weak statistical significance. The age pattern of the spending

propensity is uneven, with the 50 to 64 year old respondents having lower spending

propensities than younger (but not the youngest) and especially older households.

Education is not significantly related to spending. Since having children or the education

levels have small and insignificant effects on spending, we drop them from subsequent

regressions. Column (B) reports the baseline regression without these covariates.

          Table 11 shows that the associations that run counter to the liquidity-constraints

theory that appeared in Table 3 survive the regression framework. Being better off, either

compared to the previous year or the one’s expected condition next year, is positively

associated with a propensity to spend. Column (A) of Table 11 shows that being better

off or in the same financial condition this year relative to last year raises the propensity to

spend by 7.1 and 6.5 percentage points, respectively, relative to those who are worse off

than last year. Column (B) shows that expecting to be better off or in the same financial

condition next year relative to this year raises the propensity to consume by 2.3 and 4.5

    See Appendix Table 1 for definition of these variables and their means.


                                               23
percentage points, respectively, relative to those who expect to be worse off next year

than this year. Combining both the retrospective and expected financial conditions in

Column (C) has only a small effect on the estimates compared to those in Columns (A)

and (B). Hence, current financial conditions relative to the past and future conditions

have a significant effect on spending, but not in the way one would expect if liquidity

constraints explained behavior. In particular, those with transitorily bad financial

condition have about the same spending propensity as those with transitorily good

financial conditions. The highest spending propensities are associated with those that

have a stable financial condition, retrospectively and going forward.

       The regression reported in Column (D) of Table 11 confirms that one’s expected

financial condition has better predictive power for spending than expected income, as

reported in the cross-tabulations of Table 3.

       Table 12 shows that whether or not the respondent has a budget is not a

significant determinant of spending the rebate [Column (A)], but conditional on having a

budget, those whose budget targets spending have a higher propensity to spend relative to

other budget rules [Column (B)]. Taken at its face value, this result means that

households abandon their budget rule on the margin, i.e., those who have a spending

target are more likely to spend the rebate.

       Table 12, Column (C), provides further evidence that the cross-section differences

in spending propensity are not well predicted by the standard model of consumption

smoothing and liquidity constraints. A liquidity constraint would require households

facing an unexpected expense to cut back other spending. For unconstrained households,

using saving or using credit are both means of buffering consumption against shocks.




                                                24
Yet, Table 4 shows and the regression in Column (C) of Table 12 confirms that in the

survey responses, only those who would use saving as a buffer against an unexpected

expense are particularly likely to spend the rebate. The estimated coefficients of use

credit and use saving are significantly different (p=0.01). Hence, there is a striking

asymmetry between those who buffer shocks with credit and with savings.

       Table 13 corroborates the impression gleaned from the cross-tabulations shown in

Table 5 that neither budget rules nor beliefs about the impact of the tax cut legislation on

one’s own, or the country’s, financial standing is montonically related to whether the

consumer spends or saves the rebate. Paradoxically, although not statistically

significantly, those who believe that the tax cuts would worsen or improve their own

personal financial situation were more likely to mostly spend the rebate compared to

those who think it would have no effect; the same pattern is true with respect to how the

tax cuts affect the overall economic situation.

                  D. Response to a Temporary Tax Cut After the Attack

The University of Michigan Survey Research Center fielded a new survey, How America

Responds, in response to the attacks on New York and Washington, D.C. of September

11, 2001. The aim of the new survey was to study whether there were shifts in economic,

social, political, and psychological attitudes following the attack. The survey included a

version of the question about tax rebates analyzed above. It reads as follows:



       This year many households have received a tax rebate check in the mail

       amounting to $300 or $600. Suppose the Federal government cut taxes an




                                             25
       additional $1000 per household for this year only and sent this $1000

       rebate to you (your family) in October of this year.



       Thinking about your (family’s) financial situation this year, will the tax

       rebate lead you mostly to increase spending, mostly to increase saving, or

       mostly to pay off debt?



Respondents were then given the same “Spend,” “Save,” or “Pay Debt” alternatives as in

the main question under study in this paper. Hence, the question is identical except that

the tax rebate is hypothetical, it is $1000 instead of $300 or $600, and it is received only

in one year.

       The results are similar to this survey. Only fifteen percent of the respondents

answered that they would mostly spend the rebate. The remainder was roughly equally

split between saving and paying debt. The spending rate for the hypothetical tax cut, like

that for the actual rebate, was not a function of the level of income. Given that the

hypothetical rebate was temporary, a lower spending propensity can be rationalized by

economic theory. Nonetheless, the spending percentage is close to what we find for the

actual rebate. Like our estimate for the actual tax rebate, the spending propensity from

the hypothetical rebate is much smaller than found in earlier studies.


                       IV. Literature on Propensity to Consume

The standard methodological approach to this question has been to examine aggregate

consumption data for signs of a break in behavior around the implementation date of a

tax policy change. This approach has been applied to the most similar recent policy, the



                                             26
tax rebate of 1975. The Tax Reduction Act of 1975 provided for a 10 percent rebate of

1974 taxes up to a maximum of $200, and totaled $8.1 billion sent out from late April to

mid-June of 1975. The 1975 tax bill also included a smaller, transitory income tax

reduction that was subsequently made permanent, and a one-time Social Security bonus

for retirees with no income taxes to rebate. Blinder (1981) finds that each rebate dollar

raised consumption by about 16 cents in the quarter it was received, and still had

substantial effects five to eight quarters afterwards. Hence, the cumulative effect is

substantially larger than the impact effect and substantially larger than we find.

Modigliani and Steindel (1977) find much smaller effects, however, and Blinder and

Deaton (1985) were unable to precisely estimate the response. Poterba (1988), using

monthly rather than quarterly consumption data, finds that consumption of nondurables

increased by between 18 and 24 percent of the rebate in the month received, but found

that the change in service consumption was negligible. Hence, despite the fact that the

1975 rebate was meant to be a temporary tax reduction, the time-series evidence suggest

propensities to consume at least as great as we find, and substantially greater in the case

of Blinder’s study.

       These aggregative studies focus on specific tax rebates as shocks to income. The

literature on the excess sensitivity of consumption to predictable changes in income

examines how consumption responds on average to predetermined movements in

income.10 According to the permanent income model of consumption, consumption

should adjust only when income moves unexpectedly. These studies find, however, that

10
 This line of research was begun by Flavin’s (1981) extension of Hall’s (1978) seminal
work. Though there are some econometric difficulties with Flavin’s approach [see




                                             27
consumption responds to predictable changes in income. The estimated aggregate

propensity to consume from expected changes in income is between 40 and 50 percent.

       Similarly, there is a large literature on examining the excess reaction of

consumption to income in data on households.11 A series of recent studies have used data

on individuals to examine how the receipt of payments affects spending. The common

thread of these studies is that consumption responds to changes in the timing of payments

not associated with changes in lifetime resources.12 Parker (1999) examines whether

spending changes when take-home pay increases in months after wage earners hit the

earnings ceiling for Social Security payroll taxes. He finds that there is a correlation

between take-home pay and consumption, although the evidence points to myopia or

rule-of-thumb behavior rather than liquidity constraints as the source of the

consumption/income correlation. Souleles (1999) studies spending from tax refunds. He

concludes that almost two-thirds of every dollar of refund is spent within the quarter.

Moreover, households that likely face liquidity constraints (those that are younger, have

high debts, few liquid assets, and low income) quickly increase their spending on

nondurables, while wealthier households quickly spend it on durable goods and may use

part of the refund check later on summer vacations. Stephens (2001) studies whether the

receipt of Social Security checks affects the timing of spending within the month. He

finds a significant burst in spending in the week following receipt of the check. Since the

regularity of these payments provides ample opportunity for households to make



Mankiw and Shapiro (1985)], the finding of excess sensitivity has been confirmed by a
large literature. See Campbell and Mankiw (1989) and its successors.

adjustments to avoid the correlation of spending with the receipt of the check, Stephens’s

finding suggests that some behavior other than liquidity constraints explains spending

patterns.

       Not all evidence from individual households suggest excess consumption from

predictable changes in income. Hsieh (2001) finds that there is no evidence against

consumption smoothing from changes in income from the large and predictable payments

received by Alaskans from oil royalties. Similarly, Souleles (2000) finds that large and

predictable tuition payments have little impact on parents’ non-tuition expenditures.

       The most methodologically similar paper is Shapiro and Slemrod (1995), which

used survey responses to estimate the consumption response to a policy of George W.

Bush’s father. President George H. Bush in 1992 issued an executive order that changed

the income tax withholding rates to increase after-tax income by about $29 per month per

worker, or an aggregate increase of $25 billion in after-tax income. This study concluded

that 43 percent of consumers spent the extra cash flow from the withholding change.

This figure is similar to Campbell and Mankiw’s (1989) estimate, based on aggregate

time-series that 50 percent of income goes to “rule of thumb” consumers. Consistent

with the 2001 evidence, the study revealed no relationship between the response to the

withholding change and indicators of liquidity constraint based on one’s income and

financial condition in the current year compared to the previous year and expectations

about the next year. Shapiro and Slemrod speculated that the results might be consistent

with consumers following some sort of rule of thumb, or near-rational, behavior. The

evidence that this paper presents on budget targeting does suggest that budget rules




                                            29
matter, although if “target spending” means that saving is the residual in a rule of thumb,

this evidence does not support the simplest behavioral model.

       Although the 1992 and current surveys are similar in wording and design, the

policy changes were different. We have already emphasized that the 1992 policy change

affected only the timing of tax payments while the 2001 change, if taken at face value,

had a substantial effect on their present value. The 2001 changes also might have been

more salient. They were more heavily discussed in the press and also came in the form of

a single check rather than a series of 10 monthly increments to take-home pay. It is not

obvious, however, that increased salience would generate a higher rate of saving.


                                      V. Conclusions

Only 22 percent of households report that they had spent or expected to mostly spend the

income tax rebate of 2001. This spending rate perhaps needs to be corrected upwards by

as much as 3 percentage points to account for the effect on survey responses of the timing

of receipt of the rebate. Given that the tax legislation in place at the time of the survey

provided for ten years of tax cuts of at least the amount of the rebate for most households

receiving the rebate, the tax rebate apparently corresponds to a substantial increment to

lifetime resources. Hence, standard economic theory would suggest a spending rate close

to one. It is therefore very surprising to find a spending propensity much closer to zero, a

surprise that is compounded by the likelihood that some households are liquidity

constrained, which raises the propensity to consume even out of a temporary tax cut.

       The very low propensity to consume is even more surprising in the context of

previous estimates. There is substantial evidence—both from aggregate time series and

from data on households—that the propensity to consume out of changes in income is



                                             30
substantial. Indeed, the propensity to spend in situations where an unconstrained,

forward-looking consumer would smooth consumption is generally found to be

substantially larger than what we find.

       Economists are, of course, skeptical of survey responses. We are supposed to be

interested in what people do, not what they say they will do or have done. We have

argued elsewhere [Shapiro and Slemrod (1995)] that this view of the survey evidence is

too limited. In any case, it is very difficult to use time-series or cross-section evidence on

actual behavior to study events such as the tax rebate. It is a single event that affects

most households by the same amount. In the time series, any other aggregate event could

account for changes in spending associated with the timing of the rebate. In the cross

section, most households will face the same shock.

       There are also legitimate concerns that the wording of the survey may affect the

results in ways that are difficult to predict. That our survey question has been tested in

the field provides an important defense against these concerns. In 1992, survey

respondents reported a much higher spending rate for a temporary tax withholding

change based on a nearly identical survey instrument. These findings are in line with

other evidence on the propensity to consume. That survey respondents reported low

propensities to consume from the 2001 rebate hence cannot therefore be attributed to the

survey methodology.

       What accounts for the very low propensity to consume from the 2001 tax rebate?

The cross-sectional analysis of Section III provides some clues. Respondents are quite

pessimistic about the size of future tax rebates. Even among respondents with high and

increasing income who should benefit substantially from the legislated reduction in




                                              31
marginal tax rates, no more than a 1/3 expect to receive future tax cuts from the 2001

legislation greater than the size of the rebate. Many households who received the rebate

expect to benefit in the future by less than the size of the rebate.

        Wealth holding is one of the most powerful predictors of spending propensity in

the cross-section. Those with some stockholdings, but low levels of stock-market wealth,

are particularly likely to save the rebate. This is consistent with a spender/saver model.

Those without stock portfolios may be spenders. Those with stock portfolios, but with a

low value of stock, may be in saving mode as they try to build assets. Those with high

asset values may already have adequate accumulated saving. Moreover, they tend to be

high-income households for whom the size of the rebate is relatively small.

        The cross-section results also fail to support some possible theories of the low

propensity to spend. In particular, because we find that propensity to spend the tax cut is

not associated with expectations of lower government spending, the cross-section results

do not support the Barro/Ricardo integration of the household and government budget

constraints.

        There are, of course, limitations to the cross-sectional results. First, because the

vast majority of households do not spend the rebate, there is little cross-section variation

in behavior to explain. It is not thus surprising that the R-squared statistics reported in

Tables 11, 12, and 13 are fairly low. Second, and more fundamentally, if there is an

aggregate change in behavior such that spending propensities have shifted downward,

cross-section techniques will be of limited use in pinpointing it. The survey does indicate

that there is a high degree of aggregate pessimism about the size of future tax cuts and the

possibility that government spending will be restrained. These findings can explain a low




                                              32
spending propensity on average even if there is not sufficient variation in these beliefs to

predict which of the few households will actually spend their rebate.

       Regardless of the reasons for the low rate of spending, the findings of this paper

have significant implications for the impact of fiscal policy on the economy. First, the

low propensity to consume implies that the 2001 tax rebate will have a very small impact

on aggregate demand. The rebate was added to the 2001 tax bill explicitly to provide a

short-run stimulus. This research suggests that policymakers will be disappointed.

Moreover, the new survey conducted after the terrorist attack suggests that further

temporary tax cuts will be relatively ineffective in stimulating spending.

       Second, to the modest extent that spending from the rebate was spent, low-income

households are not less likely to spend. This finding runs counter to the belief that a tax

rebate would be more effective at stimulating aggregate demand were it targeted at low-

income households. It is, though, conceivable that the propensity to consume would be

higher among those households whose income was too low to qualify for the first round

of rebates. This survey does not rule that possibility out.

       Third, our finding of a very low propensity to consume raises a cautionary note

about the effectiveness of fiscal policy in general. Consumer behavior appears to have

shifted from what most economists would have expected, both based on economic theory

and earlier evidence. It is possible that key parameters such as the propensity to consume

are contingent on aggregate conditions in ways that are difficult to anticipate or model.

One can speculate about why the spending propensity might have shifted downward

under the circumstances of mid-year 2001. Perhaps the negative wealth shocks of the

previous two years placed consumers in an asset-rebuilding mode. There may be costs to




                                             33
cutting back consumption, such as a force of habit. Such preferences may cause

households to allocate the rebate to saving even if they are saving a very low fraction of

current income. Future research may clarify the causes of the large apparent decline in

the marginal propensity to consume. In the meantime, these findings illustrate the peril

of extrapolating the impact of current policies from past behavior.

A31.   Earlier this year a Federal law was passed cutting income tax rates and
       expanding certain credits and deductions. The tax cuts will be phased
       in over the next ten years. This year many households will receive a
       tax rebate check in the mail. In most cases, the tax rebate will be
       $300 for single individuals and $600 for married couples.

       Thinking about your (family’s) financial situation this year, will the
       tax rebate lead you mostly to increase spending, mostly to increase
       saving, or mostly to pay off debt?

A36.    When do you plan on spending most of your tax rebate--have you already
        spent most of it, will you spend most of it within a month, will you
        spend most of it within two months, will you spend most of it before
        the end of the year, or will you not spend most of it until next year?

A37.    Now thinking about the tax cuts you (and your family) expect in future
        years, do you think that your (family’s) annual tax cut will be larger
        than this year’s tax rebate, about the same size, or smaller than this
        year’s tax rebate?

A39.    People budget in different ways. Do you (and your family) generally
        try to keep your spending within a certain limit or do you focus more
        on trying to save regular amounts of money, or to pay off regular
        amounts of debt?

A40.   If (you/your family) had an unexpected expense, such as a one-time car
       repair, would you pay for it mostly by taking the money out of savings,
       mostly by cutting back on other spending, or mostly by using credit or
       borrowing?

A41.   Do you think the tax rebates will improve conditions in the national
       economy during the year ahead, will the tax rebates worsen conditions
       in the national economy during the year ahead, or will the tax rebates
       not have much impact on the national economy during the year ahead?

A42.   Now thinking about the federal tax cut legislation as a whole, not just
       this year’s rebate, do you think the tax cuts will lead to increased
       future government spending, decreased future government spending, or
       will future government spending not change much as a result of the
       federal tax cut?

Note—The table show expectations of size of future tax cuts and fraction spending the rebate by income
groups and expectations of future financial condition. The first three rows of each cell show the fraction
expecting a larger, same, or lower tax cut. The fourth row shows the fraction spending the rebate. The
fifth row in each cell gives the frequency of the cell. See also note to Table 2.
