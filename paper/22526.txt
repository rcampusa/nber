How Do Voters Matter? Evidence from US Congressional Redistricting

                                          ABSTRACT

How does the partisan composition of an electorate impact the policies adopted by an elected
representative? We take advantage of variation in the partisan composition of Congressional
districts stemming from Census-initiated redistricting in the 1990’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s. Using
this variation, we examine how an increase in Democrat share within a district impacts the district
representative’s roll call voting. We find that an increase in Democrat share within a district
causes more leftist roll call voting. This occurs because a Democrat is more likely to hold the
seat, but also because – in contrast to existing empirical work – partisan composition has a direct
effect on the roll call voting of individual representatives. This is true of both Democrats and
Republicans. It is also true regardless of the nature of the redistricting (e.g., whether the
redistricting was generated by a partisan or non-partisan process).

    1. Introduction

        What is the relationship between voters’ preferences and the policies supported and

enacted by their representatives? Broadly speaking, voters influence policy on both an extensive

margin and an intensive margin. On the extensive margin: voters choose between candidates

through elections. If different candidates are expected to support different policies once elected,

voters are essentially choosing which policy bundle they prefer when they vote for a given

candidate. On the intensive margin, shifts in voter preferences may directly lead an already-

elected representative to support different policies.

        Theoretical models of electoral competition differ on which of these margins matter. The

Downsian model of electoral competition (Downs, 1957) and related models suggest that, in

order to achieve and maintain electoral support, politicians adopt policies that please the median

voter. Thus, shifts in preferences of voters may lead to shifts in policymaking by their

representatives – an intensive margin response. These models also, therefore, imply that who is

elected (the extensive margin) is of less consequence: all candidates propose policies close to the

median voter’s ideal. Other models (e.g., “citizen-candidate” models 1) assume that politicians

adopt their personally preferred policies if elected, so elections only serve to select the candidate

whose policy proposals are most preferred by voters. That is, under these models, only the

extensive margin is operative.

        In our paper, we take advantage of variation in the partisan composition of Congressional

districts stemming from post-Census redistricting in the 1990’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s in order to

empirically assess the importance of these two margins. To do so, we construct a new measure



1
  For Citizen-candidate models, see: Osborne & Slivinski (1996), Besley & Coate (1997). The idea that politicians
simply enact their personally preferred policy is also consistent with Alesina’s (1988) model with limited concerns
about future election outcomes.


                                                                                                                 2
of “predicted Democrat share” within each district, which allows us to observe the share of

Democrats within every Congressional district just before and after each wave of redistricting.

       Using a difference-in-differences strategy (with continuous treatment), we ask: “Does a

larger share of Democrats within a district lead to more leftist representation in Congress?” If

so, does this happen only because a Democrat is more likely to be elected (an extensive margin

response)? Or, does a leftward shift in representation occur even if the incumbent party or

candidate remains in office both before and after the shift in the electorate (an intensive margin

response)? The difference-in-differences strategy allows us to answer these questions while

stripping away the influence of (1) general time trends in ideological positions in Congress and

(2) unobservable differences between Congressional districts and representatives (that are

constant across redistricting).

       The extant empirical literature on this question has led to mixed results. Several

researchers have documented a relationship between voters’ preferences and the ideological

position of their elected representatives in the legislature (e.g., Levitt, 1996; Gerber and Lewis,

2004), but disentangling whether such a relationship occurs through the intensive or extensive

margin is not the main goal of those papers. Most relevant is the work of Lee, Moretti, and

Butler (2004) who also study the US House of Representatives. They use a regression

discontinuity strategy to isolate quasi-random variation in the “electoral strength” of a party,

building on the notion that a narrow (quasi-randomly assigned) Democrat victory in the previous

contest generates strength for the Democratic candidate in the next election due to the

incumbency advantage. Ultimately, they find that increased electoral strength only impacts the

roll call voting behavior of a district’s representative through the extensive margin, with no

intensive margin response. Indeed, they conclude: “Voters merely elect policies,” and that once a




                                                                                                  3
candidate has been elected: “the degree of electoral strength has no effect on a legislator’s voting

behavior.” In work concurrent to ours, Fedaseyeu et al. (2015) document that voters become

significantly more likely to vote for Republicans in areas where hydraulic fracturing (or

“fracking”) has driven fossil fuel extraction booms. This move toward Republican representation

then in turn leads to more conservative representation in the House. As in Lee, Moretti, and

Butler (2004), they find that this result comes entirely through the extensive margin. Conditional

on being elected, representatives from areas with shale booms, on average, vote no differently

than do other members of their party.

        However, other research using the same empirical approach as Lee, Moretti, and Butler

(2004) has found conflicting evidence in the context of the US Senate (Albouy, 2011).

Moreover, recent research suggests that the assumptions necessary for a valid regression

discontinuity design are not satisfied in US Congressional elections (Caughey and Sekhon,

2011). 2 Given these mixed results and the concerns raised around using a regression

discontinuity strategy in the US House, as do Fedaseyeu et al. (2015), we aim to contribute to

this literature by providing new evidence from a different empirical approach.

        We find clear evidence that both margins matter. First, not surprisingly, an increase in

Democrats within a district leads to more leftist representation overall. Part of this result stems

from the extensive margin: a positive shock to the number of Democrats in the district increases

the likelihood that a Democrat is elected, and Democrats are more likely to hold a leftist

ideological position in their roll call voting. However, this simple extensive margin effect does

not entirely explain the shift to the left. We find that an increase in the number of Democrats

within a district leads to more leftist representation even when controlling for party affiliation.


2
  Caughey and Sekhon (2011) find that narrowly elected Democrats are different in a number of ways (other than
just the fact that they won): incumbency status, financial resources, political experience, and other observables.


                                                                                                                4
Indeed, only about 63% of the overall shift to the left in response to a higher share of Democrats

appears to be driven by increased likelihood of electing a Democrat. This is in contrast to Lee,

Moretti, and Butler’s (2004) result; in their paper, a change in Democrats’ electoral strength

within a district led to a shift to the left in roll call voting, but roughly 100% of this change was

explained by increased likelihood of electing a Democrat.

        The main threat to identification in our analysis is the fact that Congressional districts are

not randomly drawn and therefore our treatment is not randomly assigned. As in any difference-

in-differences approach, this fact only threatens the validity of our research design if the factors

that determine treatment are also related to the anticipated trend of the outcome variable. We

would therefore be concerned if districts experiencing the largest changes in partisan

composition were markedly different in their pre-existing partisan composition or if the pattern

of redistricting varied substantially by the circumstances surrounding redistricting (e.g., party of

incumbent, cause of redistricting, partisanship of redistricting authority). We address these

concerns in a number of ways.

        We begin by directly assessing the relationship between pre-existing Democrat share and

redistricting-prompted changes in Democrat share – both in isolation and in relation to various

types of redistricting processes. In the aggregate, we find no meaningful difference in the post

redistricting change in Democratic share between districts with a low baseline democrat share

and those with a high baseline democrat share. 3 Although this finding may seem surprising given

frequent discussion of heavy manipulation of redistricting for political purposes, recent research

in fact suggests that the conventional wisdom on redistricting is not borne out in data. McCarty

et al. (2009) provide evidence to suggest that there is in fact very little relationship between


3
 A one percentage point increase in baseline Democrat share is, on average, associated with a 0.034 percentage
point decrease in Democrat share following redistricting.


                                                                                                            5
redistricting and an increase in polarization in Congress, which would be expected if redistricting

was used by state governments to minimize the competitiveness of districts. 4 Further, and

perhaps more importantly for our analysis, the relationship between baseline Democrat share and

the redistricting outcome does not appear to vary with the nature of the redistricting. To explore

this, we split our sample along several dimensions that proxy for the likelihood that redistricting

was associated with political motivations (e.g., non-partisan vs. partisan processes); we find no

evidence that this relationship varies based on the likelihood that states were engaged in

politically motivated redistricting.

         While the descriptive evidence suggests that selective redistricting may not pose a threat

to our analysis, in our empirical work we demonstrate that our results are robust to three different

strategies for addressing the issue. First, we include a rich set of time trends (interacted at both

the district and congress person level).                Second, we replicate our analysis on different

subsamples of the data, focusing on states whose redistricting processes were less likely to have

been politically motivated. Finally, we evaluate the impact of district composition on a second

demographic dimension, percent black. Utilizing the Leadership Conference on Civil Right’s

(LCCR’s) Congressional ratings as our outcome variable, we demonstrate the presence of an

intensive margin effect of percent black on voting behavior relative to the LCCR’s agenda. This

result is robust to controlling for Democrat vote share.

         Our finding of both an intensive margin and an extensive margin effect contributes to a

literature in political science exploring the impacts of redistricting on legislators’ behavior

(Boatright, 2004; Crespin, 2010; Bertelli & Carson, 2011). These authors focus on


4
  Friedman and Holden (2009) challenge the notion that redistricting is aimed to provide incumbents an advantage;
they in fact provide causal evidence that the incumbent reelection rate is lower after each wave of post-Census
redistricting during the time period we study, perhaps due to a tightening in the legal constraints (and enforcement of
constraints) on redistricting in recent decades.


                                                                                                                     6
representatives present before and after a single wave of redistricting and study their response to

a change in partisan composition (as measured by presidential vote share in the most recent

presidential election). Ultimately, results from those papers are mixed: Boatright (2004) and

Crespin (2010) provide some evidence that representatives do change their voting behavior after

redistricting; Bertelli & Carson (2011) do not. While related, the focus of our paper is different.

We are especially motivated to quantify the relative impact of electorate shifts on the extensive

and intensive margins. In doing so, we provide a new measure of partisan composition that is

not tied to any particular candidate. We measure the effects of several waves of redistricting,

and demonstrate the robustness of our analysis to potential non-randomness of redistricting.

         Our results also speak to a more general literature testing implications of models of

electoral competition. One prediction of the Downsian model has received substantial empirical

scrutiny: policy convergence. Under the Downsian model, rival candidates both aim to please the

median voter and therefore offer (and, if elected, enact) identical policies; thus it ultimately does

not matter who is elected. Competing models predict policy divergence – that is, that different

parties adopt different policies if elected. 5 It is worth noting that the “extensive margin” effect

we discuss is only relevant if there is some degree of policy divergence. A number of papers

have empirically tested whether there is more evidence of policy convergence or divergence,

often using a regression discontinuity design to randomly assign which party wins the election.

Results are very mixed; some papers provide clear evidence of policy divergence, while others

document convergence. 6


5
  For instance, if candidates are motivated to run to enact their personally preferred policy (Osborne and Slivinski,
2006; Besley and Coate, 2007), policy platforms are not credible commitments (Alesina, 1988), or voters rationally
abstain from voting if they are indifferent between candidates (Llavador, 2006), then we may expect divergence:
candidates from different parties adopt different policies if elected.
6
  Lee, Moretti, & Butler (2004), Albouy (2013), Beland (2015), and Hill & Jones (2016) all find clear evidence of
partisan differences in enacted policy and therefore policy divergence. Other studies find little or no partisan
difference in policy (e.g., Reed, 2006; Leigh, 2008; Ferreira and Gyourko, 2009; Gerber and Hopkins, 2011).


                                                                                                                   7
        Despite the substantial amount of empirical work on policy convergence/divergence,

convergence is of course just one prediction of the Downsian model. A more general prediction

of the model (and various extensions of the model) is that candidates move towards the

preferences of the median voter, or at least shift their policies in reaction to a shift in the

preferences of the median voter. This can occur even if policies of competing candidates do not

fully converge. That is, we may observe “partial policy convergence” (Alesina, 1988). Testing

whether candidates move towards the median voter in their district in general (even if we do not

observe full policy convergence) is the main goal of our paper; indeed, a model which predicts

some response – but not complete convergence – to the median voter best describes our results.

Put differently, while our results do not support all of the predictions of the Median Voter

Theorem, they do support the importance of the median voter’s preferences.



    2. Empirical approach

        How does the partisan composition of her electorate impact an elected official’s policy

decisions? To answer this question, we employ a continuous-treatment difference-in-differences

approach. The “treatment” is variation in partisan composition of a Congressional district. To

measure this variation, we construct a novel measure of predicted partisan composition, which

we describe in the next section. Because the context we focus on is the US House of

Representatives, the policy decisions of interest are roll call votes. As we discuss in more detail

in the next section, our main outcome variable is the first dimension of Poole & Rosenthal’s

“DW-Nominate” score. 7 This measure collapses all of a representative’s votes from a particular

session of Congress into a single measure capturing their ideological position along a continuum;


7
 There is a second dimension of the DW-Nominate score which accounts for regional differences within parties,
which we do not incorporate into our analysis.


                                                                                                           8
increasingly negative numbers indicate increasingly leftist voting, while increasingly positive

represent increasingly conservative voting. Thus, our analysis makes use of a panel of

representatives, with one observation per Congress.

       Our source of variation in partisan composition (measured as share of Democrats in a

district) stems from redistricting in the early 1990’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s. For each wave of

redistricting, the “pre” period consists of the two (two-year) Congresses before redistricting; the

“post” period consists of the two (two-year) Congresses after redistricting. In practice, this

means that we treat our data (described in more detail in the next section) as three pooled panels,

rather than a single long panel. For instance, Alabama’s 1st Congressional District is coded as an

entirely different district for each of the three waves of redistricting. (For that reason, although

we discuss the use of “district fixed effects” in this section, in practice, our empirics use “District

X Redistricting wave fixed effects”. This allows a district that is named “Alabama - 1st District”

to be treated differently each decade.) We elaborate on the reasons for this approach in the data

section.

       With this setup, we estimate variations on the following equation:

                             𝐷𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝛿𝑑 + 𝜖𝑖𝑑𝑡 ,

where “DWidt” is the first dimension of the DW-Nominate score for representative i in district d

at time (or Congress) t. On the right hand side, “DemSharedt” measures the partisan composition

of district d at time t and is of primary interest. We exploit variation in the partisan composition

of district d stemming from redistricting to identify the impact of this variable. We also include

time (Congress) fixed effects and, at a minimum, congressional district fixed effects. (Extensions

of the specification, discussed below, include individual representative fixed effects.)




                                                                                                     9
        Just as in a difference-in-differences approach with a binary treatment variable,

identification is based on changes in the treatment variable before and after redistricting (in this

case, “DemShare”). If partisan composition is identical before and after redistricting (i.e., the

district was not redistricted), this will be captured by the district fixed effect.

        Having established the basic specification, we now consider the hypotheses we test. Note

that the simple specification described thus far identifies the combined effects of the intensive

and extensive margins discussed in the introduction. That is, an increase in DemShare may be

expected to impact ideological positioning (DW) in two ways:

        (1) Intensive margin effect: DemShare may have a direct effect on DW. Under the

            Downsian model of electoral competition, politicians respond to a leftist shift in the

            preferences of their electorate by proposing and adopting more leftist policies.

        (2) Extensive margin effect: An increase in DemShare increases the likelihood that a

            Democrat is elected. If, conditional on being elected, Democrats enact more leftist

            policies (or engage in more leftist roll call voting), then the increased likelihood of

            Democratic victory implies more leftist representation.

Given these two channels, we expect β1 to be negative: an increase in DemShare should lead to

more leftist roll-call voting (reflected by a more negative DW-Nominate score). The magnitude

of the coefficient is of interest as it provides a baseline measure of the overall impact of a shift in

partisan composition.      We will compare this to the magnitude of coefficients in other

specifications to disentangle the intensive and extensive margin effects.

        We adopt several strategies to disentangle these different drivers. First, we can of course

simply include a dummy indicating the partisan affiliation of district d’s representative in

Congress t. That is, we estimate:




                                                                                                    10
                𝐷𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑑𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝛿𝑑 + 𝜖𝑖𝑑𝑡 ,

where 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑑𝑡 is an indicator that a Democrat is elected in district d at time t. In other

specifications, we restrict our focus to districts where the partisan affiliation of a district’s

representation in Congress is the same before and after redistricting. In either case, the resulting

estimate of β1 captures the direct impact of DemShare on roll call voting separated from the

indirect effect that comes through an increased likelihood of a Democrat being elected.

       Of course, there is a second potential extensive margin impact that is not dealt with

through either of the two approaches we just noted. In particular, just as an increase in the share

of Democrats increases the likelihood of electing a Democrat, there may also be an increased

likelihood that the candidate put forth by a given party is relatively leftist. That is, there may be a

higher likelihood of electing a centrist Republican in an otherwise mostly Republican district, or

a higher likelihood of electing a far-left Democrat in an otherwise mostly Democratic district.

This would make it appear as though higher DemShare leads to more leftist voting even

controlling for partisan affiliation (or restricting to districts where partisan affiliation of the

representative remains constant across districts), and indeed it would, but not necessarily because

politicians are responding to their electorate. Instead, this would represent a more nuanced

extensive margin effect, wherein voters choose a more leftist politician (conditional on party)

and this politician then proceeds to vote according to his or her own preferences.

       In our most robust specifications, we include individual representative fixed effects. In

those specifications, identification implicitly stems from treatment-induced changes in roll call

voting of representatives who were present both before and after redistricting. Within-party

ideological variation is captured by the representative fixed effect, so this approach removes the

influence of even the nuanced within-party extensive margin effects from the estimate of β1. The



                                                                                                    11
resulting β1 captures the intensive margin impact of DemShare on a given representative’s roll

call voting separated from any effect driven by electing a different type of candidate (different

party or otherwise). This specification is also, in some sense, the most conservative approach, as

individual candidate fixed effects absorb a large amount of the variation in ideological

positioning.

       What are the main threats to our empirical approach? The main concern is that the

partisan composition of Congressional districts is not randomly determined. State governments

are responsible for redrawing Congressional districts within their state; the potential for states to

draw districts favorable a particular party or incumbents has been much discussed in academia

and in popular media. Given our identification strategy, an important threat is that pre-existing

trends in ideological positioning of representatives cause large changes in partisan composition,

either to secure the seat for the incumbent whose political capital has grown or to remove a

party’s growing stronghold on a particular district. To deal with this, we: a) check for patterns

consistent with this form of non-random redistricting behavior in the descriptive data; b) include

specifications that control for either district- or representative-specific time trends; c) split our

sample into states that one might expect would be more or less impacted by non-random

redistricting (e.g., states forced to redistrict because of reapportionment vs. states that redistricted

without gaining or losing seats); and, d) demonstrate that similar findings hold when we analyze

the impact of share black on voting relative to the priorities of the LCCR’s legislative priorities –

results that are robust to additional controls for share Democrat.



   3. Data

   3.1 Measure of Congressional district partisan composition




                                                                                                     12
       Our identification hinges on changes in partisan composition of Congressional districts

stemming from redistricting; thus, we require data on district composition (share of Democrats

within a district) that is (or can be) measured immediately before and after redistricting. Thirty-

one states track partisan affiliation of registered voters and make aggregate statistics publicly

available; however, these statistics are usually reported at the county-level. In urban areas,

Congressional districts often make up a small subset of a county; elsewhere, Congressional

districts often cut across county borders. Thus, the official voter registration statistics are not

immediately usable, as they do not capture the composition of a representative’s electorate.

       An alternative approach might be to use actual election results immediately before and

after redistricting. One could take vote share received by a Democratic candidate as a measure of

partisan composition within a district. Obviously, taking election results from US House

elections as our measure of partisan composition would be problematic as it would introduce

substantial endogeneity into our estimation approach. Vote share received by a particular

candidate is, itself, an outcome driven by a variety of factors: personal characteristics of the

candidate (and the opposing candidate), incumbency status, etc.

       Given the lack of immediately available data that suits our needs, we construct our own

measure capturing the predicted Democrat share for each Congressional district before and after

each wave of redistricting in our sample period (1990’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s). Broadly, we use

demographic characteristics of Congressional districts to predict districts’ partisan compositions.

To do so, we draw on three sources of data: (1) county-level voter registration statistics from the

year 2010, (2) Census data at the block group level for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010, and at the

county level for 2010, and (3) Congressional district geographic boundary data, which we use to

map Census block-groups into Congressional districts before and after redistricting.




                                                                                                13
           The 2010 county-level registration statistics are drawn from Dave Leip’s US Election

Atlas (Leip, 2013). From these data, we can calculate actual Democrat shares at the county-level.

We measure Democrat share in these data as the number of voters registered as Democrats in a

district divided by the number of voters registered as Democrats or Republicans. Thus, when we

discuss Democrat share throughout the paper, we are capturing Democrats’ electoral strength

relative to Republicans (ignoring independents or third parties). We do so to more closely map

into the hypotheses we are testing (discussed in the previous section), which focus on

competition between two parties. The Congressional district boundary data is taken from Lewis

et al.’s (2013) compilation of Congressional district shapefiles for every Congress in US history;

they have made these files available online. 8

           Broadly, our construction of predicted Democrat shares requires four steps. (We describe

the construction of this variable very generally in this paragraph; full details are in an appendix.)

First, we use the 2010 county-level voter registration data and the 2010 county-level

demographic data to estimate coefficients that we will eventually use to predict Democrat share

at other geographic levels. Second, we map Census block groups into pre- and post-redistricting

Congressional districts. Third, we use those mappings to aggregate Census block group

demographic data up to pre- and post-redistricting Congressional district-level demographics for

each wave of redistricting. Finally, we use the coefficients from the estimation in the first step to

construct predicted Democrat share at the Congressional district level, for every Congressional

district immediately before and after every wave of redistricting. This leaves us with the

“DemShare” variable that is used in the empirical approach described in the previous section.

We summarize the distribution of the resulting measure in Figure 1, using a kernel density

estimate plot.

                                                                                                  14
       Although we discuss the full details of the construction of Democrat share in the

appendix, two details are worth emphasizing: (1) Census data and block group boundaries are

held constant within each redistricting wave and (2) we do not rely on actual district names in

employing district fixed effects; instead, we account for the fact that a given post-redistricting

district may be essentially the same as some pre-redistricting district, but may have a different

name. We elaborate on both of these points below (with additional detail in the appendix).

       First, when we map block group data into Congressional districts before and after

redistricting, we hold the source of the Census data constant. Consider, for instance, the 1990’s

wave of redistricting. The first elections impacted by redistricting were in November 1992. Thus,

the 1989/1990 and 1991/1992 Congresses are considered “pre-1990’s redistricting”, while the

1993/1994 and 1995/1996 Congresses are considered “post-1990’s redistricting” in our analysis.

We use 1990 Census data to construct demographics and Democrat share for both the pre-1990’s

redistricting districts and post-1990’s redistricting districts. This means that the shift in partisan

composition of districts that we measure in our data stems only from redistricting and not from

sorting in or out of Congressional districts. If we had used intercensal demographic estimates for

the post-1990’s redistricting demographics, we would be capturing a joint effect of redistricting

and within-decade demographic shifts in the district. These latter shifts may be an endogenous

response to redistricting, so we view the fact that we isolate variation stemming only from

redistricting as an advantage of our data.

       This fact, it should be noted, is the reason that we treat our data as three pooled panels

(with four periods each), rather than one long panel (with twelve periods). If we treated the data

as one long panel, we would implicitly be comparing the 1st Alabama District after redistricting

in the 1990’s to the same district in the early 2000’s, before 2000’s redistricting. Indeed, this




                                                                                                   15
district has the same boundaries throughout this period, but – despite this – we would observe

variation in the district’s demographics because we shift from using 1990 Census data in the first

case to 2000 Census data in the second case. This therefore would capture variation stemming

only from sorting in or out of the district, which is obviously counter to our goal of observing the

impact of changes in partisan composition resulting only from redistricting. For that reason, we

silo each of the three redistricting waves and make only within-wave comparisons.

        Table 1 summarizes the construction of our data with regards to usage of Census data and

district mapping. As noted, our data is essentially set up as three pooled panels; each

“redistricting wave” is a separate panel with a separate pre- and post-redistricting period. Each

pre- and post- period consists of two Congresses. (This means we ultimately omit data from

Congresses exactly half way in between two redistricting waves: e.g., the 105th.) The table

illustrates the point we just made: within each redistricting wave, the Census data used is held

constant (see the second to last column). The observed demographics of a given Congressional

district change within a redistricting wave only because of redistricting, which is reflected by the

fact that we use a different mapping of blocks to districts in the pre- and post- phases of each

redistricting wave (see the final column).

        The second detail worth noting is that we do not rely on the name of a Congressional

district to match a district just before redistricting to the same district just after redistricting. In

many cases, especially when seats are gained or lost, a district that is called “District 1” before

redistricting may overlap very little with the district called “District 1” afterwards; conversely, a

district that most overlaps with “District 1” after redistricting could very well be assigned an

entirely different district number. Thus, in implementing district fixed effects, we construct our

own district naming based on our own matching of pre- and post-redistricting districts.




                                                                                                     16
        We match pre- and post- districts using our block-group level population data. Given our

mapping of block-groups to districts, we can identify the districts that block-groups were

assigned to under every drawing of districts and can therefore calculate the population-based

overlap in two districts before and after redistricting. For instance, if District 7 is dissolved and

split between Districts 5 and 6, we can identify what fraction of the population that was in

District 7 (based on the nearest Decennial Census) is now in each of the two new districts (based

on the same Decennial Census). We then say that some pre-redistricting district “Xpre” and some

post-redistricting district “Ypost” are matched if: (1) of all the post-redistricting districts that have

any population overlap with District Xpre, District Ypost has the most overlap, and (2) of all the

pre-redistricting districts that have any population overlap with District Ypost, District Xpre has the

most overlap. If two districts satisfy these conditions, we rename them in our data accordingly:

that is, we would code both “Xpre” and “Ypost” as “Xmatch” in our data, and use the matched name

(Xmatch) when we employ district fixed effects.



    3.2 Measure of ideological position of Congressional representatives

        The main outcome variable used throughout our paper is the first dimension of the “DW-

Nominate” score (Poole & Rosenthal, 2007). Specifically, because we are interested (in some

analyses) in how an individual Congressperson’s ideological position changes from one

Congress to the next, we use the period-specific version of the score as introduced in Nokken &

Poole (2004). 9




9
  The standard DW-Nominate score varies over time, but is forced to evolve linearly. Essentially, each
Congressperson is assigned a DW-Nominate score at the beginning and end of his or her career; for periods in
between the beginning and end, the score is assigned through linear interpolation. This is not true of the Nokken &
Poole (2004) version.


                                                                                                                17
       The first dimension of the DW-Nominate score locates a politician along a left-right

continuum based on their roll call voting patterns in a particular Congress. Increasingly positive

DW-Nominate scores indicate a politician whose roll call voting is generally farther to the right,

while increasingly negative scores indicate a politician who is farther left. Thus, in our sample,

Republicans tend to have positive scores and Democrats tend to have negative scores. This is

documented in the top panel of Table 2, which summarizes the DW-Nominate scores in our

sample. The top row summarizes the scores in the full sample, while the two following rows split

the sample by Democrats and Republicans.

       In additional analyses, we test how a shift in racial composition of a district impacts

voting on issues specifically related to race and civil rights. To do so, we draw on the scores

given to members of Congress by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR). They

choose a small number of bills from each Congress that are important to race and civil rights and

rate members of Congress based on the number of times they vote in line with LCCR’s positions.

LCCR scores have been used widely in the political science literature as a measure of the quality

of black representation in Congress (e.g., Avery & Fine, 2012; Grose, 2005; Whitby & Krause,

2001). We use a version of these scores that have been adjusted by Groseclose, Levitt, and

Snyder (1999) to allow for intertemporal comparisons. The adjusted scores are only available

through the 110th Congress; as a result, our analyses taking LCCR scores are restricted to the

1990s and 2000s redistricting waves.      The LCCR scores (overall and split by party) are

summarized in the bottom panel of Table 2.



   4. Documenting the impact of redistricting on predicted Democrat share




                                                                                               18
       Before proceeding to our main results, we first graphically document the impact of

redistricting on changes in partisan composition. To do so, in Figure 2 we plot a two-dimensional

kernel density estimate. Each observation in the data is a single Congressional district during a

particular wave of redistricting (matched across redistricting as described in the data section).

For each district-by-redistricting wave pair, we observe the predicted Democrat share prior to

redistricting and the change in Democrat share resulting from redistricting. In Figure 2, pre-

redistricting Democrat share is on the x-axis, while change in Democrat share as a result of

redistricting is on the y-axis. Thus, if no districts changed as a result of redistricting, all points

would fall along the line y=0; positive (negative) values on the y-axis indicate gains (lossed) in

the predicted share of Democrats within a district.

        Our goal in reporting this figure is twofold: First, our construction of “predicted

Democrat share” is novel, so we generate this plot to further summarize the data. Moreover, most

immediately available measures of partisan composition of districts do not allow for such a clear

picture of the relationship between pre-existing partisan composition and redistricting-prompted

changes in composition (while holding demographic data constant), so the figure is of interest in

its own right to illustrate the impacts of redistricting. Second, we are interested in assessing

whether “heavily treated” districts are clearly different than “less treated” districts along

observable dimensions in ways that may threaten the validity of the research design.

       Figure 2 reveals that beyond a very small regression to the mean (a 1 percentage point

increase in baseline Democrat share is, on average, associated with a .034 percentage point

decrease in Democrat share following redistricting), there is no clear relationship between pre-

existing Democrat share and the conditional distribution of change in Democrat share.




                                                                                                   19
Importantly, while most districts change very little, there is still substantial variation across the

entire support pre-existing Democrat share.

        Still, the basic concern is that there is some fact that explains why some areas gain (or

lose) Democrats, while others do not, and that this fact also explains changes in roll-call voting

behavior. To probe this possibility, in Appendix 2, we provide a series of plots and regression

coefficients associated with splitting our sample along a variety of dimensions that may be

associated with the level/type of selection involved in the redistricting process.                        If non-

randomness in redistricting is driving the redistricting process, one might reasonably expect the

form that redistricting takes to vary across these different subsamples. We split the sample by:

        (1) states that must redistrict because they gained/lost seats vs. those that did not

        gain/lose seats,

        (2) states where the redistricting authority (e.g., state legislature) is dominated by

        Democrats vs. dominated by Republicans,

        (3) districts with Republican incumbents vs. Democrat incumbents,

        (4) districts where DW-Nominate scores of elected representatives has trended left in the

        preceding decade vs. trended right,

        (5) redistricting that occurred in the 1990s vs. 2000s vs. 2010s, and

        (6) redistricting by executive and legislative branches vs. courts vs. redistricting

        commissions.

        We find no evidence of meaningful differences in the redistricting process across any of

these comparisons. 10



10
   As noted in the appendix, within each sample splitting category, we conduct pairwise tests of differences between
lines fit to the data to assess differences in patterns of redistricting. None of these tests reveal a statistically
significant difference.


                                                                                                                 20
   5. Results

       Our primary goal is to assess whether a shift in partisan composition impacts the

ideological position of a district’s representative. More importantly, we aim to understand why

this might happen: Does an increase in the number of Democrats in a district lead to more leftist

representation only because a leftist is more likely to be elected, or is there a direct effect of

partisan composition on representatives’ behavior (as predicted by the Downsian model)?



   5.1 Does “predicted Democrat share” predict success for Democratic candidates?

       Prior to addressing these questions, it is important to first confirm that our predicted

Democrat share measure – and the redistricting-driven variation in this measure – meaningfully

captures an increase in electoral strength for Democratic candidates. To do so, we estimate the

basic specification described in Section 2 (a continuous difference-in-differences model with

district-by-redistricting wave fixed effects), but instead of taking “DW-Nominate” as the

outcome variable we take two measures of Democratic electoral success.

       Results are reported in Table 3. Column 1 reports the result of a linear probability model

taking as the outcome a dummy variable equal to one if a Democrat represents the district. In

Column 2, we take the vote share received by the Democratic candidate in the election for the

relevant Congress as the outcome (noting that we observe electoral vote shares for only a subset

of our observations). In either case, our constructed “predicted Democrat share” measure is

clearly related to an increase in Democrat electoral strength. Keep in mind that within the set of

observations for a given district (within a particular redistricting wave), variation in predicted

Democrat share stems only from redistricting. Thus, the interpretation of the coefficient in

Column 1 is: if the predicted share of Democrats within a district is increased by 10 percentage




                                                                                               21
points as a result of redistricting, then the likelihood of a Democrat winning increases by 14

percentage points. Similarly, a 10 percentage point increase in predicted Democrat share within a

district leads to an additional 8 percentage points in vote share (Column 2).

       As further evidence, Figure 3 presents a binned scatterplot, relating predicted Democrat

share (x-axis) to frequency of Democratic representation within bins of the x-axis variable (y-

axis). Here we see that, as we would expect, there is nonlinear relationship between the

probability that a Democrat represents a district and the predicted Democrat share within that

district. When districts are competitive (close to 50% Democrat share), a small increase in the

Democrat share of the district dramatically increases the likelihood that a Democrat holds the

seat. When districts are uncompetitive (far from 50% Democrat share), an increase in Democrat

share has much less impact on the likelihood of a Democrat being elected.

       The pattern of results in Table 3 and Figure 3 is important for two reasons: first, they

document the validity to our constructed measure. Second, one of our goals in this paper is to

understand how a change in Democrat share impacts representative’s behavior even when the

shift in electorate composition is not large enough to change who represents the district. Figure 3

suggests that there is substantial scope to do so.



   5.2 How does partisan composition of an electorate impact a representative’s ideological

       position?

       Having documented that our constructed measure of Democrat share performs well in

predicting the election of a Democrat, we turn to the main question of the paper. Here, the

outcome of interest is the period specific DW-Nominate score. As a reminder, increasingly leftist




                                                                                                22
voting corresponds to a score that is increasingly negative, while conservative roll call voting

yields a positive DW-Nominate score.

       Our first results on this issue are reported in Table 4. Column 1 reports results from the

most basic form of the estimating equation described in the methodology section. We regress

DW-Nominate scores on predicted Democrat share, district (by redistricting wave) fixed effects,

and Congress fixed effects. Thus, this specification captures the combined, within district, effect

of the extensive and intensive margins. On the extensive margin, a higher predicted Democrat

share is associated with a higher likelihood that a Democrat is elected (as documented in Table

3). In the absence of complete policy convergence, we expect this to generate more leftist roll

call voting. On the intensive margin, if individual politicians directly respond to changing

preferences in their electorate (rather than strictly implementing their personally preferred

policies), this too could push roll call voting further left. As we are combining these two effects

and we have already documented a substantially higher likelihood of electing a Democrat when

Democrat share increases, it is perhaps not surprising that Column 1 indicates a sizable negative

(leftward) effect of Democrat share on the DW-Nominate score. This result establishes the

baseline overall effect of a shift in partisan composition. The question of interest now turns to

what drives this leftward push. What fraction of this overall effect is driven by the intensive

rather than extensive margin effect?

       We adopt several strategies to decompose the extensive and intensive margin effects. We

first note that simply controlling for partisan affiliation of the elected representative (as we do in

Column 2 of Table 4) leads to a smaller but still highly significantly negative coefficient on

predicted Democrat share.




                                                                                                   23
       We adopt more direct means of isolating the intensive margin effect in Table 5. In

Column 1 of Table 5, we restrict the sample to districts where the partisan affiliation of the

representative does not change before and after redistricting. That is, partisan affiliation remains

constant across the four Congress that make up the pre and post periods of each redistricting

wave. Note that there are many districts for which this is true (as previewed in Figure 3); we lose

only 21% of our sample with this restriction. Thus, far more often than not, a shift in Democrat

share does not have an effect on partisan affiliation of representatives.

       If the increase in leftist voting found in Table 4 was entirely driven by a change in the

party representing a district (the main extensive margin effect), then predicted Democrat share

would be unrelated to DW-Nominate scores after restricting our sample. This is not the case.

Instead, in Column 1 of Table 5, we again find a clear negative (leftist) impact of Democrat

share on the DW-Nominate score. Comparing the magnitude of this coefficient to Column 1 of

Table 4, the results suggest that only 60% of the leftward shift is driven by increased likelihood

of electing a Democrat. The fact that it is 60% rather than 0% confirms that partisan affiliation is

important for policymaking and that policy divergence appears to be present in the US House (as

others have documented); however, while some degree of policy divergence is present, it is not

complete: 40% of the leftward shift in roll call voting in response to a shift in the composition of

the electorate is not explained by this partisan affiliation effect. Thus far, our results therefore

suggest that both the extensive and intensive margins are important.

       Of course, as noted in a previous section, there is a second type of extensive margin

effect which may still explain the result in Column 1 of Table 5. In particular, even if a change in

Democrat share is not large enough to change which party is elected, it may still impact the

candidate that is put forth within a party. That is, an increase in the number of Democrats within




                                                                                                 24
an otherwise right-leaning district may not lead the district to elect a Democrat, but it may

increase the likelihood of electing a centrist Republican. Note, of course, that this story is more

nuanced: this is only an extensive margin effect if the centrist Republican in question genuinely

holds centrist preferences and would adopt them if elected independent of the composition of the

district.

        To eliminate the influence of even this more nuanced extensive margin effect, our most

robust specification includes individual representative fixed effects. 11 In this specification, we

identify changes in individual representatives’ DW-Nominate scores in response to redistricting-

generated changes in the partisan composition of the district they represent. Identification,

therefore, is implicitly based on individuals who were present in Congress immediately before

and after redistricting. This specification strips away the influence of any form of extensive

margin effect.

        Column 2 of Table 5 reports the result. The negative effect of an increase in Democrats

within a district survives even in this specification. The coefficient is smaller, but is still of

substantial magnitude. As a point of comparison, the within party standard deviation in DW-

Nominate score is 0.21 for Republicans and 0.15 for Democrats. With this result, we can

confidently say that – while there is an extensive margin effect – there is also clearly an intensive

margin effect. An increase in the number of Democrats within a district leads individual

representatives to change the way the vote. This confirms that, even if complete policy

convergence is not observed, at least one basic prediction of Downsian-type models is observed

in the US House: individual politicians’ policy positions move with the preferences of their

electorates.


11
  To be more specific, like our district fixed effects, they are representative-by-redistricting wave fixed waves.
Thus, for each Congressperson, we identify the impacts of each redistricting wave separately.


                                                                                                               25
        In the remaining columns of Table 5, we assess whether the result we have documented is

restricted to just one party. Do both Democrats and Republicans shift to the left when there are

more Democrats in their district? In Columns 3 and 4, respectively, we repeat the specifications

of Column 1 (restricting the sample to districts with no party change) and Column 2 (individual

level fixed effects), but we now allow for differential effects for Republican and Democratic

representatives. The basic pattern of results – a clear negative effect of Democrat share on roll

call voting – is true whether representative is a Democrat or Republican. The magnitudes are

slightly different across parties, but not significantly so.



    5.3 Robustness checks – DW Nominate

        Our remaining results probe the validity of our empirical approach. While our analysis of

the raw redistricting data showed no evidence of systematic non-randomness. Selection remains

a potential concern. Empirically, we adopt three approaches to rule out that the factors that drive

redistricting do not drive our results: 1) we include district- and individual-level time trends; 2)

we partition the sample into states where redistricting is more or less likely to have partisan

motivations; and, 3) we evaluate the impact of racial composition on voting relative to the

LCCR’s voting priorities. We begin by probing the robustness of the intensive margin result as

that is our main contribution.

        Table 6 reports the results of specifications that are similar to the first two columns of

Table 5, except that we include unit-specific time trends. Column 1 of Table 6 repeats the

specification wherein we restrict the sample to districts where party does not change after

redistricting, but with district-specific time trends included on the right hand side. Column 2 of

Table 6 uses the full sample but includes individual representative fixed effects; there, we add




                                                                                                 26
individual representative time trends. In both cases the goal is to eliminate the influence of pre-

existing trends in ideological position that may have caused redistricting authorities to target

particular districts. This concern does not appear to drive our results; the results in Table 6 are

nearly identical to the results in Table 5, even with the time trends.

        Next, we test whether our results are different in states where there might be of particular

concern that redistricting is endogenous to pre-existing ideology and Democrat share as

compared to states where the reassignment of census block groups to different congressional

districts is more plausibly exogenous. Specifically, we split the sample in three ways: first, we

split the sample by states where redistricting was or was not conducted by a unified partisan state

government (or subset of state government). For instance, many states require that redistricting is

decided upon by the state legislature with approval by the governor. In these cases, we code a

state as “partisan” in their redistricting if the majority party of the legislature and the governor

are of the same party when redistricting occurs. If the separate branches are not all of the same

party, we code the redistricting as “not partisan”.      Other states make use of an independent

nonpartisan redistricting commission. These states are coded as nonpartisan regardless of the

partisan balance in the state legislative and executive branches. We interact our main treatment

variable (predicted Democrat share) with a dummy indicating whether a state’s redistricting

process was partisan or not partisan. Results are reported in the first panel of Table 7. The first

column includes district fixed effects and restricts attention to districts where the partisan

affiliation of the representative did not change; the second column uses the full sample but

includes individual fixed effects. We find that whether redistricting was conducted by a partisan

or nonpartisan subset of government, the basic result holds: an increase in Democrat share within

a district leads to more leftist voting.




                                                                                                 27
        Following the same idea, we split the sample in a second way. Specifically, if we are

concerned that non-random drawing of Congressional districts impacts our results, this is likely

to be more of a problem in states that did not gain or lose any seats as a result of the post-Censal

reapportionment. They have much greater freedom to redistrict for political purposes. States that

did gain or lose seats are forced to redistrict to accommodate the change in seats, and may be

more constrained in their ability to draw districts for political gain. Results are reported in the

second panel of Table 7. Once again, the basic pattern of results holds.

        Finally, we split the sample by the authority responsible for redistricting: state legislative

and executive branches versus courts or redistricting commissions. 12 Existing research has

documented that the authority responsible for redistricting can have an impact on

competitiveness of Congressional elections, with courts and commissions leading to more

competitive elections than legislative redistricting (Carson & Crespin, 2004). Results are

reported in the third panel of Table 7, and – again – reveal the same pattern of results as our main

specifications regardless of the redistricting authority (albeit with reduced precision).



     5.4 Robustness Check - Response to shifts in racial composition of districts

        Thus far, our results document that an increase (decrease) in the predicted Democrat

share of a Congressional district leads to more liberal (conservative) roll-call voting behavior,

and that this change occurs both because of an increased (decreased) likelihood of electing a

Democrat (“extensive margin”) and because of changes in how individual representatives vote

(“intensive margin”). This response at the intensive margin, which contrasts with some existing

empirical literature, is consistent with predictions of the classic Downsian model, wherein

12
   We combine courts and commissions into a single category in the analysis due to the smaller numbers of
observations in those categories. Combined, they account for roughly 40% of observations, with
legislature/governor redistricting accounting for the remaining 60%.


                                                                                                      28
politicians’ policy positions move towards the preferences of voters within their districts. There

is, however, an important alternative explanation for the observed change in roll call voting:

rather than responding to voter preferences, politicians may simply be responding to increased or

decreased competition. Decreased competition (e.g., a Democratic district becoming more

Democratic) may lead politicians to feel free to indulge in their own preferred policy outcomes.

       In this subsection, we provide a related empirical test to assess whether politicians are

genuinely responding to the composition of their districts. Specifically, we test whether an

increase in the percent of residents of a district who are black impacts how representatives vote

on issues related to race and civil rights. If our previous results were genuinely driven by a

reaction to voter preferences within the district, one would expect that racial composition would

also directly impact voting on issues related to race. If, on the other hand, our previous results

were strictly driven by changes in electoral strength and competition within the district, then

shifts in Democrats and Republicans within the district should matter for roll-call voting, but

shifts in other types of district composition (e.g., race) should not.

       To test this hypothesis, we modify our existing empirical approach. We replace DW-

Nominate scores with Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR) ratings as our outcome

variable. The LCCR ratings capture the extent to which representatives vote in favor of African

Americans and civil rights issues during a particular session of Congress. We use an adjusted

version which is comparable across Congresses (Groseclose, Levitt, and Snyder, 1999). The

measure is increasingly positive when voting records on civil rights issues are more in line with

the policy positions of the LCCR. On the right hand side, rather than measuring shifts in

predicted Democrat share, we consider the impact of shifts in percent black within a district




                                                                                               29
caused by redistricting. 13 As noted in the data section, the adjusted LCCR scores are only

available through the 110th Congress; the analyses in this subsection are therefore based on just

the 1990s and 2000s waves of redistricting. Beyond those changes, the structure of the

specifications are otherwise similar.

         Results are reported in Table 8. Column 1 reports results from a specification including

only district fixed effects; it therefore captures the overall effect (combining intensive and

extensive margin effects) of a change in percent black within a district. Not surprisingly, an

increase in percent black within a district leads to a more supportive record on civil rights issues.

To provide a sense of the magnitude of the coefficient in Column 1, a 10 percentage point

increase in percent black is associated with a 0.25 standard deviation increase in the LCCR

score. Of course, the percent black within a district is correlated with the (predicted) Democrat

share 14, so one concern is that we are simply controlling for a proxy for partisan composition

(and therefore potentially a proxy for electoral strength and/or competition). The specification in

Column 2 differs from that of Column 1 only in that it includes a control for predicted Democrat

share. The strong influence of the LCCR score survives even when controlling for predicted

Democrat share.

         Columns 3 and 4 restrict the sample to districts where the party of the elected

representative does not change during the redistricting wave, and therefore eliminates the

extensive margin effect of electing a representative from a different party. Still, there is a large

and significant effect of an increase in black population within a district and the LCCR score.

The coefficient in Column 3 is roughly half the size of the coefficient in Column 1 suggesting

13
   Our measure of “percent black” is constructed in the same way as our “predicted Democrat share” measure. That
is, for each redistricting wave, we hold fixed the demographic data we use (using the most relevant Census data) and
simply lay pre- or post-redistricting maps over Census block groups to obtain changes driven only by redistricting.
The main difference is that percent black can be measured directly, so there is no need for “predicted percent black”.
14
   In our sample, the correlation coefficient between predicted Democrat share and percent black is 0.5817.


                                                                                                                   30
that the extensive and intensive margin effects contribute roughly equally to the overall effect.

As in Column 2, Column 4 adds a control for predicted Democrat share. Again, the significant

influence of percent black survives. (In fact, in this specification eliminating the influence of

partisan extensive margin effects, only percent black is predictive. The predicted Democrat share

does not significantly influence LCCR scores in this specification.)

         Columns 5 and 6 report the results of including individual congressperson fixed effects,

thereby eliminating any further intraparty extensive margin effects. 15 As in previous analysis, the

result survives even with the inclusion of individual fixed effects. In Column 6, we include both

percent black and predicted Democrat share as controls. We find a result that is nearly identical

to Column 5.

         In short, the pattern of results from Table 8 are remarkably similar to our main results. In

both cases, the roll call voting behavior of representatives appears to genuinely respond to the

composition of their district.



     6. Discussion and Concluding Remarks

         The question of how voter preferences are translated into policy is especially pertinent in

the current electoral environment. Congressional races in the US have become less and less

competitive in recent decades (Friedman & Holden, 2009). In many districts, then, a very large

shift in voter preferences would be required to elect a candidate from the opposing party or

unseat the incumbent. If it is indeed the case that voters’ preferences only filter into policy

decisions by impacting who is elected, then this decrease in competition in Congressional

15
   Doing so may be particularly relevant here, as we do not control for the race of the member of Congress; it may
be that a district that is always Democratic leaning continues to elect Democrats after redistricting, but is more likely
to elect an African America representative if percent black within the district increases. Assuming black members of
Congress have a more favorable voting record on civil rights issues, this could explain the increase in the LCCR
score even in observations where the party of the representative does not change after redistricting.


                                                                                                                      31
elections may imply an increasing disconnect between voter preferences and representation in

Congress. On the other hand, if sitting Congressional representatives respond to even small shifts

in preferences of their voters (as our results suggest), the problem – while still important – may

not be so severe.

       One could reasonably expect that an increase in the number of Democrats in a district

would lead to more leftist representation in Congress. Consistent with earlier work (Levitt, 1996;

Gerber & Lewis, 2004), we find strong evidence in support of this linkage. However, the main

focus of our analysis is on understanding what drives this relationship. Broadly speaking, the

theoretical and empirical literatures put forth two hypotheses. Either: (1) politicians aim to

maximize votes by adopting policies that please their electorates, in which case a shift in the

preferences of the electorate will directly impact the way politicians vote in Congress, or (2)

once elected, politicians enact their personally preferred policies and voters only impact

legislative voting through their choice of candidate. The first of these two hypotheses stems from

the Downsian model of electoral competition (Downs, 1957). One prediction of this model – that

politicians from different parties adopt identical policies – has been subjected to substantial

empirical scrutiny, to mixed results. Much less empirical work has focused on whether

politicians’ roll call voting responds in any way to shifts in electoral strength or the electorate’s

preferences, even if evidence of pure policy convergence is not observed. That is, even if the

“median voter theorem” does not strictly hold, do politicians still respond to the median voter,

albeit in an attenuated fashion? Our study provides new evidence on this issue.

       We take advantage of variation in the partisan composition of Congressional districts

which stems from Census-initiated redistricting in the early 1990’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s. Using

this variation, we assess how partisan composition impacts representative’s roll call voting




                                                                                                  32
behavior. Ultimately, we find that an increase in the share of Democrats within a district impacts

roll call voting in two ways. First, an increase in electoral strength for Democrats indeed leads to

a higher likelihood of Democrats being elected, which in turn is associated with more leftist

representation. This result is consistent with the second hypothesis discussed above, wherein

politicians enact their preferred policy if elected and voters choose between them. However, in

contrast to existing empirical work implemented using different approaches (Lee, Moretti, and

Butler, 2005; Fedaseyeu et al., 2015), we find that this “extensive margin” or party effect does

not explain the entire relationship between partisan composition and roll call voting. Instead,

there is also a direct effect reminiscent of politicians’ responses in the Downsian model. We find

that an increase in Democrat share leads to more leftist roll call voting even when we isolate

within-party and/or within-representative changes.

       Thus, we find that both the extensive and intensive margins are important. Specifically,

our estimates suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in predicted Democrat share leads to a

roughly 1/3rd standard deviation leftward shift in the DW-Nominate score of that district’s

representation. Restricting our attention to observations where the party representing a district

does not change, the estimated impact of a 10 percentage point increase in predicted Democrat

share shrinks to a leftward shift of roughly 0.13 standard deviations or one third of the within-

party standard deviation in DW-Nominate score. Compared to the overall effect, this result

suggests that party switching accounts for approximately 60% of the overall effect. The

remaining 40% is driven by a combination of extensive margin effects occurring within the party

(e.g., more liberal candidates being chosen in primaries) and changes in individual

Congressperson voting behavior.




                                                                                                 33
Including Congressperson fixed effects, we find that 2/3rds of the within-party effect is driven

by the selection of more liberal candidates at the primary stage, with the remaining 1/3rd

explained by movement to the left of individual members of Congress who retain their seat after

redistricting.

        Finally, extending our analysis to evaluate the impact of the size of a district’s black

electorate on legislator voting relative to the priorities of the Leadership Conference on Civil

Rights, we find a very similar pattern of results - both in terms of the magnitudes and relative

importance of the extensive and intensive margin effects.

Appendix 1: Data

   1. Constructing predicted Democrat share

       As noted in the main text, there are four steps in constructed our DemShare measure.

First, we use the 2010 county-level voter registration data and the 2010 county-level

demographic data to estimate coefficients that we will eventually use to predict Democrat share

at other geographic levels. Second, we map Census block groups into pre- and post-redistricting

Congressional districts. Third, we use those mappings to aggregate Census block group

demographic data up to pre- and post-redistricting Congressional district-level demographics for

each wave of redistricting. Finally, we use the coefficients from the estimation in the first step to

construct predicted Democrat share at the Congressional district level, for every Congressional

district immediately before and after every wave of redistricting.

       The four steps are described in detail in this Appendix.



   1.1 Estimating the relationship between observed Democrat share and demographics at the

       county-level

       Using the voter registration data, we construct actual Democrat share. This is measured

as the number of voters registered as Democrats in a district divided by the number of voters

registered as Democrats or Republicans. Recall that only a subset of states maintain statistics on

the partisan affiliation of registered voters. Thus, of the 3,186 counties in our data, we observe

partisan affiliation statistics and can calculate “Democrat share” in 1,362 counties.

       We then estimate fractional logit models taking “Democrat share” on the left hand side,

and a set of county-level demographic characteristics on the right hand side. (Fractional logit

models ensure that the result predicted values of Democrat share fall within 0 and 1, which is




                                                                                                  45
important when we predict Democrat share at other geographic levels and in other years.)

Although there are relatively rich demographic characteristics that we can observe at the county-

level, we are restricted in the demographic characteristics we can use in our estimation; because

the resulting coefficients will ultimately be taken to Congressional district-level data constructed

from block group-level data, we can only use variables also available in the block-group level

data.

        On the right hand side of the fractional logit, we include the following covariates: share

of population that is: in an urban area, male, over 18, over 65, black, white, Hispanic,

Asian/Pacific Islander, or Native American. We also include share of households that consist of:

one male, one female, a married couple with children, a married couple without children, a single

male head of household family with children, a single male head of household family without

children, a single female head of household family with children, a single female head of

household family without children, a non-family with a male head of household, or a non-family

with a female head of household. We include covariates measuring share of houses that are:

vacant, owned (renter occupied), or owned (owner occupied). Finally, we also include population

density in the estimation.

        Because particular demographic characteristics may have different consequences in

different parts of the country, we actually estimate four fractional logits (and store four sets of

coefficients), one for each of the four major Census regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West).

        After estimating the four models, we store the coefficients as they will be used to predict

Democrat share of Congressional districts, where we can observe all of the same demographics

listed above, but do not observe voter registration statistics.




                                                                                                 46
   1.2 Mapping Census block-groups into Congressional districts

        Next, we use historical Congressional district geographic boundary files to map Census

block groups into Congressional districts. Block groups are of interested because they are the

largest geographic area defined by the Census Bureau that, with some very rare exceptions, nest

into Congressional districts.

        Congressional district geographic boundary files are available for every Congress. For the

most part, we use the files associated with Congresses just before and after redistricting. We pair

these with Census defined geography from the relevant Census period. Thus, we take – for

instance – the 1990 block group boundaries and map them into the 102nd Congress district

boundaries to obtain the pre-redistricting mapping for the 1990’s. We then use the same 1990

block group boundaries, but pair them with the 103rd Congress district boundaries to obtain post-

redistricting mappings for the 1990’s. We repeat the process for 2000’s redistricting and 2010’s

redistricting. Table 1 in the main text summarizes the relevant periods of Congress paired with

each decade’s Census geography.

        Thus, this process ultimately assigns Census block groups to Congressional districts for

every redistricting wave, with different assignments before and after redistricting within each

wave.



   1.3 Matching pre- and post-redistricting districts (accounting for name changes)

        Of course, it is often the case that the post-redistricting district that most resembles a

given pre-redistricting district bears a different name. This is especially common when a state

gains or loses seats. So that district fixed effects are meaningful, we must pair pre- and post-

districts based on something other than name. To do so, we first use our block-group level




                                                                                                47
population data to identify the overlap between pre- and post-redistricting districts. Suppose we

are focusing on the 1990’s wave of redistricting (though the procedure is identical for all three

decades.) Overlap between some pre-redistricting district Xpre and some post-redistricting

districting Ypost is defined as:

                                  𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 1990 𝐶𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑠 𝑝𝑜𝑝. 𝑖𝑛 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑠 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑡𝑜 𝑋𝑝𝑟𝑒 𝐴𝑁𝐷 𝑌𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡
       𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝�𝑋𝑝𝑟𝑒 , 𝑌𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 � =
                                   𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 1990 𝐶𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑠 𝑝𝑜𝑝. 𝑖𝑛 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑠 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑡𝑜 𝑋𝑝𝑟𝑒 𝑂𝑅 𝑌𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡

Thus, if Xpre contains exactly the same set of block groups as Ypost, then Overlap=1. If none of

the block groups in Ypost are contained in Xpre, then Overlap=0.

        After calculating Overlap for every pair of pre- and post-districts, we identify unique

pairing of districts such that:

               Overlap(Xpre,Ypost)= maxi[Overlap(ipre,Ypost)]=maxj[Overlap(Xpre,jpost)]

for all pre-redistricting districts ipre and for all post-redistricting districts jpost. That is, in order for

us to consider Xpre and Ypost the “same” district in our empirical analysis, it must be that (1) Ypost

shares more population with Xpre than with any other pre-redistricting district and (2) Xpre shares

more population with Ypost than any other post-redistricting district. This mutual matching

scheme allows us to find a unique pairing of pre- and post- districts; it does, however, imply that

not every district can be matched. This is not a surprise: we would not expect every post-

redistricting district to be cleanly matched to some pre-redistricting district (or vice versa), nor

would we want to pair districts that are not cleanly matched. Unmatched districts are therefore

not used in our empirical analysis.

        After finding a unique pairing, we rename districts so that paired districts have the same

name (in our data) before and after redistricting. That is, if Xpre and Ypost, we name both of them

Xmatch in our data. Thus, when we use district fixed effects in our empirical analysis, we our

matched identifier for districts (e.g., “Xmatch”).



                                                                                                           48
       To make sure this is clear, consider the hypothetical redistricting in the figure below.

There, what was District 7 is split into Districts 7 and 8. The new District 8 is entirely contained

within the old District 7. The new District 7 is mostly contained within the old District 7 but

includes a small portion of land that was previously part of District 6.




       Because Census block-groups (with very rare exceptions) nest into both pre- and post-

redistricting districts, we can identify the population of each of these areas (including the subsets

of districts that were transferred from other districts). For instance, we can identify that the

Census block groups in the new District 7 that were previously part of District 6 have a total

population of 67 people.

       To pair districts, we first calculate overlap for every possible pairing:

                              Overlap(6pre, 6post) = 933/(1,000) = 0.93

                              Overlap(6pre, 7post) = 67/(1,333) = 0.05

                              Overlap(7pre, 7post) = 333/(1,067) = 0.31

                              Overlap(7pre, 8post) = 667/(1,000) = 0.67

Based on these calculations, we pair districts 6pre and 6post, and call them 6match in our data. We

pair 7pre and 8post and call them 7match. District 7post is unmatched and is not used in our analysis.



                                                                                                   49
This illustrates the importance of mutual matching: of all possible pre-districts, District 7post has

the most overlap with 7pre (Overlap(7pre, 7post) > Overlap(6pre, 7post)). Thus, if not for the mutual

matching condition, we might pair those two districts. However, of all possible pre-districts,

District 8post also has overlaps most with 7pre (Overlap(7pre, 8post) > Overlap(6pre, 8post)); so,

without mutual matching (and some convention about whether to adopt pre-to-post matching or

post-to-pre matching), District 7pre could potentially be matched to two post- districts. Mutual

matching prevents this, and identifies the unique best pair; in our example, 8post clearly has more

in common with 7pre than 7post does, so our matching scheme has selected the “correct” pairing.



   1.4 Aggregating block-level demographics and constructing predicted Democrat share

       The third and fourth steps of the construction of predicted Democrat share require less

explanation. In the third step, using the mappings between block groups and Congressional

districts, we aggregate block-level demographics to the relevant Congressional district-level for

each pre- and post-redistricting period. In the final step, we simply use the result district-level

demographics and the coefficients from step one to construct predicted Democrat share. Because

the coefficients were drawn from a fractional logit, Democrat share is constructed by calculating:

                                                            �        −1
                                𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑡 = �1 + 𝑒 − ∑𝑖 𝛽𝑖 𝑥𝑖𝑑𝑡 �

where d indexes the district (named according to our matching scheme discussed above), t

indexes the time period (e.g., 1990’s/pre-redistricting, 1990’s/post-redistricting, 2000’s/pre-

redistricting, etc.), and i indexes the set of demographic variables used to predict Democrat

share. 𝑥𝑖𝑑𝑡 is the value of particular demographic variable for district d at time t, and 𝛽𝑖̅ is the

relevant coefficient from the 2010 county-level fractional logit estimation.




                                                                                                  50
Appendix 2: Additional tables and figures

In this appendix, we generate two-dimensional kernel density estimate plots (similar to Figure 2

in the main text). To assess whether the pattern of changes in partisan composition varies by

circumstances surrounding redistricting, we split the sample by:

- (Figures A.1(a) & (b)) states that must redistrict because they gained/lost seats vs. those that did

not gain/lose seats,

- (Figures A.2 (a), (b), and (c)) states where the redistricting authority (e.g., state legislature) is

dominated by Democrats vs. dominated by Republicans.

- (Figures A.3(a) & (b)) districts with Democrat incumbents vs. Republican incumbents,

- (Figures A.4(a) & (b)) districts where DW-Nominate scores of elected representatives has

trended left in the preceding decade vs. trended right

- (Figures A.5(a), (b), and (c)) redistricting that occurred in the 1990s, 2000s, or 2010s, and

- (Figures A.6(a), (b), and (c)) state-decade observations wherein redistricting was done by a

redistricting commission, the courts, or a combination of the state legislature and governor.



In all cases, we test pairwise comparisons between slopes of lines fitted to the data to assess

whether patterns of redistricting vary depending on the nature of the redistricting. Results are

reported in Appendix Table 1. None of these tests reveal significant differences in slopes within

categories.

Table notes: This table reports slopes of lines fit through Appendix Figures A.1-A.6. Specifically, we run a simple
regression of “change in Democrat share” on “pred. Dem. share”. The column “slope” reports the coefficient on
“pred. Dem. share”. Each panel represents a distinct way of splitting the data (by cause of redistricting, party of
redistricters, etc.), corresponding with the six sets of figures in this appendix. We conduct pairwise comparisons of
slopes within each sample splitting category; p-values from these tests are in the final column of the table.
