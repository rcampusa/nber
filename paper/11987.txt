Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, and the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and
Goetz (2005)

                                             ABSTRACT

Donohue and Levitt (2001) argue that the legalization of abortion in the United States in the 1970s
played an important role in explaining the observed decline in crime approximately two decades
later. Foote and Goetz (2005) challenge the results presented in one of the tables in that original
paper. In this reply, we regretfully acknowledge the omission of state-year interactions in the
published version of that table, but show that their inclusion does not alter the qualitative results (or
their statistical significance), although it does reduce the magnitude of the estimates. When one uses
a more carefully constructed measure of abortion (e.g. one that takes into account cross-state
mobility, or doing a better job of matching dates of birth to abortion exposure), however, the
evidence in support of the abortion-crime hypothesis is as strong or stronger than suggested in our
original work.

        Donohue and Levitt (2001) put forth the hypothesis that the legalization of

abortion in the United States in the 1970s played an important role in explaining the

observed decline in crime approximately two decades later. In that paper, we present a

variety of types of evidence in support of the argument: (1) a calibration exercise based

on pre-existing estimates of the impact of abortion and the distribution of women seeking

abortions, (2) patterns in the national time-series data, (3) a comparison of the crime

paths of early-legalizing states and those in which abortion only became legal with Roe v.

Wade, (4) differences in crime patterns in states with high and low abortion rates after

abortion became legal everywhere, (5) the fact that reductions in crime in high-abortion

states were limited to those born after abortion legalization, and (6) arrest patterns by

single year of age that are negatively related to abortion exposure. The findings of each

of these analyses are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that legalized abortion

reduced crime through a combination of smaller cohort sizes and lower criminal

propensities among those born after legalization.

        In a widely circulated working paper, Foote and Goetz (2005) challenge the sixth

piece of evidence described above (namely, that arrest patterns by single year of age are

consistent with abortion reducing crime).2 Foote and Goetz (2005) present two strands of

evidence in making their argument. First, they correctly note that the text of Donohue

and Levitt (2001) reports that state-year interactions are included in some of the columns

in Table 7 of the paper, but that the published version of the paper inadvertently omitted




2
 Foote and Goetz (2005) does not address any of the five other analyses in Donohue and Levitt (2001).
Joyce (2004) is the only published paper we are aware of that challenges our initial findings. Donohue and
Levitt (2004) contains our response to that earlier paper.
these interactions.3 When state-year interactions are added to the specification, the

parameter estimates shrink, but remain economically large and statistically significant.

Second, Foote and Goetz (2005) shows that when one includes state-year interactions in

Table 7 of Donohue and Levitt (2001) using a data set that we prepared for Donohue and

Levitt (2004) and changes the dependent variable from the log of arrests to the log of

arrests per capita, the coefficient on the abortion variable becomes small and statistically

insignificant. Based on this result, they conclude that legalized abortion may have

reduced crime because of smaller cohort sizes, but that individuals exposed to legalized

abortion in utero are no less criminal on average.

         In this reply, we address in turn the two issues raised by Foote and Goetz (2005).

While it is with great embarrassment that we acknowledge that state-year interactions

were omitted from four of the eight regressions in the published version of Table 7 of our

original paper, the mistake in the table, as we show, has a relatively minor impact on the

results.4 With respect to the second challenge raised by Foote and Goetz (2005), we show

that the absence of effects when including state-year interactions and using per capita

arrest rates is an artifact of the combination of a very crude abortion proxy and empirical

specifications that remove an enormous amount of the true signal in the data by

controlling for state-age interactions, age-year interactions, and state-year interactions.

When building on our work in Donohue and Levitt (2004), we more carefully construct

the abortion measure so that it (1) better corresponds to the actual month and year of birth

3
  While any mistake is embarrassing, we are at least glad to have facilitated the catching of this error by
posting our data and do files on the web at http://islandia.law.yale.edu/donohue/pubsdata.htm. Jonathan
Gruber, Phillip Levine, and Douglas Staiger were actually the first to discover this programming error in
our code; they intend to discuss it as part of a larger analysis of the impact of abortion in a paper that is in
process.
4
  The same omission of the state-year interactions is also repeated in the bottom two rows of Table 1 of
Donohue and Levitt (2004), which used the same code as the original paper. In neither paper did we rely
on these flawed regressions to estimate the magnitude of the impact of abortion legalization on crime.
of the individual, (2) incorporates cross-state mobility between birth and adolescence,

and (3) reflects the state of residence of those having abortions (as opposed to the state in

which the abortion is performed), the results we obtain are as strong or stronger than the

original results included in Donohue and Levitt (2001).

        The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section I discusses the

mistake in the published version of Table 7 of Donohue and Levitt (2001). Section II

demonstrates the presence of substantial measurement error in the crude abortion proxy

used in our original paper and discusses the construction of a more thoughtful proxy.

Section III shows the impact on the estimates of correcting for measurement error.

Section IV revisits the question of the channels through which legalized abortion reduced

crime. Section V concludes.



I. The mistake in the original Table 7 of Donohue and Levitt (2001)

        The final table (Table 7) of Donohue and Levitt (2001) analyzes arrest rates by

state of residence, year, and single year of age.5 As reported in the text of the original

paper, the most saturated models estimated in this section of the paper take the form:

ln( ARRESTS stb ) = β1 ABORTsb + γ sa + λta + θ st + ε stb                      (1)

where s, t, a, and b correspond to state of residence, year, age, and birth cohort

respectively. The variable ARRESTS is the raw number of arrests for a given crime

category. The abortion proxy used is the abortion rate in the current state of residence in

the calendar year most likely to have preceded an arrestee’s birth given the year in which


5
  Most of the analysis in Donohue and Levitt (2001) uses reported crime statistics from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports as the measure of crime. Because the age of an offender is
recorded only when an arrest is made, one must use arrest data rather than crime data when carrying out an
analysis by age of offender.
they were arrested and their age. Included in the specification are state-age interactions,

year-age interactions, and state-year interactions.

        Due to an oversight on our part, which we deeply regret, the version of Table 7

that was published did not include state-year interactions, despite what was written in the

text of the article. Table 1 of this paper reproduces the incorrect version originally

published as Table 7 of Donohue and Levitt (2001), along with the corrected columns as

they should have appeared.6 Columns (1) - (4) reproduces the original results reported

for violent crime. Columns (5) and (6) are identical to columns (3) and (4) respectively,

except that state-year interactions are included in columns (5) and (6). Adding the state-

year interactions reduces the abortion coefficient from -.028 to -.013, but the estimate

remains statistically significant at the .01 level. The abortion coefficient with state-age

and state-year interactions is about the same in magnitude as when only state-fixed

effects are included (column 1). When arrest rates are broken down by single year of age

(column 4 versus column 6), all of the estimates remain negative, although almost always

smaller. Adding state-year interactions to the property crime regressions induces a

similar pattern of coefficient changes.



II. Can measurement error in the abortion proxy explain the smaller estimates

obtained when state-year interactions are included in the specification?

        There are two possible explanations why the coefficient on the abortion variable

shrinks when state-year interactions are included. The first explanation is the presence of


6
  Note that the numbers in Table 2 do not exactly match those reported by Foote and Goetz (2005) because
in addition to correcting the programming error in our original paper, they also used our Donohue and
Levitt (2004) data set that extends the number of years covered beyond those included in our original
paper.
omitted factors that vary by state and year which are positively correlated with current

crime rates and negatively correlated with the abortion rate two decades earlier. The

second possibility is that there is substantial measurement error in the abortion proxy. As

more controls are included in the regression, the remaining variation in the abortion

measure may become dominated by noise. The shrinkage of the abortion coefficient, in

this scenario, is due to attenuation bias.

         Presenting definitive statistical evidence one way or the other on the omitted

variable explanation is extremely challenging, precisely because the factors involved are

not readily observed.7 It is possible, however, to systematically explore the issue of

measurement error in the abortion proxy to determine whether it may be at the root of the

diminished effect of abortion when state-year interactions are added to the specification.

         An examination of the correlation between the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI)

abortion measure (by state of occurrence) and another abortion proxy independently

collected by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provides a first indication of how

noisy these measures of state-level abortion rates are.8 The results are presented in

Table 2. The raw correlation between the proxies, not controlling for any other factors, is

7
  Foote and Goetz (2005) conjecture that crack cocaine might be a possible omitted factor. Crack cocaine
emerged in the mid-1980s, peaking in the early-1990s, before falling slowly thereafter (Fryer et al. 2005).
In order for crack cocaine to plausibly explain these results, it must be the case that (1) crack cocaine varies
by state and year, (2) is positively correlated with crime, and (3) is negatively correlated with abortion rates
in prior decades. Crack cocaine, as proxied by the crack index constructed in Fryer et al. (2005), did indeed
exhibit substantial state-year variation and is positively associated with crime. On the other hand, the data
suggest that, if anything, the places most adversely affected by crack in the 1980s and 1990s were those
that had high abortion rates in the 1970s, not low abortion rates. The five states with the highest estimated
level of crack in Fryer et al. (2005) were Maryland, New York, New Mexico, New Jersey, and
Massachusetts. Except for New Mexico, these high crack states were among the top ten highest abortion
states after legalization. In contrast, of the five lowest crack states (South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming,
North Dakota, and Nebraska), three of these states were among the ten states with the lowest abortion rates.
Thus, the omission of crack cocaine should lead the impact of abortion to be understated, not exaggerated.
See Levitt (1999) and Donohue and Levitt (2004) for further discussion of this issue.
8
  Although the CDC currently collects data on abortion rates by state of residence and by place of
occurrence, as far as we can determine, only the data by place of occurrence are available over the entire
period of interest. Therefore, we use that measure as our instrument.
.849, as shown in column (1). Thus, in the raw data, these two proxies do indeed track

each other closely. In the regression analysis, however, it is not the measurement error in

the raw data that matters, but rather the measurement error after partialling out the set of

included controls. As Table 2 demonstrates, the more controls that are included, the

lower the correlation between the two abortion measures, suggesting that the signal-to-

noise ratio is substantially reduced in the portion of the abortion measure that is actually

being used to identify the parameter estimate. In the most heavily saturated models that

include state-year interactions, the correlation is only .396. What remains of the variation

in these two proxies is only relatively weakly correlated, implying that there is substantial

measurement error in at least one, and likely both of the indicators.

       Even the correlations shown in Table 2, however, are likely to dramatically

overstate the amount of signal in the abortion proxy used by Donohue and Levitt (2001)

and Foote and Goetz (2005) for two reasons. First, given that both AGI and CDC collect

their data through similar survey methods, it seems quite likely that the measurement

error in the two data series will actually be positively correlated, implying that some of

the observed correlation is not due to true signal, but instead to correlated errors in the

two proxies. Second, and probably far more important, the crude measure of abortion

that was used has other obvious weaknesses. The proxy for abortion exposure in these

two earlier papers for individuals of age a in state s in year t is the AGI estimate of

abortions performed in state s per live birth in state s in year t-a-1. This particular choice

of proxy suffers from three additional sources of measurement error that are not captured

in the correlations reported in Table 2:
       1) A non-trivial fraction of abortions performed in the United States, especially in

the time around when legalization occurred, involved women crossing state lines to get

an abortion. As a consequence, measuring abortions in terms of the state in which the

abortion is performed, rather than the state of residence of the woman getting the

abortion, induces further measurement error into their abortion proxy.

       2) Cross-state mobility. Based on census data, more than one-third of Americans

aged 15-24 currently reside in a state other than the one in which they were born. For

these individuals, one should not expect lagged abortion rates in their current state of

residence to matter, but rather, the lagged abortion rate in the state in which they were

themselves born.

       3) Using the year t-a-1 as the relevant timing of abortion exposure leads to the

wrong year of birth for a non-trivial fraction of individuals. The arrest data reports how

many 19 year olds are arrested in a state and year for a particular crime. A 19 year old

arrested in 1993 may have been born as early as Jan. 2, 1973 (making him 19 if arrested

on Jan. 1, 1993) or as late as Dec. 31, 1974 (if arrested on Dec. 31, 1993). Because of the

way the arrest data are collected, there is a two-year window of birthdays that is relevant

and not adequately captured by the simple abortion proxy.

       The combination of access to new data series that we were not aware of at the

time our initial research was published, along with more careful decisions in constructing

the abortion measure, allows us to build an improved abortion proxy that addresses each

of these three measurement error concerns cited above.

       The first source of measurement error in the original abortion proxy is that many

women were crossing state lines to get abortions in the 1970s. When calculating abortion
exposure of people residing in a state, knowing the abortions performed on women

residing in a state is clearly preferable to abortions performed in a state, regardless of

where the woman actually lives. When our initial research was published, we were not

aware of the fact that the AGI calculates abortions both by location of the procedure (the

data we used) and by state of residence of the mother (the more theoretically desirable

measure). Given the availability of this better measure, we can eliminate this source of

measurement error. In Donohue and Levitt (2004), we argued that this improved

abortion measure was clearly preferable to the original proxy we had chosen. In that

paper, we demonstrated that correcting this measurement error substantially increased the

estimated abortion coefficients.9

         To deal with the second source of measurement error, namely cross-state

mobility, we use the 5 percent PUMS sample from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial

censuses to measure the distribution of states of birth among current residents of a state at

each age. One can then linearly interpolate using the three censuses to estimate the

distribution of states of birth in intervening years as well.10 Rather than using lagged

abortion rates in the current state of residence, one can more closely proxy the true in

utero abortion exposure using a weighted average of the lagged abortion rates in the


9
  The data set we provide to researchers who want to replicate our findings reflects the improvements we
made to our approach after the original paper was published, e.g. it includes abortion measures both by
state of occurrence and state of residence, and also extends the years covered beyond the original sample.
We find it puzzling that Foote and Goetz chose to use the longer data series (which slightly reduces the
point estimates) when “replicating” our original Table 7, but did not elect to use or even discuss the better
abortion measure (which substantially increases the estimates), in spite of citing Donohue and Levitt (2004)
which argues strongly for the improved measure.
10
   In Donohue and Levitt (2001), we carry out precisely this exercise in the sensitivity analysis to our
primary identification strategy, reported in Table 5. As would be expected, the abortion coefficient became
larger when this correction was made. The measurement error problem in that setting is likely to be much
less severe than in the analysis of arrests by single year of age. The unit of observation in Table 5 of
Donohue and Levitt (2001) is a state-year so the controls are limited to state and year fixed effects and
covariates. In contrast, in the corrected Table 7 of Donohue and Levitt (2001), controls are included for
state*age, age*year, and state*year interactions, as well as all the main effects of those interactions.
states of birth of those currently living in the state, with the weights determined by the

percent of a state’s current residents born in each state.

         The final source of measurement error in the crude abortion proxy is a failure to

correctly match some individuals to the true abortion exposure they experienced by using

year t-a-1 as the date of abortion exposure. Table 3 presents a matrix of the year of likely

abortion exposure for those arrested at age 19 in year 1993 under the assumption that

births and arrests are uniformly distributed across months, births occur nine-months after

conception, and abortions occur at week 13 of a pregnancy. For instance, roughly half of

those individuals arrested in January of year 1993 at age 19 will have been born in year

1973. The rest will have been born in year 1972. Arrests made in the middle of the year

match well with a year of birth of 1973. Towards the end of the year, however, an

increasing fraction of those arrested are actually born in year 1974, rather than 1973.

Totaling the fraction of all births to this cohort, 25 percent fall outside of 1973. To better

capture the actual abortion exposure of this cohort, we construct an improved abortion

measure that is a weighted average of the abortion rates in years t-a-2, t-a-1, and t-a, with

the weights corresponding to the fractions in Table 3.11

         Even after making these three corrections described above to the abortion proxy,

measurement error may still be a problem given imperfections in the way that abortion

data are gathered. A standard approach for dealing with measurement error of this sort is

instrumental variables. If one has two noisy abortion measures, but the measurement

error in the two proxies is uncorrelated, instrumenting for one abortion proxy using the

other will eliminate attenuation bias. In this setting, the CDC’s independently generated

11
  One could also be less parametric and simply include separately the abortion rates in these three years in
the regressions and total up the combined impact of all three years of abortion exposure. The estimated
effects are very similar, but slightly larger, when we run the specifications non-parametrically.
measure of legalized abortions is likely to be an excellent instrument. Because there is so

much noise in each of the measures, the standard errors increase when doing this IV

procedure, but under a standard set of assumptions, the estimates obtained will be purged

of the attenuation bias that will be present due to measurement error.12



III. A comparison of estimates with and without corrections for measurement error

         Table 4 presents a comparison of the results before and after the corrections

described above are made to deal with measurement error.13 The top row of the table

reports the estimates using the uncorrected measure for violent crime arrests; the second

row shows results when the three corrections noted above are made to the abortion proxy.

The third row uses the corrected abortion measure, and in addition instruments for the

AGI measure using the CDC measure. In all cases, the abortion coefficient jumps

sharply when the original measure is replaced with the more carefully constructed

measure.14 Even the estimates from the most saturated version of the model which

includes age-year, state-age, and state-year interactions yields a coefficient of -.046 that

is highly statistically significant. This estimate is larger than the coefficients reported in

the original Donohue and Levitt (2001) paper that did not include state-year interactions.




12
   To the extent that there is positive correlation in the measurement error in the two abortion proxies, the
instrumental variables estimates will tend to understate the impact of abortion exposure on crime.
Correlated measurement error will lead to an exaggeratedly large first-stage relationship between the two
abortion proxies, which will result in the second-stage estimates being too small in absolute value.
13
   The results in the top row of each panel of Table 4 differ from the results in Table 1 because in Table 4
we follow Foote and Goetz (2005) in using the expanded Donohue and Levitt (2004) data set covering the
time period 1985-1998, whereas the results in Table 1 match our original sample of 1985-1996.
14
   All three of the corrections we make to the abortion proxy contribute to the increased coefficient.
Adjusting for state of residence as opposed to state of occurrence in the model with state-year interactions
raises the coefficient from -.009 to -.021. Correcting for cross-state mobility in addition to the first fix
raises the coefficient from -.021 to -.039. Getting the birth years right moves the coefficient from -.039 to -
.046.
Instrumenting with the CDC abortion measure has a relatively small impact on the

coefficients once the better abortion proxy is utilized, although the coefficient does rise

by 20% in the regression with state-year interactions, which is likely to have the most

measurement error.

         The bottom panel of Table 4 is identical in structure to the top panel, except that

the dependent variable in the regression is the natural log of the number of property crime

arrests rather than violent crime arrests. Using the better proxy once again leads the

estimated impact of the abortion rate to more than double in all three specifications.

Instrumenting with the CDC abortion measure has a substantial impact in column (3),

nearly doubling the estimate to -.044, which is larger than any of the estimates for

property crime originally reported in the flawed Table 7 of our 2001 paper.



IV. Distinguishing between the alternative channels through which abortion operates

         The results in Table 4 above suggest that, properly measured, higher abortion

rates when one is in utero is associated with a statistically significant and substantively

large reduction in later crime. Abortion exposure can reduce aggregate crime in at least

two ways: (1) by shrinking the size of the cohort, and (2) by lowering the average crime

propensity of those who are born through positive selection.15

         Neither Table 4 above nor Table 7 of Donohue and Levitt (2001) distinguishes (or

claims to distinguish) between those two competing hypotheses. As Foote and Goetz



15
  Note that this discussion refers to the impact of legalized abortion on crime, not the impact of legalized
abortion on arrests. When analyzing the data by single year or age, we are forced to rely on arrest data
rather than crime data, since the age of the offender is not known unless he is caught. As shown in Becker
(1968), when crime falls, arrests are likely to fall less than proportionately. For the same size of the police
force, with less crime there is more police manpower to devote to each crime, which should lead to a
greater fraction of the crimes being solved by arrest.
(2005) correctly point out, adding controls for cohort size to the regressions provides a

mechanism for discriminating between the two avenues for abortion reducing crime.

         Foote and Goetz (2005) report the results from two specifications, one in which

the natural log of the state population by single year of age is included as a control in the

regression, and another in which the dependent variable is the natural log of arrests per

capita, rather than simply the natural log of arrests. The latter specification is equivalent

to imposing a coefficient of one on the population variable in the first specification.16

Once controls for population are included, any remaining impact of abortion is likely to

be attributable to positive selection.17 Table 5 reports results from both of these

specifications, along with regressions without controls for cohort size for purposes of

comparison. The top row of the table, using the crude abortion proxy, replicates the

results reported in Foote and Goetz (2005) for violent crime arrests. The second row

shows identical specifications, but using the more carefully constructed abortion proxy.

The third row uses the better abortion proxy and instruments with the CDC abortion

measure. In stark contrast to the null results obtained by Foote and Goetz using the crude

abortion proxy, with the better measure, the abortion rate remains negative and

statistically significant, even with the inclusion of population controls or measuring

arrests per capita. It is not a surprise that controlling for population reduces the

magnitude of the estimates since a smaller cohort size is one channel through which

legalized abortion plausibly reduces crime. These estimates suggest that at least 40

16
   Foote and Goetz (2005) provide a discussion of the risks and benefits of these two specifications. If there
are no social interactions, measurement error in the population variable, and that measurement error is
uncorrelated with the other right-hand-side variables, then theory suggests that the latter of these two
specifications is preferable. In the presence of social interactions or population measurement errors that are
correlated with the right-hand-side variables, the former specification is probably more appropriate.
17
   This discussion ignores any dynamic effects of abortion access on later cohorts. A woman who seeks an
abortion today is likely to alter her future fertility decisions. See Ananat, Gruber, and Levine (2004) and
Donohue, Grogger, and Levitt (2006) for an exploration of these issues.
percent of the measured impact of abortion on arrests is operating through the selection

channel.

       The bottom panel of Table 5 mirrors the top panel, except that it corresponds to

property crime arrests. The results for property crime are weaker. The better abortion

proxy by itself does not yield statistically significant estimates once population controls

are included. In the instrumental variables regressions, however, the coefficient on

abortion is -.028 (standard error=.011) when population is included as a control variable

and -.013 (standard error=.010) when arrests are measured per capita.



V. Conclusion

       We are indebted to Foote and Goetz (2005) for identifying a mistake in one of the

tables in our original paper and pointing out the opportunity to more directly test the

competing hypotheses regarding the explanation for why exposure to legalized abortion

is associated with lower future crime. The inclusion of state-year interactions and

controls for cohort size makes greater demands on the data by single year of age than the

crude rule of thumb abortion proxy used in Donohue and Levitt (2001) could support. A

more thoughtfully constructed proxy yields results that are in many cases stronger than

those reported in our initial paper, even after addressing the issues raised by Foote and

Goetz (2005). Thus, while criticism of us as authors for weaknesses in the initial paper

are warranted, we do not believe that the Foote and Goetz analysis calls into question the

conclusions reached in Donohue and Levitt (2001).

The unit of observations in the regression is annual arrests by state by single year of age. The sample covers the period 1985-1996 for ages 15-24. The abortion rate for a cohort of age a in state s in year y is the
number of abortions per 1000 live births in state s in year y - a - 1 . If data were available for all states, years, and ages, the total number of observations would be 6120. Due to missing arrest data and occasional zero
values for arrests, the actual number of observations is somewhat smaller. A complete set of year * age interactions are included in all specifications to capture national changes in the shape of the age-crime profile
over time. When state * age interactions are included, state-fixed effects become redundant and are excluded. Estimation is weighted least squares, with weights determined by total state population. Standard errors
have been corrected to account for correlation over time within a given birth cohort in a particular state. Such a correction is necessary because the abortion rate for any given cohort is fixed over time, but multiple
observations corresponding to different years of age are included in the regression.

The unit of observation is a state by year by single year of age. The sample covers ages
15-24 from 1985 to 1998. If data were available for all states, years, and ages, the total
number of observations would be 7140. Due to missing arrest data and occasional zero
values for arrests, the actual number of observations is somewhat smaller. This sample
includes any observation without missing data for ln(Violent arrests). The reported
coefficients tell us the correlation between the Alan Guttmacher Institute's (AGI) measure
of abortion and the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) measure of abortion in the raw
data and as we remove certain parts of the variation.

Each entry into the table gives the year, or combination of years, for the appropriate abortion rate for a 19 year old who was arrested in a given month in 1993 under the assumtpions that the
abortion decision is made six months prior to the birth and offending rates and birthrates are constant over the interval examined. For example, for someone who is 19 years old in 1993 and
arrested on January 15, 1993 may have been born as early as January 16, 1973 (implying abortion exposure 6 months earlier in July 1972) or as late as January 15, 1974 (implying abortion
exposure 6 months earlier in July 1973). A 19 year old arrested February 15, 1993 who was born in January must have been born in January of 1974, implying 1973 abortion exposure.

The unit of observation is a state by year by single year of age. The sample covers the period 1985-1998 for
ages 15-24. If data were available for all states, years, and ages, the total number of observations would be
7140. Due to missing arrest data and occasional zero values for arrests, the actual number of observations is
somewhat smaller. The dependent variable for the top panel is ln(violent arrests) while the dependent variable
for the bottom panel is ln(property arrests). The number of observations for the Violent arrests regressions is
6724 and for the Property arrests regressions is 6730. Estimation is weighted least squares. The rows labeled
"original" use the abortion measure that was used in Donohue and Levitt (2001), but for the extended sample
from 1985-1998. The rows labeled "with corrections" incorporates the changes described in the text (correcting
for cross-state mobility, the appropriate year for the abortion rate, and using place of residence instead of place
of occurrence of abortions). The rows labeled "IV using CDC" run weighted instrumental variables regressions
where the Alan Guttmacher Institute measure of abortion is instrumented for with the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) measure of abortion. All reported coefficients are multiplied by 100.

The unit of observation is a state by year by single year of age. The sample covers the period 1985-
1998 for ages 15-24. If data were available for all states, years, and ages, the total number of
observations would be 7140. Due to missing arrest data and occasional zero values for arrests, the
actual number of observations is somewhat smaller. The number of observations for the Violent arrests
regressions is 6724 and for the Property arrests regressions is 6730. Estimation is weighted least
squares. The rows labeled "original" use the abortion measure that was used in Donohue and Levitt
(2001), but for the extended sample from 1985-1998. The rows labeled "with corrections" incorporates
the changes described in the text (correcting for cross-state mobility, the appropriate year for the
abortion rate, and using place of residence instead of place of occurrence of abortions). The rows
labeled "IV using CDC" run weighted instrumental variables regressions where the Alan Guttmacher
Institute measure of abortion by residence is instrumented for with the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
measure of abortion by occurrence. All reported coefficients are multiplied by 100.
