                          Abstract


      The main thrust of this report is the development of a price
record that would provide a basis for the identification of the areas
of activity in the oil industry in which significant price changes
have occurred, iith expectation that this type of information could
serve as a useful ingredient in the policy—making process.

      The study presents estimates of the selling price of a barrel
of oil at three stages of operations of the industry -— the welihead,
the refinery and the end—use levels. Prices of individual classes of
petroleum products at refineries and at the end—use level were also
estimated. The price data are provided for benchmark years 1958, 1963,
1967 and 1972, as well as for 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 when crude oil
prices rose considerably. The estimating procedure is briefly described
in the study.

      The examination of the transmission of prices from market to
market within the oil industry shows that the steep rise in 1973—74
prices paid by end—users of petroleum products was due not only to
the large increases in crude oil prices but also to the sizable in-
creases in gross operating margins—labor costs, transportation,
profits, etc. —— at the refinery and distribution levels. In the
post—embargo years of 1975 and 1976, prices continued to advance but
at a slower pace. The refiners' gross margins in 1975, however,
declined somewhat; they rose significantly above the 1974 level in
1976. The marketers' margins made further gains in 1975, but exhibited
a decrease in 1976. knother finding is that during 1973—74 there was a
considerable narrowing in the price differentials among the various re-
fined products; in particular the price of residual fuel oil, which
averaged 20 percent of the price of gasoline in the decade of the 1960's,
rose to 52 percent of the price of gasoline by 1974. The narrowing
process continued in 1975—1976.
      The study includes a short discussion of the effects of rising
oil prices in 1973—1976 on the profitability of the petroleum industry
and the general price level.

        The propagation of Prices in the Oil Industry, 1958_1976*
                            AVRAM KISSELGOFF


        The ongoing inflation in the United States, which began in the
middle 1960's, has produced an extensive literature on both its causes
and remedies. Despite a great number of studies, some of them quite
enlightening, dealing with the factual, theoretical and policy aspects
of inflation, the problem appears to be now as intractable as ever.

        The inflationary process can be viewed generally as a propagation
of rising prices through the economy, with the rates of increase
modified by the structures of the sectors -and special forces affecting

them and resulting in an upward movement in the general price level.
        Numerous hypotheses as to the origin of inflation and the relative
importance of sporadic domestic and external events as well as persistent
long—run influences expected to play a role in its generation have been
formulated and tested, contributing considerably to the understanding of
the problem of inflation. Recently, particular effort has been made to
investigate the transmission of inflation through the economy. Most of
the emphasis in this area, however, has been on the macroeconomic level,
leaving the movements of prices from market to market within individual
industries largely unexplored. This study represents a modest effort to

 increase our knowledge of this process, as an aid in the development
of anti—inflationary policy measures.
     One can associate the current inflation in the United States with
the intensification of the war in Vietnam under President Johnson which

was largely financed through budgetary deficits and not conventionally,
through taxation. As a result, new pressures were added to already
high levels of utilization of the country's resources. Coinciding in

time, the rapidly expanding new social programs and various stimulative
measures in selected areas of economic activity had a tendency to
create in a short span of time considerable increases in demand for

services and goods without a corresponding rise in supply and thus

generate upward pressures on the price level. Since 1964 the monetary
policy of the country has been generally expansionary and with the
exception for a short—lived tightening on some occasions, it has
produced conditions that have validated the rising demands, particularly
through a generous extension of credit. There is also some evidence
that shortages of raw materials in recent years, partly due to very
long lead times on the supply side, have contributed significantly to
the sharp rise in wholesale and consumer prices. The development of
serious domestic market imbalances was accompanied by a series of
strong external shocks aggravating the current inflation. Among the
disturbances that should be noted for their serious impact on the
economy are: the devaluation of the dollar and the resulting rise in
import prices; the abnormally large purchases of agricultural com-
modities in the U.S. by the Soviet Union causing shortages arid driving
up food prices; and a drastic increase of oil prices by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

       The purpose of this report, which is a part of a larger study,
is to investigate the price behavior of the petroleum industry in
the 1958—1976 period, with the hope that it may help to shed some
light on the role of the 1973-74 sharp increases in oil prices in
the current inflation. To be more precise, the main thrust of this
report is the development of a price recod that would provide a
basis for the identification of the areas of activity in the industry
in which significant price advances have occurred, with expectation
that this type of information could serve as a useful ingredient in

the policy—making process.

                 The Markets of the Petroleum Industry in the U.S.

      Domestic operations of the petroleum industry are generally
divided into three major successive stages: the production of crude
oil, the refining of crude into finished products, and the marketing

of such products. Although the industry performs other functions,
such as exploration and drilling on the production level and trans-

portation of crude to refineries, these functions, however important

and indispensible they are, may be considered as services incidental
to production and processing of oil. This study will be concentrated
on the movement of prices through the three successive stages of the
petroleum industry.
      Despite the long—running      heated controversy as to whether the
petroleum industry is characterized by a low or high degree of com-
petition, it is difficult to contest the fact that there ar separate

and substantial markets: (1) at the welihead level, for crude oil;

     the study for publication.

(2) at the refinery level, for finished products, and (3) at the
end—use level, for finished products incorporating marketing
servicesj./ The nature of these markets, in which large and small
concerns participate, stems from the structure of the petroleum

industry. Although there is much integration in the industry, even
the most integrated companies are not self.sufficient.2/ Generally,
these companies produce more or less crude oil than they refine and
refine more or less products than they market. There are also
partially integrated concerns. Some of them produce crude nd
operate refineries, but do not possess marketing facilities. Some
of them refine and market, but buy crude from other firms. Moreover,

there are non—integrated producers of crude, non—integrated refiners
and non—integrated marketers. As a result, all the companies in the
industry in various degrees must have recourse to the markets in
which they appear as buyers or sellers or both in order to be able
to carry out their operations. Obviously, if all the companies in
the petroleum industry would be fully integrated and balanced, there
would be only one market in which finished products are sold to the
ultimate consumers. Since this is not the case, even the most in-
tegrated companies cannot fully by—pass the intermediate markets.
       Table 1 shows the extent to which the refineries of the top

eight companies are integrated between production and refining,
with the degree of self—sufficiency measured by the ratio of each

company's refinery input to its own production of crude. The table
also gives the companies' shares in total domestic production of crude.

/     Another way of viewing the petroleum industry would be as an industry
      composed of the three major areas of activity with markets for crude
      and products connected by refining as an independent industry.

      Joh.nM. Blair in his book, The Control of Oil, provides   an
 estimate of self—sufficiency of 71.7% for all eight top companies
 combined.-/ These companies also accounted for 50.4% of total
 domestic production of crude.

     According to Mr. Ted Eck of Standard Oil of Indiana, quoted
by The Twentieth Century Fund report, non-integrated companies

 accounted in 1974 for about 30% of refining and 29% of marketing.2/

These are relatively substantial markets where the output of non—
integrated companies and part of the output of integrated companies
are traded and prices are established. Since this study is concerned
with the movements of prices for the total output of the oil industry,

the same prices that prevail in these markets also will be considered

as representative of that integrated output moving outside the market
channels.


               Some Background Remarks about the Industry
     Crude oil is not a single product, but a range of products.

There are actually hundreds of different types of crude, reflecting

primarily variations in gravity and sulphur content. Correspondingly,
there are hundreds of wellhead prices.

     Historically, crude prices, though generally on the rise since
early 1940's, have shown a tendency toward stability in the short run.

A major factor underlying this tendency has been the restrictions



/ Companies that are integrated in at least three functions —
  production, refining and marketing — are  generally known as majors.

   "lesser majors" those companies which are important onlycalls
                                                            in one
   stage, although they still can be engaged in operations in other
   stages. Non—integrated companies are classified as independents.

imposed by various oil-producing states upon production of crude
in accordance with market demand as estimated by the Bureau of

Mines and the principle of avoiding physical waste (a concern that
can   be traced back to the turn of the century). In 1959 this con-
trol of domestic supply was   supplemented by crude oil import quotas.
The quotas were eliminated in 1974. These restrictive measures
generally operated efficiently over time as they kept the imbalance
between supply and demand for crude to a minimum.     It should be
noted, however, that some fluctuations in crude prices have taken
place even when there has been adequate total supply due to active

competition among individual companies in short supply. Generally,
companies desiring to purchase domestic crude oil post their prices
(on this level of operations prices are set by the buyers), but
significant quantities of crude are still sold at prices varying
from posted quotations due to special situations.
      According t,o the American Petroleum Institute, U.S. refineries
turn out from crude oil more than 3,000 products or gradations of

products. Customarily, these products and gradations of products
are grouped into classes of products. For 1972, the year before
the explosive upsurge in oil prices, the Bureau of the Census gives

the following distribution by major product classes of the value of
refinery output shipped and transferred between plants by all manu-
facturing establishments

/   The value of interplant transfers constitutes a very small proportion
    of the total value and therefore no significant error is introduced
    in the computations by ignoring it.

     It can be seen from the above data that the three most

important classes of products are gasoline, distillate fuel and
jet fuel. Together they accounted for about 76% of the total
value of domestic output. The percentage yields of refined
products from crude oil in the United States published by another

Federal agency, the Bureau of Mines, indicate that the same three
classes of products also represented 76% of the total physical out-
put of refined products in 1972, but with gasoline accounting for
46.2%, distillate oil for 22.2% and jet fuel for 7.2%. Because of

the great importance of gasoline among petroleum products, the
principal activities of the oil industry at the refinery and
marketing   levels are to a large extent related to this product.

     Since refining is a joint-product production of complementary
type and calls for Continuous operations of the plants at the

maximum level in order to keep costs to a minimum, the supply is
not easily adjusted in the short run    to   unexpected changes in demand
for individual products.
                                    —9—
     Moreover, because of the tax advantages that the petroleum
companies engaged     in crude production enjoyed in the   past, there
were obvious reasons for them to    keep crude output at the highest
level compatible with demand, thus putting upward pressure on the
refineries' capacity utilization./ With these factors present,
conditions were created generating intensiv competition among
the companies as they tried to dispose of the refineries' products
in order to maintain uninterrupted the flow of crude oil.

     At the refinery level there is a considerable amount of inter-

company product exchanges and product sales arising from supply and
demand imbalances. The non—integrated refiners generally sell their
products wholesale to resellers or directly to large buyers —
industrial   and commercial concerns, utilities, and governmental
agencies —   for   their own use. The integrated companies, to the
extent that they refine products in excess of what they can handle
through their own distribution systems, dispose of the surplus by
selling it to other distributors.

    Wholesale prices at which refiners sell their products are
customarily posted but also are often negotiated between sellers
and buyers. Prices charged to other refiners as well as to re-
sellers and large ultimate consumers usually vary with the trans-
action volume and when they are a result of contractual arrangements
also depend on many other considerations.

     The marketing system for refined products is large and complex.

Some products flow directly from the refineries to consumers,

others flow through a number of intermediaries. A general,
greatly oversimplified structure of the distribution channels
of the market for finished oil products, particularly in the non—
integrated segment of it, can be described as follows:1"

     1. Independent refiners generally make direct sales to other

         refineries (sometimes using brokers), to large non—refinery
         suppliers, to jobbers, to wholesale cooperatives, to large
         ultimate consumers (industrial and commercial accounts and
         governmental agencies) to retail dealers or only to some
         of them.21'

     2. The large non—refinery suppliers resell the products to
         jobbers and also directly to retail dealers.
     3. The jobbers and wholesale cooperatives resell the products
         to retail dealers and retail cooperatives.

     4. Retail dealers and retail cooperatives sell the products
         to the ultimate consumers (which include small agricultural
         and commercial accounts and cooperative members).

     The first three levels of distribution involve sales at whole-
sale prices. As the products move forward from one level to another,
closer to the ultimate consumers, prices generally increase, since



1/ The various deviations from the presented scheme are too many to be
   listed here.

2/ From the refineries gasoline often moves to terminals or bulk stations,
   from which it is reshipped in reduced volumes to service stations or
   large ultimate consumers. Large suppliers and jobbers may also own
   (or rent) bulk stations through which they distribute refined products.
                                  — 11 —
various costs, including those of transportation and profits, are
added on each level. At the retail level, prices for the same
reason obviously   increase further.

     The integrated companies, which produce the bulk of refined
products in this country, have their own marketing organizations.

These organizations are generally built around terminal and bulk
stations, from which refined products move through various links
down to the retail establishments which are owned either by the

companis or by the dealers or resellers, or are sold to large
commercial consumers. When the integrated concerns produce
refined products in excess of their own marketing needs, they
appear as sellers in the refined products market.

     Although in the past the custom in the petroleum industry was

to post prices, in practice the posted prices generally represented
only a point of departure for negotiations and often differed

significantly front the actual prices../ Recently, deviations from
the posted prices have been much less frequent.
     It is obvious from the even cursory discussion of the structure

of the petroleum industry and its main operations, involving thousands

of products and gradations of products, that the study of the price
behavior in the industry, in order to be manageable, would have to
be carried out on a high level of aggregation. An efficient way of

accomplishing this is to use a 42 gallon barrel as a yardstick for



1/ The tank wagon price (the price at which sales are made to retailers
   and some commercial consumers) is a key price in petroleum product
   distribution. It provides a basis for the determination of the
   jobber's margin and the retailer's margin. This price, however, in
   its turn moves upward or downward with changing market conditions.

the   measurement of overall oil prices on each of the three successive

stages of the industry's operations. Prices of (1) a barrel of crude
oil at the welihead, (2) a barrel of products at the refineries, and
(3) a barrel of refined products at the end—use level, together
should form a convenient framework for the examination of the propa-

gation of prices at any given point of time and over time. To be
valid, however, this approach requires that the composition of the
barrel's products does not show significant changes between stages
and over time. The evidence provided by the Bureau of Mines in the
form of annual percentage yields of refined petroleum products from
crude oil in the United States, Table 2, indicates considerable

stability in the composition of refined products produced./ How-
ever, to the extent that changes did occur in the composition of
the barrels on the three stages of operation over time, some in—
accuracy is introduced in calculations.

  The stability is even more marked if "kerosene" and "jet fuel"
               are combined. It should be noted, however, that since
   1972 the percentage of residual oil produced has been on the increase,
   reflecting the expanding domestic demand for this product in certain
   regions of the U.S.

             Since relevant and reliable monthly price information, necessary
        for the computation of the barre1s prices, in many instances 'was
        found to be lacking, annual data had to be utilized. However, even
        on the annual basis, the avaii,.able price data impose considerable
        limitations. Although this study is concentrated on price develop-
        ments in the 1973—1976 period, it would have been desirable to
        introduce data for a certain period immediately preceding these years
        in order to put the        developments   in the proper perspective. Unfor-
        tunately,    this was not possible to achieve. Because           of the unavail-
        ability of    the appropriate refinery price information for a number
        of   years in sequence, this        investigation covers, in addition to 1973,
        1974.    1975 and 1976.     only 1958, 1963, 1967 and 1972 for 'which the
        Census Bureau provides the Manufactures Census data necessary for the
        tabulation of average values per barrel of refined products and which
                                   — 14 —

can be considered as a good approximation of their prices.-/ The

          Estimation of Prices of Oil on a Barrel Basis at
        the Three Stages of Operations in the Petroleum Industry
     1. Crude Oil Prices
            In the computation of crude prices two series reported by
            the Bureau of Mines were employed:

             (a) annual totals of U.S. value of crude oil (including
                  lease condensate) at the welihead, and
             (b) the number of barrels produced during the corres-

                  ponding years.
            The annual value averages per barrel obtained on the basis
            of these two series may be considered as representative of
            the price levels of crude and, like the posted prices, they
            do not include transportation charges. Since 1973 and 1974
         prices of imported crude were much higher than those of

         domestic crude, composite prices of both (weighted by the
            corresponding quantities) were used in calculations.
         Before 1973 the refiner's acquisition costs (prices of
         crude plus transportation charges) of a barrel of imported
         crude and that of domestic crude were reported by the re-
            fineries to the Bureau of the Census to be about the same.
     2. Refinery Product Prices
         Because of the multiplicity of products processed by the



1/ The calculated average values (or census unit values) are equivalent
   to weighted averages of all transactions prices for the products in—
   volved where the weights are the amounts of individual transactions.

2/ For 1973 and 1974 prices of imported crude were provided by the
   Federal Energy Administation.

      refineries   out of crude oil, classes of products were
      used as a basis for the estimation of a barrel price of

      refined products. Basic information necessary for com-
      putation is provided by two sets of data:
      a)   annual percentage yields of refined petroleum products
           from crude oil in the United States as reported by the
           Bureau of Mines; and,

      b) annual values and quantities of shipments and inter—
           plant transfers of refined products distributed per
           class of products as reported by the Census of Manu-
           factures for the years 1958, 1963, 1967 and 1972.
           For 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976, for which annual values

           of shipments and interplant transfers per class of
           products with the corresponding quantities are not
           available, wholesale prices of the most representative

           product of the class of products at refineries in
           Oklahoma, as reported by the Platt's service, were
           used after adjustment for the level of the average
           value of the corresponding class of products in 1972
           (census data). These data allow the computation of
           annual average selling prices of the refined products
           yielded by a 42 gallon barrel of crude.
• By multiplying the percentage yields for any given year by 42
 gallons, a distribution of output of a barrel of refined

 products among its classes of products are obtained. The
 gallonage figures then are multiplied by the corresponding
 average values of shipments and interplant transfers per class
 of products. The sum of the tabulated values of the classes
                                  — 16 —


     of products represents the estimated price of a barrel of
     products at the refinery level.--" An example of such
     computations   is given in Table 3.




/ Afortest based on detailed data reported by the Censuses of Manufactures
        1958 and 1963 showed that the effect of changes in the composition
  of the two principal classes of products —  distillatefuel oil and
  residual fuel oil — on the average values of these classes of products
  was rather small (from 1% to 4%).

     3.    End—Use Prices of Refining Prices

            Petroleum products produced by refiners are sold either for
resale or to ultimate consumers. At the end—use level, utlimate con-
sumers purchase not only the part of the output that is sold directly
to them by the refineries, but, obviously, also the remaining part of
this output that reaches them through the intermediaries. The latter
part of output is acquired at higher prices, because these incorporate,

in addition, to prices charged at the refinery level, also the cost of
marketing. Thus, the basis for the estimation of the price of a barrel
of refined products at the end—use level should be the same barrel of

products as on the refinery level, without any change in its composition.
           On the end—use level, however, the same class of product of
the barrel is generally put to various uses by the final consumers. A
shortened list of these uses and the relative importance of purchases

by users in the total of each product class marketed in 1972 is as
follows:

     on the basis of the percentage distribution of the 42 gallon barrel
of refined products per class of products and the percentage distribution
of products within each class of product per use, it is possible to
obtain a corresponding distribution in gallons.
     When the appropriate prices charged to ultimate consumers are
multiplied by the estimated gallonage data within each class of products
and the values so computed are added up and then divided by the total
gallonage for each class of products, an average price for each class of
products at the end—use level is obtained. These average prices when

multiplied by the corresponding gallonage of classes of products will
yield values whose sum may be considered as a reasonable approximation
of a price of a barrel of refined products purchased at the end—use
ievei.1'

     Prices used in these computations, however, are not readily avail—

able. Because prices for the same class of refined products charged to
various categories of users are generally different as they vary with
the size of delivery, method of delivery, length of contract, market
conditions, etc., the search for the relevant price data necessitated
the use of all of its three major sources: government, industry and
consumers. As a by—product of this effort, it was possible to develop
time series of prices on an annual basis for the most important refined

products purchased by the final consumers.

     The table below presents the results of these computations. While
revealing, they are not surprising.



/ Since sales for export (and they represent rather a small proportion
  of total sales) are not taken into account explicitly, some error is
   introduced in the estimates (this will occur when prices for exported
   products differ from prices of the same products sold for other uses).

     The price of domestic crude which stood at $3.01 a barrel at

the welihead in 1958, declined to $2.89 in the following year, arid

then showed little change until 1967. From $2.92 in 1967 the price
was on the uptrend to 1971, when it reached the level of $3.39; it
held at that level in 1972.

     In 1973 the average price per barrel moved up to $3.89, a gain
of 14.7% over a year earlier. During 1973 two important developments
took place:   (1) the system of import quotas, in existence for 14
years, was abandoned on April 17 as the domestic production of crude
continued the decline from its peak in 1970 and the domestic demand

for petroleum products continued to expand rapidly, creating an in-
creasingly greater need for the importation of foreign oil, and (2)
the establishment by the Cost of Living Council (CLC) on August 17

of a two—tier pricing system exempting from ceiling prices "new oil'
(oil produced above the 1972 level) in order to stimulate production.

These developments in conjunction with the completely unexpected sharp
advances in prices of foreign crude and petroleum products in 1973 had
a profound impact on the U.S. oil markets.

     On October6, 1973 Arab countries declared an embargo on oil
shipments to the United States which was followed by large price
increases in exported oil. On October 16 the Organization of Petroleum

Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the posted price of a barrel of crude
oil, as measured by Saudi Arabia light, from $3.01 to $5.11 in June
and further to $11.65 in December 1973. It my be observed that as
recently as 1970 the price of the Saudi Arabia light was still at the
long—established level of $1.80)"

     The U.S. average price of imported crude for 1973 was estimated

 at $4.50 per barrel. In 1974 it increased -sharply to $12.40 or 175.6%
greater than a year before.

     With respect to prices of domestic crude, the effect of the
elimination of the price ceiling prices for "new oil" in August, 1973
was almost immediate and such prices moved rapidly to the world market
levels. Between September and December 1973, the price of "new oil"
increased from $5.12 to $9.51 per barrel. Between January and December
1974, the price per barrel advanced from $9.82 to $11.08. The prices
for old or controlled oil also were adjusted upward. They were allowed,

after CLC granted two significant increases in the first half of 1973,
to rise from $3.90 per barrel in August to $5.25 in December. In 1974
the price remained at the $5.25 level throughout the year.

     The average composite price of all domestic crude, "new" and
"old", at the well jumped from $3.89 in 1973 by 73.3% to $6.74 in
1974. In the post—embargo years of 1975 and 1976, the composite price
per barrel continued its advance. In 1975 it rose by 12.2% to $7.56
and in 1976 by 7.7% €o $8.14.

     Since the U.S. refineries in their production of refined products

have used, in addition to domestic crude, also a certain proportion of
imported crude, total costs of crude purchased, obviously must reflect

the prices of its two components. The data provided by the Bureau of
Census indicate that the refiners' acquisition costs (price of crude
plus transportation cost) for both domestic and foreign oil was about
the same in 1958, 1963, 1967 and 1972.

     This occurred in a period when prices for foreign crude oil were
significantly cheaper than those of domestic crude oil as evidenced
by the existence of prices on import "tickets" (allocations) that
                                  — 24

emerged under the quota system and which became stabilized at around
$1.25 per barrel)-"

     In the computations of the composite prices per barrel of both
domestic and foreign oil it was necessary to take into account the
changing proportion of imported crude in the total input of crude of
the U.S. refineries. This proportion which was about 12% in 1958 and
13% in 1963 declined to 11% in 1967, but rose to 19% in 1972. In 1973
and 1974 it was approximately 26% and 29%, respectively. In 1975 the
percentage rose to 33% and in 1976 to 39%, underscoring an increasing
reliance of this country on foreign oil.

     The sharp—rising share of foreign crude in the total input of
refineries combined with the sharply rising prices of such crude and
their upward pressure on domestic prices of crude is the basic story
of oil in the 1973—1976 period.

     Movements of crude prices in the years under consideration were

generally accompanied by concoinmitant movements in prices of refined
products, with price controls exercising a moderating influence on
their advance.

     Although refined product price levels are not very closely
related to prices of crude, they could be expected to reflect, among
other factors, the cost of the most important single input. The cost
of crude (excluding cost of delivery) to refineries in 1972 represented
about 71% of the F.O.B. price of refined products; in 1973 about 69%



/ Although the fact that prices of imported crude were lower than those
  of domestic crude during the period when import quotas were in
   operation is well known, it is not surprising that both imported and
   domestic crude were carried on the books of U.S. refiners (acquisitions
   costs) at about the then prevailing higher domestic prices.
                                 — 25   —


and in 1974 about 75%. In 1975 the cost of crude to-refineries
approximated 79% and in 1976 — 76%.      In 1958 and 1963 this pro-
portion was close to 70% and in 1967 about 66%.
       As can be seen in Table 5, the annual average price of a

barrel of refined products including taxes which stood at $4.93 in
1958 edged down to $4.89 in 1963. In the subsequent census years,
1967 and 1972, the price per barrel was higher over the preceding
census years by 25 cents and 39 cents, respectively. From $5.53

in 1972 the price jumped by 19.3% to $6.60 in 1973, with most of
the increase taking place in the last quarter of the year as price
controls on refined products were relaxed to permit refiners to pass
along at least in part the increased costs on gasoline, home heating
and diesel fuels. In 1974, refined products made a very large gain
of 79.2% reaching a level of $11.83. This increase, while sizable,
was still controlled. In 1975 the advance in price was only 9.0%
but still smaller than that in crude oil. In 1976 the price increase

was 9.3%, significantly greater than that of 6% in crude oil.
      On the end—use level, prices of petroleum products were on a
steep uptrend in the period covered by the four census years. In
1958 the price of a barrel of petroleum products at this stage of
operations was $8.88. It rose steadily in the subsequent years,
reaching in 1972 the level of $11.40. As a matter of fact, the
end—use prices increased percentage—wise in this period faster than
the prices of petroleum products on the refinery level. In 1973 and
1974 the end—use prices rose at an accelerated rate. In 1973 the

price moved up to $12.63, a gain of 10.8% from the preceding year.
In   1974 the price advanced sharply, by 43.2% to an average of $18.08

for the year. During these two years, however, the rate of increase
                                     — 26

was not as rapid as that on the refinery        level.   Was' it due to a

 stricter enforcement of price controls on the end—use level or to
 some other reason? It is an interesting question to explore.

        In the post—embargo years of 1975 and 1976, the end—use prices
 registered much smaller relative advances than in 1973 and 1974.
 In relation to prices on the refinery level for the same years, these
increases were also smaller, particularly in 1976.

                                   TA)S
        Total estimated indirect taxes on petroleum products were on

the rise during the period under consideration, advancing from $1.60
per barrel in 1958 to $2.49 in 1972. They increased to $2.52 in 1973
and further to $2.56 in 1974. In relation to the average value of

petroleum products, however, taxes per barrel, as can be seen in
Table 6, showed a considerable decline in 1974, reflecting a sharp

rise in petroleum products prices during this year and the fact that
the levied taxes are mostly based on rates expressed in cents per
gallon. In 1972 total indirect taxes per barrel of petroleum
products      Federal and States —   paid   on the refinery and end-use
levels represented nearly 28% of the average value of a barrel,
excluding taxes, sold to ultimate consumers. After declining to
approximately 25% in 1973, they were down to about 16% in 1974.
The decline in taxes was particularly great on the refinery level as
they dropped from about 13% of the average value per barrel in 1973
to 7% in 1974. Taxes per barrel paid on the refinery          level   in the

1972—1974 period were less than half of the taxes paid on the
marketers    level (Table 5) .4"

—1/   The estimates of taxes used in this study are somewhat smaller than
      actual, although the most important are included in these estimates.
      Because of the difficulties involved in the estimation of severance
      taxes paid on crude oil to States and local taxes paid on the petroleum
      products, these taxes were not included in the totals..

        Indirect taxes as a percent of petroleum products prices
continued on the downward trend in 1975 and 1976, reflecting the
fact that in the oil industry these taxes changed very little during

these two years while prices made further gains although much smaller
than in l973—l974.-1. As can be seen in Table 6, indirect taxes as a
percent of the average value of petroleum products on the refinery
level declined from their peak of 18.1% in 1963 to 5.7% in 1976. On
the end—use level, this percentage, after reaching its peak of 17.6%
in 1972, was down to 10.9% in 1976. These substantial decreases in
the relative importance of indirect taxes in the average value of
petroleum products can be of interest to policyrnakers when the

influence of indirect taxation on inflation of oil prices is considered.

                          of Operations, 1973—1976

     The temporal movements of prices, excluding taxes, in the three
stages of operations in the 1973—1974 period produced annual advances
in prices considerably greater than those in the preceding years. The
price advances in absolute terms in 1973 and 1974 at the crude level
were significantly smaller than on the refinery and end—use levels,

clearly suggesting that the petroleum industry was able not only to
pass the increases in crude prices to the other two stages of operations,

but also to enlarge gross margins in absolute terms.

     The effect of the differences in price increases on gross revenues

of the petroleum industry at the three stages of operations in 1973 and
1974 is indicated by the fact that an increase of one dollar in prices
per barrel was generating for the industry additional annual gross

revenues of about $4.5 billion (excluding imported petroleum products)
in each of these two years.

     In the years 1975—1976, year—to—year changes in prices on the three
stages of operations in the oil industry were less consistent then in

 the    1973—1974 period. In 1975 prices in absolute terms on the refinery
 level rose less than on both the welihead (including imports) level and
on the end—use level. In 1976 advances in the refinery prices were
significantly greater than on the other two levels. As a result, the
refiners who in 1975 absorbed a part of the price increase in crude, in
1976 were in a position to raise their gross margins substantially. The

marketers' record on the contrary, showed in 1975 greater price increases
than those registered by refiners and in 1976 significantly smaller. The

shocks produced by'considerable increases in prices of imported oil in
1973 and 1974 and much smaller increases in 1975—1976, put in motion

forces that within the operating constraints of the industry had clearly

unsettling effects on the price relationships between the three stages
of operations of the oil industry.

        Table 8 summarizes succinctly the record of relative price changes
in the three stages of operations in the petroleum industry. In addition

to yearly price changes in the 1972—1976 period, the table provides
information on price changes between the census years included in this
study and on the two-year price changes for   the embargo period of 1973—
1974.

       The largest two—year rate of increase in prices ws registered by
crude oil — 146.0%; next in its importance was the rate of increase in

prices of petroleum products at the refinery level — 113.9%, and
finally, the smallest rate of increase was exhibited by the refinery
products on the end—use level - 58.6%.        This pattern of rising prices
clearly implies that between 1972 and 1974 both the percentage margin
of refiners —   the   difference between the selling price of refined
products obtained from a barrel of crude minus the selling price of a
barrel of crude divided by the latter - and that of marketers have

undergone reductions, with the greater decline incurred by the marketers.
It may be observed, however, that in 1973 the rate of advance in prices
from the 1972 level was greater on the refinery level than the composite
price of imported crude and domestic crude at the welihead, suggesting
some enlargement of the percentage margin. The marketers' percentage
margin was down in 1973 and 1974.

       In 1975 and 1976 oil prices advanced on all three stages of

operations of the industry at much slower rates than in the preceding

two—year period. However, the pattern of increases in 1975, which was
similar to that in 1973 and 1974, showed a significant difference in

1976. In 1975 the year—to—year percentage increase in the price of a
barrel of crude (15.3%) was greater than that in the price of a barrel
of refined products on a refinery level (9.0%) and the year—to—year
percentage price increase on the refinery level was somewhat greater
than that on the end—use level (8.5%). In 1976, however, the largest
percentage price increase (9.3%) was on the refinery level arid the
smallest one (4.2%) on the end—use level. The rate of advance in
crude oil (6.0%), although greater than on the end—use level, was
substantially smaller than on the refinery level. These changes in

the price relationships between the three levels of operations in 1976
                                — 32 —

cannot be ignored if an explanation is sought for the-significant
changes that occurred in the oil industry's gross margins whether
expressed in absolute terms or percentages (See Table 11).
      Although a barrel is used in this study as a standard for

temporal and cross—section comparisons of the price levels in the
oil  industry, valuable information helping to understand the behavior
of this aggregative measure is obtained when the behavior of the
prices of the individual classes of products produced out of a barrel
of crude and sold on the refinery level and disposed on the marketing
level is also considered. Tables 9 and 10 given below contain price

data underlying the computations presented in Table 8. Moreover,
they contain prices, excluding taxes (an important element in the
structure of prices), which could provide an alternative basis for a
study of the movements of prices through the petroleum industry.

         Table 8 in its part based on individual classes of products shows
 that refinery prices of all product classesregisterea considerable,
 although quite uneven, gains in the 1972—1974 period, with some prices

 rising much faster than the composite price of the barrel of all

product classes. The largest advance during these two years were made,
when listed in the order of their importance, by "Residual fuel oil"
 (201%), "Distillate fuel Oil" (165%), "Kerosene" (156%) and "Gasoline"

 (94%). The "Other products" price was not included in this list be-
cause it was computed on the basis of only two classes of products,
liquefied refinery gases and asphalt, and thus was less reliably
estimated.

       The unusually large increase in the price of residual fuel oil

may be explained by a considerable expansion in demand for such oil
by electric utilities (as a substitute fuel for natural gas and high-
sulfur bituminous coal) and quickened demand for shipping services as
well   as   by the fact that the imported oil's proportion of this product
in the total supply advanced to a level of 65% in 1973 and was still
at 60% in 1974. As all foreign petroleum products, the prices of

residual oil increased sharply during these two years, pushing

strongly upward the country's average price for this product.
       A less rapid rise in prices was recorded by "Jet fuel" (81%),
and was mainly due to lagging prices. Since this product is sold
predominantly on the basis of long—term contracts, many deliveries
in 1973—1974 were made at prices lower than those that were then

currently charged.
       A smaller advance in prices was registered by "Lubricating oil"
(74%).

       It   should be noted that the largest increases in the refinery

prices occurred in 1974 and under conditions of eased price controls.

        In   1975 and 1976, as in the preceding two—year period, prices
of individual classes of refined products exhibited considerable
diversity in their rates of change.
        In 1975 —   the   year of mild winter and economic recession —   the
demand for petroleum products declined moderately below the 1974
level as decreases in the use of distillate oil, residual oil, liquid

petroleum gases and asphalt more than offset an increase in the demand
for motor gasoline (2%). The year 1975 was characterized by a relax-
ation of controls on allocation and prices of such products as kerosene,
distillate oil and residual oil.
        The largest advance in refinery prices on the refinery level for
the year was registered by jet fuel oil (45%), reflecting a sharp rise
in commercial kero—type jet fuel prices and the decline in their

importance of lower old contractual prices in the average of actual
prices paid during the year.
      Residualoil prices showed no change from 1974, as production,
on the uptrend since 1972, surged during the year and demand dropped
by 8%.
      On the end—use level, prices of all classes of refined products

recorded     gains in   1975. As on the refinery level, jet fuel exhibited
the greatest increase in prices (33.4%). The smallest rise in prices
(5.6%) occurred in lubricating oil.
      In 1976 the demand for refinery products was up (6.9%), reflecting
a moderate recovery of the economy and an unusually severe winter.

Since production of crude, on the decline since 1970, was further down.
during the year, the increased demand as in the past was met through
a greater import of both crude oil and refined products. .1/

/ Domestic refineries in 1976 operated at 81.0% of operable capacity
   as compared with 81.7% in 1975.
                                 — 37 —
       On the refinery level, prices of all classes
                                                    of refinery products,
with the exception of lubricating oil, increased faster than prices of
gasoline in 1976. The rates of advance in these products did not vary
much and were in the range of 10% to 12.1%. This compares with the

gain of 8.4% for gasoline (in 1975 the rate of increase was about    the
same   —   8.1%).
       On the end—use level prices of refined products on the average
registered in 1976 the lowest rate of advance since 1972 — 4.2%.     The
gain in gasoline prices for the year was also 4.2%. Other price

changes varied widely, with residual oil showing a decline of 1.7%
and jet fuel an increase of 10.8%.

       The price uPheaval of 1973—74 in the oil markets led to a

development whose importance cannot be underestimated.   As a result
of different rates of increase in prices of refined products, the

differentials among prices of most classes of products long in

existence, declined considerably in relative terms in 1974 (see Table
11). This phenomenon was found particularly pronounced when excise
taxes were excluded from prices. The historical pattern in relation-
ship to the prices of refined products, generally associated with the

degree of lightness of the product (the lighter the product, the
higher the price) while remaining basically little changed, showed
also a somewhat narrower spread in the levels of actual prices of
the major classes of products.

/ Computations are based mostly on realized contract prices which were
    substantially lower than new prices in 1973 and 1974. This accounts
    for a slower increase in the jet fuel prices during these years and
    the failure to show a decline .n the differentials in 1973 and 1974.

        On the end—use level, prices of individual product classes
                                                                   showed
 less spectacular increases in the 1973—74 period, a fact that was re-
 flected in the smaller advance in the price of a barrel of petroleum
 products   on the end—use level, compared with the price of such barrel
 on the refinery level.
        The largest gains   by the   product classes on the end—use level
were    registered, when listed in the order of importance, by "Residual
 fuel oil" (179%), "Kerosene" (87%), "Distillate fuel oil" (86%), "Jet
fuel" (81%) and "Gasoline" (48%). These increases altered somewhat
the historical pattern in the relationship among the prices            of most
classes of products as well as the spread among their actual prices
on the end—use level. The price differentials
                                               among the products,
considerably larger than those on the refinery level, in relative
terms decreased in 1974, but less than on the refinery level (see
Table   12).

       In the 1975—1976 period, prices of individual refined products
generally continued to rise at different rates on both the refinery
and end—use levels, with their spreads showing a tendency toward

further narrowing. The observed decline in differentials among
prices was under way since 1973 and it is reasonable to interpret
this development as a more than a passing change in the price

structure of refined petroleum products. Within the framework of
the regulatory conditions under       which      the oil industry was functioning
the fact that prices of most of the refined products were allowed to
advance faster than the     price of gasoline (which was also on the rise),
undoubtedly,    contributed to the improvement in the profitability of
the industry.

     The Effect of Cross—Section Movements of Prices on Gross Marins

       The data and comments presented above provide a useful background
for the examination of the cross—section movements of prices through
the three stages of operations of the petroleum industry for      their
effect on margins, although some passing remarks on this subject were
already made in another context.
       Table 13 shows that the refiners' gross margin ——    the difference
between the F.O.B. price of a barrel of petroleum products and the
F.O.B. composite price of a barrel of domestic and foreign crude,
excluding taxes -— which was $1.36 in 1972, expanded to $1.78 in 1973

and further to $2.72 in 1974. These increases in the margin meant
additional gross receipts for the refiners of about $1.9 billion in
1974. The margin as defined here includes the costs of transportation
of crude to refineries, other costs and profit (if
                                                        any) and actually
is the price of the refining function plus transportation costs. The
census data for 1972 indicate that the average transportation costs per
barrel of crude from the wells to refineries in the U.S. for that year
were 25. One oil industry source estimated these costs for 1973 at
25 and for 1974 at 3O. Table 13 also gives the refiners' margin for
the census years of 1958, 1963 and 1967, which was $1.37, $1.25 and
$1.50 in the respective yearsJ./ These data suggest no clear trend in
the margin in the 1958-72 period. It is well known, however, that the
margin is sensitive to cyclical influences../


1/   Refiners' margins net of transportation costs were estimated to be in:
                 1958 — $1.07               1972 — $1.11
                 1963 — $1.05               1973 — $1.53
                 1967 — $1.30               1974 — $2.42

      The marketers' margin on the costs of moving a barrel of

petroleum products from the refineries through the distribution
channels to the ultimate consumers (the marketers' function), ex-

cluding taxes, was $4.16 in 1972..L"     This   margin advanced to $4.28
in 1973 and $4.46 in 1974. The gains in margins in these two years,

much smaller than for refiners, brought to the marketers also much

smaller additional gross receipts: about $545 million in 1973 and
about $795 million in l974.-" In the census years of 1958, 1963 and
1967 the margin was $2.90, $3.22 and $3.64, respectively. The marketers'

margin was on the uptrend during the whole period considered in this

study. The most striking feature of the marketers' margin is its size.
In 1974, the cost of processing a barrel of petroleum products amounted

to $2.42 (refiners' margin minus transportation costs) while the dis-
tribution costs of the same barrel were $4.46.
      In   the 1975—1976 period, gross margins of the industry exhibited
significant deviations from their trend.
     On the refinery level the refiners' margin, on the rise since 1963,
decreased     from its peak level of $2.72 per barrel in 1974 to $2.51 in
1975. In 1976, however, it moved up to a new high of $3.14.
      On the end—use level the marketers' margin per barrel continued

on the uptrend in 1975, reaching a high of $4.76 in that year. In 1976,
however, it was down to $4.34.

      Any attemptto provide an adequate explanation of these changes in
the industry's margins would require a detailed analysis of the elements
of costs on the refinery and end—use levels. The pertinent information

/   Taxes excluded are indirect taxes paid on both the refinery and end—use
    levels.

for   this, unfortunately, is not made available by the companies for

public use. The fragmentary general industry data, however, suggest
that marked fluctuations in weather and general economic activity as
well as changes in regulatory conditions in the 1975—1976 period had
a notable but uneven effect on the supply and demand and prices of

individual products, with the corresponding impact on the industry's
gross margins. The clear example of this is the failure of residual
oil prices to advance on the refinery level in 1975 and a small decline
of these prices on the end—use level in 1976 while prices of other
products continued to increase.
      It is interesting to note that the oil industry's gross margins
in relation to prices on the refinery level showed a declining trend
in the 1973—1976 period. The similar trend can be observed on the
end—use level in the 1972—1976 period. The existence of these trends
is not accidental. It can be attributed to the failure of some com-
ponents of costs to increase proportionately with the increase in
crude, the largest component of total costs of refined products..i/
      From the sketchy discussion of the marketing operations presented
earlier and the fact that thecost of marketing (excluding the cost of
crude oil) is the largest component of the price of refined products

paid by final consumers, it is clear that any anti—inflationary policy
in order to be effective must consider not only the total price of the
marketing function, but also the cost of it on various levels of dis-
tribution. By locating in time an unusual rise in prices on the inter-.
raediary levels of distribution a basis is provided for anti-inflationary


1/ The distributors' margins and costs of transportation generally do
   not vary proportionately with the cost of crude.
                                      — 45   —


 actions,    if this would be found    justified.   This problem does not arise
on the refinery level, because crude generally moves from the welihead
to refineries without intermediaries.

        is important to stress that in the oil industry what counts is
        It
the absolute size of the margin and not the percentage margin or mark-

up, a concept that is widely used in the industry and commerce. •As a
matter of fact, when prices rose sharply in 1974, the percentage margin
declined considerably on the refinery level and the        marketing level,
while   the margin in absolute terms showed substantial enlargement. A
proportional increase in the margin would have meant an enormous rise
in profit. Historically, it is the concept of a margin in absolute
terms that has been in use in the industry.


                  Petroleum Prices, Other Prices and Profits
     The price explosion of 1973—1974 in the oil industry coincided in
time with the acceleration in the rate of inflation in this country and

thus could only aggravate the corrosive influence of the rapidly rising
general price level on the American economy.

     The principal annual price indexes presented below, however, do
not reflect clearly and consistently the strong advances in prices of
petroleum products, representing on the end—use level a mixture of
wholesale and retail prices.

     As can be seen in Table 14 the Consumer Price Index, All Items
 (CPI) and the Consumer Price Index, All Items,    Less   Petroleum Items
rose at about the same rate — 6% —    in   1973. In 1974, the advance in
CPI from the 1973 level was 11% or 1% faster than in CPI, Less

Petroleum Items. On the wholesale level, the price index of industrial
commodities (WPI, IC) including "Fuels" in 1973 and 1974 showed
significantly more rapid increases than the same index, excluding "Fuels".
     In the post—embargo years of 1975 and 1976 the consumer price index
with and without petroleum i,tems advanced at a declining rate, but in
each of these two years the rates of change virtually did not differ

from each other. The WPI, IC including "Fuels" and WPI, IC excluding
"Fuels" during these two years exhibited much smaller discrepancies in
their rates of advance than in 1974. These discrepancies were close to
that in 1973.

     The observed differences in impact of rising oil prices on the
general price indexes reflect not only changes in prices of refined
products but also the fact that:   (1) "Petroleum Items" in the CPI
have a weight of about. 4.5% and "Fuels" in the WPI, IC — 10.4%;        (2)

the cP1 is composed of prices of goods and services and WPI —      of
prices of goods only; and, finally,    (3) the bulk of petroleum products
sold at retail prices (for instance, gasoline) exhibited smaller rates
of increase than the bulk of petroleum products sold to the ultimate

consumers at wholesale prices (for instance, residual fuel oil) in the
1973—1974 period.

     The simple comparison of the indexes obviously does not allow the
taking into account fully of the direct and indirect effects of the

increases in prices of petroleum products on these indexes, some of
which may be expected to be felt with a certain time lag, particularly

under conditions of price controls. In special situations these effects
                                     - 48   —


were quite substantial as it is exemplified by a strong upward thrust
in the electricity rates due to higher prices of fuels.
        It may be observed that the CPI and     WPI, IC made   greater annual
gains than prices of petroleum products on the end—use level in the

1967-1972   period. The reverse was true in the two        subsequent   years
of 1973 and      1974.   In 1975 and 1976 CPI   and WPI showed   again larger
yearly    advances ti-ian those registered by the end—use prices of

petroleum products.
        The sharp increases in prices of crude oil and petroleum products
in 1973 and 1974 produced substantial advances in net income of the
petroleum industry during these two years. In 1975 net income was
about the same as in the preceding year, but moved up strongly in 1976.
The full import of these changes, however, is not easy to assess be-
cause of the usual limitations of the accounting data available for

public use. The published annual reports of the petroleum companies,
however,   can   still serve as a reasonable basis for statements of at
least indicative value on the profit performance of the oil industry.
     Two most often used annual profit rate series for the petroleum

industry developed on the basis of the reports were selected for this
purpose. These series are:   (1) Citibank's "net income after taxes on
net worth" of leading petroleum corporations (with net worth on January
1), and (2) Chase's net income after taxes on "average invested capital"

(includes preferred stock, common stock and surplus, as reported on
December 31). The behavior of the two series in 1967-1976, a period

considered long enough to      provide a perspective on the developments
in 1973    and 1974, was found, generally, to be quite similar despite

          of the 29 largest petroleum companies. This group of companies, according

          determining the probable experience of the overall industry." "1976

again, to 15.1%. The Chase shows for the corresponding two post—
embargo years profit rates of 12.8% and l3.a%)'
     The Chase's supplementary data published in the yearly "Financial

Analysis of Group of Petroleum Companies", although highly aggregative,
throws some additional light on the profitability of the petroleum
industry in 1973 and 1974. Annual after taxes net income changes of
the Group, which did not exceed 10% in the 1967—1972 period, jumped
by 70% to $11.7 billion in 1973 and further by 40% to $16.4 billion
in 1974. These sharp advances in earnings were accompanied by a
rise in the proportion of retained net income from 45% in 1972 to 65%
in 1973 and to 71% in 1974. As a result, net worth of the group in-
creased by 11% in 1973 and by 15% in 1974, much faster than in any
year of the 1967-1972 period. This unusual expansion of net worth
due to unusual increases in retained income had for its effect to
slow down the rise in the rates of profit of the group in 1973 and
1974. It should be also noted that despite the fact that net income
after taxes of the Chase's group of oil companies was virtually the
same in 1973 and 1975, the group's rates of profit for these two years
differed considerably —     in   1973 the profit rate was 15.5% and in 1975 —

12.8% —   obviously,   due to the difference in the levels of net worth.
Whether or not the ratio of net income to net worth adequately measures
the profitability of the oil industry (other measures of profitability
have also their shortcomings), its levels in the 1973—1976 period were
above those that were recorded between 1951 and 1973 as they reflected
an extraordinary upsurge of net income in this period.



1/ The repeal of depletion allowances (effective as of December 31, 1974),
   undoubtedly was a factor affecting the reported income of the petroleum

      The Chase's "Financial Analysis of a Group of Petroleum
                                                              Companies"
attributes the rise in net income in 1973 to: (1) the devaluation of
the dollar;    (2) inventory profits due to... "Petroleum price increases
initiated   by government"..,   and (3) the recovery of chemical and
shipping activities.

      In the "Financial Analysis" for 1974, the Chase writes on page 9,
"The large crude oil prices increases dictated by the governments of
several foreign producing countries in 1974 necessitated a substantial
rise in prices of petroleum products." And further, on page 12, it
states: "Along with other significant increases recorded on the group's
income statement, net income also grew, but to a much lesser extent."
"...More than one—quarter of the gain reflected inventory profits early
in the year that were the result of the dictated change in the price of
crude oil. Another important factor in the earnings rise was the sub-
stantially large contribution made by the chemical activities." It may
be observed, however, that sales of chemical products accounted for

only 6.5% of the operating revenue of the Group in 1974.
      The annual reports of the petroleum companies, regrettably, do
not contain information on net income stemming from domestic activities
related to production of crude, refining and marketing separately. They
also do not provide detailed information on costs of these activities.
And although it is not possible to estimate directly whether or not

there were significant increases in profit on each of the three stages.
of operations of the petroleum industry in the United States in 1973
and 1974, the sharp increases in prices of crude and petroleum products,
the noticeable widening of the refinery and marketers' margins and the

extraordinary rises in the aggregate net income in the two years under
consideration indirectly suggest that these developments are not incom-

patible with the notion that such increases in profit did occur in 1973
and 1974.

            A    rough measure of the oil industry's profitability is also
       provided by net income after taxes per barrel of marketed refined
       products. The table below contains the relevant data for the 1967—
       1976 period.

       The column    (7) in the table above clearly indicates that, when the index
       of net   income of the Chase's Group is divided by the index of all
       petroleum poducts marketed in the United States, there was an enctous
       rise in profit per barrel of such products in 1973 and 1974. Obviously,
       this result has only indicative value since net income of the petroleum
       companies is a product of various activities, some of which are not
       directly related to production and sales of crude oil and petroleum
       products in the United States. The net income series reflected mainly:
       (1) a decline in domestic production of crude observed since 1970

       (column 1):     (2) an    increased use of foreign crude in refining operations
                                 — 53 —

(column   2);   (3) an increased importation of petroleum products in
1973, but a reduction of such importation in 1974 as total demand
for oil products dropped;    (4) various foreign operations;   (5)

inventory profits due to higher prices, and (6) very large advances
in prices of foreign crude and petroleum products and much smaller
advances in domestic oil prices. It should be noted that operating
revenues other than crude oil and refined products accounted for

only about 15% of the total operating revenue of the group in 1973
and 1974.

     In the post—embargo years of 1975 and 1976 net income after
taxes per barrel of marketed products showed increasingly higher
levels in relation to 1973, but it was still below its all—time high
in 1974. The gains in these two years took place despite the decline
of the refiners' margins in 1975 and the marketers' margins in 1976.

                         Summary and Conclusions

     1. The study of propagation of prices in the petroleum industry
in the 1972-76 period is the main objective of this report. Unfor-

tunately, price data necessary to achieve this objective are not
readily available. While national averages of crude prices (rather
average values of crude) are directly provided by the Bureau of Mines,
the estimation of petroleum product prices at the refinery level had
to be made through the liberal use of census data for the census years

(a largely neglected source in this respect) and the selected repre-
sentative prices of individual products for the product classes
adjusted for the level of prices in the closest census year for 1973,
1974, 1975 and 1976. The prices on the end—use level were collected
from all accessible sources: government, industry and consumers.
                                    -54-
Because of lack of consistent and reliable data on a monthly basis,
the analysis in this study was carried out on the basis of annual
data.

        2. A 42—gallon barrel was used as a yardstick for the estimation
of prices on the three major stages of operations in the industry,

namely,     (1) prices of crude at the welihead (including imports),

(2) prices of petroleum products at the refinery level, arid      (3)

prices of petroleum products on the end—use level. The set of data
obtained, despite its limitations, can serve various purposes. The
estimated prices on the three stages of operations provides a basis
for the computation of the total value of sales on each stage. For
example, the cost of refined products to ultimate consumers was
estimated to approximate $71 billion in 1973 and $101 billion in 1974.

This type of information, when related to other variables, can be of
value in the economic analysis. Obviously, this set of data also
provides a basis for the study of temporal and cross—section changes
in prices.
     3. Prices of crude, after a decline in 1958, moved in a narrow
range in the 1959—1967 period. From 1967 to 1976 prices were on the
uptrend, with the largest increase registered in 1973 and 1974.
           Prices of refined petroleum products generally followed the
movements of crude prices exhibiting sometimes smaller, sometimes

larger absolute and relative changes by comparison with the prices
of crude in the 1958—1972 period. In 1973 prices of petroleum products
advanced at about the same rate as those of crude, but showed a signifi—
cantly slower rate of rise in 1974. In both these years — 1973 and
1974 —    absolute   increases in prices on the refinery level were sub-
stantially greater than prices on the welihead level.
                                   — 55   —


            On the end—use level, prices of petroleum products were

on a steep uptrend —    in   absolute and relative terms —   in   the period
covered by the four census years. They also advanced at a more
rapid   rate than prices on the refinery level during this period. In
1973 and 1974 end—use prices of petroleum products rose at an
accelerated rate. This rate, however, was not as fast as that           of
prices on    the refinery level, although it still produced somewhat
greater    increases in absolute terms.
            In 1975 prices in absolute terms on the refinery level rose
less than on both the wellhead (including imports) level and on         the
end—use level. In 1976 advances in the refinery prices on the

refinery level were significantly greater than on the other two levels.
As a result, the refiners, who in 1975 absorbed a part of the price
increase in crude, in 1976 were able to expand their gross margin

substantially. The marketers' record in 1975 showed a greater price
increase than that registered by refiners. In 1976 the price increase
was significantly smaller.
           The shocks produced by considerable increases in prices of
imported   oil in .1973 and 1974, and much smaller increases in 1975—
1976, put in motion forces that within the operating constraints of
the industry had clearly unsettling effects on the price relation-
ships between the three stages of operations of the oil industry.
        The price changes on the three stages of operations in 1973—
1974 suggest that the petroleum industry was able during these two
years not only to pass the unusual increases in crude prices to the
other two stages of operations, but also to enlarge them significantly.
In the post—embargo years 1975—1976, year—to-year changes in prices
on the three stages of operations in the oil industry were less con-
sistent than in the 1973—1974 period. The differences in behavior
                               — 56 —

on the three stages of operations can be largely explained by the
structure of the petroleum industry, the special forces that operated
on each of these stages and the varying application of price controls.
     4. An important development took place on the level of prices
for individual classes of petroleum products in the 1973—1976 period.
Although some of these prices advanced faster than the others on both
the refineries and marketers' stages of operations, prices of products

generally moved closer to gasoline prices, reducing considerably in
relative terms the differentials among them. The decline in differ-
entials was particularly pronounced on the refineries' stage of
operations. The implication of this development is that the narrowing
of the price spread during the period under consideration was a factor
in the improved profit performance of the oil industry.

     5. Refiners' gross margins in absolute terms, generally exhibited
small changes with no trend in the 1958-72 period. They showed
considerable increases in 1973 and 1974. In 1975 the margins declined,
only to rise to their all—time high level in 1976. The percentage
margins or mark—ups were characterized by the same behavior in the
1958—72 period, but after increasing in 1973, declined markedly in
1974. The percentage was down again in 1975. In 1976 it rose, but
was still below the level reached in 1974.
         The marketers' gross margins in absolute terms except for 1976
were on the rise during all of the period under consideration in this

study. They showed, however, substantially smaller increases in 1973
and 1974 than the refiners' margins in these two years. In 1975 the
marketers' margins were up while those of refiners were down. The
reverse was true in 1976. The percentage margins or mark—ups were
on the rise from 1958 through 1972, but were sharply down in 1973
                                — 57   —


 and 1974. They decreased further in 1975 and 1976. The failure of

many components of refined products costs to increase proportionately
with the increase in costs of crude (the largest component of total
 costs)along with the varying degree of strictness with which price
controls were applied on the refinery level and the end—use level
could largely account for the difference in the margin's behavior
on these two levels in 1973—1976.
     6. Although petroleum prices made considerable advances in the
1973—1976 period, the general price indexes, except the WPI, failed
to reflect them noticeably. With price controls in operation, the
inflationary effects of these advances, however, could have been
expected to be felt with certain lag. In special situations these

effects were quite strong as it is exemplified by a substantial rise
in electricity rates due mainly to higher prices of fuels.
     7. The price explosion in the oil industry in 1973 and 1974
and more moderate price increases in 1975 and 1976 were accompanied
by an upsurge in the profitability of the industry.
          Net income after taxes of the 29 largest petroleum companies
(the Chase Bank sample), which was at the level of $6.9 billion in
1972, jumped to $11.7 billion in 1973. It climbed to its all—time
high of $16.4 billion in 1974, but decreased to $11.5 billion in
1975. Net income resumed its advance in 1976, reaching a level of
$13.1 billion for the year.
          when profitability of the oil industry is measured by the
ratio of net income after taxes to net worth, the reported ratios
show levels in 1973 and 1974 significantly above those that prevailed
in the 1952—1972 period. The profit rates in these two years would
have been even markedly higher if there were no unusual increases in
                                      58
net worth, due to the unusual increases in retained earnirigs..i/ it
should be also noted that despite the fact that net income after
taxes of the Chase's group of oil companies was virtually the same
in 1973 and 1975, the group's rates of profit for these two years

differed considerably         in 1973 the profit rate was 15.5% and in
1975 — 12.8% —      obviously,   due to the difference in the levels of
net worth.
            A rough measure of the oil industry's profitability is also
provided by net income after taxes per barrel of marketed refined

products.
            Net income after taxes per barrel of refined oil products
consumed in the United States, after rising considerably in 1973
and     1974, in   1975 and 1976 was significantly below its extraordinary

level of 1974, but still higher than in 1973. It should be noted
that despite the fact that the volume of net income after taxes       in
1975 was slightly lower than in 1973, such income per barrel of oil

products    consumed was higher in that year (Table 16) and continued



/   A meaningful evaluation of the profitability of the industry should
    take into account not only the behavior of the net worth variable
    over time but also many other factors, including the fact that to the
    extent that the oil industry is investing in reserves of fuel other
    than oil such as coal, uranium, oil shale and timberland (and the
    industry's holdings of these reserves are considerable and increasing)
    and does not exploit them, it is in possession of assets which do not
    currently yield profit but whose potential profit increases inexorably
    with the rising value of the reserves.
                                    — 59 —
 to   advance in 1976. The increases of income per barrel of oil in
the l973—1976 period occurred despite the considerable and systematic
yearly decreases in production of domestic crude oil which, after
reaching a peak of 9.64 million barrels per day in 1970, dropped to
a level of 9.21 million in 1973 and then to 8.12 million in 1976 or

down by 1.1 million barrels per day in the 1973—1976 period..i/ it
may be also observed that if there were no elimination of depletion

allowances at the end of 1974, income per barrel of oil products in
1975 and 1976 obviously would have been significantly higher than it
was in these two years. A more rapid rise in prices of refined
products other than gasoline was a factor contributing to the excellent
over—all performance of the oil industry in the 1973—1976 period.

              The unavailability of the necessary accounting data makes it
impossible to estimate directly whether or not there were significant
increases in profit on the barrel basis on the three stages of operations
of the petroleum industry in the United States in 1973 and 1974.      How-
ever, such developments in these two years as the extraordinary rises
in    the   aggregate net income, the sharp increases in prices of crude
and petrolearrt products and the marked widening of the refinery and
marketers' margins, when taken together directly suggest that they
are not incompatible with the notion that increases in profit on the
barrel basis did occur on each of the three stages operations of the

industry.



/ when
  The decline in domestic production of crude took place in a period
       "new oil" could be marketed at the high world prices established
      by OPEC. The existence of strong income incentives to produce more
      crude oil in. the U.S. was clearly insufficient to overcome negative
      factors having a bearing on production of crude.
                                — 60 —


     8.   Because of the enormous strategic importance of oil in the
economic life of the United States, its notable size in the total
activity of the economy and   the   far—reaching impact of oil imports
on the balance of payments, a comprehensive program of price data

gathering embracing all major aspects of the petroleum industries'
activities, in addition to other information, is needed. Central
to this program should be the monitoring of price developments on

the three stages of operations of the industry, with particular
attention given to the marketers' function because of its large
costs and the existence of various levels of distribution through

which petroleum products travel from refiners to ultimate consumers.
These price data could be of great value locating in time any up—

surges in prices, should they occur, and help in the development of
a suitable anti-inflationary policy.
