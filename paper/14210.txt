                                             ABSTRACT

This paper proposes long-term insurance (LTI) as an alternative to the standard annual homeowners
policy using lessons from the mortgage market as a benchmark. LTI has the potential to significantly
increase social welfare by reducing insurers’ administrative costs, lowering search costs and uncertainty
for consumers and providing incentives for long-term investment in mitigation measures to protect
property. A two-period model illustrates situations that would make a long-term contract attractive
to both insurers and consumers under competitive market conditions.

    1. INTRODUCTION

             Catastrophes have had a more devastating impact on insurers over the past 15 years than

    in the entire history of insurance. Between 1970 and the mid-1980s, annual insured losses from

    natural disasters (including forest fires) were in the $3 to $4 billion range. There was a radical

    increase in insured losses in the early 1990s, with Hurricane Andrew (1992) in Florida ($23.7

    billion in 2007 dollars) and the Northridge earthquake (1994) in California ($19.6 billion in 2007

    dollars). The four hurricanes in Florida in 2004 (Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne) taken

    together cost insurers almost $33 billion. Insured and reinsured losses from Hurricane Katrina,

    which made landfall in the U.S. in August 2005, are now estimated at $46 billion; total losses

    paid by private insurers due to major natural catastrophes were $87 billion in 2005.

             The amount of coverage an insurer is willing to provide against risks in different hazard-

    prone areas partly depends on how much of its exposure can be transferred to reinsurers, and at

    what cost.      As a result of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, the price of catastrophe

    reinsurance in the U.S. increased significantly, rising 76 percent between July 1, 2005 and June

    30, 2006 and 150 percent for Florida-only insurers over the same period of time.1 In addition to

    this hard reinsurance market, insurers also faced increases in catastrophe risk estimates by

    modeling firms and more stringent criteria by rating agencies for measuring the financial

    strength of companies. Insurers responded to these changes by filing for significant rate increases

    in states subject to hurricanes. While only a portion of these increases were granted, a study

    undertaken by the Wharton Risk Center (2008), in conjunction with Georgia State University and

    the Insurance Information Institute, reveals that the average homeowner’s premium in Florida



1
    Between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2007, prices fell slightly but were still considerably higher than during 2005.
    Prices continued to fall at the January 2008 renewal, but are still considerably higher than they were at the beginning
    of 2005. See Guy Carpenter (2007 and 2008).


                                                              2
more than doubled in the past six years, increasing from $723 at the start of 2002, to $1,465 in

the first quarter of 2007.

       In coastal areas, premiums tripled or even quadrupled for some homeowners. While the

market price of insurance has significantly increased in those coastal areas (especially in

Florida), insurers are still concerned about earnings volatility and the possibility that their long-

term earnings will be negative in high-risk areas. Some insurers simply refused to renew policies

in coastal areas subject to hurricanes. In February 2007, State Farm, the largest homeowner

insurer in Mississippi, stopped selling new policies on homes and small businesses there.

Allstate, another giant residential insurance provider, announced it would restrict new

homeowners’ policies in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and New York City, refusing to

write policies in areas subject to hurricanes.

       This volatility in catastrophe losses and the market and regulatory reactions after the

2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons in the U.S. raises the following question for insuring

catastrophe risks in the future: How can one smooth the cost of coverage over time to avoid the

radical changes in the market environment from year to year that have recently occurred?

       To address this question, one needs to find ways to reduce insurers’ earnings volatility

while assuring people living in high-risk areas that their insurers will not simply cancel their

policies or double or triple their rates from one year to the next.

       There are also issues on the demand side. Prior to a disaster, many individuals perceive

its likelihood to be sufficiently low that they believe, “It will not happen to me” and are reluctant

to incur upfront cash expenditures to reduce future losses. As a result, they do not voluntarily

invest in protective measures, such as strengthening their houses or buying insurance. It is only

after the disaster occurs that these same individuals claim they would like to have undertaken


                                                  3
these actions (Kunreuther, 2006).      To illustrate, the Department of Housing and Urban

Development (HUD) reported that 41 percent of damaged homes from the 2005 hurricanes were

uninsured or underinsured. Of the 60,196 owner-occupied homes with severe wind damage from

these hurricanes, 23,000 (more than one-third) did not have insurance against wind loss. (U.S.

GAO, 2007).

       To address the problem of volatility of insurance premiums and homeowners’ failure to

protect their property against disaster, we propose in this paper a new approach to providing

homeowners’ coverage: long-term insurance contracts (LTI) rather than the usual annual policies

on residential property. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the need for LTI

and some of the reasons why a market for this type of coverage does not exist today. Section 3

provides lessons from the mortgage market that can serve as a benchmark for LTI. Section 4

applies concepts from long-term mortgages to insurance, and describes how fixed rates and

adjustable insurance contracts would function. Section 5 introduces a simple two-period model

to capture some of the features in designing an LTI contract. Section 6 raises questions for

future research and challenges for implementing this concept.

2. DEVELOPING LONG-TERM INSURANCE (LTI)

Our proposal for LTI is aimed at homeowners’ insurance for residential properties with reference

to protection against natural disasters. This coverage has always been provided in the form of an

annual contract renewable at the option of the insurer. In some cases, legislation has restricted

insurers from canceling policies or from charging premiums that reflect risk. For example,

following the Northridge quake of 1994, California, in effect, imposed an exit fee on insurers

that no longer wished to offer earthquake coverage, by requiring these firms to provide the initial

capitalization for the newly created California Earthquake Authority. Similarly, Florida


                                                4
    established a state-operated assigned risk pool—Citizens Property Insurance Corporation—as a

    stop-gap measure for those hurricane risks that the private insurers are unwilling to accept.2 As

    pointed out above, some insurers have recently restricted the sale of new homeowners’ policies

    in hurricane prone areas. Policyholders cannot help but worry that their existing coverage might

    be subject to unexpected cancellation or very significant premium increases, particularly if there

    is severe hurricane damage in the near future.3

    2.1. Need for Long-Term Insurance

           Short-term insurance policies foster significant social costs. Many individuals voluntarily

    purchase insurance only after a disaster occurs. If they have not collected on their policy for

    several years, they then cancel it, because they view it as a bad investment.4 Evidence from

    recent disasters reveals that consumers who fail to adequately protect their home or even insure

    at all, create a welfare cost to themselves and a possible cost to all taxpayers in the form of

    government disaster assistance. Under the current U.S. system, the Governor of the state(s) can

    request that the President declare a “major disaster” and offer special assistance if the damage is

    severe enough. The number of Presidential disaster declarations has dramatically increased over

    the past 50 years: there had been 162 over the period 1955-1965, 282 over 1966-1975, 319 over

    the period 1986-1995 and 545 during 1996-2005 (Michel-Kerjan, in press).



2
  Citizens, which used to be the insurer of last resort in Florida, has actually become the largest insurance provider of
   homeowners’ coverage in the state in 2007. However, Citizens does not have enough financial reserve to meet its
   liability in case of a major hurricane. Furthermore, Citizens’ deficit can be recouped against all other homeowner
   insurers operating in the state of Florida. See Chapters 2 and 13 in Wharton Risk Center (2008), for a detailed
   analysis of the market in Florida.

  In a survey of homeowners in flood-prone areas in Austria and Germany, Raschky and Schwarze (2007) found that
   distrust of insurance companies was one of the principal reasons for lack of interest in purchasing flood coverage.
4
  Kunreuther, H., W. Sanderson and R. Vetschera (1985). Following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, there was a
   significant increase in the purchase of earthquake insurance; This was also observed after the 1994 Northridge
   earthquake in California; in 1996 over 30 percent of the population had purchased quake insurance; but this figure
   has continuously decreased over time: it is estimated that only 12 percent of homeowners bought the quake coverage
   in 2006. (Insurance Information Institute, http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/earthquake).


                                                            5
    The development of LTI should encourage individuals to invest in cost-effective mitigation

    measures. Many homeowners do not invest in such measures due to myopia and budget

    constraints. They are unwilling to incur the high upfront cost associated with these investments

    relative to the small premium discount they would receive the following year which reflects the

    expected reduction in annual insured losses (Kunreuther, Meyer and Michel-Kerjan,

    forthcoming). If an LTI policy were coupled with a long-term home improvement loan tied to the

    mortgage, the reduction in insurance premium would exceed the annual bank loan payment. The

    social welfare benefits of LTI coupled with long-term mitigation loans over N years could be

    significant in that there will be less damage to property, reduction in costs of protection against

    catastrophic losses by insurers, more secure mortgages and lower costs to the government for

    disaster assistance.5


    2.2. Why Does a Market for Long-Term Insurance Not Exist Today?

             In his seminal work on uncertainty and welfare economics, Arrow defined “the absence

    of marketability for an action which is identifiable, technologically possible and capable of

    influencing some individuals’ welfare (…) as a failure of the existing market to provide a means

    whereby the services can be both offered and demanded upon the payment of a price.” (Arrow,

    1963). Here we shall discuss several factors which have contributed to the non-marketability of

    LTI for protecting homeowners’ property against losses from fire, theft and large-scale natural

    disasters. We discuss elements which affect both the supply and demand sides.

    Supply Side

             Today, due to political pressure, insurance rates are frequently restricted to be artificially

    low in hazard-prone areas. The result is that the risks most subject to catastrophic losses also

5
    Mooney (2001) has argued for long-term homeowners’ policies for this reason.


                                                            6
become the most unattractive for insurers to market. A second stumbling block, derived from

premium regulation, is that insurers are unclear as to how much they will be allowed to charge in

the future.

           Uncertainty regarding costs of capital and changes in risk over time may also deter

insurers from providing long-term insurance. In principle, of course, insurers could add a

component in their premium quotes to account for the costs created by these factors. The

problem is that the insurance regulator presumed to be representing consumers interests, may not

allow these costs to be embedded in the approved premiums. Furthermore, it is unclear what the

voluntary demand for coverage will be, given the resulting premium. In a real sense, a new and

less intrusive format for government regulation of insurance markets may be required if the

private markets are to be successful in dealing with time-varying risks and capital costs.

           Impediments to risk spreading across insurance firms are another source of market

failure. A key benefit of organized insurance markets is, of course, the ability to spread risks

across a large number of individuals and entities. To achieve this benefit, an organized market

must be available for reinsurance or for capital market access based on insurance linked-

securitization. The creation of such risk-sharing facilities, however, might face a fundamental

coordination problem, since simultaneously there must arise both primary insurers who are

willing to write policies, and reinsurers (or capital market investors) who are willing to provide

reinsurance protection. For some cases such coordination problems may be difficult for private

markets to solve alone. In other words, no one wants to be the first to enter the market, so a

critical mass does not develop.6 However, if there is a welfare gain that can be achieved through

coordination efforts, then government entities could help facilitate this by providing the


6
    See Ibragimov, Jaffee, and Walden (2008).


                                                 7
necessary conditions for this market to develop (Baumol, 1952). An extreme form of

coordination is for the government to require all insurers to participate in this market. One recent

example of such an intervention is the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) legislation of

2002. The development of a large terrorism insurance market in the United States post

September 11, 2001 can be attributed, at least in part, to the “make available” clause of the law

which required all insurers to participate in the market.

       One may ask why banks, which now provide long-term mortgages, have not played an

active role in packaging insurance to cover the physical asset. Two factors contribute to the

answer. First, until 1999, banks were prohibited from operating an insurance business. It was

only with the passage of the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which removed features of the

Glass Steagall Act, that insurance activities were allowed. Even then, bank entry has been

relatively slow as highlighted by the 2004 spin-off of the Travelers insurance division by

Citigroup just five years after they merged.

       Lenders may also feel they are protected by the first-loss position of the homeowner

given the homeowner’s equity in the dwelling. Lenders may also be able to transfer most of their

exposure to capital market investors through securitization. However, regulatory responses to the

subprime mortgage crisis may hamper the future securitization of high-risk instruments, with

particularly negative consequences for insurance-linked securitization. Earthquake, wind

damage, and flood risks may also be quite different in this regard. Homeowner’s equity may

protect lenders with respect to seismic risks, since most wood-frame homes are relatively

resilient to earthquakes. This is not the case for hurricane and flood risks, where a house can be

totally destroyed by these disasters. Indeed, most lenders do require homeowners to purchase

insurance in such high-risk regions.



                                                 8
    Demand Side

             Some homeowners may worry about the financial solvency of their insurer over a long

    period, particularly if they have the feeling they would be locked-in if they sign an LTI contract.

    It is noteworthy that the quasi-public California Earthquake Authority clearly states that there

    will be a range of major events for which it will not be able to pay all claims. Consumers might

    also fear being overcharged if insurers set premiums that reflect the uncertainty associated with

    long-term risks. Furthermore, those who have not suffered a loss for 10 years but have a 25-year

    LTI may feel that the premiums are unfairly priced. It is thus essential that the design of an LTI

    contract anticipates these concerns. The policy may also include specific features that allow

    contract terms to change over time.

    3. BENCHMARK FOR LTI: LESSONS FROM MORTGAGE MARKETS

    3.1. History of Mortgages in the U.S.7

             Until the Great Depression, long-term (20- or 30-year maturity) mortgages were rare.

    U.S. bank mortgages were commonly short-term (maturities 1 to 4 years) with the full principal

    due at maturity. In practice, the loans were regularly renewed at each maturity date. However, as

    the Great Depression took hold, banks refused to renew these contracts. The problem was that

    most bank depositors had the right to withdraw their funds on demand, and, fearing a bank run,

    were doing so. As a result, the banks did not renew the mortgage loans, using the funds instead

    to pay off their depositors.

             House prices were naturally falling under the dire depression conditions, so in most cases

    the loan balance exceeded the house value, giving the borrower further incentive to default. In


7
    This section is based in part on Jaffee and Quigley (2007). Aaron (1972) provides a useful discussion of the role
    played by various government agencies in the development of the U.S. mortgage market during the 1930s.


                                                            9
    addition, a vicious circle ensued, as falling house prices begot more mortgage defaults and

    mortgage defaults begot greater declines in house prices. To curtail this process, the federal

    Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created in 1933 to recycle the failing home

    mortgages (reminiscent of government programs now being proposed to deal with subprime

    mortgages); the HOLC also expanded the use of long-term, fixed payment, and fully amortizing

    mortgages in the U.S. The HOLC finished its business and was closed by 1935, a notable

    achievement. It was replaced by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), established under

    the National Housing Act of 1934, to oversee a program of home mortgage insurance against

    default and it continued to promote the use of long-term mortgages (Aaron, 1972).

             The entry of the FHA greatly facilitated the long-term mortgage innovation for at least

    two reasons: The FHA contract provided low-cost government insurance, ensuring its immediate

    and widespread adoption. And as it was adopted, the FHA contract became a de facto “standard”

    even for loans made by private lenders. It is plausible that the actions of the HOLC and FHA

    hastened the standardization of long-term mortgages in the U.S. by a decade or more relative to

    what private markets would have achieved.

             When it started in 1934, the FHA mortgage program had no counterpart in the private

    sector. There had been a private mortgage insurance (PMI) industry in the 1920s, but by the early

    1930s, all of these firms had become bankrupt—echoing the concerns created by the current

    subprime mortgage crisis for security guarantee insurers. A private industry was restarted in the

    1950s, and by the late 1970s, it had reached a 50 percent share of the overall market for insured

    mortgages. By 2006, the PMI industry had a market share of over 70 percent of all insured

    mortgages.8


8
    See Jaffee (2006) for a discussion of the PMI industry as monoline insurers.


                                                             10
     Following World War II, the Veteran’s Administration (VA) created a parallel program of

mortgage guarantees. As recently as the mid-1980s, these government mortgage insurance

programs were supporting over 20 percent of the overall market. A factor contributing to their

success was that FHA and VA mortgages became the raw material to create the GNMA

(Government National Mortgage Association) certificate, the first organized mortgage backed

security (MBS) in the U.S. The GNMA certificates were soon traded in very active security and

futures markets, helped in large part because the underlying mortgages were already fully

guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. In other words, the FHA program not only made the fixed

payment, fully amortizing, long-term mortgage the standard instrument for the U.S. mortgage

market, but it also was the origin of the entire U.S. MBS market.

       The history of the FHA program provides a very useful template for the creation of a new

long-term insurance market against natural disaster risks. First, it illustrates that in the absence

of coordination, private markets may fail to initiate an important financial innovation. The

government intervention was not only of value for its own sake, but it provided a variety of

external benefits, such as the FHA-based creation of the mortgage backed security market.

Jaffee and Quigley (2007) even suggest that the FHA program was instrumental in allowing the

reestablishment of a private mortgage insurance industry, since the success of the FHA program

demonstrated that it was feasible to insure fixed payment, long-term home mortgages. Second,

the later development and success of the private mortgage insurance industry indicates that a

government program will not necessarily crowd out private competitors. A key factor here, of

course, is the requirement that the premiums charged by the government program be actuarially

sound. It no doubt also helped that the FHA program has progressively been directed to lower-




                                                11
    income borrowers, thus providing a natural market niche with middle- and upper-income

    borrowers for the private mortgage insurance industry.

    3.2. Reasons for Long-Term (LT) mortgages

            LT mortgages developed because of the need by homeowners for liquidity given their

    budget constraints. They also had a desire for stable payments over time – planning ahead. LT

    mortgages – either fixed rate or variable rate – have various advantages. Due to their long

    maturity, the borrower does not face the risk that the full principal may be called on short notice.

    The loans amortize the principal in a series of steady payments over the life of the loan, so at the

    maturity date, the loan principal due equals zero. With securitization, both the interest rate and

    credit risk can also be transferred from the lender to a capital market investor. Intermediation by

    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac serves a similar purpose.

    Fixed-rate LT mortgages

            Fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) normally have higher interest rates than variable-rate loans

    to reflect the interest rate risk and the normal ascending shape of the yield curve. Interest-only

    (i.e. no amortization) mortgages will have still higher rates, since the homeowner has less equity

    at the end of any time period. Most mortgages allow the borrower an option to repay the loan

    under a variety of circumstances. The standard “due on sale” clause requires the homeowner to

    repay the loan if the home is sold. There is no fee for this, since it is designed to protect the

    lender.9




9
    There exist some assumable mortgages under which the homeowner can transfer the existing mortgage to a new
    home buyer under certain conditions.


                                                       12
     Adjustable-rate LT mortgages

             The interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have been systematically lower

     than comparable rates on fixed-rate mortgages. The spread has been as high as 3.5 percentage

     points, while it is currently at the relatively low spread of about 1 percentage point; the spread

     has averaged 1.8 percentage points from 1985 to 2007. As already noted, the normally ascending

     yield curve is one explanation for this positive spread. In addition, since ARMs impose the risk

     of rising interest rates on the borrower, lenders systematically offer discounts on ARM rates that

     are even greater than the yield curve would warrant.

             The ARM percentage of all originated mortgages has varied significantly over time,

     reaching almost 60 percent in 1987, but falling to only 10 percent at times during the last 10

     years. There is a substantial and growing literature on the factors that determine the borrower’s

     choice between the two contracts formats. It is apparent that all else being equal, borrowers

     would prefer the price certainty created by fixed-rate mortgages. However, two factors may

     induce borrowers to choose ARMs. The first factor is that ARM rates are generally lower than

     FRM rates. The second factor is that borrowers may believe they can predict future movements

     in interest rates, and therefore it is economically rational to take out ARMs when they expect

     market interest rates will soon be falling. There is evidence that the borrowers are somewhat

     successful in this regard.10

             States generally require a series of “caps” that limit the increases in the contractual

     interest rate and the payment amounts. The interest rate may not change by more than a fixed

     amount (e.g. 1 percentage point) and payments likewise cannot rise by more than a given

     percentage (e.g. 5 percent). The payment caps are usually applied in terms of annual changes,

10
     See, for example, Campbell (2006); Van Hemert (2007); and Koijen, Van Hemert, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2007).


                                                         13
     whereas rate caps may apply to both annual changes and lifetime changes (measured from the

     initial conditions on the mortgage). On most prime adjustable mortgages, and reflecting some

     state laws, homeowners facing a payment increase are allowed a “no penalty window” during

     which they can prepay without incurring additional charges. Many of the subprime mortgages

     found a way to avoid these windows, thus forcing the borrowers either to pay the higher

     premiums or to pay prepayment penalties.11

     4. APPLYING CONCEPTS FROM LT MORTGAGES TO LT INSURANCE

     4.1. Reducing the Uncertainty

              The loss distribution for homeowners insurance in hazard-prone areas of the country is

     not always well specified because of the infrequency of major catastrophes. The ambiguities

     associated with the probability of an extreme event occurring and with the outcomes of such an

     event raise a number of challenges for insurers with respect to pricing their policies. Empirical

     studies reveal that actuaries and underwriters are averse to ambiguity and want to charge

     somewhat higher premiums when the likelihood and/or consequences of a risk are highly

     uncertain than if these components of risk are well specified. (Kunreuther et al., 1995).

              Recent research shows that insurers are sensitive to the type of ambiguity associated with

     the likelihood of an event occurring. In a survey of 78 actuaries in France, Cabantous (2007)

     showed that actuaries would charge a much higher premium when ambiguity came from conflict

     and disagreement regarding the probability of a loss than when the ambiguity came from an

     imprecise forecast.

11
     Mortgage rates in the U.S. were also once limited by a variety of state usury laws, many enacted in the late 19th
     century. Federal legislation was passed in 1980 to preempt these laws, because it was increasingly evident that their
     major effect was to reduce mortgage lending, especially for higher risk borrowers who would normally be expected
     to pay higher rates. Interestingly, the federal legislation provided state legislatures the right to reenact their usury
     legislation, but no states did so.


                                                               14
       A web-based survey by the Wharton Risk Center in 2007 measured actuaries’ and

underwriters’ decision making under risk, uncertainty without conflict, and uncertainty with

conflicting information on risk estimates. Nine different scenarios were developed by crossing

three different types of natural hazards (fire, flood and hurricane) with three types of information

about the probability of a disaster with a loss of $100,000 (precise probability, imprecise

probability and conflicting probability), using the same type of questions as in the survey of

actuaries in France, as described in Table 1. Participants were asked to determine the annual

premium they would charge to cover a homeowner against a risk, assuming a 1-year contract and

a long-term insurance contract (e.g., 20 years) tied to the homeowner’s mortgage.

                                 TABLE 1. SCENARIOS OF THREE RISKY SITUATIONS

       Under a 1-year contract, insurers would charge on average $1,521, which reflects their

estimate of the expected loss plus a loading factor (administrative cost and cost of capital). The

mean annual premiums when the probability is ambiguous are 25 percent higher than when the

probability is given precisely. The source of uncertainty however does not affect insurers. As

shown in Figure 1 under the 20-year contract, the premium with precise probability is $1,589 (or

about 5 percent above $1,521, the amount which insurers would charge for a one-year contract

with precise probability). But aversion to ambiguity increases significantly has the length of the

probability estimates, mean annual premiums are 41 percent and 34 percent higher, respectively,

than when there is no ambiguity ($2,246 and $2,133).

      FIGURE 1. ANNUAL MEAN INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN DOLLAR, ACROSS NATURAL HAZARDS (N=78)


4.2. Fixed Rate LTI Contracts

       The above survey data suggests that insurers are likely to charge higher premiums for

long-term contracts than for annual policies because of the perceived uncertainty associated with

the risk. If the risk increases over time, then the LTI premium will be too low relative to what

the insurer would need to charge. If the risk decreases over time, the homeowner will want to

cancel her policy and purchase coverage at a lower premium. To address this issue we propose

that homeowners pay a penalty to the insurer if they opt out of their policy for any reason other

than home sale. This parallels the treatment of mortgages.

       To deal with insurers’ concerns with catastrophic losses during the length of the LTI

contract, there is a need for longer-term reinsurance contracts and alternative risk transfer

instruments such as catastrophe bonds. Today, reinsurance contracts are typically for one or two



                                                  16
     years. But alternative transfer instruments such as cat bonds are longer. In 2007 there were 20

     catastrophe bonds (of the 29 issued that year) that covered a term of 3 years or more.12 There is

     thus a need to assess the constraints on the availability and volume and contract length of

     securities that diversify catastrophe risk, how the use of these vehicles could be expanded to

     augment reinsurance capacity, and the role that the government can play to promote this market.

     4.3. Adjustable Rate LTI Contracts

             There will be a significant benefit to homeowners if their insurer will guarantee coverage

     for a fixed period (e.g. 15 years), even if premiums vary from year to year to reflect changing

     risks. In theory, premiums could decrease as well as increase. It is critical that the premium

     variations be based on an external index. For example, the Property Claims Services regularly

     tabulates the total insured losses from major events. This could help creating such an index, but

     regulators and policyholders need to be assured that it cannot be manipulated. There may also

     have to be caps on how much the premium can change year to year, just as there are limits on

     how much the interest rate and payment amounts can change annually on adjustable-rate

     mortgages (ARMs).

     4.4. Risk Exposure Indices and Capital Costs for LTI

     Risk Exposure Indices

             Whether the LTI contract uses fixed or adjustable premiums, one of the challenges will

     be in establishing a transparent mode of evaluating risk exposure for the long period of time

     covered. Catastrophe models developed by modeling firms have been the source of these

     estimates in recent years but controversies in the post-Hurricane Katrina period raise several


12
     The only catastrophe bond issued for longer than 5 years was a 10-year cat bond issued in 1997. For more details on
     the trends in cat bonds and other insurance-linked securities, see Michel-Kerjan and Morlaye (2008).


                                                             17
issues. Today catastrophe modeling and risk assessment face a number of informational

challenges as well as acceptance by the market and regulatory agencies. For example, the

Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology refused to certify RMS's

medium-term view of hurricane activity filed in 2006 that reflected the recent increase in

hurricane frequency and intensity being experienced in the Atlantic basin. RMS was certified

after resubmitting its model based on hurricane activity estimates using historical averages of the

number of hurricanes recorded since 1900 (Risk Management Solutions, 2007).

       The development of an index is important for transparency and to limit potential

problems related to asymmetric information between interested parties. In the case of catastrophe

risk insurance, one might contend that large insurance companies have more information about

hurricane risks in a specific region than a family living there who does not have the financial

resources that an insurer typically invests in modeling. Asymmetric information in favor of the

insurer can have important market implications as it might lead to a selection process where only

the low-risk individuals are fully covered at the equilibrium (Henriet and Michel-Kerjan, 2008).

       Risk evaluation, of course, is an issue common to most financial instruments. The recent

U.S. subprime mortgage crisis illustrates that capital market investors are willing to purchase and

hold new and risky classes of securities, especially if the risk is thought to have a low correlation

with systematic market risk and the risk-adjusted return is judged to be adequate. The subprime

investments turned out to be a large mistake, but the market meltdown has been primarily the

result of falling house prices, which have created highly correlated defaults. Furthermore, there is

a parallel record of investments in securitized auto, credit card, student, commercial mortgage

and other loans, all of which have been highly successful to date (Jaffee, 2008).




                                                 18
     Cost of Capital

             The second important element that enters insurance pricing is the cost of capital that the

     insurer has to access for its entire portfolio. The importance of including capital costs in setting

     premium for insurers to secure an adequate rate of return is often not sufficiently understood.13

     In particular, the prices charged for catastrophe insurance must be sufficiently high to cover not

     only the expected claims costs and other expenses, but also the costs of allocating risk capital to

     underwrite this risk. Moreover, because large amounts of risk capital are needed to underwrite

     catastrophe risk relative to the expected liability, the resulting premium is likely to be high

     relative to its loss expenses, in order for the insurer to earn a fair rate of return on equity and

     thereby maintain its credit rating (Doherty 2000; Wharton Risk Center, 2008)

             Each policy the insurer sells imposes its own capital burden. If an additional policy were

     sold without adding to the insurer’s overall capital, there would normally be a small increase in the

     likelihood that the insurer would default. Just how much of a change depends on the riskiness of

     the policy and its covariance with other policies and assets held by the insurer. The appropriate

     allocation of capital to a policy would be that amount required to maintain the insurer’s credit

     status; i.e., the addition of the policy and the accompanying capital would leave the insurer with

     the same credit status as before. We thus define a fair price for insurance as a premium that

     provides a fair rate of return on invested equity.

             There are other considerations that can dramatically increase the capital cost, notably the

     impact of double taxation. Harrington and Niehaus (2001) have simulated the tax burden over

     many parameters and show that tax costs alone can reasonably be as much as the claim cost and

     lead to further increases in premiums. When we account for all these factors (i.e., high capital

13
     Discussion in this section is based on Wharton Risk Center (2008).

     inputs, transaction costs and taxes), catastrophe insurance premiums often are several multiples

     of expected claims costs.

             There are parallels between insurance and mortgage lending with respect to the

     importance of incorporating the cost of capital in pricing decisions. The cost of capital for fixed-

     rate mortgages is a serious issue because bank depositors are generally unwilling to accept

     certificates of deposit with maturities beyond even 1 or 2 years. The main solution was the

     securitization of fixed-rate mortgages, which provided a highly efficient mechanism for the

     lenders to sell the mortgages.

             The cost of capital issue for long-term mortgages has been very effectively solved by a

     combination of ARMs that are held in lender portfolios and securitization which allows fixed-

     rate mortgages to be sold to capital market investors. The investors purchasing these mortgage-

     backed securities are primarily institutional investors, including mutual bond funds, pension and

     hedge funds, and insurance companies. Foreign investors, particularly Asian investors have also

     become an important investor class as a result of the U.S. trade deficit.14

     5. DESIGNING OPTIMAL CONTRACTS

     5.1. Relevant Literature in Economics, Insurance and Finance

             An extensive literature now exists on the optimal design of financial securities and

     contracts.15 The mechanism used to design securities in this literature assumes an economic

     decision-making environment with actions of the various economic agents affected by income,

     consumption and balance sheet constraints. Other features of the market, such as transaction

     costs, incomplete contracts and asymmetric information must also be specified. A solution is a

     contract that maximizes consumer expected utility subject to the above constraints. This often

     has a highly mathematical and abstract form. A real-world approximation to the abstract optimal

     contract is then proposed.

             To illustrate, debt contracts—in which the borrower promises to make specified

     payments, while the lender has the rights to certain assets if (and only if) the borrower fails to

     make the scheduled payments—can be derived as the optimal design when lenders face large

     costs of verifying the borrower’s ability to repay. The debt contract is optimal because the

     lender needs to verify the borrower’s cash flow only in the hopefully infrequent situations in

     which the borrower fails to make the scheduled payments. A recent example is the paper by

     Piskorski and Tchistyi (2006) which derives certain features of subprime mortgages as the

     optimal design when borrowers have highly uncertain and fluctuating income, and where direct

     observation of their consumption and saving is impossible. With this background, we now turn

     to a model for designing a LTI contract.

     5.2. A Two-Period Model for LTI

             Here we propose a simple model that highlights some of the tradeoffs facing insurers and

     policyholders who have the option to purchase either a long-term (LT) policy at a fixed premium

     for each of the two periods or two one-period contracts.                     For such a comparison to be

     meaningful, it is necessary that insurance premiums reflect risk.16 This is a key principle that has

     guided the recent Wharton Risk Center (2008) study.


16
     As stated in the 2007 Economic Report of the President, which for the first time devotes an entire chapter to the
     question of catastrophe risk insurance, “Effective insurance underwriting serves an important social function by
     tying the premiums and terms of insurance policies to the risks covered. When insurance prices reflect underlying
     economic costs they can encourage a more efficient allocation of resources. Efforts to keep premiums for insurance
     against catastrophe hazards artificially low, whether through regulation or through subsidized government programs,
     can encourage excessively risky behavior on the part of those who might be affected by future catastrophes.” (White
     House, 2007, Chapter 5, p. 122-123).

Assumptions

       We assume a competitive market in which insurers are homogenous and maximize

expected profits. Consumers are homogenous and buy full coverage for periods 1 and 2. Insurers

offer an LT policy or two one-period policies. At the beginning of period 1, experts provide a

single estimate of a disaster occurring in period 1; however, they are uncertain as to whether

there is a high (H) or low (L) probability of a disaster in period 2. At the end of period 1, insurers

and consumers both learn whether the probability of a disaster in period 2 is H or L.

       Z2L = (1+λ) p2LD + M + A with likelihood a                                             (1a)

       Z2H = (1+λ) p2HD + M + A with likelihood (1-a)                                         (1b)


Premium Charged by Insurer for LT Insurance

       For simplicity we assume that the discount factor is zero between the period 1 and period

2 costs. If the consumer purchases a LT contract then she will pay the same premium Z(LT) in

each of the two periods, which is:


               Z(LT) = ½{M +2A + (1+λ) [p1 D + a p2L D + (1-a) p2H D]}                         (2a)


The premium in (2a) reflects the upfront costs of marketing a policy, the administrative costs in

each period and the expected losses with the appropriate adjustment for the cost of capital.

       Consumers are given the right to cancel an LT contract at the end of period 1 but at a

cost. The insurer marketing an LT contract knows that if the probability of a disaster in period 2

is p2L then a consumer will be able to purchase coverage more cheaply from an insurer offering a

separate policy to cover losses in period 2. If the consumer cancels its LT contract at the end of

period 1, then the LT insurer wants to make sure it receives Z′(LT) in period 1 to cover its

administrative cost and cost of capital incurred in period 1 and its expected loss for period 1.

Since the consumer leaves at the end of period 1, the insurer is not liable for period 2, except for

the cost of capital held during period 1 for covering the potential loss to the insured in period 2.




                                                 23
The value of Z′ (LT) is:

               Z′ (LT) = M + A + p1 D + λ[p1 D + a p2LD + (1-a) p2HD]                         (2b)

where λ[p1 D + a p2L D + (1-a) p2H D] represents the cost of the capital to the insurer in period 1

to cover potential losses occurring in either period 1 or 2.

       The difference C = Z′ (LT) - Z(LT) can be viewed as a penalty cost imposed on the

insured who decides to leave the two-period contract at the end of period 1. More specifically:

               C = 0.5{M + (1+λ) p1 D + (λ-1)[a p2L D + (1-a) p2H D]}                         (2c)

λ can easily vary from 0.1 to 2 or 3 for truly catastrophe risks. In the latter case, the penalty cost

can be substantial.

       When does the insured have an incentive to leave at the end of period 1? The consumer

has to balance the price charged in period 2 under a two-period contract with what she can get

elsewhere for a coverage (Z2L) when the probability of a loss is p2L and there is a penalty cost C

specified by equation (2c). This condition can be written as follows:

               Z2L + C < Z(LT)                                                                (3a)

Equation (3a) can be written as

      C < ½{M + 2A + (1+λ) [p1 D + a p2L D + (1-a) p2H D]} – {M + A + (1+λ) p2LD}             (3b)

               C < 0.5(1+λ)[p1 D + (1-a)p2H D + (a-2)p2LD] – 0.5M                             (3c)

Let the RHS of (3c) be denoted as C*. Then if C < C*, the insured would have an interest in

leaving and purchasing a new policy for period 2.        If the insurer sets the penalty cost so that

C > C*, then the insured will have an incentive to stay for the second period and pay Z(LT) even

though she knows the probability of a disaster in period 2 is p2L.

     estimate the probability of a disaster in period 2 to be high (i.e., p2H) then the homeowner has no

     incentive to cancel her policy. On the other hand, if the experts estimate the probability of a

     disaster in period 2 to be low (i.e., p2L) then the homeowner may wish to incur the penalty cost of

     canceling the LT policy at the end of period 1 and search for another policy at a lower cost in

     period 2.




17
     The reason search costs are different is that when an insurer cancels a policy (S1) and when the insured cancels it
     (S2) is due to different market conditions. When an insurer cancels (for instance, because the insured is viewed as
     too exposed or in the aftermath of a catastrophe in order to reduce the insurer’s exposure in a given area) it will be
     much harder to find another insurer than when an insured cancels.


                                                              25
Optimal Choice by Consumer

       To determine the optimal choice by the consumer in period 1, one needs to determine the

total premium (Z*) if the consumer purchases an LT policy in period 1 and the probability of a

disaster in period 2 is revealed to be p2H and the premium (Z**) if the probability of a disaster in

period 2 is revealed to be p2L. More specifically:

               Z* = 2 Z(LT)

               Z** = Z (LT) + min {(S2 + C + Z2L), Z(LT)}



The expected cost E(Z) of an LT policy at the beginning of period 1 is thus:


               E(Z) = (1-a) Z* + aZ**


The optimal choice by the consumer is given by the following decision rule:


               Purchase two 1- period policies if Z(ST)<E(Z)
               Purchase an LT policy in period 1 if Z(ST)>E(Z)

Conditions Leading to Preference for an LT Policy

       In a competitive market there are several factors that will make an LT policy attractive to

consumers over two one-period policies:

       (1)   If the consumer believes that there is a high likelihood that the insurer may cancel

       the policy at the end of period 1 (i.e., a high value of q)

       (2)   If there is a high search cost for a new policy in period 2 if either the insurer cancels

       the policy (i.e., a high value of S1) or the consumer decided to look for a cheaper policy

       in period 2 (i.e., a high value of S2)



                                                 26
       (3) There is a high penalty cost to the consumer for defaulting on an LT policy (i.e. a

       high value of C)

       (4) The importance to the consumer of having stability with respect to her insurance

       contracts and peace of mind in knowing that she is fully protected against damage

       from disasters as long as she owns her home

5.4. The Benefits of Long-Term Insurance for Risk-Averse Homeowners

       We now demonstrate that risk-averse homeowners will prefer fixed-price LT insurance

over a sequence of one-period variable-price contracts if insurance premiums are actuarially fair

(premiums equal expected insurance reimbursements), and that consumers maximize expected

utility with respect to a time separable utility functions. We use the well known proof of Arrow

(1963) of the optimality of full insurance to motivate the analysis. For a one-period model, the

consumer maximizes expected utility (EU):


               EU = (1-p)U[W – pI] + pU[W – pI – (D-I)]
       where
                       p=      probability of the loss event
                       I=      the amount of the insurance
                       D=      the amount of loss if the event occurs
                       W=      initial wealth


The first term is the utility if the disaster does not occur, weighted by its probability. The second

term is the weighted utility if the disaster reduces wealth by (D – I) (i.e. the amount of uninsured

damage). The first order condition shows that it is optimal to purchase full coverage, making D=I

so that the utility in both states is the same, namely U(W – pD).




                                                 27
       Now consider a consumer with a 2-period horizon and a time separable utility function,

with the discount rate assumed to be zero. This can be written as:

                       U = U1[W, p1, I1, D] + U2[W, p2, I2, D].

U1 and U2 are the utility functions for periods 1 and 2 respectively, p1 and p2 are the event

probabilities for the two periods with the damage remaining the same whether the disaster occurs

in period 1 or 2 and Ii represents the amount of insurance purchased in period i.

       For this two-period horizon, we first assume the consumer is offered only a sequence of

one-period contracts. In particular, we assume the actuarially fair premium for period 2 is not

determined until the end of period 1. The consumer will still purchase full coverage in both

periods, since premiums are actuarially fair in both periods.

       Now assume instead, that a long-term contract is available at the beginning of period 1,

offering the consumer actuarially fair insurance to cover possible events in both periods 1 and 2.

Given the time separable structure of the problem and the actuarially fair premiums, it is clear

that the consumer will choose full insurance in both periods; that is, I1 = I2 = D. Further, given

the concavity of the utility function, the consumer will always prefer to be charged a fixed per

period premium (P) to cover the losses in periods 1 and 2 [i.e., P = .5 (p1 + p2) D] rather than a

variable premium for period 2. Figure 2 shows that the utility at P will exceed the expected

utility based on uncertain but equally likely premiums of P-ε or P+ε.

5.5. Social Welfare Implications

       Based on the two-period model, one can determine the social welfare implications of

providing long-term insurance (LTI) contracts to consumers in a manner similar to analyses

undertaken by Arrow (1963) in his path breaking study on the welfare benefits of insurance

markets. Although Arrow’s paper is written in the context of the market failure for medical

insurance, it is remarkable that almost all his points apply today to similar market failures with

respect to the provision of catastrophe insurance. For example, Arrow’s discussion focuses on

such issues as the welfare loss when insurance markets or contracts are incomplete, when there

are search costs and administrative costs, when there can be high variability in the risk level, and

when there is informational asymmetry or moral hazard. He also emphasizes the welfare loss

when the absence of insurance markets causes individuals to forgo activities that they would

otherwise pursue. Finally, in passing (p. 964), he mentions the benefits of “insurance with a

longer time perspective” that might have level premiums as illustrated by life insurance.




                                                29
       As pointed out in Section 3, LTI encourages individuals who are myopic in their thinking

to invest in cost-effective mitigation measures where they would not do so if they had purchased

one-period contracts. In addition, LTI reduces transaction costs from the consumer’s and

insurer’s point of view. More specifically, an insurer who offers an LTI policy has reduced

marketing costs (M) since this is only incurred at the time the contract is offered rather than at

each period. Similarly, consumers with single-period policies whose contracts are canceled at the

end of period 1 are able to avoid the search costs (S1) of looking for another policy by buying an

LTI policy. The expected social welfare benefits to the consumer based on our two-period

model are qS1.

6. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR DESIGNING CONTRACTS

       There are a number of issues and questions associated with the development of a long-

term insurance policy which have a direct impact on insurers and homeowners, and indirect

effects on other stakeholders, which require further research and analysis. Some of the issues

that need to be resolved include:

6.1. Nature of the Contract

       Long-term insurance could be offered by insurers in the form of a fixed-price contract

(FPC) for the full term of the policy (e.g., 20 years) or an adjustable premium contract (APC) at

a variable premium with guaranteed renewal for the term of the policy. The annual premium

would be reset based on an index that would have to be simple and transparent. Policyholders

will want the option to terminate the contract; mortgage markets provide examples of both good

and bad practices. On FPCs, formal arrangements to make the insurer whole through provisions

such as yield maintenance and defeasance (the two most common methods for dealing with

prepayment costs on commercial mortgages) may be necessary. On APCs, the borrower would


                                               30
want the right to terminate the contract without cost within a certain time period of a premium

increase notification (e.g., 3 months).

6.2. Understanding Terms of the Contract

       There is an opportunity for insurers to educate consumers as to the basis for the

premiums they charge by providing more detail on the types of risks that are covered and the

amount charged for different levels of protection. More specifically, insurers could break down

the premium into coverage against fire, theft, wind damage and other losses included in a

homeowners policy, and how the premium varied with the length of the long-term contract.

       It would be very beneficial for insurers to reveal this information, so that homeowners

will be able to make better decisions by understanding the nature of the contract and what

alternative options cost them. They will then be able to make tradeoffs between costs and

expected benefits – impossible for them to do today. Thaler and Sunstein (2008) argue for this

type of information disclosure by proposing a form of government regulation termed RECAP

(Record, Evaluate and Compare Alternative Prices). They recommend that the government not

regulate prices but require disclosure practices – not in a long, unintelligible document, but in a

spread-sheet-like format that includes all relevant formulas.

6.3. Protection Against Catastrophic Losses

       To protect themselves against possible increases in the probability of catastrophic losses

over time, insurers marketing FPCs would have to be able to invest in cat bonds or other forms

of securitized risks. Some type of government guarantee might be necessary to deal with both

insurers’ and policyholders’ concerns with respect to the ability to pay claims in the future

following a catastrophic loss. In principle, insurers could raise funds by issuing new equity under




                                                31
     these circumstances, but this is usually not a practical alternative.18 Another possibility is for the

     government to use an auction process to provide reinsurance coverage on an ex ante basis.19 Still

     another possibility is for the government to stand ready to make loans to insurers after an event.20

     The latter mechanism would allow the government to function as a lender of last resort to

     insurance firms just as the Federal Reserve does currently to commercial banks (and, in the case

     of Bear Stearns, to investment banks).

     6.4. Pricing LTI

            FPC premiums would likely be somewhat higher than APC premiums to protect insurers

     against an increase in the risk during the contract period. This behavior would be similar to the

     pricing of fixed-rate mortgages relative to adjustable-rate mortgages. One of the central issues

     will be how high the price of a long-term contract will be, given the ambiguities associated with

     the risk and the capital costs for covering catastrophic losses. Without some type of protection

     against large losses either through long-term risk transfer instruments (which currently do not

     exist) and/or a government reinsurance program at the state or federal level, the premiums for

     FPCs are likely to be extremely high so that there would be little demand for this type of

     coverage.

     6.5. Requiring Insurance Coverage

            Should insurance be required on all residential property? This would not be a radical

     change from the current situation – homeowners who have a mortgage are normally required by

     the bank which finances the loan to purchase coverage against wind damage for the length of the

     mortgage. Similarly, those in flood-prone areas are required to purchase flood insurance under

the National Flood Insurance Program if they have a federally insured mortgage. Insurance

coverage is required today for other consumer purchases. Today in all states, motorists must

show proof of financial responsibility on their automobile insurance policy, or bodily injury and

property damage liability in order to register their car.

       If all homes were required to be covered by a homeowners policy, insurers would be able

to more easily diversify their risks and hence reduce the likelihood of suffering catastrophic

losses over the length of the long-term contract. Another advantage of requiring homeowners’

insurance is that it will reduce the likelihood of liberal disaster assistance following the next

large-scale disaster since victims will be indemnified by their insurer. Some European countries,

such as France and Spain, have made insurance against catastrophe risks mandatory for all

(Vallet, 2004; Michel-Kerjan and deMarcellis, 2006).

       Whether long-term insurance will be attractive to insurers, homeowners, regulators and

other relevant stakeholders will certainly depend on the market conditions that come with it.

What is clear today, however, is that we need innovative programs for reducing future losses

from disasters that involve combined strengths of the public and private sectors. For insurance,

to play an important role in this regard, one needs to understand what a policy can and cannot do

as a function of the nature of the risk, the type of coverage provided by the insurer and the

premium structure.
