                         THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LIGHT OF

                                              ABSTRACT




      The paper surveys the macroeconomic literature             of the last decade with

emphasis on the implications of the New Classical and Rational Expectations
critiques for the Keynesian paradigm and the role of macro policies.    This
is done oo the.backgroundof the main macro developments of the l970'a and

1980's as well as the specific lessons of recent           high      (chronic)   inflation

processes.


      The    paper    takes   an      view emphasizing a synthesis that is
                                   eclectic

emerging in which the basic Keynesian view of the existence of market and
price co—ordination   failures as well as room for Pareto improving policy
intervention are maintained. At the same time the theoretical               underpinnings

are   undergoing substantial         change mainly due to a 'rational expectations'

(rather than 'new classical') reformulation.      The new Theory    of Econonic

Policy is      also   discussed and illustrated in terms of recent stabilization
experience.

I.   Introduction5




      Having been asked to give a paper in a    survey session in which the
first    two    papers are, respectively,   dsvoted to the two main competing

schools of thought    in Macroeconomics I take it that I may be expected to

serve    assome kind of objective referee. I would therefore like to start
with a certain personal disclaimer. Neither my upbringing as an economist
oor my occasional involvement in policy advice and more recently, in some
                                                       I have been 'brain

a sharp dent on one's image of the world, While viewed with  some suspicion

Lhe monetarlet model, especially in an international economics conteac, did

have a considerable appeal. Then came the New Classical      (not just the

 'Kational      Expectations')          having captured all the bright and

Theory and policy implications                has     become     obsolete snd       much     of what
rational expectations theory has taught us, in spite of its new classical
guise, is there to stay and make macroeconomics a very different discipline
from that which we were taught in our youth. But there is a basic sense in
which I must confess to having remained a Keynesian, albeit an eclectic
one. It is in the empirically based belief that there may be major markets
that do not always clear,              that co—ordination failures may          play a          major
role and          that a government may have an important Pareto improving                    role in
the co—ordination        game,     even when or precisely             because       its     behaviour
forms part of private agents'            information set.


       From the point of view of Macroeconomics                  as a tool for policy there are
two outstanding contributions which the rational expectations    revolution
has made  —  one is the Lucas' critique and ll that goea with it in applied
research.       The other, related one, is the basic              premise    that         individuals
make      the      optimal       use     of   information        available   to them, including
their perception of government policy behaviour. It is this, and not the
image of continuous market clearing and flexible prices, which seems to be
the basis for the new macroeconomic                 synthesis.


       What I hope to stress in the coming pages is the belief that past
sucessful    advances as well as the beat path for macroeconomics to follow in
the future is that which syntheaizes results of scientific                      obaervationa        of
the real world,        including the lessons of successes and failures of actual
policies,       within sound theoretical     constructs,   irrespective  of the
'school      of    thought'      from which they originote initially.               In the heat of
doctrinal       debates participants may            sometimes
                                               forget that the ultimate
objective of doing macroeconomics is to understand how the real world ticks
and to try,    to the extent that this is possible,        to improve   its

functioning.


       The   main ultimate          test for a theory is its ability to explain facts
andJor form the basis for successful policy.            This criterion should, of
course,  not be interpreted too narrowly.                        There may be deeper layers of

pure    theory      like microfoundation building blocks which need not be
individually        testable except through the testability of the aggregate
phenomena to which their logic leads. Moreover,                      even the   most pragmatic
policy maker (or the advisor tcho whispers in his                   ears) oho in practicE sore
                                                  —4—


often than not bases decisions on his own (or                    his    advisor's) intuition,
should benefit from learning of some new                         pure    theoretical     insights.

Intuition, after all.              is the complex embodiment       of    knowledge and       facts

processed         through        both formal      and informal 'models' 1)      However,     it is

difficult to envisage an  optimal   process  of search           'right'     for   the

theories         and building up of the 'relevant' policy intuition as
                           the
                              2) It is, incidentally, a two—way
anything other than eclectic.                                   process,

in which a certain policy, baaed on some vague intuition, may be
successful, and will only later receive the supporting theory.


       The history of Macroeconomics              abounds with examples of
                                                             major advances
aade      into    the                           theory by researchers from
                           mainstream of macroeconomic
outside a given school of thought challenging one of its major premises.
tikewime  there are examples where a doctrinaire approach by the priests of
a dominant creed has hindered progress for a while.       In Macroeconomic

Theory as elsewhere there are fashions to which one is expected to conform.
Also, the quest for analytical rigour, in itself a virtue,       may sometimes
keep certain   observed  phenomena   or  proven policy tools  out  of bounds of
acceptable  theory.  Examples are  the  fall and  rise  of   the   wage— price

spiral     ,   which will be discussed below,           or the use of price controls or the

roie,     more generally,           of incomes policy as a legitimate supply management
tool.      tikewise        there    are examples of policy tools that have been totally

discredited because of failing,                  for good reason, in one context while they

might     work in a different setting.              An example of the latter is the use of
the exchange rate as a atabilising device.



1)   To this one must add Keynes's famous dictum about the practical                       men who
     "are usually the slaves of some defunct economist" anyway.


       Here      is    a   brief diversion       — Paul Samuelson has told a story about his
2)

     teacher Gotfried Haberler defending being eclectic against                      the   critics

     of    eclecticism           with their      more exciting views:     "how do we know that

     Mother Nature is            not   herself     eclectic?"     Quoted     in P.     Samuelson,

     "Policy Advising in Economics",                Challenge,   March—April 1978.
                                          —5—


        Finally,   while there is a sufficiently broad body of macro theory that
is commonly relevant in most economies,  it is important to keep in mind
that macroeconomics is about an economy with certain markets and a certain
institutional set—up and the structure of markets and institutions      may
differ substantially for different economies. This is an obvious point, but
it is one that tends to be overlooked especially since the distributions of
macroeconomists      and of macroeconomic problems across countries are not the
same.


    In the coming sections we shall illustrate some of the issues mentioned
here fro's developments   in certain selected areas of macroeconomics, Our

examples will by no     means do       justice    to    the   subject nor        do    I   feel
sufficiently       updated    to    deal with cli       sub-branches      of    this    highly
proliferating field.3'        Moreover, there are by          now   a   number of       recent
surveys  that go into the various areas  in greater detail.  I will sttempt

to illustrate a particular point of view and concentrate mainly on the
product and labour markets where most of the issues and debates have arisen.
The next section briefly reminds us that there are important contributions
of the 1950's and 1960's that have remained almost intact. We then go into a
discussion of price adjustment and the behaviour of product markets (Section
III),  followed by a discussion of what can be learnt          from extreme

inflationary phenomena (Section IV). Section V takes up labour market
behaviour and the problem of persistent unemployment. Section VI discusses
some of the recent developments in the theory of               economic policy         and   the

paper ends with concluding remarks.




3)      It   is
             enough to         be away from academia for a very few years,                 which
happens to be my case,         to    lose track    of    some of        the    more    detailed

developments.       I will,        try to use one object of my detour,
                              however,                                  high
inflation and its cure, as a  practical laboratory experiment to  illustrate

some of the doctrinal issues.

11.   The Constructive Synthesis of the 1950's and 1960's


     Having come through the turbulent developments of macroeconomicsof the
last 15 years, with the field still licking its wounds but just about
beginning   to   build up a new synthesis,        it is worth remembering

that there is a considerable body of macroeconomic theory, based on sound
empirical  basis and having important policy content, which evolved out of

what used to be called the Keynesian neoclassical synthesis of the pre 1970
era.4 Much of what goes into the Theory of household and firm demand for
consumption    investment and financial assets, the basic ingredients of
                    ,




the TSLM part of the standard textbook aodel, are still with us, live and

kicking. The advent of rational expectations has certainly left its mark

there       too,        but   the    essence      of    the      careful portfolio choice approach

developed by Milton Friedman (1957), James Tobin (1958) and many others
has survived the onslaught in terms of both eapirical relevance and
theoretical         rigour.


     I would single out two contributions that impressed as being a sost
successful war of attacking a major building block of Keynesian Theory,
taking it          entirely apart and             replacing        it    with what looked like          a

path—breaking             advsnce.          The     first       one was Milton Friedman's       permanent

income hypothesis in consumption theory (not to ignore ,Modigliani's life
cycle  parallel).  It was the most beautiful example of a seeming empirical
paradox (the differing consumption patterns coming out of time series and
cross  section  data) resolved by a truly innovative idea, the distinction
between permanent and transitory income. This has led to a whole body of
literature  with further developments involving intertemporal optimization,
the introduction of liquidity constraints and many other fruitful                                insights

(for        a recent survey see Hall,                   The particularly notable aspect of
                                                    1987)   .




this branch of macroeconomic                  research is the very close connection and
snthesis            achieved        between theoretical             rigour    and   empirical     testing

thereof,       Needless to           say,     the      policy implications          for   taxation and

savings policy were immense.


4)     An     early      major      theoretical        synthesis        was given in Patinkin's     (1965)

      book.
                                       —7—


      The other example is Tobin's liquidity preference        theory,    which has
laid the foundations for both theoretical and empirical research on the
demand for money and other financial assets. In the same vein one might
mention the various contributions     to the theory of investment demand,

including both the neoclassical model (Jorgenson,        Eisner,   etc)    and    the

later developments following on Tobin's q—theory, All of these have been
major improvements on the basic Keynesian model, they were based on sound
theory,      were empiricallly testable and had substantial policy relevance.
The way they were developed was in the best scientific tradition. Finally,
the advent of rational expectations      did introduce some major change in
these parts of the Keynesian Model but did not have the devastating

implications    that other parts of macrotheory   subsequently underwent.




III. Price adjustment and the Product Market


     The           of empirical and theoretical analysis of the process of
             subject

price adjustment could provide one of the most fascinating topics for the
study of the history and sociology of economic science. Wage stickiness
and price inertia have been a centerpiece   of Keynesian thinking, their
existence or non— existence    matters for key policy issues such as the

validity of a short-term inflation   unemployment trade—off or the way to

fight high inflation.    It  has   been  the main object of attack cf the

new-classical    school, the fiercest attack on    Keynesian   Theory     since   its

inception.      For    a time the attack looked so successful that the baby was
just about thrown away with the bath water.


     Looking back over the last decade one can say that the intensity of the
attack    was     not   justified    on    either    empirical    or   even

intuitively—theoretical grounds. At the came time it found the object of
attack weak in its analytical micro—foundations, snd for that reason had
far reaching implications for the way macroeconomic theory and econometric
research was to proceed henceforth. The main shift of emphasis is in the
                                                     —S-


way available information is processed by the individual market agent,
including its perception of expected government policy. This widening of
the information structure is perfectly legitimate in its own right. The

problem only was that this shift caine under the heading of an all out
attsck on elements of a real world image of wage and price adjustment which
can neither be rejected outright nor were they substituted by more valid
behavioural      models.    The final result seems to be that some                of    the     basic

empirical  findings have remained intact, yet considerable effort is being

put into the reconstruction of a tbeory which,   once the shift in tbe
information        struèture         is        made,     will show most of        the     previous

applications to      tand     firm. This is a worthwhile effort, no doubt,                    but   it

is   important      to     stress     that       in     some major parts at least,      the policy

implications       remain     unchanged          although    the   theoretical   grounding is
undergoing major           change.        It    is     almost as   if,   like in the well known

anecdote,   a person suffering             from bed—wetting goes to       tiLe   psychiatrist       to

be cured.  His perception of life undergoes dramatic change. He continues
to bed—wet but he is now perfectly happy or, at least, is no longer ashamed

of it.


     The   wage-price mechanism    that was prevalent in the empirical and

theoretical literature in the U.S.  by the beginning of the 1970's and which
became     the    subject of attack by tucas (1973), Sargent and Wallace (1975),
and others centered around the       Phillips curve in a way that made it

particularly vulnerable to attack not only on rational expectations
grounds.  By using a rather crude closed economy labour cost—plus
specification for the product market no distinction was made between wage
and price adjustment. Thus the Phillips curve for wages bccsme the Phillips
curve  for prices which,    of course, performed miserably once the oil and

commodity shocks came,  quite apart from the tucas (1976) critique about
the vulnerability of seemingly      'structural' parameters to the change in

policy regime.
                                                                  —9—


       To clarify the point one may use one of seversl versions of the Philips
curve that was popular in the early 1970's.  Suppose we stsrt from a version
of what was originally s wage adjustment equstion under disequilibrium:


           w = an-1 + (l—o)ir -                               (U_UN)                            (1)


       where w              =   rate     of nominal wsge inflation
                     it     =   rate of          inflation
                     C = expected rate of inflation                        (to be specified)
                     U = rate of unemployment
                     UN = natural rate of unemployment.


       Next assume a closed economy and fixed profit margin.                                    Thus
                itw                             (2)


and (1) becomes


                it    = an-1 + (l_c)itt -                     (U-U')                (1')


       Now assume a policy rule for the (expected) rate                                    of   growth of   money
(is)




           p=po+pt(U-UM)                                                            (3)


We get


           it    =        ait...1   +   (l_a)itt         +   c(p—p°)                (4)
       where c =


       In equilibrium                   p   =   it   =   C=    jSN and   U =   U'



     Suppose now that there is a demand short-fall leading to temporary U >
UN and it <      p
             in (1'). By temporarily raising p >pc,.     is raised above                   it                  C
enabling a fall in U back to U' while it gradually rises back to p°. This
could have been a typical application of the Phillips curve by the beginning
of the 1970's. The possibility of a short-term trade—off between inflation
and unemployment hinged on the assumption that a > 0 (wage inertia)                                     or,    if
a = 0, that expectations (C) are adaptive.
                                                     —   10 —




      Now suppose that a = 0 and that                    C    is rationally expected   We now know
that in the formation of expectations the policy rule (3) will be taken
into account and that in that case no trade—off exists,    The only thing

that monetary policy can do in that case is to correct for unanticipated
shocks to prices or output, because any other change will immediately affect
C along with              it    (the policy ineffectiveness      hypothesis).   Moreover,   the   use
of    an    empirically              estimated  equation like (1') for policy evaluation ia
faulty when          rz        is not independent of the policy rule (the Lucas critique).


     This critiquewaa indeed very powerful. The problem, however, is that
equation (1') failed to explain inflationary developments in the 1970's and
also failed as a policy tool for reasons that have very little to do with
the  rational expectations revolution. The main fault was the mental switch
from a wage adjustment equation (1), which may have remained valid as a

disequilibrium relationship for the Labour Market, to a price equation (1')
which is an invalid description for the Product Market,    especially  under

supply shocks. In other words, it is equation (2) which may be at fault.


     Anybudy who was living and working in an open economy would have known
long ago that a workable product market specification of price adjustment,
replacing equation (2),    should at least have to involve import prices as

part of coats and aggregate supply. If,                       in fact,   prices are determined in
terms      of
           an aggregate                   demand and aggregate
                                              supply equilibrium for an open

economy, the rate of inflation could be specified more generally        as a

linearly homogenous    function of wages, the  exchange rate and money,  plus
other remaining real shock variables.


        Consider a conventional open—economy commodity market                       (with
intermediate              imports)
      Aggregate Supply (AS)                      and Aggregate      Demand   (AD) balance

gives:

5)    One step further was to turn the equation on its head, replace (uu')                         by
        y and obtain what wss to become the Lucas "output-supply equation".

     To        basic underlying price adjustment equation one could append
              the
                                                                 variables
adjustment rules for one or more of the three underlying nominal
(e.g.   monetary accomodation for a, or a crawling peg rule for e, plus
some version of a Phillips curve for w), as one of several ways for
showing inertia in price adjustment.


     Consider again the case of a closed economy (a2 = 0, a1 + aa = 1).
Suppose w = ru., (full COLA, leaving out expectations and unemployment

effects).         We get


        =     (1-a)      rt_ + a3p + v     (7)


    Here a          aoney        growth rule     is the price mover and inertia comss from
COLA.


        Now conisder the open economy and assume, for simplicity


        w =   ØrL       + (l—Ø)t (wage adjustment)


        p =       oiL1 +   (1-a)c (monetary accomodation)


We get:


         =    Or—1 ÷ (1—6)r + v                      (8)



where         =   aj$    + a3a



Here an exchange rate rule will be the prime mover of inflation.


        While there are econometric              issues that we are ignoring here,   the fact

remains that various versions of the price equation (6),                in combination with

a wage adjustment equation like (1), have been successfully used in numerous
empirical  studies  of inflation in open economies in the 1950's and 60's.
It has also successfully survived the analysis of differential inflation
rates        in industrial countries during the great supply shocks of the
                   the

1970's, a test which the above mentioned simple Phillips    curve(l')   could

       I   shall return to the open economy version of the inflation                     equations
below, since they can he used to illustrate many of the pointa of the debate
about monetary policy that has mainly been raging in the U.S. with exchange
rate policy replacing monetary policy in an open economy context. But first
let ua return to the closed economy                  'mainstream'


       Two major implications          appeared in the Lucas et al attack on the
Phillips      curve      paradigm.        Once you assume that agents form their
expectations taking the               observed policy rule into account the only
short—term     trade—'off      there       may   be between inflation and unemployaent is
that due      to    suprise     or     unanticipated           inflation.     Monetary    policy
intervention       ia   thus bound to            be    ineffective    in     changing output and
employment even in the short—run, and a change in                     a     monetary rule will
show immediately in a correspondingly changed                         rate of inflation.     The
second implication,          wh± ch   in   a way has a much more profound      effect on     the

way    econometric      results       are    to be interpreted for policy, is the Lucas
critique.  What seems to us in the data as a structural parameter in the
iuflationary  process  may be entirely dependent on the policy rule snd by
properly incorporating  the agents' perception of that rule the parameter
is no longer policy invariant.


     It could be argued that any sensible user of an econometric model who
was fully aware of the underlying theory, must have known, from the early
days of modern Econometrics and long before Lucas, that when there is a
change in policy regime over the sample period, a suitable shift in the
relevant estimable parameters must be allowed for. Lucas's important
contribution in the context in which it was made, however, highlighted the
particular problem arising from the shift of emphasis in the specification
of    rationality       in   expectations        behaviour,      which hitherto tended         to
concentrate        on
                  backward looking, adaptive, and therefore largely policy
invariant, expectations.   The relationship between theory, econometric
testing thereof         and    the     formulation       of macro policy models underwent a
major change.


       It is somewhat ironic that the attack had a major effect
                                                              on the way
applied research would be conducted henceforth but actually failed in what

was its major objective,             the policy ineffectiveness           hypothesis.     Barro'e

(lO7B)     empirical     results,       purporting        to   show that only unanticipated
changes in money effected output were larer                    refuted by  Gordon   (i9$2)

Mishkin     (1983) and others and the existence of nominal price rigidities was

recently successfully tested for               the    U.S.      by     Poterba,       Rotemberg      and

Summers      (1986),        The    empirically based Keynesian intuition,                that nominal

wages and prices are usually sticky,                 baa so far withstood the             attack     and
has   thus     left    the     equilibrium,         flexible price,        new classical approach
without the devastating practical              policy implication that it had originally

set out as its main objective.


      If     wage     and    price    stickiness       seems    an     empirical     reality but its

existing theoretical              foundation was       not     sound        given the new
                                                                          enough,

rational expectations emphasis,     the                  research effort was to turn in the

direction of divorce of the applied proven results from the existing theory

and finding a way of a new marriage of nominal rigidities with a rational
expectations        approach.         There have been many     important  theoretical

developments,   only           a     few of which I will mention here, but :t must be
obaerved that in terms of a real world image or actual policy implications
so   far   this   is   an   effort  in the direction of bolstering the

aicrofoundations,           and not one   of    any     revolutionary         policy implications
relative       to what        'intuition' would tell us anyway.               Only the future will
tell whether there is more to come.


          The first authors to develop models in which nominal rigidities                         can   be

squared       within a        forward—looking        rational     expectations         approach      were

Fischer (1977) and Taylor (1980),                   Tn these models         the     nominal   wage      is

preset so as to achieve, on expectation, constant real wage and employment
while prices are flexible and monetary policy for the current period is
not kno:rn by the wage earners in advance. Thus a money shock may increase

prices and output through a temporary reduction     real wages. By having
                                                                     in

nominal  wages predetermined for a longer period than policy and with wage

setting staggered for different groups      in the labour force, nominal
intertia and a case for activist monetary policy are established.




6)    Arelated development with possibly more profound implications for the
theory of economic policy is the rules versus discretion debate. That will
be taken up in section VI.

        While        these     models gave an             ingenious     justification        of   nominal

rigidities          within a rational expectations setting                of   wage contracts,         it
does     raise a number of problems not the least of which is the exogeneity of
the contract length with respect to the rate of                         inflation,    We      know from

empirical observation that even with coats of adjustment of contracts the
contract length as well as the nature      of   staggering may     change

auabatantially  with the rate of inflation (an example of changing COLA
arrangements         under high inflation is mentioned below).



        Quite apart fI'om the development of various modela of                       wage adjustment
in     the    labour market which will be further discussed in Section V. ,                        there
has been a aubatantial independent atcempt to refine the analysis of price

rigidity in the commodity market, The point of departure in aost of these
models        is    a monopolistic competition model, primarily developed by
Blanchard          and Kiyotaki  (1986)',    in which there are n :mperfectly
competitive          producers       of    differentiated       products (and         likewise        for

subsequent          application there are          m   imperfectly        competitive suppliers of
labour). With all producers                facing identical        demand curves        in    terms    of

their        relative price    P./P and aggregate M/P the equilibrium is one in
which all          P±Pbut the price level P is above the perfectly competitive one
with h/F           and output below that and therefore Pareto inferior. This
structure          implies an externality for any             individual producer          wanting     to

reduce his              own price,
                          which will make for nominal rigidity if there are
even small "menu costs" of adjustment and thus an increase in money will
show more in output than in prices.


        Other        developments         in the   same       general    ares have to do with more
refined models of price staggering structures                      such as Calvo's(1982),          which
he     hassubsequently also applied in an open economy exchange rate
adjustment setting (1983). Then there is a whole new recent branch of
research,            mostly connected         with the Blanchmrd—Kiyotakimodel, in which


7) For an account of this model and related recent literature see also                                the

survey by Blanchard (1988), which is extremely useful.   See also a survey

of work on micro—foundationsby Rotemberg (1987).    There has been a new

classical reconstruction effort based on imperfect information, including
intertemporal            substitution in labour supply, which will not                  be    taken    up
here.

the   issue        of   equilibrium      staggering or synchronisation          is taken up as a

co—ordination problem among firms.


        A particularly illuminating recent model is that by                      Ball and Romer
(1987).          The paper introduces       the possibility      of multiple equilibria, both

full adjustment of prices              in
                                  response to a money shock and complete

non-adjustment   as well as intermediate  equilibrium degrees cf nominal price

rigidities   for    a   distribution    of   shocks.    There   is   "strategic

complementarity"           in   that     one     producer's     incentive    to adjust prices is

greater if other, producers            adjust.       Also,   heterogeneity   among price setters
leads to equilibria in which some prices adjust and others do not.                         Welfare

will be higher in the low rigidity equilibria which implies a role for
government intervention to move the economy to a superior equilibrium.
Practical application for policy implies that incentives        for firms to sign

shorter      contracts     or adopt greater indexation will lead to an equilibrium
with less         nominal rigidity.  Such intervention could also be temporary or

apply       to    only part of the market. The rest of the time (or the rest of)
the private sector will take of itself. Below we shall see the relevance of
synchronisation or co—ordination devices as well as the real life relevance
of multiple equilibria in the context of a high inflation                        process    in   an

open economy.


        will end the discussion in this section by returning to the issue of
        I

empirical aggregate  price adjustment equations under sticky wages and
prices.    With the advent of rational expectations, we have seen, the wage
price spiral of the 50's and 60's became passe. Moreover,   under the new

classical economics view of the world it just could not exist. In theory at

least, that        in practice the aggregate
                     is;                                           price     equations,    inertia

inclusive, were working quite well.8.

zoo for the first time in his life. Upon being shown a zebra he looks at                          it

for     a   long time.          Finally he        utters:     "an animal with     white and black

stripes.. .hm.. .such an animal does not existfl'.

      Using     the above    mentioned monopolistic competition model Slanchard
(1986)    has    worked out      an ingenious wage and price staggering model with
rational expectations to reproduce an inflationary spiral equation (7) for
a closed economy. The essence of the model is the assumption that prices
are set in advance for two periods and likewise wages, except that these
decisions are staggered (the device that is used is to have one of the two

set in even periods of time and the other in uneven       periods).   This

asynchronization       is
                      enough to give a rational expectations solution price
adjustment equation which looks very much like equation (7), derivable from
the more simple minded backward looking pre- revolutionary days.


       In an  interesting extension of this model Zeira (1987) points out the

the    empirical     question of         how   importsnt   the    inertia coming from that

component really is.           I believe it is the actual backward linkage provided

by    institutional         arrangements       (such as COLA or the
                                                        rrswling peg) which
determine the extent of actual inertia. That linkage is, of course,     not

independent of the rate of inflation, as we shall srgue again below.

interesting  but the brief empirical application purporting to show that
there wss no inertia in the Israeli infistion appears erroneous.

IV.   What      can   be learnt from hyper- or high—inflationexperiences?


     The inflationary experience in industrial countries      to which the

mainstream macroeconomic theories and policies are usually applied has to do
with rates of inflation that may run up to no more than 1-2 percent a month
on average, sometimes extending over a few years, with occasional higher
peaks (of say 2—5 percent in one month)                      Even    that   rate haa       only been
reached in times of extreme shocks like in the 1970's. Now consider rather
brief historical experiences in which the monthly rate of inflation on
average  increased by between 20 and 1000 percent a aonth (with monthly

peaks up to the crder of 30,000 percent).                     Would there      be    any      hope of
learning anything fron the latter about the former phenomenon?


        Asking that        question sounds           about     the   same as asking a hydraulic
engineer wh°ther he could learn aomething about the laws of motion of water
in    the       Miasiasipi River from observation of the frictionleas                  free drop of

water in the highest of Niagara Falls.                   Yet     that is     just    what Sargent
(1982)  purported to do in what was otherwise an extremely illuminating
studs of the hyperinflation experience:     "The four incidents     we have

studied  are akin to laboratory experiments   in which the elemental forces
that cause and can be used to stop inflation are easiest to spot" [Sargent
(1982), op. cit.].     That much may in part be true. The trouble is that
this experience was also used by Sargent to deny the role of persistence
and self—sustaining   momentum,   observed in the ordinary garden variety
inflation.        Extreme laboratory experiments can teach us                 a     lot of     things
about       a    theory when stretched      to the limit but one has to be very careful

about the transfer of such             lessons       to where        they   just do     not    apply.

Hyperinflation          resembles     an   explosion         in which ordinary money stops to
function and contract length dwindles to single days and                          sometimes    hours.

It    is    precisely a       phenomenon in which               inertia     almost by definition

disappears.


        Since the crisis of the 1970's we have had a number of                      new     laboratory
cases,  in some Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, and more lately
Mexico)'° and in Tsrael, which are of a new and intermediate genre — high

hyperinflation.          See Table.

(and   persistent)           inflation.    Following the price shocks of the 1970's theae
economies  have reached monthly rates of inflation of 5-8% (with peak
monthly rates of 25—30%, so far. .) extending over much longer periods of 8

years or more (see Table).     A very strong torrent, unprecedented in the
post-WW2 period,  but neither a waterfall nor a slow—moving river. In many
ways       these      more
                     are     interesting  laboratory experiments than the
hyperinflations  because  they  start  from  the garden variety  and only

gradually   approach a more extreme form of runaway inflation. In all
probability ending high inflation,   like ending hyperinflations, could not

be done gradu.all (at    least in moving from 500 percent a year or more to
the 20 percent ratige). Yet persistence and inertia are one of their key

attributes,         which a           serious stabilisation      program cannot ignore.         It is
precisely the development               of inflation-proofing       institutional       arrangements
which help the process to persist. Quite apart from having to deal with the
fundamental causes of inflation               (i.e.     large fiscal deficits       and monetary
accomodation)        a       disinflation program         must solve a      price co—ordination

problem,       so as to avoid what would otherwise become fobiddingly high real
transition     costs.


       Let us first discuss one aspect of the high inflation process which has
recently received considerable   theoretical attention,  the possibility   of
dual inflation                    this purpose I will use and extend a
                             equilibria.     For

simplifiedversion of a seignorage model which Stan Fisher snd I have been
analysing     (1985).        "
       Consider      first        a   closed economy in which the increment to the money

base   H   is a fixed percentage (d) of GNP.                  Denoting the rate of growth of the

money base by 0          (   = H/H) and    its ratio per unit of output by          h   [=   H/(PY)J
We have:



           _=      Th        .() =0.h=d                (9)


11)     Various      versions of the simple seignorage model have appeared in the
literature,                                   (1981), Livistan (1984).
                   see e.g. Sargent and Wallace

      In   steady state ® = it +            n   and we get



           (n+n)hd                                     (9')


     Assume next that the demand for unit real base money h(H/PY) depends
negatively on C, where t        stands for inflationary expectations or,
            as we move to the open economy, the exchange rate.
subsequently,                                                   (Presently

suppress the real rate of interest, as well as shifts    in the demand for
                                                                    demand
money or mnnetary policy.) Assume a semi-logarithmic      (Cagan)

function:


            h = exp(—aC).                              (10)



      Combining           (9')       with   (10)   we find that maximum seignorage revenue is

given by:


                 d° = Max {0 exp[-o(e-n)]}              =    a    exp (an-l)
and the associated inflation rate is                   71°   =   i/o- n.



      If   d >   d°   there is no steady state equilibrium                     (hyperinflation)


      For d=d° or dco there is a unique steady state.


      If 0 C     d    C   d°    there are two steady state equilibria (A,B in figure              A),

which we shall consider as an illustration for the case of high inflation.
Steady state equilibria may shift due to changes in d, n or shifts in h( ).


Now consider dynamics under adaptive adjustment                          of   rr_




                  =              —

Substituting      for      it   from equation      (11) gives the equation of motion

for   C:

      C=       (1     —    aB)1 B         (8_n_itt)                         (13)

      where $ = d exp (an)

     For B <         1/       A is stable, B unstable

           B >       1/       A is unstable, B stable
   The latter case is also relevant when B                                         (or    perfect     foresight)   in
   which case (8) becomes

       = a_t         (it   + n -     0)                                    (8a)

     Next consider the variable coefficient case B = 0(m) uith B' > o where
      = i/o, m* = threshold inflation rate.        We have the following
possibilities:


            (a)            itA   <   it          <     m           A    stable,     B unstable,


            (b)            m*    <   m           C     ItB         A    unstable,        B stable


            (c)            rt    C   m*          <     m           Both A and B are stable.




     This last case becomes                                  relevant   once we reinterpret this model for
an open economy in which monef                             and     foreign  exchange holdings are close
substitutes.          Replace             C      by        c in the demand for money           (10)   and now   assu
that the actual adjustment of the exchange rate by the authorities                                         follows a

crawling peg rule, in which the rate of devaluation is adjusted (other than
               — see below) to the lag between the rate of wage inflation
through shocks
(w) and the rate of devaluation(s):



           c     =        B1 (w —         c).                       (14)

     where     B,,    = B,,(c) and              B,,'   > 0



     The    rationale                for        this adjustment rule comes from the maintenance of

competitive power in the export sector.


     Next assume that wage adjustment follows the rule (we                                          here leave     out
discrete time lags):


               w = 'tot+             (1 -
                                                            —   22 —




where    2,   itself will rise with inflation and we may assume 't(e) > 0.


        We get w - a = 'Em -                 a).       Substituting        into equation (14) we have




                   E =    B(e)(n   —   a)    ,                   (15)
where         B =   't'B   =   0(g),       and B'> 0


Equation (15)               is     the      same   as       (11)       with a replacing C, where a may be

rationally expecte.


     Equation (15) describes a ssooth exchange rate adjustment process, with
no  speculative  attacks,  in which no discrete devaluation of the exchange
rate can take place. To add this element we can rewrite equation (15) as a
difference equation and add a discrete jump variable                                    J   to it,   in which

form it can also be empirically estimated:


        (lsa)        a a_, B(n_1
                           —           =           —    a—)        +   J
        where        a = e—e_1 itt                 =   Pt   Pt—i
                                                            —



        e      =    log   of exchange rate               Pt = log of price level.


     Combining (iSa) with a price adjustment equation like (8) one can
describe an exchange rate shock and accomodation process     under high

inflation.



     Equation (15) is an example of a gradual adjustment process                                     which is
nonetheless  consistent  with a rational expectations approach.                                      The fact

that the underlying system may have two inflationary    equilibria   both

of which are quasi—stable, shows that it is the policy rule, in this case
the rule of adjustment for the exchange rate,                                which may bring it   about.'


12)       upward jumps              in      Jt or downward shocks in the price equation (due to
price and wage controls)                    may shift the system towards the upper or lower
equilibria,           respectively.

The upper equilibrium, which is an 'inefficient' equilibrium, exhibits
attributes which one would associate with very high inflation, quick
adjustment speeds, shortening of contract lengths (such as COLA agreements)
and   also what        looks     like     'perverse'       behaviour   of a cut in the budget
leading to a higher rather than a lower inflation equilibrium.


     It is worth pointing out chat in all probability movemenc cowards an
upper equilibrium   was an empirical reality in the higher phazes of the
Israeli  inflation.    There   is   clear   empirical  evidence  of   che
elasticity of demand for money rising above unity when annual inflation
rose over 100% (ãfcer 1979). Ic is not that the government volunteered to
operate  on the 'wrong' side of the Laffer curve (for the inflation tax),
but the economy was pushed in chac direction by a number of policy mistakes

which then trapped             the     economy in a   higher inflation (introduction of
foreign exchange linked money,             as   part of a misfired 'liberalization'
efforc,    also involving   a large step devaluation without the accompanying
fiscal restraint).       Next, equation (lsa) was estimated
                                                          with a non-linear
specificacion.     establishing a  cut—off  inflacion  rate  (for the Cagan
condition)   7t   of   becween 5 and 6 percent monthly inflation (75—100               percent
annual race).'3     In ocher words, there was an implicit chreshhold race
above which inflacion was being pushed cowards a high, inefficient,
quasi—equilibrium (of che order of 700—1000% annual race).


      A   corollary      of     this    type of      analysis ia       the need to view a sharp
disinflation program in two different, though related, parcs. One is the
correction of fundamentals - a cut in the government deficit helps reduce
foreign borrowing, relieve pressure from the exchange rate and shift che A-

inflationary      equilibrium      to     a low (or zero) rate.           The other part of the
program must insure that a synchronised             jump to the lower inflation rate is
in fact      successfully     carried out.          This     is     the     part that involves a

temporary suspension of the COLA agreements, a freeze on the exchange rate
and domestic credit, as well as supporcing price controls (whose main
function in the Israeli case was to get the unions into the bargain and
obtain the 'right' expectationsl signals). All of these elements ensble s
co—ordinated drop in the inflation rate,                 and also help to mske              the   newly
established iow level inflation rate stable.


     There are many interesting features both of the high inflatica process,
as well as that of its elimination, which have a besring on the price
co—ordination        literature    which was       briefly      mentioned       in    the previous

section.    A major example is          the advantage        in an open economy, of using
the exchange rate, rather than the quantity of money,                 as the co—ordinating
pivot (the exchange rate unifies all the tradable goods prices while the
demand for money may be highly unstable, especially during stabiliration).


     In     the   context    of    our present discussion the most important lesson

from this experience, ma oppoaed to the hyperinflation experience which led
to Sargent's conclusions,    is the predominance of nominal inertia even at

very high inflation (up           to    20%   monthly     rates,    say).      This     imparts       an
important     role     to synchronisation     during rapid disinflation,                making it a
'heterodox' rather than an             orthodox shock therapy.     The other                      almost

obvious point is that when a system has more than one (stable) equilibrium
thers is room for policy to get the system out of one Pareto—inferior,   to

the 'better' equilibrium.    Other  lessons  that have to do with the rules

versus discretion debate will be mentioned                 below.         Finally     the     case of
heterodox stabilization which was tried out in a number of countries                              is one

where the applied policy package was in many ways based on intuition and
was moulded by trial and error. Once it has been shown to work in at least
one case the theory is developing by which                 it     could     eventually be           fully

rationalized.     "

V. The Labour Market and Persistent Unemployment


     The existence of iaperfections in the functioning of labour markets was
a  dominant theme in much of the literature which lay at the interface of
macro-theory and labour economics alrsady before the 1970's, notably the
contributions     to     search    theory     such      as   by   Mortensen (1970) and Phelpa
                                           making for fluctuations
(1970). The underlying macro forces, however,                          in

employment and economic activity were considered  to lie predominantly on
the aggregate demand side.   The possibility    of supply side induced
unemployment could         be     admitted,       but   it was confined to long term growth

(e.g. technological       unemployment).      While the literature oo         Less     Developed

enter   mainstream macroeconomics             until      after    the oil nnd commodity price

shocks of the 1970's,


     It is a rather typical example of the natural tendency to apply the
existing paradigm to a new phenomenon,        the oil shocks, and only then
discover that it does not work.             When the oil crisis of 1973 first           set    ic.


the dominant issue at first sight seemed the petro-dollar                  recycling    problem.
With so much more purchasing power in the hands of the oil producers and
the fall in real income and wealth causing unemployment in the economies of

the major oonsumers,           all that seemed to be required is to redress the world
demand imbalance.          If only one could channel the extra purchssing power in
the form of expanded exports from the oil consumers                  to the oil producers      the

'Keynesian' unemployment in the industrial economies would disappear. Only
with time did it become clear that rising unemployment together with
accelerating  inflation in the mid— 1970's.      was a result          and        ,    first
foremost,   of a shift          in the aggregate commodity supply       schedules of
individual economies,           hitherto a rather dormant component of the Keynesian
short—term equilibrium.

      A     mere leftward shift of the aggregate supply schedule on account of
the       rising    prices of material inputs is not enough to generate

unemployment was due to aggregate demand     shortfall rather    than a
high real wage per se even though the latter seemed to continue to play a
important    role in high    real wage       resistant    countries           like        the    UK and
Belgium.


       The wage gap concept had been rationalized with reference to a
competitive  market clearing equilibrium concept of full employment,   while

in    the above mentioned  estimates for the employment effect of real wages

allowance was        made for   departure     from       market     clearing                A     recent
theoretically  more satisfactory analysis along similar lines was given by
Coen and Hickman (1987) who explicitly assume an imperfect competition
setting and look at the wage gap in terms of the relative price ratio of
labour and capital and a        more complete        aggregate      demand           and        aggregate
supply     estimable    model, applied to four countries          (U.S.   ,   U.K.    ,    Austria     and

Germany).    The     empirical results are not substantially         different                  from   the
earlier      ones,but stress again the increasing re—emergence                            of aggregate
demand shortfall as the dominant element in the early 1980's.


     Relative real wage rigidity, while employment tends to fluctuate,   and
the phenomenon of persistent unemployment have, over the last decade, given
rise to a very extensive theoretical literature dealing with various aspects
of    labour market imperfections and institutionel structure, which will be
briefly mentioned.


     Starting with Emily (1974) and Azariadis (1975) wsge and employment
behaviour under long term contracts was shown to lead to relatively stable
contracted real wage, pcoviding workers are more risk averse (and with less
access to insurance markets)     than their employers.    Later developments
centered around employment decisions by firms under asymmetric   information
between  workers  and   firms (e.g. on perception of productivity shocks)

showing that employment will be lower than under symmetric information. 3.9)


19)      Major contributions here were         made by      Hart     (1983).               For     recent
surveys of the contract literature see Rosen (1985), Stiglitz (1986).
                                               —   28 —




     Several    writershave analyzed the role of union wage setting as a
factor in real wage rigidity over the business cycle (e.g.    Oswald,   1979;

Grossman,  1982). McDonald and Solow (1981) have provided  a series of models
that focus on the wage—employment trade-off and outcomes that are likely to
arise from wage bargaining, emphasizing the implicationa of demand ahocka
for real wage outcomes. The model can also be uaed to show that an
optimizing union, with given aize memberahip, may abaorh an input price
shock entirely in the form of reduced employment at given real wage, if the
shock dues not affect the elasticity of labour demand or the level of
utility in unemployment.


     A more recent theoretical development, in which the exiatence of unions
playa an impoctant role and which attempts to account for persistent
unemployment,        is the insider—outsider model.             By      controlling   entry into
employment union insiders may              cause the real
                                                    rise      wage tn         above the market   —



—clearing rate and thus keep unemployment from falling.                        The idea has been

raised in      the     context        of   Auatralian unemployment by            Gregory (1985),

developed in a aeriea of papera by Lindbeck and Snower (1984, 1986). It has
recently been used by Blanchard and Summers (1986) to suggeat that
persistent European unemployment coqld be explained as a          hystereais

phenomenon.      The aupply and demand ahocka mentioned above would explain why

unemployment increaaed the way it did,        while the     insider—outsider

characteristic of the labour market explaina why unemployment has atayed at
persistently high levela. Unfortunately the empirical part of these analyses
remaina     inconcluaise         ma    far   aa    to   rhe    policy implications       of such

phenomenon.     On     the one hand it may call for             supply      management   measures

such as   work-sharing and profit sharing programs (along Wc,iczman (1986)
lines) as well as limitations on union control of entry. On the other hand
it ia not clear whether the NAIRU could be brought down and to what extent
aggregate demand expansion could also be a solution.      Preaumably a
combination of both is needed, but ian"t that something that 'intuition'
would tell us anyway?


     A parallel development that should be mentioned in this context ia the
efficiency wage theory, another import from LDC development literature
(Leibenstein, 1957) with contributions, amongst others,   by Solow (1979),
Akerloff and   Yellen (1984).      (For an excellent recent survey aee Katz

(1986)).  Here the possibility  of  the real wage being paid in excess of the

market clearing level recta  on the  aaeumption that productivity (and labour
                                          —   29 —




morale,   aversion to shirking,     etc.) depends on the       real     wage.    The   model

could be criticised         on the grounds that some of the firm's objectives that
are meant to rationalize a high wage could also be achieved by                  longer term
employment      relations      (upwards       sloping   age-earnings     profiles,internal

promotion schemes, pensions etc) Imperfect observability of worker quality,
namely an adverse selaction argument, would also lead a firm to raise the
wage so as to attract a higher quality pool of applicants.


     The choice between the insider—outsider aod the efficiency wage theory
ultimately depends'on the degree of importance that is attached in practice
to imperfect infofmation on part of firma or to workers' market power. Theae
may differ across industries and countriea and a great deal more eapirical
work needs to be done before one would be able to judge the practical macro
policy relevance of the theory.


    In    the   interdependent     world of       the   1980's it may be unrealistic      to

expect a solution of the unemployment problem within              the     confines of en
individual   country.    Part of     the answer    may lie in a somewhat
different, though related,  field - that of international co—ordination of
macroeconomic policies. What looks like a "classical" unemployment prob?en
for a single country could be solved by co-ordinated  "Keynesian"  expansion

by  a  group of countries, a subject that will not be taken up here.  At the
same time we know that countries          differ in respect        of unemployment and
general macro—economic         performance.       What are    the lessons that could be

learnt from comparative studies of macroeconomic        performance    across

countries,   in relation   to  differences   in  wage setting structures?  An

interesting recent paper by Calmfors and Driffil (1987) has challenged the
conventional wisdom   by which there is a monotonic relationship between the
degree of centralization of wage bargaining and the macroeconomic   outcome.

When that outcome is measured by an open economy analog of the conventional
                                                 —

misery index,20  they show that the relationship is rather hump—shaped. The
best performance is at the two extremes of high centralization (e.g. Austria
and the Nordic countries) or high decentralization(e.g. Japan, Switzerland
and the U.S.) with the worst outcome at the intecmediate level of
centralization (e.g. Belgium, Netherlands).


       What is interesting and original in this study is the attempt to give a
theoretical    model by which this empirical      finding  is rationalized.  A

stylized model economy is conceived consisting of many separate industries
the    goodsof which are imperfect substitutes in demand. The goods may be
aggregated into broader and broader groups with each group at one level
treated as  a single good at the next higher level. Goods from the same
group are close substitutes while among different     groups  the   more
distant substitutes conform to longer distance along the branches of the
industry tree.       When industry unions amalgamate they always do so by foraing
coalitions between        those in sectors    producing the closest substitutes.
Increased centralization           is     thus       synonymous     with      climbing      up    the

substitutabilitytree.


       In   this            impact on wages with increasing centralization
                    set-up the
depends on two opposing forces. As unions get larger they acquire market
power.   A given money wage increase results in a larger output price rise
the more sectors the union encompasses.  The price rise is larger and thus

also the       incentive     to   raise    money wages,           the larger the elasticity of

substitution between the goods produced by                  the    cooperating        sectors    since

this    increases     the   cross effects in product demand. On the other hand the

effect of the money wage rate on the rggregate price level works in the
opposite direction,     As unions get bigger the effect of the money wage on
the aggregate price level increases and the real wage gains are reduced.
Put    differently,         centralization           can be       seen   as     the      progressive

internalization      of an externality.   Using the authors' words   "If, at                       the

wage which         maximizes each union's welfare when it acts independently,                      the



20) Here is another instance of              limited       generality of quite widespread
macroeconomic measure.            Instead of           adding the unemployemnt rate only to
the inflation rate as is common in the U.S. poliy discussion, The GOP                            share

of current account deficit is added in the present context.

marginal      effect of an increase in its wage on the welfare of the other union
is positive,      then cooperation results     in   higher wages    than independent
actions and vice versa."


       Thisargument rationalizes the hump shaped relationship between degree
of centralization and the real wage rate.    The way this fits into the

comparison of change in economic performance between the pre—73 and post—73
world,     is that in the earlier period economies were in full employaent          and
real     wages    at more or      less market clearing     levels    whereas   in   the

underemployment       si'tuation of the 1970's and 80's labour     markets were more
likely     to  thrown into a situation like the one described by the above
                 be
model, The policy implication of all this is that a bit more or a bit less

centralizaiton for a country in the medium range may not by itself make a
lot of difference.

VI.   Credibility,         Rules versus Discretion and the Theory of Economic Policy


     A government that cannot tie its hands to a precommitted policy rule
(such as follow a disinflation policy) will at each point in time make a
short—run optimal decision,  taking the private sector's reaction as given.
The     private       sector,     in turn, takes the government policy as given when it

makes its own optimizing decisions,                This discretionary, Nash equilibrium,
outcome       may     on    average,     over time, be Pareto inferior to one in which a

binding precommitment,             or a co-operative outcome can be              negotiated.          But

what about a government that seems to commit itself to a certain policy over
more than one period and then finds it optimal to renege when the next
period        comes     around?        This,   so—called,         dynamic     inconsistency problea

(Kydland and Prescott,             1977) has started a whole set of interesting                    papers

by Barro and Gordon (1983a, l983b) and several other authors.2t


        One     contribution of          this literature,         which so far has been entirely

theoretical,          was to give systematic           rational     content     to   concepts        with
which     one    been reasoning only intuitively like policy credibility and
                  has
the rules versus discretion issue, What may be a more important outcome   is
the     systematic         introduction of       the     idea     that in a multi-period horizon

governments may be less likely to act in dynamically                        inconsistent     ways if
there     is an incentive         to build—up a reputation and there is a cost attached

to the loss of credibility.               In this      discussion findings           and   tools     from

repeated game theory, especially under incomplete information,                              have been

fruitfully borrowed (notably Kreps and Wilson, 1982).


        The      standard         reference     in      this       literature         is     to       the

inflation—unemployment             trade-off     in the         closed economy where the single
period pay—of (or loss function) of the government    combines a squared

inflation and a linear (or squared) unemployment term and the multi-period

extension is simply the discounted sum of these terms over time. The

unemployment term is then replaced by the expectational Phillips curve.                                In


21) For recent surveys see Perason (1987) and Driffil                       (1987).

the one—period optimization (discretion)               inflationary expectations,         embedded

in      private   sector contracts,             are   taken   as    given and      the    rational

expectations,         dynamically   consistent,       solution gives a positive           inflation

rate which is also the Nash equilibrium.    A precommitment (rule) to a zero
inflation policy which will in fact be believed and carried out is a Pareto

superior outcome, Reneging on the promised zero inflation rate in the first
period may give a short run gain in employment (this is the 'temptation' in
Barro     andGordon (1983) terminology). The cost is the loss of credibility
henceforth, leading the private sector to expect positive inflation and act

accordingly.    Thi's is the 'enforcement' of the rule. Various games can be

devised in whichthe          government may regain its             credibility    by     correcting
its  ways and producing the expected zero inflation rate next period, Some
of the more interesting applications are those in which the private sector
does     not
           know what kind of government it has and must gradually learn its
behaviour by applying Bayes' rule to the npdccing of their beliefs   (Barro
and Gordon,1983;    Backus and Driffil, 1985). What these studies show is

that here too, as in the co—ordination problem discussed in Section IV, a
multiplicity of possible equilibria exists. A co—operative solution, such
as under centralized wage bargaining may, of course,                    facilitate matters.


     The closed economy problem analyzed in the above studies    implies  an
open economy analog, which has so far not been fully explored.22' Instead of
looking at inflation and unemployment  the relevant trade—off    is between

inflation       and    the   current account (in present discounted stream form this
amounts to the trade—off between inflation and foreign                    exchange       reserves).
The  relevant policy variable here is the exchange rate while labour,
assuming that it is highly organised, chooses a nominal wage rate so as to
maximize some function of the real wage and employment.


22)     Horn and Persson (1985) discuss an open economy union versus government
bilateral monopoly model but            only incorporate           employment    in    the   export
industry       rather than the         current account or foreign exchange reserves in
the objective         function.     Gukierman       and Liviatan (1988)          have also been
studying the balance of payments inflation trade-off.

        We     may    give two examples that are relevant to the rapid disinflation
experience decribed in the previous section,         in which the above type of
theory  may at least be descriptively relevant. Consider the case in which
initially there is inflation at the rate mo and wages have been fully
indexed   (i.e.  a =             r1)
                           Now the government
                                        .     faces the choice of moving at

once to zero inflation. The cost                   if the COLA agreement            cannot be suspended

(lack     of    credibility)           ia a permanent increase in the real wage level (and
real appreciation of the exchange rate) causing a loss of                             foreign         exchange

receipts       not     only this            period but also over the future,              It can he shown
that this cost will be less than the gain                        from     disinflation (saauaing an
infinite horizon,            for simplicity)        if the inherited          inflation rato is above

the inflation          rate that would be obtained under diacretion.                      If    one     starts

from     an     initial discretionary            solution the decision to die inflate could be

the result of an increase in the weight of the inflation                             tear      relative      to

exchange reserves in the welfare maximand which would now make it preferable
to opt for disinflation.  In this example we implicitly assume that once
zero      inflation        has   been        achieved    it     is    also     believed since the COLA
assumption will reduce the nominal wage inflation to zero from the second
period onwards.    The introduction   of wage and price controls may he
rationalized as a way of convincing labour of the government's    serious

intentions.  The welfare cost of moving ahead without COLA suspension can be
used as a baaia for a bargained up-front wage compensation within an
agreement by which the unions do, in fact, agree to suspend automatic COLA
temporarily.          This was in fact done in the Israeli case.


      As a second exmmple we may consider the dynamic game that has taken
place   in Israel between the government and labour once the initial
stabilisation phase    including an exchange rate freeze, had been laonohed.

Given        the had past government track record the private sector expected that
a few months after the                 beginning of       the        program    another     exchange      rate

adjustment would             take place.          Workers       demanded a     wage increaae and the
employers,            in   anticipation of          government          exchange rate accomodation,
granted it. At thia point government resisted the temptation to devalue and
thus gradually invested in ita own reputation. Ex-poat some industries had
to reduce their nominal wage but overall the real wage nonetheless increased
and export profitability in the course of 1986 deteriorated, In January 1987
a   10%       devaluation        was        introduced within another             tripartite      agreement

(involving           a partial auapenaion of COLA) and again a                    precommitment         to    an

exchange rate freeze.                  conditional on wage moderation.              waa announced.           The
                                         —   35 —




outcome for 1987 was better than for the previous year.   Real wages have
still been rising a bit faster than productivity but    the gap in rates of
change is closing and some major concerns have announced a nominal wage                cut
to    avoid    the    loss in   competitiveness.       It   is   an example of a gradual
                         —
learning cum credibility   building process in which the government attempts
to show     a.  that it will not easily accomodate.   b. that it will not use

surprise inflation (i.e. "cheating" by devaluing  without an agreed incomes

policy component) to erode the real wage.


      Another interesting       development     related     to   the   time inconsistency
literature                       of macroeconomics
               lies on the borderline               and political theory
and    dealswith questions such as the rationale for public deficits under
two—party systems, and the effect that uncertainty of election outcomes

may have on the business cycle. Much of this work is due to Alesina and
Tabellini,      such as,    for example a recent paper      (1987) that shows
                                                                  why it
is hard to eliminate budget deficits even if there is    a consensus that

they are socially sub—optimal. In their model this arises from the fact
that the costs of running current deficits are not fully internalired by
today's voter, not because of his irrationality,     but because of his
awareness      that    future policy choices,       after another election,     might not
reflect his preferences.        The expected marginal       disutility of     having   to

reduce       spending in    the future, to repay the debt incurred to—day, ia not

sufficiently high.      He thus votes in        favour      of   fiscal   deficits   even

though a    benevolent "social planner" would choose to balance the budget.
The paper also shows that current voters would prefer to precoamit   future

governments   to   a balanced budget rule but would not want the rule to
be binding on themselves.


       Theanalysis is done within a neat model in which there          are

heterogenous  individuals with  differing tastes on the production of two

different public goods.   Decision is by majority rule,      and at the

beginning      each period the group votes on how much to produce of each
               of
public good in that period but no precommitment can be made on production
next period.    Preferences are single peaked and the median voter property
holds.  The social planner would always choose to balance the budget but

because of elections each period in which disagreement between present and
future voters occurs a time inconsistency and a bias in favour of budget
deficits arises.

     In the context of the stabilisation programs mentioned in Section V
the above type of reasoning could be applied in the other direction — why

a   comprehensive  disinflation program undertaken within a democratic
political system is more likely to succeed when two major political parties
that otherwise disagree on most issues form a coalition government under
which a balanced budget is more likely to be                     achieved (cf          the   recent
Israeli example).


VII. Concluding remarks


        There       number of policy related research areas which were left
                  are    a.

out of the present discussion. We have already mentioned international
macro policy co—ordination.  In this area a literature is developing within
which some of           the    strategic    considerations       and game—theoretic   tools

mentioned above               in another context     ,   have been applied. On the individual
economy level there are various fiscal snd monetary policy issues on                          which
there     is ongoing theoretical           research. There is increasing         interest in the

role of         credit rationing in financial markets arising                      from adverse
selection        of risky borrowers or moral hazard considerations,
                                                             whereby high
interest rates lead to the choice of riskier activities.From the point of
view of conduct of monetary policy, there is a lot more theoretical and
empirical work to be done on the role of financial intermediation in a
world of rapidly changing institutions.     This is a particularly vexing

problem in countries with thin money and                    capital   markets.     These areas
were left out of the present discussion,                    not because they are unimportant.

They are just as important from a policy point of view.                    But     this      is not
where the great debates have been raging.


        Looking back in an             attempt       to evaluate what has been achieved in
macroeconomic       theory during the last 10—15 years the record                 is    impressive
but not unmixed.    Take the narrow minded policy maker's point of view and
suppose his policies were based only on the results    of theoretical and

empirical  research based on the 'old' paradigm or known by the mid 70's,
Would that lead him to any bigger mistakes than those that he would have
made if all the new knowledge were embedded in the wisdom that the economic
advisor, recently graduated from a top academic   institution,  would have

whispered in his ears? Put in this form the answer, most probably, would
be negative. Yet we know that very dramatic changes have been taking place
in the underlying building blocks, mainly with the new ways of looking at
                                   —   37 —




information processing by individual agents and the departure from perfect
competition  models.   Our understanding of the endogenous role of economic

policy in the system has certainly undergone substantial improvement even
if   most    of     sctual policies could just as well have been undertaken
                   the
within the old model Understanding in a better way what one is doing may
very well be th.e first stage in the learning process on how it will be done
differently       in the future.


     Nscroeconomics as a field has made substantial progress over this
period.  It continues to be mn exciting area in which a lot of new ideas
and useful new insights keep coming up. It also seems to be at a stage in
which a      new          is emerging between a 'Keynesian' view of markecs
                     synthesis
and a 'rational expectations' view of the way in which their functioning
could be improved through macro-policies.    It is very likely that the next

contarence                 ten years from now, would not have to start
                  of this kind,
with separate papers on the two schools of thought between which the debate
hms been raging during the last decade. Natural selection will dictate the
right (eclectic?) mix of the new psradigm.
