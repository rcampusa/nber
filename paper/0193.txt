     Direct foreign investment is of growing importance throughout
the world. Taxation of the resulting investment income is therefore
a significant problem for both the host country in which the invest-
ment is made and the home country from which the capital comes.
In the present paper we derive optimal tax rules for both the capi-
tal-exporting and capital-importing countries. Of particular interest
to a large capital exporter like the United States is the derivation of
the tax rate that is optimal for the capital-exporting nation when other
countries adjust their tax rates in response.1
      Our paper begins with the relatively simple problem of optimal
taxation as viewed by the capital-exporting ("home") country when
it can assume that its actions do not alter the tax rate in the host
country. As a further simplification, the only foreign investment is
the transfer of equity capital from the home country to the host
country. We assume that such direct investment occurs because the
"subsidiary firms" (i.e., the firms owned by residents of the home
country that produce in the host country) have a different production
technology than what is available to host country firms. For an im-
portant special case of this problem, i.e., when foreign investment
accounts for only a very small fraction of host country production, we
obtain an optimal tax rule that corresponds to a common policy pre-
scription: the capital-exporting country should tax foreign source
profits after foreign tax at the same rate that it taxes domestic profits.
This "full taxation after deduction" rule is a useful benchmark against
which to compare the optimal tax policies in more general cases. For
example, Section I also shows that when foreign investment accounts
for a significant fraction of production in the host country, the capi-
tal-exporting country should tax foreign source investment income

more heavily than is implied by the "full taxation after deduction"
rule.
      The important question of tax rate interdependence is developed
in Section II. We assume that the host countries are small relative to
the capital-exporting country. They therefore regard the tax rates in
the capital-exporting country as fixed parameters and choose their
own tax rate on foreign investment to be optimal, conditional on the
tax rates in the capital-exporting country.2 The optimal tax policy
of the capital-exporting country must take this reaction by the host
countries into account.3
     We began our analysis of this problem with the expectation that
allowing for such tax rate interdependence would lower the home
country's optimal tax on foreign source investment income. We rea-
soned that a lower tax rate in the capital-exporting country would
make home country firms more sensitive to the foreign tax rate4 and
that this in turn would induce foreign countries to cut their tax rates
in order to attract foreign investment. By this line of reasoning, re-
ducing the taxation of foreign source investment income would be a
net benefit to the home country because subsidiary firms would pay
a smaller fraction of their income in host country taxes.
      Our initial expectations turned out to be false. Under quite
general conditions, it is optimal for the host country to tax foreign
source investment more heavily than the "full taxation after deduc-
tion" rule suggests. By raising its tax rate, the home country can re-
duce the tax rate levied by the host country. This allowance for in-
terdependence does make it worthwhile for the home country to use
its tax rates to induce a lower rate of tax by host countries, but this
entails a heavier rather than a lighter tax by the home country.
      In the third section we replace the assumption that all foreign
investment is financed by a transfer of equity capital from the home
country with the more realistic description that subsidiary firms
borrow in the host country. We assume realistically that an increase
in equity investment is accompanied by increased borrowing and that
the rate of interest is less than the marginal product of investment

    2. We treat the host countries as effectively identical so that, from the point of
view of the capital-exporting country, the host countries are equivalent to a single
country, and all choose the same policy. It is important, however, that there are in fact
a large number of such countries so that they take the capital-exporting country's tax
rates as parameters.
     3. Note that in the process of deriving the optimal policy for the capital-exporting
country, we obtain as a by-product the optimal tax policy of the small, capital-importing
country.
     4. In the extreme, a 100 percent tax rate by the home country on subsidiary profits
net of tax makes home country firms completely insensitive to the host's tax rate.

in the subsidiary firms. Although this raises the profitability to the
home country of investment by its foreign subsidiaries, we show that
this need not alter the conclusions of the previous sections.
     We regard the present paper as only a first step in a proper
analysis of the complex issue of optimal taxation of foreign source
investment income. A more complete analysis would reflect the in-
terdependence of trade and investment,5 the existence of portfolio
investment as well as direct investment, the multinational character
of the firms' investment and financing decisions, and the several
factors that account for the simultaneous two-way flow of investment
between individual pairs of countries. The static analysis of the
present paper should be extended to consider investment paths in
growing economics. Finally, the purely nationalistic optimality cri-
terion could be generalized to give some weight to the real income of
the rest of the world.

                           I. THE BASIC MODEL
     This section sets out the basic model that will be developed and
analyzes the special case of optimal taxation when the subsidiary firm
borrows no capital in the host country and when the tax rate on foreign
investment income levied by the host country is constant (and
therefore not influenced by the tax policy chosen by the capital-
exporting home country).
     It is useful to begin by describing the economy of the home
country and the problem of choice is seen by a representative home
country firm that has a foreign subsidiary. Aggregate production in
the home country is determined by a production technology F =F (K,
L). The domestic labor supply (L) will be taken as fixed, but the do-
mestic capital stock (K) must be regarded as endogenous, the dif-
ference between the exogenously given total national capital (K) and
the amount of capital transferred abroad to foreign subsidiaries (K');
i.e., K = K — KS. With constant returns to scale, each firm invests
until its marginal product of capital is equal to the common value FK.
Firms pay tax at the rate 0 on their domestic profits so the firms net
marginal productof capital is (1 — O)FK.
      The subsidiaries of the home country firms produce in the host
country with a technology that in general differs from both their

    5. Such an analysis could derive the optimal combination of tariffs and taxes in
the more general framework of interdependence developed in the current paper. See
Kemp [1966] and Jones 11967] for discussions of this problem without interdepen-
dence.
616               QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

technology at home and the technology of the local firms in the host
country. We represent this subsidiary technology by F =Fs(Ks,L5)
where L S is the host country labor employed by the subsidiaries. The
subsidiaries earn pretax profits Fs — w*L5, where w is the wage rate
paid to all workers in the host country. The host country collects a tax
at the rate 0* on subsidiary profits. The after-tax profits available for
division between the home country parent firm and the home country
treasury are therefore (1 — O*)(FS — w*Ls). At the margin, every
subsidiary investment earns a net return (1 — O*)Fk.
     The parent firm must pay an additional tax to the home country
before its foreign investment income is available for distribution as
gross dividends. It is useful to regard the home country tax as a
combination of (1) a tax at rate OS on the subsidiary profit net of the
host tax (i.e., a tax of O(1 — O*)F on the marginal foreign investment
income Fk) and (2) a credit at rate y for the tax paid to the host
country (i.e., a credit of yO*F< on the marginal foreign investment
income Fk). The net tax paid to the home country on the marginal
investment is thus [O'(l — 0*) — y0*] Fk.6
     Firms of the capital-exporting country invest at home and abroad
until the net of tax rates of return are equal:
(1.1)            (1 — O)FK       [(1 — gs)(1 — 0*)      + yO*]Fk.
     The firms of the host country produce with a technology de-
scribed by F* = F* (K*,L*), where K* is fixed exogenously but L * is
the difference between the exogenously fixed national labor supply
(L*) and the labor employed by the subsidiary firms (Ls); i.e., L* =
    — L. By assumption, these firms produce only in the host country.
As a condition of production efficiency, the host country firms will
pay a wage w equal to the marginal product of labor F. Since host
country workers are free to work for either the host country firms or
the subsidiaries, the wage paid by the subsidiaries is also w * and their
production efficiency requires w = Fl. Thus, labor market equilib-
rium implies that
(1.2)                  F(K*,L* — L) = Fl(K,L).
     This completes our description of the relevant economic behavior
of the capital and labor markets. We can now turn to the optimization
problem of the home country. The national income of the home
country is the sum of the domestic income and the profits of its foreign
subsidiaries net of host country taxes:
     6. Note that this includes the special case of taxing foreign source income net of
a credit for the foreign tax paid (0' — O*)Fk by setting y = 1 — 0'.

(1.3)        N = F(K — K,L) + (1 — O*)(Fs — w*Ls).
The home country selects fis and y to maximize N with the knowledge
that firms will respond by adjusting KS until (1.1) is satisfied and that
the equilibrium of the host country labor market assures (1.2).
     Before examining the general problem, consider first the case in
which the demand for labor by the subsidiary firms is small enough
(relative to the size of the host country labor force) to leave the host
country wage rate w unchanged. The first-order condition for a
maximum of N with respect to OS is then

(1.4)

or
             dK5                   dKs        dL         dL = 0.
(1.5) —FK—+(1 _O*) Fk
Since = w' is a condition of production efficiency for the subsidiary
firms, equation (1.5) simplifies to

(1.6)               [—FK + (1 — O*)Fk]          = 0.

Thus, the home country should choose its tax policies to make
(1.7)                      FK = (1 —
regardless ofthe magnitude of dK/dO 0. Similarly, the first-order
condition for a maximum of N with respect to y implies that

(1.8)

It is clear from a comparison of (1.5) and (1.8) that this also implies
condition (1.7).
      Equation (1.1) implies that this condition is satisfied if the home
country chooses OS = 0 and y = 0. This implies taxing subsidiary
profits net of the tax paid to the host country at the same rate as do-
mestic profits are taxed. The logic of this "full tax after deduction"
method is clear. From the point of view of the home country, the na-
tion's capital stock should be divided between home production and
subsidiary production until the marginal product of capital to the
 nation is equal in both uses. Since foreign taxes are a cost to the na-
 tion, they should be subtracted in valuing the marginal product of
 capital of the subsidiary. In contrast, taxes levied by the home country
618              QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

are a cost to the firm but not the nation and must therefore be disre-
garded. The "full tax after deduction" method has been proposed in
discussions of tax reform7 as a method of achieving "neutrality" in
investment allocation. We have shown that it maximizes national
income under a particular set of simple but restrictive assumptions.
The "full tax after deduction" method is thus a useful benchmark
against which to compare the taxes that are optimal in a more general
framework.
    In sections II and III we shall relax the assumption that the
subsidiary firms are small enough to leave the host country wage
unchanged. At this point we shall briefly examine the implication of
dropping this assumption when the host country tax rate is constant.
The first-order condition for maximization of Nwith respect to O now
implies that
(1.9)


_FK+(1_O*)[Fk+F_w*_LsI=O.
Although the subsidiary firms collectively raise w, each individual
subsidiary still takes w' as exogenous and equates F = wi'. This al-
lows (1.9) to be simplified in the same way as (1.5) and further implies
that
(1.10)                   dw* = FSLKdKS + FSLLdLS.
Totally differentiating the equilibrium condition of the host country
labor market (equation 1.2) implies that
(1.11)                _FLdLS = FKdKS + FSLLdLS,
and

(1.12)                         dLs = _FLKdKS
                                      FL + F8LL
Substituting into (1.10) yields

(1.13)               dw* = FK [i —           FELL
                                                       dK
                                        FLL + FLL]
                           =               dKs.
                               FLL+FL
Equation (1.9) can thus be written

      7. See, e.g., Krause and Dam 11964] and Richman [19631.

(1.14)                   (1   _O*)

and, for any dKVdO 0,
(1.15)                FK = (1 — fl*) [Fk —
                                                  LsFKFjLj
The first-order condition for a maximum of N with respect to y also
yields condition (1.15).
     It is clear from (1.15) that the marginal product of subsidiary
capital net of the foreign tax, (1 — fl*) Fk, should exceed the marginal
product of domestic capital FK. This requires allocating a smaller
fraction of the home country's capital stock to subsidiary production.
This in turn entails a heavier tax on foreign source investment income
than the "full tax after deduction" method. For example, with no
credit (y = 0) the optimal tax rate Os that satisfies (1.15) subject to
(1.1) is the solution of
              —
                  Os)1_ 0*)
                                                              LFFj
                                         —
(1.16) [(1                       JFk = (1 0*) [Fk —

(1.17)                   O=     0+
                                             tLsFLi
      The reason for this heavier optimal tax on net foreign profits is
easy to understand. When the subsidiary firms in the aggregate raise
the foreign wage that they must pay, they can increase their profits
if they act as a monopsonist and reduce their collective demand for
labor. Although the subsidiary firms cannot do this themselves, the
home country can achieve the optimal reduction in the subsidiaries'
demand for labor by a heavier tax on foreign investment. This ex-
planation can alternatively be stated in terms of the subsidiaries as
monopoly suppliers of capital. The increase in the host country wage
implies a corresponding reduction in the marginal product of capital.
Although the subsidiary firms individually cannot restrict the supply
of capital to exploit this monopoly position, the home country can
achieve this by a tax increase that reduces the capital export.8
      In order to continue to use the "full tax after deduction" as a

     8. This analysis is thus directly parallel to the case for a tariff in the theory of
international trade. If the exporting country is a large supplier of the exported goods,
a tariff can achieve the monopoly profit for the nation that individual export firms
cannot achieve. See, for example, Baldwin [1952] for this analysis of the optimal tariff.
The application to capital exports has been discussed by MacDougall [1960], Kemp
[19621, and Jones [19671.
620              QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

benchmark, the following sections of this paper will discuss both the
general case and that in which the subsidiary firms account for a small
enough part of the host economy so that their effect on local wage rates
can be ignored.9 For simplicity, the tax credit (at rate y), which we
have just shown is optimally set equal to zero, will be ignored in the
remaining analysis.

                  II. TAX RATE INTERDEPENDENCE
      We are now ready to drop the simplifying assumption that only
the capital-exporting country optimizes its tax rate (0) while the
capital-importing countries passively keep their own rate of tax on
foreign investment (0*) unchanged. We specify instead that the
capital-importing countries react to O by setting the value of 0* that
 maximizes their own national income conditional on Os. We treat the
capital importers as individual small countries each of which can take
  as given, assuming correctly that its choice of 0* does not affect Os.1o
In contrast, the capital exporter is large and takes into account the
effect of its choice of 0 on the 0* chosen by the capital im-
porters."
    This specification converts the previous two-level optimization
problem into a three-level problem. The capital-exporting country
chooses Os to maximize its national income, taking into account the
response to the capital-importing country that chooses fl* to maximize
its national income. In selecting 0*, the capital-importing country
takes into account the response of the firms that invest in both
countries. The capital-exporting country also recognizes the effect
of its tax rate on the behavior of firms and understands that the
capital-importing country does this as well.
    It is useful to begin by restating the optimum condition of the

     9. Comparing the optimum conditions of equations (1.7) and (1.15) shows that
ignoring the effect of the subsidiaries on the host wage u; is equivalent to assuming
that FL is small relative to FL. Since the ratio of P*LL to FtL is of the same order as
LVL*, ignoring the change in w is appropriate if L* is small relative to L*.
     10. We implicitly treat all of the capital-importing countries as identical; each
therefore chooses the same 0*. We could generalize by making the technologies differ
among the capital importers and thus obtain a different 0* for each. The capital ex-
porter would then respond to a suitably weighted average. No new insights would result
from such a generalization.
     11. We are, in the terminology of the bilateral monopoly problem, assuming that
the capital-importing countries behave according to the Cournot reaction curve and
that the capital-exporting country knows that this behavior will occur. Therefore, a
Stackelberg equilibrium is reached, with the capital-exporting country acting as the
leader. Hamada [1966j considers some other duopoly solutions for the related case of
a pure capital transfer.

capital-exporting country in this more general situation. In place of
equation (1.6) we obtain

(2.1) [FK — (1 — o*                 —L

        =       dO*                          dw* dKs
            _() {Fs_W*Ls+ [FK —(1 _0*)(Fk_Ls___)]—__j.
The equilibrium condition for the international firms, i.e.,
(2.2)           (1 — O)FK = (1    0)(1 —
implies that (2.1) can be rewritten as

(2.3)                 F,. + (1 — 0*)Ls

                                                  dK5 dO 1 — 0*
or, rearranging and using (1.13), as
            0—   Os                    L'FLKFLLdK'    dO* 1 —

     Equation (2.4) shows that the size of the optimal Os relative to
the given domestic tax rate 0 depends on the sign of dO*/dOs. This
dependence is shown more explicitly by rewriting (2.4) as
(2.5)

Os   =o+

                 1 —   0 i FdO*                        dO* 1 — O   dK
            +
                           jLF5_w*L5]/1+
Equation (2.5) demonstrates how the divergence of the optimal tax
on foreign source income from the tax on home country domestic in-
come results from the two factors we are discussing: the tendency of
the home country's tax policy to influence wages faced in the host
country and to influence host country tax policy.
     Specifically, the second term on the right side of (2.5) is the host
country wage factor, which was derived in the previous section (see
(1.17)). Since host country wages are always reduced by a restriction
622              QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

of the capital transfer, this term is unambiguously positive, tending
to make the optimal tax on foreign source income greater than the tax
on domestic income.
      Having isolated the host country wage factor, we know that the
last term of (2.5) is the host country tax effect. That is, dropping the
assumption of a fixed host country tax provides a further reason for
the optimal tax on foreign source income to differ from the domestic
tax. Since Fs — w*Ls and Fk are positive while dKs/dOs is negative,
the sign of this term is given by the sign of _(dO*/d05).12 The eco-
nomic reason for this is clear. If an increase in O causes a decrease in
0*, the home country should raise Os in order to benefit from a lower
rate of foreign taxation.
      If an increase in the foreign source income tax levied by the
capital-exporting country induces a decrease in the tax levied by the
capital-importing country (i.e., dO*/dOs <0), both the host country
wage factor and the host country tax factor operate in the same di-
rection. Therefore, foreign source income should be treated less fa-
vorably than domestic income. In fact, Os should be even larger than
the value that would be optimal with a fixed 0*. Conversely, if an in-
crease in the tax on foreign source income levied by the capital-ex-
porting country causes an increase in the tax levied by the capital-
importing country (i.e., dO*/dOs > 0), then the sign of (0 — Os) is am-
biguous. Whether the home country tax system should favor foreign
source income over domestic income depends on whether an increase
in the home country tax on foreign source income causes a sufficiently
large decline in foreign wages to compensate for the increased tax
imposed by the foreign country. The crucial questions for the capi-
tal-exporting country are the sign and (only if the sign is positive) the
magnitude of dO*/d05.
     To assess the response of 0* to 0, we must examine the op-
timization problem of the host country. The national income of the
capital-importing country is the sum of its own production (F*) and
the production of the subsidiary firms (Fe) minus the net-of-tax
profits that can be returned to the capital-exporting country:
(2.6) N* = F*(K*,L*           —
                                  L) + Fs(Ks,Ls) — (1 — O*)FkKs.
Totally differentiating (2.6) with respect to 0* yields the first-order
condition:


     12. This uses the stability condition d{(l — a*)(1 — Os)/dOs <0. If this were not
true, the capital-exporting country could benefit indefinitely by raising its tax rate.

    We can simplify this equation by using the condition for labor
market equilibrium in the host country:
(2.8)              F(K*,L* — Ls) = F(Ks,Ls).
Note first that this implies immediately that the first two terms of
(2.7) sum to zero and can be eliminated. Totally differentiating (2.8)
yields
(2.9)              _FLdLS = FLdLS + FSLKdKS
or
(2.10)             dLs = — [FK/(FL + FL)]dKs.
Using (2.10) to replace dLs/dOs in (2.7) by the corresponding term in
dKs/dO permits (2.7) to be written as

(2.11) {o*Fk + (1 — *)Ks FFLL            —                 + FkKS = 0.

Since constant returns to scale implies that (F-L)2 = FLL FkK, (2.11)
simplifies further to

     Instead of analyzing (2.12) any further, it is useful to develop an
explicit expression for dKs/dO*. We begin with the international
firms' first-order condition for capital allocation:
(2.14) (1 — 6*)(1 — Os)Fk(Ks,Ls) = (1 — O)FK(k — Ks,L)
and totally differentiate to obtain
(2.15)    (1 — O*)(1 — OS)[FkKdKS + FkLdLS] — (1 — Os)Fkd,9*
                                                  = —(1 — O)FKKdKS.

Using equation (2.10) to substitute for dLs and taking into account
that (FkL)2 FLFkK, we can rewrite (2.15) as

be expressed more symmetrically as

 For any constant returns to scale technology, —KFKKIFK = (1 — a)I(J,
 where a = FKKIF is the capital share and r is the elasticityof sub-
 stitution; of course, a and o are local values and not necessarily con-
 stants. Since K = K — KS, we can write the host country's optimum
 condition as

Since a Cobb-Douglas technology is the only case in which a remains
constant when KS and therefore K changes, it is simplest to consider
its implications first. With a a constant (and i = 1), equation (2.20)
 implies unambiguously that 0* is an increasing function of KS. A
 greater extent of capital exporting in the home country induces a
 higher optimal tax rate in the host country. Since a higher tax on
 foreign source investment income (Os) discourages capital exports,
 it follows immediately that a higher value of OS induces a lower value
 of 0*. As we emphasized above, this implies that the capital-exporting
 country should tax foreign source investment income more heavily
 than domestic investment income, i.e., that the optimal value of OS
 exceeds 0. We have thus proven the following:
 PRoPosITION 1. If the capital-exporting firms have a Cobb-Douglas
    technology in home production, the capital-exporting country
            THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN SOURCE INCOME                               625

       should tax foreign source investment income more heavily than
       domestic investment income.
     This proposition can be generalized to any plausible constant
elasticity of substitution technology in the capital-exporting coun-
try.13 Equation (2.20) can be rewritten as
                            0*
                                     =   1 —

(2.21)                      — 0*                F   K
The right-hand side is now a function of K only. Since r is a constant,
the left-hand side is an increasing function of 6*; for convenience we
denote it by Z. We can now examine dZ/dK. If dZ/dK < 0, an increase
in K implies a decrease in 0*. But since K = K — KS and dK/d0 <
0, an increase in 0 implies an increase in K. Thus, dZ/dK < 0 implies
that d0*/d0 = (dO*/dK)(dK/dOS) <0. The result established for the
Cobb-Douglas technology is therefore valid for any constant elasticity
of substitution technology if dZ/dK < 0.

                                    1—a              6*
Since 0* < 1, this will be satisfied wherever
(2.29)                            a < (7(1 + a).
Although this could in principle be false if the elasticity of substitution
were low enough, it is true for any empirically reasonable value of r.
Inequality (2.29) therefore implies that dZ/dK < 0 and thus dO*/dK
<0. An increase in Os by reducing capital exports and increasing K
thus lowers the host country's optimal tax rate: dO*/dOs < 0. From
this it follows that the capital-exporting country's optimal tax on
foreign source investment income exceeds the tax on domestic income.
We thus have proved the following:
PROPOSITION 2. If the capital-exporting firms have a constant elas-
   ticity of substitution production function with a> a/(1 + a), the
   capital-exporting country should tax foreign source income more
   heavily than domestic investment income.
    If the home country's foreign investment is sufficiently small that
changes in its tax rate have no effect on host country wages, the second
term in (2.5) is zero. The home country still has an incentive to favor
domestic investment over foreign investment with its tax policy.14

                         III. FOREIGN BORROWING
     Firms that invest abroad frequently also borrow in the host
country. In general, the amount of borrowing that a firm does in a
foreign country increases with the amount of its equity investment
there.15 The reason for this association between equity investment
     14. To obtain this result, it is, of course, necessary that dO*/dOs be negative. To
see that Propositions 1 and 2 continue to hold, it is necessary to observe that Q, given
by (2.13), equals zero when the host country wage is fixed. Therefore, by (2.18) the host
country tax response (2.19) is the same as when the host country wage is affected.
     15. Hartman [19761 provides evidence that on average each dollar of new equity
capital transferred from the United States to direct investment outside North America
is accompanied by borrowing an additional two dollars. Retained profits of subsidiaries
also contribute to the finance of such foreign investment.
            THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN SOURCE INCOME                                    627

and host country borrowing presumably reflects the impact of local
equity investment on the risk perceptions of both borrowers and
lenders.
      The real rate of interest that firms pay for such borrowed funds
is clearly less than the marginal product of investment in the sub-
sidiary firms.'6 This implies that each dollar of equity investment
transferred from the home country earns more for the home country
than the subsidiaries' marginal product of investment net of host
 country taxes. It is natural to ask: Does this "leverage gain" imply that
 foreign source investment income should be taxed more lightly than
 would be optimal if there were no borrowing?
      Consider the case in which the "full taxation after deduction"
 rule would be optimal if the foreign investment were financed only
 by equity, i.e., the case in which the host tax rate (0*) and the host
 wage rate (w*) are independent of the home country tax rate (0s)•
Assume for the moment that everyone in the capital-exporting-
country is risk-neutral with respect to the amount involved in the
foreign investment. If the home country applies the "full taxation after
deduction" rule, the firms will invest abroad until the net marginal
product of their equity investment abroad—including the leverage
gain but net of the host country tax—is equal to the marginal product
of equity in domestic investment. It is clear that this allocation of
capital is also optimal from the home country's point of view. The
leverage gain on overseas investment increases the optimal amount
of such investment but does not alter the marginal optimality con-
diti()n that marginal domestic and foreign investment should be
equally productive to the home country. With risk neutrality the
optimality of the "full taxation after deduction" rule is unaffected
by borrowing.
      This conclusion is unchanged when shareholders in the home
country are risk-averse if the government (i.e., the taxpayers in gen-
eral) has the same attitude about risky investments. If shareholders
are risk-averse, subsidiary firms will invest and borrow abroad until
the marginal net return on their leveraged equity—after adjusting
for the risk of foreign investment and borrowing—is equal to the
marginal risk-adjusted return that they receive at home. The "full
taxation after deduction" rule thus remains optimal with risk aversion
even if the tax rules affect the extent of foreign borrowing.
      16. It is optimal for firms to borrow until the marginal cost of debt capital equals
the marginal product of the investment. Since the interest rate is an increasing function
of the debt-equity ratio, the marginal cost of debt exceeds the interest rate. See Feld-
stein, Green, and Sheshinski [1979] for an analysis of the optimal debt-equity rates
in a closed economy.
628               QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

     Note finally that this conclusion ceases to hold if the government
has a different risk aversion than the shareholders. Consider, for ex-
ample, the case in which shareholders are risk-averse, while the gov-
ernment is not risk-averse with respect to its tax revenue.17 If a lower
tax rate on foreign source investment income increases both equity
investment abroad and foreign borrowing, this lower tax rate raises
the "leverage gain" to the capital-exporting country. If the share of
the gain that accrues to the home country tax revenue is not dis-
counted for its increased riskiness, this increase in borrowing repre-
sents a net national gain.

                                IV. CONCLUSION
     As we noted at the beginning of this paper, we are well aware of
the limitations of our simplified model. We believe, however, that we
have provided a framework for analyzing international taxation in
a world in which small countries adjust their tax rates in response to
the policies of large countries. The current analysis should be ex-
tended to incorporate the role of trade, the use of portfolio investment
and the multinational character of investment and tax competitive-
ness. The rapid growth of international investment points clearly to
the potential gains from a better understanding of these issues.

activities as effectively eliminating the risk on each such activity from the point of view
