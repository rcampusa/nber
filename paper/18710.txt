                                              ABSTRACT

In the nearly fifty years since the adoption of the Higher Education Act of 1965, financial aid programs
have grown in scale, expanded in scope, and multiplied in form. As a result, financial aid has become
the norm among college enrollees. The increasing size and complexity of the nation’s student aid system
has generated questions about effectiveness, heightened confusion among students and parents, and
raised concerns about how program rules may interact. In this article, we review what is known and
what is not known about how well various student aid programs work. We find evidence that lowering
costs can improve college access and completion, but this general rule is not without exception. For
example, the complexity of program eligibility and delivery appears to moderate the impact of aid,
and for students who have already decided to enroll, grants that link financial aid to academic achievement
appear to boost college outcomes more than do grants with no strings attached. Future research is likely
to focus on several issues: the importance of program design and delivery, whether there are unanticipated
interactions between programs, and to what extent program effects vary across different types of students.

On November 8, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Higher Education Act of

1965, which firmly established the federal government as the primary provider of financial aid

for college. In his remarks that day at Southwestern Texas State College, his alma mater,

President Johnson said, “To thousands of young men and women, this act means the path of

knowledge is open to all that have the determination to walk it…. It means that a high school

senior anywhere in this great land of ours can apply to any college or any university in any of the

50 States and not be turned away because his family is poor.”1


In the nearly fifty years that have passed since the Higher Education Act was adopted, college

enrollment has expanded dramatically and average aid per student has grown even faster (figure

1).2 Full-time-equivalent undergraduate enrollment more than doubled, from about 6.2 million in

1971–72 to 14.2 million in 2010–11, while average aid per student more than tripled, from

$3,437 to $12,455 (in constant 2010 dollars).3 The increase in aid per student is driven primarily

by the expanding reach of the federal programs, which now flow to a more diverse range of

students than was anticipated when the programs were first conceived. The early programs were

squarely focused on “traditional” students—young, recent high school graduates enrolled in

college on a full-time basis. Federal aid, delivered primarily b the U.S. Department of Education

was also focused on students with fairly low incomes. Government aid for students was

delivered primarily by the U.S. Department of Education.4

                                        [Figure 1 near here]



On all of these dimensions, student aid has undergone a transformation. Aid now flows not only

to traditional college students, but also to part-time students, older students, and students who

never graduated from high school. Today, aid is available not only to low-income students but



                                                                                                     2
also to middle-class (and even high-income) families, in the form of subsidized loans and tax

credits. And government aid is provided not only by the U.S. Department of Education but also

by the U.S. Department of Treasury and by state governments. Several other forms of

government support, including work-study programs, and private aid are also available.

Altogether, aid to undergraduates students totaled nearly $190 billion in the 2010–11 school

year, with the majority of aid ($147 billion) coming from government sources.



The growing magnitude of government expenditures on student aid has justified growing interest

in its effectiveness. Policy makers and taxpayers want to know the returns on their enormous

investment: does student aid really influence educational outcomes? Or does it simply subsidize

students for doing what they would have done anyway? The increasing variety in the forms taken

by aid, in the students who receive it, and in the agents who deliver it has made it increasingly

difficult to give a simple answer to the question of aid effectiveness.



Forty years ago, the main question asked about student aid was “Does it work?”—with “it”

generally meaning Pell Grants and “work” generally referring to increases in initial college

enrollments. Now, to understand the effectiveness of student aid, one needs to consider the wide

array of grants, loans, and tax benefits administered by multiple agencies and levels of

government. But to the extent that the form, design, and delivery of aid matter—as all evidence

indicates they do—it may be difficult to extrapolate the effects of one program to another.

Similarly, as college enrollments have risen, policy makers increasingly ask not just whether aid

increases initial enrollment, but also whether it increases persistence, performance, and

completion, as well as whether it affects choices about where to attend, what to study, and what




                                                                                                    3
to do after graduation. Thus, asking whether aid “works” now depends on both which program

and which outcome is examined. In some cases, researchers do not have definitive answers, but

can only make educated guesses about effectiveness based on related evidence from similar

programs.



Moreover, students today are a much more heterogeneous group than they were forty years ago,

and the effect of a given program may vary by student characteristics such as income, age, and

family status. Whether aid “works” may depend on who is receiving the aid and what outcomes

they aim to achieve through postsecondary education. Coaxing an eighteen-year-old high school

graduate into enrolling full-time at a four-year college is a very different task from encouraging a

thirty-five-year-old displaced worker to enroll in a part-time certificate program to strengthen her

job skills. The same form of federal aid—Pell Grants—funds both types of schooling for both

populations, yet it may well be that Pell Grants are more effective in one case than the other.

Where the evidence allows, we discuss heterogeneity in the effects of programs across groups of

students who differ in age, income, or educational background, but in most cases the available

evidence focuses only on average program effects.



Finally, the explosion in the variety and reach of student aid implies that the environment in

which students and families make their decisions is increasingly complex. With dozens of tax

and aid programs available, two-thirds of students are now eligible for some sort of discount on

their college costs.5 For these students, the net price of college (tuition and fees less any grant

aid) differs from its sticker price. In fact, despite steadily rising tuition prices, net prices were

lower in 2010–2011 than they were in 2005–2006.6 It is tuition prices, however, that make




                                                                                                        4
headlines, in part because they are so much easier to communicate than net price. With the

proliferation of aid and tax programs, families cannot easily know in advance how much college

costs. Misperceptions about the real cost may be particularly consequential for first-generation

college students, whose families have no experience with the aid system. Research shows that

students are often unaware of the aid for which they are eligible and that they estimate tuition

costs to be two to three times higher than the true levels.7 If families do not know about a price

subsidy, they cannot respond to it.



In this article, we describe the evolution of student aid over the past few decades, focusing on the

largest programs and providing a broad overview of the rest. We then discuss whether these

programs increase college enrollment, persistence, and completion (the central measures of

effectiveness about which we have the most evidence), noting impacts on other outcomes where

available. We first spend some time laying out the methodological challenges facing researchers

in this arena, in part to explain why the evidence is sometimes so thin. We then offer some

lessons about student aid policy that we believe are supported by the existing evidence. We close

with a discussion of the remaining gaps in knowledge about the effectiveness of student aid.



The Changing Landscape of Financial Aid

The major programs that subsidize college costs for undergraduates are listed in table 1, together

with the totals for each program (adjusted for inflation and expressed in 2010 dollars) for

selected years between 1990 and 2010. The federal loan programs and the Pell Grant were the

two largest sources of aid for college throughout this period. Loans have grown more rapidly

than grants: loan volume was five times higher in 2010 than in 1990, while Pell volume was four




                                                                                                     5
times higher. Grants from colleges are the third largest source of aid; they more than tripled over

this period. The education tax benefits came on the scene in the late 1990s and are now a major

source of funding for college. The reasons for the particularly large increase in the federal aid

programs between 2005–06 and 2010–11 are discussed in detail in the next section.

                                        [Table 1 near here]



The federal programs established in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 are known

collectively as “Title IV aid” and include the precursors to Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, and

Federal Work-Study. Title IV aid also includes a variety of smaller programs that have waxed

and waned over the years. The following discussion focuses on the largest sources of

government aid in table 1: Pell Grants, federal loans, education tax benefits, and state grant

programs.



[B]The Pell Grant

The Higher Education Act of 1965 established the Educational Opportunity Grant Program,

which allocated funds directly to colleges that committed to identifying and recruiting students

with “exceptional financial need.”8 In 1972, the program was split into the Supplemental

Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) program, a relatively small program that delivers funds

directly to colleges, and the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (BEOG) program, which

delivers funds directly to students. The BEOG program, renamed the Pell Grant in 1980 after

Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, expanded eligibility to students attending part time, as

well as to those in vocational education or community colleges. Between 1972 and 1992, college

enrollments rose by 44 percent, but the number of Pell Grant recipients grew twentyfold as a




                                                                                                    6
result of these more generous eligibility criteria.9 Many of these new Pell recipients were adults

returning to school: the proportion of recipients classified as independent (age twenty-four or

older, married, or with children of their own) grew over this period from just 13 percent to 60

percent, where it remains today.10 As noted in the article in this volume by Sandy Baum and her

colleagues, the proportion of Pell recipients who are over age 30 has tripled over the past 30

years, from 8 percent in the late 1970s to 24 percent in 2009-10.11



While there is no explicit income limit on Pell receipt, the vast majority of recipients have family

incomes below $50,000, which in 2010 was slightly above the median of U.S. household

incomes.12 The definition of who is “needy” under the Pell rules has occasionally shifted,

sweeping into Pell eligibility students from the middle of the income distribution. Some of these

shifts resulted from explicit efforts to open the program to a wider range of incomes: the Middle

Income Student Assistance Act of 1978, as its name suggests, expanded eligibility for Pell

Grants to middle-income families. More subtly, increases in the maximum Pell grant award (the

usual focus of legislative debates over Title IV funding) bump up the average grant of current

recipients but also expand eligibility for the Pell further up the income distribution. This dynamic

has been clear in recent years, when the Pell maximum rose substantially, from $4,689 in 2008–

09 to $5,550 in 2010–11 (in constant 2010 dollars). Over the same period, during which median

family incomes were dropping, the share of Pell recipients with income over $50,000 rose from 6

percent to 9 percent.13



Figure 2 shows changes over time in the number of Pell recipients and the average Pell award

among recipients. Adjusting for inflation, the average Pell Grant was flat or decreasing for most




                                                                                                     7
of the period between 1976–77 and 1995–96, but large increases since 2008 have raised the

average Pell award to a historic high of $3,828. Even these large recent increases, however, have

barely kept pace with rising tuition prices: the “purchasing power” of the Pell actually declined

slightly from 33 percent of public four-year tuition in 2008-09 to 32 percent in 2011–12.14

                                       [Figure 2 near here]



In 2008, legislation was passed that increased the maximum grant and expanded summer awards.

These changes, combined with higher college enrollments and weak economic conditions that

pushed more families into Pell eligibility, drove Pell expenditures to record levels. Pell volume

increased by more than 90 percent between 2008–09 and 2010–11, with the number of recipients

rising from 6.2 million to 9.1 million and the average grant among recipients increasing from

$2,945 to $3,828.15



Federal Loans

The Stafford Loan, the largest student loan program, was named after Vermont senator and

education advocate Robert T. Stafford in 1988, but it dates to 1965, when the guaranteed student

loan program was introduced. In the original program, the government paid the interest on these

loans during college, loans were limited to low-income students, and loan volume was only a

third of grant volume. The first spike in loan volume followed enactment of the Middle Income

Student Assistance Act of 1978, which opened eligibility for subsidized loans to all

undergraduates, regardless of need.16 Loan volume exploded, as families seeking cheap credit—

interest rates on mortgages hovered around 15 percent at the time—flooded into the student loan




                                                                                                    8
program. The need requirement on subsidized loans was reinstated in 1981 to contain ballooning

costs.



Changes to the loan program in 1992 resulted in a sharp uptick in volume and unabated growth

over the following twenty years. In 1992, an unsubsidized version of Stafford Loans was created,

open to all students regardless of need. The government does not pay the interest on

unsubsidized Stafford Loans while students are enrolled, but both subsidized and unsubsidized

Stafford loans offer interest rates, forbearance protections, and flexible repayment options that

make them substantially more appealing than private student loans. Dependent students are

allowed to borrow $31,000 in federal loans over the course of their undergraduate career. For

those deemed sufficiently needy, $23,000 of this total can take the form of subsidized loans. A

student cannot take out this full amount in a single year; there are also annual limits on

borrowing (of $2,625 to $7,500 depending upon the student’s undergraduate standing).

Starting in 1992, parents also were allowed to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, including

room and board for full-time students, through PLUS loans, which had been established in 1980

(before 1992, these loans were capped at $4,000). These loans are open to the parents of all

college students, regardless of need. Unlike Stafford Loans, PLUS loans require a credit check.

Parents are responsible for loan payments, which begin immediately. Over half of college loans

initiated each year are now through the PLUS and unsubsidized Stafford Loan programs. 17



Rising levels of student debt have raised fears among some commentators of a “higher education

bubble” that may be exposing taxpayers to higher-than-recognized default risks, akin to the

housing bubble that preceded the financial crisis of 2008.18 The aggregate volume of outstanding




                                                                                                     9
student loans (both federal and private) surpassed $1 trillion in late 2011. This figure, which has

received considerable press attention, nonetheless should be viewed in the context of an

expanding population of current and former college students.19 On a per-student basis, average

loan debt at graduation has been virtually flat over the past decade.20 Between 2000 and 2009,

the share of graduates with loans has remained stable at 65 percent, and the average cumulative

debt among borrowers has held steady at around $25,000.21 Ninety percent of students who

receive bachelor’s degrees graduate with less than $40,000 of debt, and approximately one-third

borrow nothing at all.22



Compared with other graduates, those with more than $40,000 in undergraduate debt are 20

percentage points more likely to have attended schools costing $20,000 or more a year (including

room and board), and 20 percentage points less likely to have attended a public institution. Ten

percent attended a private for-profit institution, compared with only 1 percent of their lesser-

borrowing peers. News articles tend to focus on the most extreme cases, such as graduates with

$100,000 in debt. However, only 0.1 percent of college entrants, and 0.3 percent of bachelor’s

degree recipients, accumulate more than $100,000 in undergraduate student debt.23



Tax Benefits for Education

In the late 1990s, the federal government began using the tax code to subsidize college costs. The

largest and most expensive of these programs were the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime

Learning Credit, which allowed families of college students to offset their educational costs with

tax credits of up to $1,500 a year.24 These programs primarily benefited middle- and upper-

income families, for several reasons. The credits were not refundable, meaning that low-income




                                                                                                   10
families with no tax liability would not benefit even if they otherwise qualified for the credit.

Further, eligible tuition expenses were reduced by any grant aid; as a result, a student who

attended the typical two-year college and was poor enough to receive the maximum Pell Grant

received no tax credit. Finally, the income cutoffs for eligibility for the subsidies were set so high

that less than10 percent of filing households exceeded them.25



In 2009, the Hope Scholarship was expanded and renamed the American Opportunity Tax Credit

(AOTC).26 The maximum benefit was raised to $2,500, with $1,000 refundable. Eligible

expenses were expanded to include course-related books and supplies. Families were allowed to

claim the credit for four years of undergraduate education instead of only two. The maximum

benefit under the Lifetime Learning Credit was also raised, to $2,000. Spending on the AOTC

was nearly $19 billion in 2010, compared with $35 billion for the Pell program.27 A key

disadvantage of the tax credits is that they are not delivered at the time of enrollment, but up to

eighteen months later, when a family files its taxes for the relevant school year. This delay may

limit the ability of the tax benefit to influence enrollment or persistence, because low-income

individuals who most need the assistance may not be able to wait that long for the money.



Other tax breaks are available for current or former college students. Since 2002, families not

claiming one of the education tax credits have been able to deduct up to $4,000 in tuition fees

from income (even if they do not itemize). Although the benefit officially expired at the end of

2011, it has been retroactively reinstated in the past and may yet be resurrected.28 Additionally,

up to $2,500 in interest on student loans is deductible from taxable income, for households with

incomes up to $75,000 (single) or $150,000 (married). The federal Coverdell Education Savings




                                                                                                      11
Account and state 529 programs allow annual, after–tax contributions (up to $2,000 a year for

the Coverdell; the more generous contribution limits and state tax treatment of the 529 vary by

state); earnings on the accounts are untaxed if withdrawals are used for educational expenses.29

The benefits of these accounts rise sharply with income, because those with the highest marginal

tax rates have the most capital income to shelter from taxation.30 These additional deductions

have little to no value for low-income families, who often take the standard deduction rather than

itemize and who face relatively low marginal tax rates.



Finally, while children are generally considered independent for tax purposes after age eighteen,

the age limit is extended to twenty-three if the child is enrolled in school. This tax break allows

families to save up to several thousand dollars a year for each child enrolled in college because

parents can claim a dependent exemption for the student (thus reducing their taxable income), or

qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (a refundable credit for low-income families). 31



State Grant Programs

Traditionally, states have helped to keep college affordable by subsidizing public colleges, which

in turn charge lower tuition prices than they would without these subsidies. In recent years, state

support for higher education has decreased and shifted from subsidizing institutions toward

subsidizing students. In 2010–11, state and local appropriations per full-time-equivalent (FTE)

student at public colleges averaged $7,200, down 17 percent from $8,300 in 1980–81 (figures in

constant 2010 dollars).32 Just in the past decade, the share of institutional revenues coming from

state and local appropriations has fallen from 56 percent to 42 percent at public, four-year




                                                                                                      12
colleges.33 One potential explanation is that states strapped by costs of prisons, Medicaid, and K-

12 education see postsecondary education as the one place they can raise prices.34



In addition to charging artificially low prices to all students, states also offer scholarships to

individual students. States have more than doubled their expenditures on grant aid since 1980

(from $285 to $640 per FTE).35 Still, the increases in state grant aid have not been large enough

to make up for the decline in institutional subsidies. Most of these state grants are small-scale

programs. But, beginning in the early 1990s, more than a dozen states established broad-based

“merit aid” programs, the best-known of which is Georgia’s HOPE scholarship. These programs

typically award full tuition and fees at state public universities (or in some cases, an equivalent

voucher to attend a private school) to residents who maintain a minimum grade point average

(GPA) in high school and college. Many require a GPA of 3.0, not a particularly high

threshold—in 1999, 40 percent of high school seniors met this standard.36 These programs now

represent more than a quarter of all state grant aid nationwide and are the primary source of state

aid in several states.



How Do Students Apply for Aid?

To apply for Title IV aid, students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(FAFSA). This form, which most students now complete online, is also required for many state

and institutional aid programs (some institutions also require more detailed additional

information). The form requests information about students’ own income and savings, their

parents’ income and savings, their receipt of various other types of governmental assistance, and

the amounts of other income and liabilities (such as education tax credits claimed, child support




                                                                                                      13
paid or received, and other “money received or paid on your behalf”).37 This information is

based upon the preceding tax year (for example, 2011 for students entering college during the

2012–13 academic year), meaning that high school students would not be able to file a FAFSA

until at least January of their senior year, or after taxes are filed.



Once the FAFSA is filed, the information is processed under one of eight formulas, depending

upon family income, whether a student is classified as dependent or independent, whether the

student has children, whether anyone in the household received benefits from another federal

means-tested program, and what type of federal income tax form the family is required to use.38

The output of this process is an “expected family contribution” (EFC), which is provided to both

the students and the schools to which they have applied. While integral to aid eligibility, the EFC

can be difficult to interpret: it is described to students as “not the amount of money that your

family must provide…[but rather] an index that colleges use to determine how much financial

aid you would receive if you were to attend their school.”39 Before 2008, the EFC was the only

information on federal aid that students received upon completing the FAFSA; online applicants

now also receive an estimate of their Pell eligibility.



Schools use the EFC (and potentially other information from the FAFSA or additional

institutional aid application forms) to determine students’ eligibility for federal, state, and

institutional aid. Students must wait for schools to admit them and present them with details of

their aid package. Different schools may offer the same student different amounts of aid. For

example, colleges are not required to offer students the maximum Stafford Loans for which they

are eligible.




                                                                                                   14
Complexity, delay, and lack of transparency in the aid process mean that students and their

families have little idea how much aid they will receive until after they have applied to college,

which students may never do if they think they cannot afford to go. The lack of information

about available aid is acute: a recent national survey of 600 Americans aged twenty-six to thirty-

four found that fewer than three in ten individuals without a college degree had any idea what a

FAFSA was.40 Although the U.S. Department of Education has taken steps to simplify the

application process in recent years—by promoting online application (which enables students to

skip questions that do not apply to them), for example, and facilitating links with income tax data

(which is required for the FAFSA but can be provided directly from the Internal Revenue

Service)—the process remains daunting to many students and families.41



Federal tax benefits are distributed in an entirely separate process, through the annual filing of

income tax returns. Colleges provide documentation directly to the IRS of a student’s

enrollment and tuition payments. A disadvantage of the education tax benefits is that they are

distributed only after costs are incurred; on the other hand, for many families the income tax

form is easier to complete than the FAFSA.



Challenges in Evaluating the Effectiveness of Financial Aid

The theory behind student aid is straightforward: more people will buy a product (college) when

its price (tuition) is lower. Price drops, demand increases: that is a lesson taught in any

introductory economics course. While Econ 101 clearly predicts that financial aid should

increase schooling, the magnitude of the impact is an empirical question. And because aid is




                                                                                                     15
offered to students on the basis of characteristics that may independently affect college

enrollment and completion rates, such as income or academic performance in high school, the

effect of the aid the effect of these other factors can be difficult to untangle.



Take the example of Pell Grants, which flow primarily to students from families with income

below $50,000. Students from such families are less likely to attend college in the first place, for

myriad reasons: they disproportionately attended lower-quality high schools, have weaker

academic skills, and are less likely to have parents who went to college.42 Those who are eligible

for a Pell Grant have lower college attendance rates than those who are ineligible, but that does

not imply that Pell Grants actually lower college attendance. Those who are eligible for Pell

Grants are simply less likely to go to college for reasons other than their Pell eligibility.



Now take the example of state merit-based scholarships. Many states use these grants as a tool to

attract high-achieving students. Students eligible for these scholarships are very likely to go to

college, given their very strong academic skills. In this case, a comparison of eligible and

ineligible students would overstate the effect of aid. Those who are eligible for merit

scholarships are likely to go to college for reasons other than their scholarship eligibility.



Researchers typically use statistical methods that are more sophisticated than the paragraphs

above would imply. But the same problem plagues the more technical studies: those who are

eligible for aid tend to be quite different from those who are not. In theory, researchers can use

statistical tools to control for any important differences between aid recipients and nonrecipients,

but in practice such research is unlikely. Why? First, complete data on relevant characteristics is




                                                                                                     16
rarely available. For example, parental wealth affects schooling decisions, both directly and

through eligibility for aid, but comprehensive measures of parental (and extended family) wealth

are rarely revealed in survey data, especially among adults who have completed their education.

Second, and even more fundamentally, students who do receive aid may differ from those who

do not on other, unobservable dimensions. As an example, imagine that a sample of first-year

Pell Grant recipients could be matched to other first-year students at the same school, with

similar age, race, gender, family income, and so on. The question would remain: if these students

appear so similar in all of their other characteristics, including family income, which is the

primary determinant of Pell Grant eligibility, why did some receive a grant while others did not?

Several explanations for this difference may be possible, but most of them will suggest some

important unobservable difference between the groups. For example, it may be that the recipients

were more committed to a significant period of enrollment, compared with individuals of similar

income and ability who did not apply.



The ideal solution is a randomized, controlled trial, in which aid amounts are randomly assigned

to a pool of potential college students, who are then followed up after a certain period of time to

compare outcomes between those receiving more and those receiving less assistance. The

randomized trial is the gold standard of research methods in medicine and is increasingly used in

the social sciences. Randomized trials have been used to evaluate the effect of job training

programs on employment rates, the effect of smaller classes on test scores, and the effect of Head

Start on children’s emotional and intellectual development. The Education Sciences Reform Act

of 2002 elevated the randomized trial as the preferred method for education, especially for




                                                                                                  17
research funded by the U.S. Department of Education. Several randomized trials in financial aid

are discussed later in this article.



Many policy-relevant questions about aid have yet to be addressed with a randomized trial,

however. The next best approach is “quasi-experimental,” in which the researcher identifies a

source of naturally occurring but idiosyncratic variation in access to aid. When researchers can

identify a group that has access to a program and a group that does not for reasons that are, if not

explicitly random, at least unrelated to any observable or unobservable differences between the

groups, then a comparison of outcomes for these two groups can yield causal estimates of aid

effectiveness.



Financial aid eligibility rules have themselves proved to be a rich source of such plausibly

random variation. For example, many aid programs have sharp cutoffs for eligibility, with those

above specific levels of income or below certain grade point averages being ineligible. Students

directly above and below these sharp breaks are likely to be very similar, but the aid that they are

offered is quite different. In a regression-discontinuity analysis, researchers compare the

schooling decisions of individuals just above and just below these cutoffs and attribute any

difference to the causal effect of the difference in aid eligibility. Another quasi-experimental

approach exploits sharp changes in aid eligibility. When a program is introduced (or eliminated)

for one group but not another, researchers can compare changes in outcomes before and after the

policy change across the two groups. Susan Dynarski used this method—known as a “difference-

in-difference” approach—to examine the effect of the Social Security student benefit program;

we discuss this study below.43




                                                                                                   18
Lessons from the Research on Financial Aid Effectiveness

Below we discuss four major lessons that can be taken from the research on financial aid

effectiveness, drawing primarily on experimental and quasi-experimental analyses. The rigor of

these two approaches does not come without cost. In many cases, running an experiment or

identifying a naturally occurring quasi-experiment means narrowing the analysis to a subset of

treated and untreated individuals, potentially limiting the ability to generalize the results to other

groups. Thus, we also place the findings from the most rigorous studies in the context of the

broader nonexperimental literature, where such literature is available.



Lesson 1: Money Matters for College Access

The first lesson, grounded in more than thirty years of research, is that money matters for college

access. As predicted by economic theory, when students know that they will receive a discount,

enrollment rates increase. In 1988, Larry Leslie and Paul Brinkman reviewed several dozen

nonexperimental studies and concluded that a $1,000 decrease in net price was associated with a

3- to 5-percentage-point increase in college attendance.44



Susan Dynarski examined the elimination of the Social Security Student Benefit (SSSB)

program, using a difference-in-difference analysis. From 1965 to 1982, the Social Security

Administration paid for millions of students to go to college. Under the SSSB program, the

children of deceased, disabled, or retired Social Security beneficiaries received monthly

payments while in college. At the program’s peak, 12 percent of young full-time college students

were receiving these benefits. In 1981, Congress voted to eliminate the program. Except for the




                                                                                                    19
introduction of the Pell Grant program in the early 1970s, and the various GI Bills, elimination of

this program is the largest and sharpest change in grant aid for college that has ever occurred in

the United States. Dynarksi found that college attendance among the affected group fell by more

than a third after the grant program ended, suggesting that the availability of grant aid does in

fact increase college enrollment rates above what they would be otherwise.



Several quasi-experimental studies of large state merit aid programs have also found significant

positive impacts on enrollment, as did a regression-discontinuity study of the Tuition Assistance

Program in the District of Columbia and two separate studies of the mid-century G.I. Bills.

Taken together, the quasi-experimental evidence suggests that an additional $1,000 of grant aid

may increase college enrollment by 4 percentage points.45



Grant assistance affects not only whether students attend college but also where they choose to

go. For students applying to an elite East Coast institution who also applied for financial aid, an

additional 10 percent in grant aid increased the probability of matriculation by 8.6 percent. 46 This

estimate was obtained using a regression-discontinuity design, in which students were ranked

according to the strength of their application, and the matriculation rate of students just below

discrete aid-eligibility cutoffs was compared with the rate of those just above the cutoff.



Like grant aid, federal tax benefits provide money for college that never needs to be repaid.

Evidence regarding the enrollment effects of the tax benefits is limited to just two studies. An

early study using a difference-in-difference approach—comparing financially eligible and

ineligible families before and after the introduction of the Hope and Lifetime Learning tax




                                                                                                     20
credits—found no evidence that the benefits influenced likelihood of enrollment.47 A more

recent study used a similar difference-in-difference strategy, but included the new American

Opportunity Tax Credit in its analysis and also took advantage of more accurate data on income

eligibility.48 This study found effects of roughly the same magnitude as has been found for grant

assistance: the probability of college enrollment rose by 3 percentage points for every $1,000 of

tax-based aid. It is possible that earlier analysis simply could not discern a true effect because

some families were incorrectly classified as eligible or ineligible in the data, watering down the

estimated difference between groups. Or it is possible that the new refundable American

Opportunity Tax Credit has different effects from its predecessors, because it extends benefits to

families with zero or low tax liability.



Until recently much of the financial aid literature focused on college entry, rather than outcomes

after enrollment. Several recent studies suggest that financial aid can also improve persistence

and completion.49 These studies, however, generally examine grant programs with specific

academic achievement requirements for scholarship renewal. The results of these academic

incentive grants do not necessarily generalize to grant programs with no strings attached, a

caveat discussed under Lesson 3.



Lesson 2: Program Complexity Undermines Aid Effectiveness

While we conclude that aid matters for college enrollment, that does not imply that all aid

programs are equally effective. For example, the programs discussed above that have clearly

demonstrated positive impacts on college enrollment tend to have simple, easy-to-understand

eligibility rules and application procedures. The eligibility and application rules for Pell




                                                                                                     21
Grants—the nation’s largest grant program—are comparatively complex, requiring students to

submit to the lengthy and burdensome FAFSA process for determining their eligibility.



A recent experimental study by Eric Bettinger and colleagues provides dramatic evidence that

the complexity of the financial aid application process can itself become a significant barrier to

college access.50 In the experiment, low-income families who visited a tax-preparation center

were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a “full treatment” group that received both

personalized information about eligibility for financial aid as well as personal assistance with

completing and submitting the FAFSA; an “information-only” group that received personalized

information about financial aid eligibility but no application assistance; and a control group that

received a brochure with general information about college costs, financial aid, and the value of

going to college. The full treatment, which took less than ten minutes and cost less than $100 per

participant, increased immediate college entry rates by 8 percentage points (24 percent) for high

school seniors and 1.5 percentage points (16 percent) among independent participants with no

previous college experience. After three years, participants in the full-treatment group had

accumulated significantly more time in college than the control group. They also were much

more likely to have received a Pell Grant.



This experimental evidence, which demonstrates the importance of program design and delivery,

may help explain why studies have found less conclusive evidence regarding the enrollment

impact of Pell Grants than for aid programs with simpler eligibility and application procedures.

The broadest quasi-experimental study of Pell Grants used a difference-in-difference approach to

compare trends in college enrollment before and after increases in Pell Grant funding, between




                                                                                                     22
students who became eligible for increased funding and those who remained ineligible

throughout the period. Consistent with previous nonexperimental findings, this study found no

detectable effect of the introduction of Pell Grants on college enrollments for eligible (low-

income) populations.51



Other studies have found evidence of Pell impacts for specific subsets of the population: one

study found that Pell Grants increased enrollment of older “nontraditional” students, while a

study by Bettinger, described in the next section, found weak suggestive evidence that the grants

contributed to student persistence, at least among students who had already enrolled in college.52

Both findings are consistent with a story in which information and experience with bureaucracy

is important: older individuals may have learned about the Pell program over time, and

continuing students may learn about the program once they enroll in school. Those who have

recently graduated from high school but not yet enrolled may be the least informed and least

equipped to figure out the process.



This limited evidence on the impact of Pell Grants is not definitive (the US Department of

Education recently initiated a randomized trial to study the effect of further expansions of the

Pell Grant, which may help to resolve this uncertainty). But at a minimum, the FAFSA

experiment by Eric Bettinger and colleagues has only heightened existing concerns that

complexity and confusion surrounding the Pell eligibility and application process may be

obscuring its benefits and dampening its impact among the individuals who need it most—those

who are on the fence about college for financial reasons.53




                                                                                                   23
Lesson 3: Academic Incentives Appear to Augment Aid Effectiveness, Particularly after

Enrollment

A third emerging lesson from the literature is that achievement incentives appear to increase

effectiveness, particularly when the focus is on improving college performance and completion

(as opposed to simply access). Two randomized experiments have examined the results of

linking financial aid to specific GPA or credit accumulation requirements. One study by MDRC,

examining a sample of low-income, primarily minority, female enrollees at two community

colleges in Louisiana, found that performance-based scholarships increased GPAs and

persistence.54 On the basis of these findings, MDRC initiated replication studies examining

variations of this intervention in six other states; early indicators appear to reinforce the findings

of the initial study.55 An experiment at a large college in Canada found that a performance-based

scholarship did in fact increase GPAs, though only for females who received academic support

services in addition to the financial incentive.56 While the lack of significant impacts for the full

sample may be surprising, again there is suggestive evidence that program complexity may

undermine effectiveness: a subsequent experiment with cash incentives at the same Canadian

institution again found no effects overall, but found some significant positive effects only for

those students receiving grades above the minimum threshold established for the incentive, with

larger effects on grade outcomes for students who could correctly describe the program’s rules.57



To the extent that performance-based scholarships encourage students to devote more time and

energy to their studies, an important question is whether the student may be driven purely by the

relaxation of financial constraints, rather than by the performance incentives per se. A quasi-

experimental study by Judith Scott-Clayton examines this question, in the context of West




                                                                                                     24
Virginia’s PROMISE scholarship, which at the time provided free tuition and fees for up to four

years to academically eligible students as long as they maintained a minimum GPA and course

load in college.58 The scholarship increased five-year graduation rates by 4 percentage points

and on-time graduation rates by nearly 7 percentage points. Moreover, the achievement

incentives were an important mechanism driving these increases. The scholarship increased

GPAs and credits completed in the first three years of college, but in the fourth and final year of

the scholarship—while students are still receiving the money but no longer face the achievement

incentives—the program’s effect disappeared.



In contrast, several studies of pure grants (with weak or no achievement incentives) have found

less conclusive evidence of positive effects on persistence and graduation rates. Two quasi-

experimental studies found suggestive but inconclusive evidence that pure grant aid improves

college persistence and completion.59 In contrast, a regression-discontinuity study of the Gates

Millennium Scholarship (GMS) found no evidence that the grants increased college retention or

credit accumulation for its highly qualified, low-income minority participants (although it did

reduce student employment and student loan debt).60



The most rigorous and broadly relevant evidence on the post-enrollment effects of grant aid

comes from a randomized evaluation of the Wisconsin Scholars Grant, a privately run

scholarship program that provided $3,500 grants to Pell-eligible students already enrolled at

public universities in Wisconsin. The study found no effects on persistence, grade point

averages, or credit accumulation after three years for the full sample.61 However, for a subset of




                                                                                                   25
students entering college with a high risk of dropout (based on high school achievement and

other background characteristics), the effects seemed to be more positive.



Academic incentives may improve not only performance after college entry but college

preparation and initial enrollment as well. For example, a study of the introduction of

Tennessee’s state merit aid program, which provided large college scholarships to students with

minimum high school GPA and SAT/ACT test scores, found that the scholarship significantly

improved high school achievement as measured by ACT test scores (the increases in test scores

were too large to be explained simply by increases in retesting).62 A similar study of a program

in Texas that paid eleventh- and twelfth-grade students and teachers for earning passing scores

on Advanced Placement (AP) exams found that the policy not only improved AP exam scores

but increased college enrollment rates as well as college academic performance even for those

students who would have gone to college anyway.63



Lesson 4: Evidence on the Effect of Loans Is Limited but Suggests Design Is Important

A fourth lesson is that even though loans are unpopular, they are a critical element in college

financing, and their design might be significantly improved to minimize students’ repayment

risks and better communicate both risks and protections upfront. Very little rigorous research

has examined how the availability of student loans affects college enrollment, performance, or

completion. Susan Dynarski found suggestive, but ultimately inconclusive evidence that student

loan expansions in the United States in the early 1990s led to increased college attendance.64

Donald Heller reviewed the nonexperimental literature on whether loans increase college access

and concluded that the findings “can at best be described as mixed.”65 In part, this mixed picture




                                                                                                  26
may reflect inconsistencies in some researchers’ choice of the counterfactual: the studies may be

comparing $1 of loans with $1 of grants, $1 of work-study, or no aid at all. Based on the

nonexperimental evidence, Heller concluded that college enrollments are not as sensitive to loans

as to grants. This is unsurprising given that loans are not worth as much to students.

Nonetheless, since they also cost the government only a few cents on the dollar to provide, it

remains an open question whether loans provide bigger, smaller, or the same “bang for the buck”

as grant aid does.66



More rigorous evidence from a dramatic policy change at one selective northeastern university

suggests that students’ career choices, if not their enrollment decisions, are influenced by levels

of student debt. Jesse Rothstein and Cecilia Rouse examined the consequences of this

institution’s decision to replace loans in students’ financial aid packages with increased

institutional grant aid.67 In two stages, the university in 1998 eliminated student loans for

incoming students from low-income families and then eliminated loans for all students receiving

aid in 2001. Students in cohorts that entered after the policy was fully implemented not only

graduated with about $11,000 less in debt than cohorts that entered before the policy change but

also were significantly more likely to take jobs in nonprofit and public service sectors.



Debt aversion may be one important explanation for why loans do not appear to affect access as

much as grants do: some students simply dislike being in debt, even when that debt enables an

investment with high average returns. An experiment analyzed by Erica Field found strong

evidence that students (in this case, students admitted to law school) are debt averse.68 Admitted

students at one school were randomly assigned to receive either a public service scholarship that




                                                                                                  27
would convert to a loan if students did not pursue public service after graduation, or a loan that

would be forgiven if students decided to pursue public service after graduation. The two

treatments were financially equivalent, yet framing the program as a “loan that would be

forgiven if you pursue public service” was much less effective in inducing students to public

service than a “grant that will convert to a loan if you do not pursue public service.” Like the

FAFSA simplification study, Field’s findings provide further evidence that the details of

program design and marketing can be critical.



Given the widespread reliance on student loans, a more interesting question than whether they

increase college enrollment and completion at all is whether some types of loans are more

effective than others. Are there ways to make loans more attractive and less risky for students,

without drastically increasing costs? For example, the cost of a loan program is greatly affected

by the interest rate that is charged and whether interest accrues while students are still enrolled in

school. Yet evidence from other contexts indicates that individuals do not give such details as

much weight as they should when making savings and borrowing decisions.69 Similarly, with

income-contingent repayment schemes, it is unclear whether students making decisions about

borrowing are even aware of how their eventual payments will be calculated. If loan schemes

cannot be made more comprehensible to students, any subsidies incorporated into loan programs

to make them more appealing to low-income students may be ineffectual. A student’s decision to

enroll and persist may be more influenced by an aid package that includes an upfront grant and

an unsubsidized loan, rather than a package of equal cost to the government that includes only

subsidized loans.




                                                                                                     28
Conclusion

The major shifts in the financial aid landscape documented in this paper have three critical

implications for aid policy. First, student aid is no longer just for poor students. Forty years ago,

student aid consisted almost solely of federal grants for low-income students. Today, colleges

and states, as well as the federal government, provide grants, tax benefits, and loans to families

with incomes well up the income distribution.70 In fact, the majority of students now receive

financial aid of one kind or another: two-thirds of full-time college students get some form of

grant aid, and many of the remainder receive federal tax credits and other forms of assistance.

The aggregate amount of student aid distributed—including all forms of aid at the federal, state,

and institutional level—added up to nearly $13,000 a student in 2010–11. The volume of aid

distributed and numbers of students affected make it more critical than ever to understand

whether and how aid affects college enrollment, performance, and completion.



Second, the “sticker price” of college now diverges substantially from the net price most families

face. Sticker prices have climbed steadily for decades. But net prices in all sectors were actually

lower in 2009–10 than they were in 2005–06. The net price of a private four-year college

declined by 2 percent between 2005 and 2009, and the net price for a public four-year college

declined by 13 percent over this period. For public two-year institutions, average net prices

dropped to negative $810, meaning the average student received more in grant aid than he or she

was charged in tuition and fees.71 The difference between sticker prices and net prices is even

larger for low-income students, who qualify for the Pell Grant, which has grown increasingly

generous in recent years. This divergence implies that individual students will find it harder than

ever to estimate how much going to college will cost them.




                                                                                                     29
Third, the increasing scope and diversity of financial aid programs implies increased

complexity—both for students trying to estimate their college costs and for policy makers trying

to ensure coherence across programs. The proliferation of programs, each well-intentioned, has

created a system that makes it difficult for families—especially “first-generation” families in

which neither parent has attended college—to know just how affordable college can be.

Calculating the net price of college for a given family requires understanding their finances as

well as the rules of the Pell Grant, student loans, the tuition tax credits, state grant programs, and

aid offered by individual colleges. Evidence suggests that students are quite poor at estimating

net prices.72 A symptom of the general confusion is that some aid goes unclaimed: the

Government Accountability Office recently calculated that 14 percent of families eligible for an

education tax benefit failed to claim it.73 Forty percent of filers who used the tuition tax

deduction would have been better off claiming one of the tax credits instead.



The complexity of the student aid landscape can lead to unexpected interactions between

programs. For example, Susan Dynarski found that, for families on the margin of getting more

financial aid, putting money in a tax-advantaged Coverdell Savings Account led to substantial

decreases in Title IV aid eligibility. In other words, the Title IV rules not only undid the tax

incentive for saving but actually left a family worse off than if it had not saved at all. This

collision between tax and aid policy was corrected with subsequent legislation, but there will

almost certainly be more such collisions given the proliferation of aid and tax programs.




                                                                                                    30
Another example of unintended interactions regards the relationship between federal aid and

colleges’ own tuition pricing and financial aid decisions. Some policy makers, most notably

former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett, have raised the concern that even if

financial aid lowers prices for some students, it might enable institutions to raise tuition costs

overall. Some evidence supports the so-called “Bennett Hypothesis” in the for-profit sector:

Stephanie Cellini and Claudia Goldin find that proprietary schools that are eligible to receive

federal Title IV aid (via eligible students who enroll) charge significantly more than similar

institutions that must rely on students who can pay full price.74 But other research finds little

evidence of these effects at the public institutions attended by the majority of students.75 More

subtly, recent quasi-experimental work by Lesley Turner comparing financial aid packages for

students just above and below Pell Grant eligibility thresholds finds that selective nonprofit

institutions claw back up to two-thirds of Pell Grant awards through reductions in institutional

grant aid. However, at the public institutions most Pell recipients attend, the claw-back rate is

Researchers have learned an enormous amount about the effect of aid on student behavior in

recent years, as the quantity and quality of research on this topic has exploded. Aid can matter,

with simple, well-designed programs producing large increases in college attendance and

completion. Evidence shows that the complexity of eligibility and application procedures can

undermine aid effectiveness. A recent randomized trial showed that a massive simplification of

the federal aid application process produced substantial increases in college attendance, further

bolstering the conclusion that design matters. It also appears that pairing grants with academic

requirements can bolster the impact of financial aid on college performance and completion.




                                                                                                     31
Both experimental and quasi-experimental studies have shown that dollars with strings attached

produce larger effects than dollars alone.



In contrast, disappointingly little evidence is available on the effects of one method that students

increasingly use to pay for college: loans. Loans are likely to remain a key component of student

aid packages, yet almost no evidence exists about their effects on college enrollment and

completion. Finally, as both the types of aid and the types of aid recipients continue to expand

and diversify, more research is likely to focus on the importance of program design and delivery,

whether there are unanticipated interactions between programs, and to what extent program

effects vary across different types of students.



As state and federal budgets face increasing pressures and politicians look for ways to control

spending, financial aid programs will be vulnerable to cutbacks if evidence is lacking on their

effectiveness, and even those programs with documented positive effects may be asked to do

more with less. Fortunately, more may be known about the effects of financial aid than about

any other interventions aimed at increasing postsecondary attainment. No longer is it necessary

to ask the question, “Does aid work?”—for the research definitively shows that it can. But the

evidence also suggests that some programs work better than others, and because of the

magnitude of government investment as well as the numbers of individuals affected by student

aid, the stakes have never been higher for understanding what aid programs work best and why.

2. Sandy Baum and Kathleen Payea, Trends in Student Aid 2011 (New York: The College Board,

2011), tables 3 and 3A. Before 1990, the original College Board data combined data on both

graduate and undergraduate aid and enrollment. For 1971–72 through 1989–90, we adjusted the

aggregate enrollment estimates downward by 13 percent and the average aid estimates

downward by 11 percent (based on the undergraduate-to-total ratios, which have been relatively

stable over time, from later years in which both series are available) to make them comparable

with the undergraduate-only data for subsequent years.

3. Full-time equivalent statistics count two half-time students the same as one full-time student;

the number of individual students enrolled surpassed 20 million by 2009.

4. Before 1980, the department was known as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

28. The benefit was originally set to expire in 2005, but in 2006 it was extended to cover 2006

and 2007; in 2008, it was extended to cover 2008 and 2009; and in 2010, it was extended to

cover 2010 and 2011. For 2011, the income limit for this benefit was $80,000 for single filers or

$160,000 for joint returns.

29. State cumulative contribution limits range from $146,000 to $305,000; a typical state allows

an annual contribution of $10,000 for married filers. See FinAid.org, “FinAid: Saving for

effects of Pell Grant size on college persistence (conditional on enrollment). See Bettinger,

“How Financial Aid Affects Persistence” (see note 52). Similarly, Dynarski’s study of the SSSB

program, described above, finds positive, but statistically insignificant effects on completed

years of schooling. See Dynarski, “Does Aid Matter?” (see note 43).
