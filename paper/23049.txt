We contribute to the long debated issue of whether inward foreign direct investment (FDI) can
stimulate investment in developing countries by introducing a novel measure of FDI, based on
industry-level data. Our results suggest a positive impact of FDI on total investment – measured
as the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP – but only if multinational enterprises engage
in manufacturing production; the same does not hold for other business activities. Moreover, we
find evidence of a more beneficial impact of foreign investors from advanced economies
compared to developing ones. Our results are robust to alternative measures of FDI, as well as to
instrumental variable approaches accounting for the potential endogeneity of FDI.

1 Introduction

As economic growth is mostly driven by capital accumulation, at least up to the
optimal level of capital per worker (Solow, 1956), increasing investment in
developing countries is a key policy objective. In countries with persistently
insufficient domestic capital formation, foreign direct investment (FDI) is often
welcome as a means to financing development and has been a top policy priority,
especially since the Monterrey Consensus of 2002. FDI attraction policies into the
developing world have since then increased dramatically, so that FDI has actually
become the leading source of external financing (Calderon et al, 2004; OECD,
2014): FDI in terms of stock tripled in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small
Island Developing States (SIDS), and quadrupled in landlocked developing
countries (LLDCs) (UNCTAD, 2015).

Theory suggests that FDI plays a crucial role in financing development, both
directly, as an external source of capital, and indirectly through its impact on
domestic capital formation. But the overall effects of FDI on economic growth in
developing economies are far from certain, and contrasting perspectives on the
developmental impact of FDI vividly confront with one another both in scholarly
and in policy circles. In fact, FDI can potentially be either beneficial or detrimental
to domestic investment. Theoretical prescriptions on which net effect a country
hosting FDI should expect are still inconclusive, as evidenced by the sizeable
literature on the effects of inward FDI on domestic investment, which dates back
since at least the end of the 1970s (Brecher & Diaz-Alejandro, 1977; Lall &
Streeten, 1977; Matos, 1977). No less controversial are the results from the
empirical literature, which suffer from severe data limitations on foreign
investment, because they rely upon aggregate FDI data taken from the Balance of
Payments (BoP) statistics (not an appropriate source of foreign investment data
for a number of reasons, as explained in Section 2).

Yet, empirically assessing the role of FDI in financing development - and possibly
also the conditions under which FDI is likely to have beneficial or detrimental
effects - has remarkable policy implications. Since economic policy can influence
investment decisions, understanding whether and how FDI triggers more or less
domestic investment would help tailoring investment policy measures aimed at
attracting FDI. Those policies are now widespread in a growing number of
developing countries, but largely unconditional on the actual activities performed
by MNEs, and often combined with industrial development and fiscal policies
towards domestic investment that are not necessarily consistent with the overall
aim of raising capital formation.

This paper contributes to the long debated issue of whether inward FDI can
stimulate domestic investment in developing countries in three main ways. First,


                                                                                     2
we introduce a novel measure of FDI, based on investment-level data by
multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in developing countries, which allows
overcoming the previous data limitations on real investment by MNEs and on the
presence and weight of foreign firms in host economies. Most studies analyse the
impact of FDI by expressing FDI as a percentage of gross fixed capital formation in
the domestic economy. This ratio is often considered an indicator of the share of
domestic capital formation undertaken by foreigners. However, the positive
impact of foreign firms on domestic capital formation is not necessarily related to
their initial investment size, but includes other factors, such as the number of
interactions between any domestic firm and any foreign firm. In developing
countries local firms may lack access to foreign markets and technology, and
therefore suffer from “binding constraints" (Rodrik, 2006) to growth that inhibit
their investment behaviour. The entry of MNEs could serve as a vehicle for
domestic firms to get access to new technology and possibly also to larger foreign
markets, to the extent that they can enter into arm’s length relationships with
more productive firms that can exploit larger international distribution networks,
thereby increasing the profitability of domestic investment. According to Blalock
and Gertler (2008), for instance, foreign firms have an incentive to widen the local
network of suppliers, rather than concentrating on few suppliers, because this can
induce competition among domestic firms and therefore reduce overall
production costs and raise the quality of inputs. Evidence from a survey on a large
number of MNEs based in 19 African countries (UNIDO, 2011) shows that the
initial investment size is related neither to the number of linkages they establish
with domestic suppliers nor to the size of total investment of foreign affiliates
(Figure 1). From this perspective, the same amount or size of total MNEs'
investment would have a different impact on GFCF depending on the actual
number of foreign firms entering the host economy. This is why the number of
foreign firms is a more appropriate measure than investment size, when assessing
spillovers to the local economy (Lin and Saggi, 2005).

                                  FIGURE 1 HERE

Second, we account for the possible differential impact of FDI on domestic
investment according to 1) the business activities performed by MNEs abroad,
distinguishing between manufacturing production and other business activities
within the manufacturing sector (i.e. sales, marketing, client support, retail and
wholesale) and 2) the source of FDI, distinguishing investing countries between
advanced and developing economies. Our dependent variable varies by industry
– as it is defined by the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) for each 2-digit
manufacturing industry – besides also being country and time variant. Therefore,
we are able to explore the issue of whether FDI foster total investment in host
economies in a much more refined way than in the extant literature (which
focuses on the crowding in or out debate at the aggregate - i.e. national - level), by


                                                                                    3
highlighting the sectorial heterogeneity of complementary and competitive effects
due to the entry of foreign firms.

Finally, another important feature of this study compared to the extant literature
is that we specifically focus on greenfield FDI, which imply an addition of fresh
foreign capital, unlike mergers and acquisitions (M&A), which instead represent
just a change in the ownership structure of existing firms (Calderon et al., 2004;
Ashraf and Herzer, 2014).

Our overall results suggest a positive impact of FDI on total investment. Moreover,
we are able to better qualify the link between FDI and GFCF by identifying which
types of FDI are more beneficial. Our evidence supports the widespread view that
foreign capital can be a source of development financing for developing countries,
but only if MNEs engage in productive activities, which exert spillovers to the host
economies, and do not just engage in trade-related activities, which instead tend
to remain enclaves without linkages to the domestic economy. We also find
evidence of a differential impact of the presence of foreign firms from advanced
countries compared to those from developing economies. The latter do not seem
to have positive effects on total investment, and this is probably due to the shorter
time since their entry and to stronger direct competition with domestic firms. Last
but not least, we find that the positive impact of FDI on total investment does not
necessarily imply a crowding in effect on domestic investment. Our results are
robust to the adoption of alternative specifications, as well as after controlling for
the potential endogeneity of FDI. More specifically, we address the potential
endogeneity of FDI exploiting the exogenous variation of the distribution of
outward FDI from the world’s top investors by industry, assuming that this is
correlated with the probability that FDI in a given industry has no direct influence
on the investment performance of that industry.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the related
theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 describes the data and the
methodology. Sections 4 and 5 present the results. Policy implications and
concluding remarks are in Section 6.

2. Literature background

Economic theory points to a number of distinct channels through which FDI may
affect capital accumulation in recipient economies. FDI can exert both direct and
indirect effects on overall capital formation. As regards direct effects, the most
common view considers FDI as a financial flow contributing to capital stock
accumulation, by adding up to domestic investment. As such, the impact of FDI
largely depends on the entry mode of MNEs. Greenfield investments – i.e. brand
new domestic subsidiaries of foreign firms – have a direct impact on capital


                                                                                    4
formation as they create new capital assets, whereas M&As are a partial or total
transfer of existing capital assets through a change in the nationality of existing
domestic firms, but do not add to the capital stock. Nor is it certain that the
acquisition of a domestic firm by a foreign firm would lead to more investment
than the acquired firm would have made without the acquisition (Mencinger,
2003; Agosin & Machado, 2005; Herzer, 2012). 1

Although the literature has regularly acknowledged a differential impact of FDI on
capital formation depending on the entry mode of MNEs, most empirical studies
rely on macro data that cannot disentangle between different entry modes. Only
recently, Ashraf & Herzer (2014) have explored the different impact of greenfield
investment and M&A on domestic investment, with aggregate data from UNCTAD;
their results confirm that M&A do not have a significant impact on domestic
investment, whereas (estimated) greenfield flows report a positive effect, even if
this seems to happen at the cost of domestic investors (crowding-out effect).

The literature has also invariably overlooked the fact that FDI as an aggregate
measure from the BoP statistics represents just a financing flow, and not
necessarily investment (Calderon et al, 2004). FDI includes any financial transfers
from a multinational's headquarters to its subsidiary, and back 2 . As they are
measured in net terms, aggregate FDI flows can be either positive or negative, but
that does not relate at all to the amount of investment in the host economy.
Moreover, aggregate FDI statistics do not allow for industry-level breakdown on
a bilateral basis, nor include information about different entry modes of MNEs into
foreign markets. All in all, such broad FDI statistics do not allow exploring the
potential complementarities between domestic and foreign investments, calling
for more disaggregated analysis (Arndt et al., 2009).

A complementary view is to look at FDI as knowledge flows brought about by
foreign investment flows. FDI are often welcome in developing countries as they
bring fresh capital together with a number of intangible assets that are usually
scarce in those economies, namely technological capabilities, management skills,
brand names, channels for marketing products internationally, product design
(Romer, 1992; Moran, 2011).

Besides the direct effects of FDI on capital accumulation in the host economy,
indirect effects can take place through the impact of foreign capital on domestic

1 As a matter of fact, the increased importance of M&A in total FDI flows starting in the 1990s,
especially in developing countries embarking in massive privatisation policies, has been singled
out as the likely cause of an observed weakening in the empirical FDI-investment link in that
decade (World Bank 2001).
2 UNCTAD (2013) claims that the amount of repatriated profits could be substantial, especially in

certain sectors and countries. The same report estimates that, globally, in 2010 about 60% of total
FDI income was repatriated.


                                                                                                 5
capital formation, as the entry of foreign firms may alter the incentives to invest
by domestic firms. Several channels are at work.

Theory has pointed out a number of mechanisms through which FDI can increase
the profitability of domestic investment. First, FDI can act as a catalyst for
domestic investment because multinationals usually have greater access to
information and financial resources than most private investors do in developing
countries. Hence, they are able to both identify and take advantage of profitable
opportunities more quickly than domestic investors, so that the entry of foreign
firms in a developing country signals the existence of unexploited profitable
business opportunities that domestic investors might not be capable of identifying
or willing to seize by themselves. Moreover, foreign firms entering a developing
country often bring about the need for more efficient infrastructure facilities
(roads, telecommunications, ports, railways, etc.), which they can also contribute
to finance (Cardoso & Dornbusch, 1988). As poor or insufficient infrastructure is
often a binding constraint to business development in developing countries,
improved infrastructure can open up new business opportunities that would not
have been profitable otherwise, thus increasing the profitability of overall
domestic investment. A further mechanism through which foreign firms can
contribute to capital formation is through the supply of scarce inputs (Helleiner,
1988), which they can vehicle by importing human and physical capital,
technology, and other intangible assets. In particular, positive externalities are the
increased availability of training services, managerial skills, technological
capabilities, access to overseas markets, market information, all of which benefit
domestic firms (Moran, 2011). The entry of foreign firms may also create new
demand for inputs that can be supplied by local firms through backward linkages
as complements to those imported from their home countries (Gorg and
Greenaway, 2004). Finally, in developing countries with poor business
opportunities, FDI can contribute with additional tax revenue invested in public
goods (Cardoso and Dornbusch, 1988).

The literature has also emphasized the existence of potential negative effects on
the profitability of domestic investment due to the presence of foreign firms.
Different mechanisms may be at work. Foreign owned firms can acquire domestic
market shares to the detriment of domestic firms (Aitken & Harrison, 1999).
Foreign firms can crowd out domestic investment if they increase the host
country’s interest rate by borrowing on the domestic market (Harrison &
McMillan, 2003). Foreign firms entering a developing country in sectors with
relatively underdeveloped productive capacity may sensibly increase the cost of
locally supplied inputs, especially wages (Lall & Streeten, 1977). Moreover, FDI
have uncertain effects on the degree of competition in host economies, as foreign
firms, usually more efficient and productive than domestic firms, can boost
competition among the latter, but at the same time could acquire market power,


                                                                                    6
with a potentially negative effect on domestic investment (Markusen and
Venables, 1999). FDI can have negative effects on overall capital formation in
developing countries, when the entry of foreign-owned firms pushes the less
efficient domestic firms out of the market and therefore reduces domestic
production capacity (Gorg and Greenaway, 2004). Finally, foreign firms could also
have a negative impact on the demand for local inputs, if they rely less on domestic
inputs than domestic firms (Rodriguez-Clare, 1996).

Empirical evidence on the relation between FDI and investment has been mainly
provided at the macroeconomic level 3 (a summary of empirical evidence is
reported in Table A1 in the Appendix). Macroeconomic studies typically use
aggregate measures of investment to study either one particular country or a
panel of countries. Among the first to analyse panels of countries, Fry (1993) used
macroeconomic data for a sample of 16 countries to show that FDI can have a
positive or a negative impact on domestic investment depending on the level of
trade barriers and financial regulations imposed by the host country. Subsequent
evidence is similarly inconclusive. Morrissey and Udomkerdmongkol (2012),
Mutenyo, Asmah, and Kalio (2010) and Titarenko (2005) all find that increases in
FDI crowd out domestic investment. Conversely, other scholars find that FDI
crowd in private domestic investment, such as De Gregorio, & Lee (1998),
Bosworth & Collins (1999), de Mello (1999), Borensztein, Ndikumana & Verick
(2008), Tang, Selvanathan, & Selvanathan, 2008), Ramirez (2011), Al-Sadig
(2013), Farla et al. (2014). Several scholars find mixed evidence when using
several lags for FDI or when splitting the country sample according to geographic
regions (Agosin & Mayer, 2000; Misun & Tomsik, 2002; Agosin & Machado, 2005;
Apergis, Katrakilidis, & Tabakis, 2006; Adams, 2009), or even find no effect of FDI
on domestic investment (Lipsey, 2000).

Overall, neither theory nor evidence provides a definitive answer as to the impact
of FDI on GFCF. On balance, however, empirical studies seem to suggest that FDI
has a positive impact on overall fixed investment. Arguably, none of the existing
studies has been able so far to move behind the aggregate picture, ignoring the
potential heterogeneity that can arise from micro factors such as the sectorial
distribution of investors as well as the kind of business activity they perform. This
papers aims at specifically filling this gap.



3 Microeconomic studies are much less frequent. They include case studies and studies on firm-
level panel data for specific countries. Among those, Aitken and Harrison (1999), on a panel of
more than 4,000 Venezuelan firms, show that the impact of FDI on domestic investment depends
on the ownership structure. FDI that participates with domestic firms in a joint venture
arrangement enhances the profitability of the domestic investment. By contrast, FDI negatively
affects the productivity of firms with 100% domestic ownership. On balance, they find that FDI has
a positive impact on domestic investment.



                                                                                                7
3. Data and Methodology

Some studies have constructed a measure of GFCF net of FDI flows to try building
a ‘pure’ measure of domestic investment (Morrisey and Udonmkerdmongkol,
2012). This approach has raised criticisms based on two main arguments. First,
GFCF and FDI are measured according to different accounting rules (National
Accounting rules and Balance of Payments, respectively) and are therefore hardly
comparable in practice (Agosin and Machado, 2005). Second, and more
fundamental, FDI flows from the BoP do not correspond directly to any measure
of real investment. Indeed, as reported by Leino and Ali-Yrkko (2014: 3): “... real
investments of foreign-owned companies can be funded locally or by other foreign
entities than direct investors. (…). Furthermore, recorded inward FDI may consist
of funds that are immediately invested abroad by the investment-receiving FDI
enterprises".



3.1 Descriptive statistics

As in most of the studies listed in Table A1, we describe a traditional investment
function but instead measure industry level GFCF in percentage over total GDP as
our dependent variable. More specifically, we test the horizontal spillover of FDI
at the industry level, i.e. whether MNEs entering a country in a given industry exert
a positive or negative impact on total investment in the same industry. As foreign
firms can stimulate spillovers both within and across sectors (through backward
and forward linkages), our empirical specification is likely to underestimate the
overall impact of FDI on capital accumulation in host economies 4.

We collect sector data from the 2014 edition of the Industrial Statistical Database
(INDSTAT) published by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO). INDSTAT provides information over the main aggregates, including
GFCF 5, for all manufacturing industries (defined at the 2-digit levels of the ISIC
rev. 3) for a long time series (1964-2011) with full country coverage 6. By looking
only at manufacturing sectors (i.e. excluding natural resources and services), we
provide a more precise picture of the potential effects of FDI on domestic
investment. Unlike manufacturing FDI, FDI in natural resource sectors have a
large share of their profits repatriated, rather than reinvested, as recently



4 Due to the large sample of countries included in our study it has not been possible to find
consistent information on input-output tables to explore the potential vertical spillovers of FDI on
the GFCF of related industries.
5 A detailed definition of how GFCF is measured in INDSTAT is provided in Appendix B.
6 Since INDSTAT provides price indices for indexes for all the industries, we use those as deflators

for GFCF, value added and FDI flows.


                                                                                                  8
estimated by UNCTAD (2013). On the other hand, FDI in services sectors generally
require lower fixed investments.

Our sample includes all the countries not classified as high-income OECD by the
World Bank definition based on their levels of per capita GNI in 2006. As industry
level information for a number of (mainly low-income) countries included in
INDSTAT presents a large number of gaps, 7 our final sample consists of an
unbalanced panel including 53 countries, listed in Table A2 in the Appendix.

As regards our main variable of interest, i.e. FDI, we rely on investment project
level data from Financial Markets' FDIMarkets, which collects data on greenfield
investments at the deal level, providing information on source country,
destination country, industry (2-digit ISIC rev. 3) and year (2003-2011, the
longest time series currently available). Summary statistics on the number of FDI
projects by industry in the 53 developing countries covered by our analysis are
shown in Table 1 8.

                                        TABLE 1 HERE

Our main research question is to understand the impact of foreign firms on overall
capital formation in host economies. We exploit the richness of our industry-level
data to build two alternative measures of FDI: 1) the number of MNEs entering a
host economy in a given country/industry/year combination (henceforth called
“flows”) or 2) the total number of MNEs operating in a host economy since the
beginning of the period considered (cumulated FDI or FDI “stock"). 9

Using industry level FDI data is an important innovation compared to using
aggregate evidence. In fact, the net impact of FDI on capital accumulation is likely
to depend positively on the degree of sectorial heterogeneity. Agosin and Machado
(2005), for instance, suggest that FDI is more likely to add up to GFCF in sectors
with lower investments and replace it in larger industries. A further innovation on
the previous literature is the possibility to distinguish among the business
activities undertaken by foreign firms (see Figure 2). For each deal, FDIMarkets

7 When cleaning the data, individual country-sector pairs reporting abnormal values of GFCF on

GDP (e.g. over 100%) have been dropped. We have also excluded four countries (Indonesia, Iran,
Madagascar and Vietnam) whose values of GFCF on GDP were unusually high (between 40 and
80% for each of the reported industries), making the total greater than 100%.
8 The list of FDI included in our study is not as large as the entire FDI database, but it depends on

data availability in INDSTAT. In fact, the number of observations is the number of investments in
any given developing country, conditional upon that country being covered by INDSTAT with
industry level data in any of the N manufacturing industries in any given year between 2003 and
2011.
9 In the remainder of the paper, we also compute alternative measures of FDI as robustness checks,

including the share of foreign affiliates on the total number of firms in each industry and the total
flows.


                                                                                                   9
includes a description of the activity performed by each foreign firm in the host
economy. This allows identifying which foreign firms engage in manufacturing
production, compared to those that only engage in other business activities within
manufacturing sectors (such as marketing and sales) with no production facilities
in the host economy. Drawing on the large literature on FDI and development, we
can argue that the potential spillovers to the domestic economy, including on total
investment, largely depend on the extent to which foreign investors are involved
in activities that are more likely to foster local linkages, such as production, rather
than “footloose” activities, such as export platform or quota-hopping FDI (Farole
and Winkler, 2013).

                                                    FIGURE 2 HERE

Finally, we further innovate on the previous literature by accounting for the origin
of FDI. There is nowadays a rising interest in understanding whether South-South
FDI could result in larger positive spillovers compared to North-South flows, but
still little evidence playing in favour of this hypothesis (Amighini and Sanfilippo,
2014), and evidence is still scant and inconclusive about the potential effect of
South-South FDI on domestic capital formation. The underlying idea is that FDI
might have a different impact on domestic firms depending on the technological,
geographic or institutional "distance" between home and host economies.
Southern economies are more likely to share similar technologies due to similar
factor endowments, and to higher complementarities along the product space
(Klinger, 2009; Hausmann et al., 2007). While these arguments have often been
raised in favour of stronger spillovers from South-South FDI, they might as well
support the claim that Southern MNEs might be stronger competitors to domestic
firms (Sanfilippo and Seric, 2016) 10.

3.2 Methodology

We start with a basic specification to identify the relation between FDI and GFCF:

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑥𝑥 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                             (1)

where the dependent variable is GFCF in country i, industry x, and year t measured
as a share of total GDP. Our main control variable, FDI, is the number of
investments received by country i in industry x in year t. γi, θx and δt are country,
industry and year fixed effects, respectively.



10 Following the theoretical model by Ghebrihiwet and Motchenkova (2015), competition is a less
compelling argument in the case of Northern MNEs. Due to the higher cost of technology transfer
in developing countries, Northern MNEs transfer fewer resources to their affiliates, making it less
likely that they crowd-out domestic firms.


                                                                                               10
In further specifications of (1) the FDI variable is disaggregated according to the
business activity performed and the investors origins (separately, due to the high
correlation between the two variables), as follows:

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹_𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹_𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑥𝑥 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (2)

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹_𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 +𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑥𝑥 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                (3)

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹_𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑥𝑥 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                               (4)

A count measure for FDI, rather than flows, should partly reduce the endogeneity
problem on the FDI variables; we exclude at least the possibility that the initial
amount invested – the purchase of fixed assets – could end up being part of GFCF
(which is a major concern in the case of greenfield FDI). Still, the correct
identification of the relation between FDI and GFCF poses a number of
econometric challenges, including those related to the direction of causality and
the omitted variables bias. Theory suggests a potential reverse causality between
GFCF and FDI, since higher domestic investments could play as a signal to foreign
firms, in turn affecting their entry choice (Mody and Murshid, 2005). At the same
time, local conditions that influence domestic investment may in turn affect the
decision to invest by foreign multinationals.

In the remainder of the paper, we adopt different strategies to tackle the potential
endogeneity of our main control variable, while testing at the same time the
robustness of our estimates. First, we control for different combinations of
country, industry and year effects in the main specification and in robustness
checks, to account for all the possible unobserved factors and omitted variables
that could influence domestic and foreign investment decisions. In successive
specifications, we also include a number of controls at both the country- and
country-industry level. Second, we run our basic regression including different
lags of the FDI variable, to tackle the potential simultaneity bias. Third, we adopt
the most traditional approaches tackling endogeneity directly by means of
instrumental variables. Table 2 provides summary statistics and variables
description is reported in table A3 in the appendix.



                                                   TABLE 2 HERE

4. Results

The main results from our basic identification strategy as described in (1)-(4) are
reported in Table 3.



                                                                                                            11
                                       TABLE 3 HERE

By looking at the number of investors, rather than flows, we take a broader look
at FDI as more than the amount of capital invested, also considering the
knowledge flows that accompany capital. The β coefficients’ size from regressions
with a count variable for FDI (FDI_N) should be interpreted as the impact on GFCF
of any additional foreign firm entering a given host country in the form of
greenfield FDI. This measure does not account for the direct effect of investment
size (which in the case of greenfield FDI involves a direct contribution to GFCF due
to purchase of fixed assets), but rather considers the overall contribution of
foreign multinationals to total investment (which can show up in alternative ways,
regardless of the size of the initial investment) 11.

As what we test is a relation between total investment and the number of FDI
(n_FDI), a β coefficient greater than 0 confirms that FDI has an overall positive
effect on total investment (GFCF). Our estimated coefficient is about 0.002,
meaning that the entry of an additional foreign investor will result in an increase
of about 0.002 percentage points in the GFCF/GDP ratio. Despite the small
coefficient size, its economic relevance is pretty high. A one standard deviation
increase in the number of foreign firms (i.e. slightly over 10 firms) entering a given
country-industry pair raises the GFCF/GDP ratio by about 0.018 percentage
points, i.e. a 30% increase from its average. Interestingly, this positive relation is
also robust to the adoption of the “stock” (i.e. cumulative flows of FDI between
2003 and 2011) of foreign companies in the host country as a measure of FDI
(columns 1 and 4 of Table 3). It should be noticed that this is high in relative terms,
but corresponds to low increases in the GFCF/GDP ratio in absolute terms.

Additional findings show that the type of activity performed by foreign firms
matters to determine the net effect of FDI on GFCF. Foreign affiliates engaged in
productive activities are more likely to raise the profitability of domestic
investment, unlike those operating in trade-related activities. In our view, this is a
relevant distinction, especially in a context where most FDI are strategically linked
to different stages of global value chains (GVCs). In this regard, our results suggest
that foreign affiliates involved in local production are more likely to contribute to
GFCF, because the propensity to invest in middle stages of the value chain is higher
compared to investments in upstream or downstream activities, where
investment income is less likely to be reinvested (UNCTAD, 2013). In addition,
production-oriented FDI are more likely to generate domestic spillovers in the


11 Evidence reported in Agosin and Machado (2005: 152) suggests that the initial purchase of fixed
assets by foreign firms (i.e. what enters in the balance of payment definition of FDI) represents
only a small fraction of foreign firms’ total outward investment, which subsequently includes
assets for modernization and technology upgrading.


                                                                                              12
form of backward and forward linkages 12 (Rodriguez-Clare, 1996). Conversely,
foreign investments in non-productive activities do not seem to exert a positive
impact on domestic investment, because they mainly aim to create platforms
either for exports to third countries or for imports from the investing country that
can not only outperform domestic activities (up to the extent they stop investing
or exit the market), but also not contributing to generate any new investments. In
both cases, foreign firms that are only involved in non-productive activities in host
economies tend to have more direct relations with parent firms (intra-firm
transactions), and rely less on market-based transactions with local firms.

Finally, a further important dimension that we are able to explore with our data is
the different effects of FDI according to the origin of the investor. Differently from
our ex-ante expectations, our results do not support the view that emerging and
developing countries investors have so far contributed to raise GFCF in developing
economies. Conversely, we find that a positive and significant relation
characterizes FDI from advanced economies in a persistent way.

The explanations for the lack of effects of South FDI can be diverse. First, a scale
effect might be at work. Southern FDI are still fewer (in terms of number of
projects at least, as they still represent less than 20% of the total) than Northern
ones. Second, Southern firms are relatively younger and investors less structured
and experienced compared to their Northern counterparts. These features are
particularly relevant when looking at their impact on total investment.
Investments are lumpy, and therefore risky, requiring knowledge of the host
country and experience that Southern MNEs are still building up starting from
lower levels (Cuervo-Cazurra and Genc, 2008). Third, the negative effect can result
from a competitive effect. Contrary to Northern MNEs, Southern MNEs adopt
technologies that are more adapted to the local market, so that they may find
themselves in direct competition with domestic firms, crowding them out of the
market, and discouraging their propensity to invest. On this regard, it is worth
noticing that there might also be a divergence between short- and long-run effects
of FDI on local investment. For example, De Backer and Sleuwaegen (2003) show
that FDI displaces local investment by Belgian manufacturing companies in the
short run, but in the long run this effect is limited or even reversed.

4.1 Main results with additional controls



12 Considering the level of industry disaggregation in our data, we can still consider within-sector

linkages as a main potential source of FDI spillovers. According to many available I/O, most of the
2-digit industries in manufacturing sectors (including textiles; wood; motor vehicles; chemicals)
source most of their inputs from the same industry and sell most of their output to the same
industry (see WIOD website: http://www.wiod.org/new_site/database/wiots.htm)




                                                                                                13
Following the theoretical insights and previous empirical works, we augment (1)-
(4) by including a number of control variables to account for factors that could
potentially affect GFCF. More specifically, we add GDP growth to account for the
fact that current investment decisions depend on the expected flow of future
profits, which are increasing in income; political stability and inflation are
measures of political and economic uncertainty surrounding investors. We also
include some industry specific variables, taken from INDSTAT, such as the size and
the value added produced. As shown in Table 4, the coefficients of the FDI
variables are not affected by the introduction of additional country- and country-
industry controls.

All the country-level variables have the expected sign, although not statistically
significant. This is not surprising, considering our dependent variable is measured
at the country-industry level, and the effect of such factors might therefore be
heterogeneous across industries. In addition, the lack of significance for some of
these variables is coherent with the previous evidence, such as the case of good
governance (Farla et al., 2014), or the relation between the cost of capital and
domestic investment (Mody and Murshid, 2005).

                                       TABLE 4 HERE

As for as the variables taken from INDSTAT, our results show that capital
formation in host economies is not independent from the characteristics of the
receiving industry, and this is consistent across different specifications. In
particular, the overall amount of investment depends on the size of the industry,
proxied by the total employment 13. In addition, the impact on capital formation is
higher, the higher the capacity of the host industry to generate value added.

5. Additional results and robustness checks

In the remainder of this section, we present a number of robustness checks that
test the stability of our model to different measurement of the FDI variables
(section 5.2.1) and accounting for the potential endogeneity of the GFCF-FDI
relation (5.2.2).




13Results do not change if we use the total number of domestic firms net of the number of foreign-
owned firms instead of the total employees. This, however, does not exclude the presence of
foreign firms in the data, due to the inclusions of investors established before 2003 or through
different modalities, i.e. M&As.


                                                                                              14
5.1 Alternative measures of FDI

We enrich our analysis by also testing the relation between investment flows and
total investment, the traditional approach followed by the vast majority of the
studies reported in Table A1, within the crowding-in/out debate. As FDIMarkets
reports the capital expenditure for each project, based on the initial investment
announced at the time of entry, we can compute investment flows at the host
country and industry level. One caveat is that large portion of these data is
estimated based on a proprietary econometric model, introducing measurement
errors in the data. Specific to our sample of developing countries’ recipients, this
affects about 64% of the projects included 14. Still, however, when looking at some
descriptive statistics, we can see that the total value computed from FDIMarkets
behave quite similarly compared with both the more reliable information on the
number of projects and with other aggregate statistics based on Balance of
Payment information, such as those provided by UNCTAD 15 (see Figure 3).

                                       FIGURE 3 HERE

Table 5 reports the results of model (1) where FDI are measured in terms of
investment flows rather than number of foreign firms. As we are testing a relation
between foreign investment size and total investment (as percentage of GDP), the
coefficients’ size should be interpreted as the impact on GFCF/GDP of one dollar
of FDI entering a given host country in the form of greenfield FDI. Our estimated
coefficients are still mostly positive, which confirms the net positive effect of FDI.
In particular, a one standard deviation increase in FDI flows (i.e. around 521mln
$, due to an average increase in the number of foreign firms by over 10, each of
which invests on average 48 mln $) generates around 4 bln $ increase in GFCF.
Again, we do not find any significant relation between investment flows and GFCF
for FDI with no production activities and for Southern FDI 16.

                                        TABLE 5 HERE

As an additional robustness check related to the measurement of FDI, we have also
run the main regression using the share of foreign plants on the total number of

14 It should be noticed that these are the data on which UNCTAD compiles the annual World
Investment Report, and adopted in empirical research by other scholars (e.g. Davies and
Desbordes, 2015). In addition, in our specific case, data on the constructed flows is highly
correlated to the data on the number of firms.
15 When comparing the flows computed using FDIMarkets data with UNCTAD statistics it must be

noted that the former represents only a fraction of the latter, since they do not include M&As, as
well as other recorded components of FDI including for instance reinvested earnings.
16 The coefficients on FDI with no-productive activities in column 2 are extremely high. This is due

to the very low values of that variable, on average representing less than 0.001% of total GDP. This
means that should the FDI/GDP ratio go up by 1 percentage point (i.e. by 0.001% to 1.001% of
GDP), the corresponding drop in GFCF on GDP could be substantial.


                                                                                                15
firms in each industry (computed net of the stock of investment). Results, reported
in Table A4 in the appendix, look similar to those in table 3, confirming a positive
effect of FDI, also in relative terms. Despite results are consistent also in this case,
however, we cannot exclude that a relative measure of FDI share is biased,
considering the lack of M&As from the overall count.

5.2 Controlling for endogeneity
As discussed in section 3.2, endogeneity due to omitted variables and reverse
causality is a potential issue in our model, which we try to tackle in different ways.

First, to deal with omitted variables, we have checked the stability of the
coefficients of our main specifications to different combinations of fixed effects.
Specifically, Table A5 shows that the results are highly stable to specifications
using country-industry and year-effects (columns 1-4) as well as country-year and
industry-year effects (columns 5-8).

Second, to deal with the potential reverse causality of FDI and GFCF we have
checked whether results are robust to the inclusion of various lags of the FDI
variables. Table A6 reports the results including the first three lags of FDI and
seem to show that the effect of FDI on GFCF is persistent, and does not change
significantly compared to the case in which the variable is set at time t.

5.2.1 Instrumental Variables (IV) approach
A first, traditional, strategy to address the potential endogeneity of the FDI
variable is to find valid external instruments, i.e. variables that are correlated with
the regressor but not directly affecting the dependent variable. The difficulties in
finding out some good instruments in this specific setting are well exemplified by
the existing literature, quoted in Table A1, which has so far addressed the
potential endogeneity of FDI by adopting a dynamic panel framework, i.e. one in
which instruments are exploited from within the model (see also the section
5.2.2). An exception is the paper by Delgado and McCloud (2014), in which the
authors use an average of four variables (economic growth; exchange rate;
interest rate and saving rate) for the top trade partners as instruments for both
the inward and outward FDI of a given country. We depart from this and consider
the average economic growth and the exchange rate of the top three investors in
each of the country in our sample as potential instruments to be used in our IV
regression. A faster economic growth at home is normally found to be a
determinant of FDI decision, as it is in the case of a favourable exchange rate,
which can push firms to invest abroad influencing their relative wealth (Alfaro et
al., 2004; Yeaple and Keller, 2009). In addition, we consider also a variable
reporting the total amount of FDI flows by the top ten source countries to the non-
OECD recipients using UNCTAD FDI statistics, weighted by the distance to the host



                                                                                     16
country 17. Using total investments by the larger sources in absolute terms, rather
than from the main partner countries, should reduce the risk of finding cases in
which a large part of the total investment from one country represents almost the
total of the FDI received by a specific partner in a given industry. On the other
hand, the total flows by the top world sources should not be related to the
domestic investment in a given country-industry.

Still, however, being these aggregate measures, the risk is that they can be weakly
correlated to our FDI variable, which is instead computed at the country- and
industry- level. Finding an instrument available at the industry level is, however,
even more challenging. Some existing work used sectorial targeting by investment
promotion agencies (Harding and Javorcik, 2012; Alfaro and Charlton, 2013;
Farole and Winckler, 2013), but unfortunately this information is not available for
all the countries and periods covered by this study (besides being potentially
correlated to the levels of domestic investments, due to self-selection of better
performing industries in targeting) 18.

We thus try to construct a country-industry specific instrument exploiting the
information available in our original FDI database. More specifically, along the
lines of Jordaan (2011), we build an instrument representing the industry’s share
of the total number of FDI by the top source countries directed to the group of
non-OECD recipients. As emphasized by Jordaan (2011), independently on the
host economy, there are some industries that are more likely to receive FDI and
this underlying distribution, while being potentially related to the observed
distribution of FDI projects, should not affect the size of domestic investment in a
given country-industry pair.

Table 6 reports the results of the first and the second stage regressions based on
a 2SLS IV method with the inclusion of country, industry and year fixed effects. We
try different combinations of instruments to check the stability of the results.
From the first stage regression we notice that the industry share of FDI is
significantly, correlated with the total number of projects by the top investors in
the same industry. A weaker relation is found between our variable of interest and
the other external instruments, especially growth, likely to be conditioned by the
aggregate nature of these variables.

                                       TABLE 6 HERE


17 Based on FDIMarkets data, the top ten source countries in non-OECD markets are, in order, the
US, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and India.
18 Also trade variables, such as applied tariffs (as in Yeaple and Keller, 2009) or exports and

imports with major trading partners, have the advantage of being reported at the industry level
and of having an influence on FDI, but are also likely to affect domestic economic conditions,
including GFCF.


                                                                                             17
Overall, results of the second stage regression show that there is a positive and
significant effect of FDI on GFCF even after accounting directly for the potential
endogeneity of the former variable, confirming once again the robustness of our
main result. We test the performance of the instrumental variable approaches by
means of the Hansen test of overidentification. All over the different specifications
adopted the tests suggest that the instruments are generally valid and well
performing.

5.2.2 Dynamic panel model
As a final step, and along the lines of the vast majority of the existing empirical
literature reviewed in Table A1, we estimate our model by means of a dynamic
panel based on a two-step system GMM estimator (Blundell and Bond, 1998;
Roodman, 2009). A dynamic panel has two main advantages in the context of our
data. The first, as discussed in the previous section, is that it looks for valid
instruments from within the model, avoiding the risk of selecting – often
theoretically weak – external instruments. The second is that current investment
decisions have a strong path dependence due to depreciation component and to
the fact that it is a structural component of the economy. This means that the
lagged dependent variable should be included among the regressors, making (1)
a dynamic model:

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺_𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉_𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                          + 𝛽𝛽7 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


The dynamic nature of equation (4) suggests taking autocorrelation duly into
account to avoid the standard OLS estimator producing biased coefficients. GMM
is normally well suited for dynamic models with samples including a short time
period and a large cross-section, as in our case. While in the first step the first
difference of equation (4) drops out the cross-sectional fixed effects, the second
step consists of constructing suitable instruments for the endogenous variables.
We treat lagged GFCF and all the FDI-related variables as endogenous, on the
ground of a potential reverse causality, and we instrument them using their lagged
levels and differences. Additional instruments are represented by the strictly
exogenous variables, i.e. all the remaining from equation (4). Since our panel is
highly unbalanced, we correct our estimator applying orthogonal deviations as
recommended by Arellano and Bover (1995). We also include year fixed effects in
order to control for time specific effects as well as to avoid contemporaneous
correlation among individuals across time (Roodman, 2009).

Still, despite the cross-sectional dimension is not as small as in previous studies
considering the addition of the industry level, we try to keep the number of
instruments under control to preserve the stability of the over-identification test.
We do this by using the second and third lags of the dependent variable and the


                                                                                                                                                 18
first to the fourth for the other endogenous variables. Lastly, we make the
standard errors of the two-step model robust by adopting the correction
suggested by Windmeijer (2005). In order to control for the exclusion of second
order correlation and to check for over-identifying restrictions we run the
Arellano-Bond and the Hansen tests at the end of each output.

Table 7 reports the results of our main specification using the GMM method. All
over the different columns, the Arellano-Bond test supports the null of no second
order autocorrelation, while the Hansen test demonstrates that over identification
restrictions are valid, and not compromised by the presence of too many
instruments.

                                  TABLE 7 HERE

Results, on the other hand, confirm the findings of existing literature (Farla et al.
2014; Ashraf and Herzer, 2014) showing that even disaggregating the data at the
industry level, GFCF reports a strong path dependence, being strongly correlated
with its previous year’s levels. Differently from the IV estimates, we can easily
instrument all the FDI-related variables, including the more disaggregated ones.
By doing this, we show that there are little changes compared to the results
discussed in previous sections. Also in this case, in fact, we do not only find that
there is generally a positive effect of FDI on GFCF, but also that this effect is
statistically significant only when new investment projects are directed to
productive activities.

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have analysed the impact of greenfield FDI on capital
accumulation in developing countries with a firm- and industry-level measure of
FDI that allows overcoming the limitations of investment flows, the main FDI
measure in the extant literature. Our disaggregated data allow a more detailed
analysis of FDI spillovers on the host economies, including the differential impact
of foreign firms according to their country of origin (whether from the North or
from the South), and to the business activity performed by foreign affiliates
(production or trade-related). Our results show that detailed analyses on micro
data allow assessing the impact of different types of FDI as an effective means for
financing development.




                                                                                  19
Our main results confirm that FDI exert positive spillovers on total investment, in
particular within the recipient industries. More specifically, we contribute to
overcome some of the inconclusive results in the literature (Morrissey and
Udomkerdmongkol, 2016) in a two major ways.

First, we explore whether different types of FDI have diverse impact on domestic
investment; foreign affiliates with productive activities are more beneficial to host
economies. Instead, foreign affiliates performing trade-related activities, such as
sales, marketing, client support, are less likely to have a positive impact on total
investment and they could even contribute to reduce the overall size of the
investment in the industry. This suggests that FDI attraction policies by
developing economies should better consider linking incentives to the business
activities of foreign affiliates. However, this increase in total investment goes
along with a crowding out of domestic investment in each recipient industry, i.e.
the amount of FDI inflows displaces domestic investment more than
proportionally. This displacement effect seems to be dramatically large in the case
of trade-related FDI, i.e. FDI that entails no productive activities in the domestic
economy.

Second, the impact of FDI on domestic GFCF largely depends on the technological
distance between investing and recipient countries; Northern FDI seem to have a
net positive impact on GFCF in developing economies, but it does not seem to be
the same for Southern FDI. This result might be explained by the relatively low
share of Southern investment in the South, compared to Northern investment, to
the lower average Southern firms’ age, and to the more recent presence of
Southern MNEs in other developing economies: all of these factors might imply
that negative short run effects as suggested in De Backer and Sleuwaegen (2003)
could dominate, whereas the potentially positive long run effects have still to work
themselves out. In fact, our evidence suggests that the competition effects of
Southern FDI might compensate for the knowledge spillovers accruing to
domestic firms, so that the net effect is uncertain, at least in the short run.

Finally, even if and when FDI contribute to increase total investment in host
economies, they might still displace domestic investment in recipient industries,
generating a trade-off. Further research is needed on which type of FDI is more
likely to foster domestic capital accumulation together with total investment. This
would contribute to expand our knowledge of how to better design FDI attraction
policies to maximise the developmental impact of foreign capital in developing
economies.

Notes: (1) Prior to 1975, several studies were done on the impact of MNCs in Latin America. Most of these are
case studies and it would be impossible to list all of them in this table. For a good summary of these see Grieco
(1986). (2) For example, Encarnation & Wells find that where FDI substitutes for imports because it is "tariff-
jumping", the overall impact on the host country is negative.

Definition of Gross fixed capital formation in UNIDO INDSTAT:

Gross fixed capital formation refers to the value of purchases and own-account
construction of fixed assets during the reference year less the value of corresponding
sales. The fixed assets covered are those (whether new or used) with a productive life of
one year or more. These assets, which are intended for the use of the establishment,
include fixed assets made by the establishment's own labour force for its own use. Major
additions, alterations and improvements to existing assets, which extend their normal
economic life or raise their productivity, are also included.

New fixed assets include all those that have not been previously used in the country. Thus,
newly imported fixed assets are considered new whether or not used before they were
imported. Used fixed assets include all those that have been previously used within the
country. Transactions in fixed assets include: (a) land; (b) buildings, other construction
and land improvements; (c) transport equipment; and (d) machinery and other
equipment. Countries that have started implementation of recent recommendations for
industrial statistics might have extended the coverage of fixed assets to products of
research and development, computer software and database and other intellectual
property products.

Assets acquired from others are valued at purchasers' prices, which cover all costs
directly connected with the acquisition and installation of the items for use. In principle,
assets produced on own account are also valued in this manner. However, it may
frequently be necessary to value such own-account production at explicit cost, including
any imputations that may be required in respect of the employed own-account labour.
Assets produced by one establishment of a multi-establishment enterprise for the use of
another establishment of the same enterprise should be valued by the receiving
establishment as though purchased from outside the enterprise. Sales of assets should be
valued at the actual amounts realized rather than at book values.
