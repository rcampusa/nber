                            Ricardian Equivalence:
                     An Evaluation of Theory and Evidence




                                   ABSTRACT




      In evaluating the existing theory and evidence on Ricardian
equivalence, it is essential to distinguish between the short run
effects of government borrowing (primarily the potential for stimulating
aggregate demand) and the long run effects (primarily the potential for
depressing capital accumulation). I argue that the theoretical case for
long run neutrality is extremely weak, in that it depends upon
improbable assumptions that are either directly or indirectly falsified
through empirical observation. In contrast, the approximate validity of
short run neutrality depends primarily upon assumptions that have at
least an aura of plausibility.          Nevertheless, even in this case
behavioral    evidence weighs heavily against the Ricardian view.

      Efforts to measure the economic effects of deficits directly
through aggregate data confront a number of problems which, taken
together, may well be insuperable. It is therefore not at all
surprising that this evidence has, by itself, proven inconclusive.
      Overall,    the existing body of theory and evidence establishes a
significant likelihood that deficits have large effects on current
consumption, and there is good reason to believe that this would drive
up interest rates. In addition, I find a complete lack of either
evidence    or coherent theoretical argument to dispute the view that
sustained    deficits significantly depress capital accumulation in the
long run.

1•      Introduction
        In   recent years, skyrocketting federal deficits have generated

widespread concern and fevered debate. Economists' analyses of the

deficit problem have focused primarily upon two intellectual

benchmarks. One school of thought, typically associated with Keynes,

holds that deficit financed tax cuts raise disposable income, thereby

stimulating aggregate demand. As a result, deficits lead to high real

interest rates, and crowd out private capital formation. If

disequilibrium prevails, unemployment may also fall. The second school

of thought holds that taxpayers see through the intertemporal veil, and

realize that the present discounted value of taxes depends only upon

real government spending——not on the timing of taxes. This foresight

gives rise to a "Say's law" for deficits: the demand for bonds always

rises to match government borrowing. As a result, deficits fail to

stimulate aggregate demand, and in fact have no real effects. This

second view is typically associated with Ricardo, no doubt much to his

posthuminous dismay (see O'Driscoll [1977]).

       The   notion of "Ricardian equivalence" has come to play an
important role in modern economic thought, due in large part to the work
of Earro [1974]. In evaluating the existing theory and evidence on
Ricardian equivalence, it    is   essential to distinguish between the short
run   effects of government borrowing (primarily the potential for

stimulating aggregate demand, and its     implications   for macroeconomic

stabilization policy) and the long run effects (primarily the potential

for   depressing capital accumulation). I argue (section 2) that the
                                          —2--




theoretical    case for long run neutrality is extremely weak, in that        it
depends upon improbable assumptions that are either directly or

indirectly falsified through empirical observation. In contrast, the

approximate    validity of short run      neutrality depends primarily upon

assumptions    that   have at least an aura of plausibility. Nevertheless,

in both cases behavioral evidence weighs heavily against the Ricardian

view (section 3).

      Efforts to measure the economic effects of deficits directly

through aggregate data confront a number of problems which, taken

together, may well be insuperable (section 4). It is therefore not at

all surprising that this evidence has proven inconclusive. Studies

using aggregate time series data almost uniformly support the view that

deficits significantly stimulate aggregate demand in the short run, yet

they often fail to identify systematic short run relationships between

deficits and either interest rates, prices, or other nominal

variables. Studies besed upon international comparisons (including some

new results) find a significant relationship between deficits and

aggregate demand (section 5). Few if any          studies have attempted to
measure long run      effects directly.

      Taken    together, the   existing   body of theory and evidence does not
justify    claims that government borrowing has little      or no effect on the
economy.     Rather, I conclude that there is a significant likelihood that

deficits have large effects on current consumption, and there is good

reason to believe that this would drive up interest rates. In addition,

I find a complete lack of either evidence or coherent theoretical
                                        —3—




argument to dispute the view that       sustained   deficits significantly
depress capital accumulation in the      long   run.


2.       Theoretical   considerations

         The central Ricardian observation is that deficits merely postpone

taxes. A rational individual should be indifferent between paying $1 in

taxes today, and   paying $1 plus interest in taxes tomorrow. Since the
timing   of taxes does not affect an individual's lifetime budget

constraint, it cannot alter his consumption decisions.

      The relevance of this observation depends upon the length of

consumers' planning horizons. If fiscal policy postpones tax

collections until after current taxpayers have died, then it may well

alter real economic decisions (see Diamond [1965] and Blanchard

[1985]). Barro's [1974] central insight was that intergenerational

altruism may act to extend planning horizons, thereby reinstating strong

versions of Ricardian equivalence.

      Recent theoretical work Ins clarified the set of implicit and

explicit assumptions upon which the Ricardian proposition depends. To

establish the equivalence of taxes and deficits, one must assume that

i) successive generations are linked by altruistically motivated

transfers, ii) capital market either are perfect, or fail in specific

ways, iii) the postponement of taxes does not redistribute resources

within generations, iv) taxes are non—distortionary, v) the use of

deficits cannot create value (i.e. through bubbles), vi) consumers are

rational   and farsighted, and vii) the availability of deficit financing
                                       —4—




 as   a fiscal instrument does not alter the political process.JJ In this
 section, I elaborate on each of these assumptions.

        2.1. LInkages between generations
        Under the Ricardian world view, intra—family transfers between
members of successive generations are ubiquitous, and motivated solely
by altruism. Both components of this hypothesis are      theoretically
suspect. I will take them in order.

        With regard to the first component, one line of criticism argues

that,   under   plausible assumptions about preferences, productivity

growth,   and income   distribution, many parents will bequeath nothing to

their children (Andreoni [1986a], Feldstein [1986a], Laitner [1979]).

When this occurs, children nay well help to support their parents, in

which case Ricardian equivalence still prevails for policies that do not

alter the pattern of linkages (see Carmichael [1982], or Bernheim and

Bagwell [1986] for a more general treatment). The relevant issue

therefore concerns the likelihood that transfers flow neither from

parents to children, nor from children to parents.

        A number of authors have studied models which allow for both gifts

(from child to parent) and bequests (from parent to child).       Typically,

there is a range of parametrizations for which transfers flow in neither

direction (Buiter [1979], Carmichael [1982], Weil [1984], Abel [1985a],

and Kimball [1986])./ In general, I find this subliterature

unenlightening. For one thing, I question the wisdom of rejecting

certain specifications of preferences, as is the    practice   of several

authors mentioned above, on the basis of criteria such as dynamic
                                       —5—




inconsistency (between members of successive generations), or divergence

of utility streams. While consistency and convergence are          analytically
convenient properties, they are unjustifiable as primitive choice

axioms. Dynamic inconsistency is simply a manifestation of conflict

within families, and I see no reason to rule it out. Similarly,

divergence of utility streams simply limits the usefulness of utility

functions as representations of primitive preference orderings, and

cannot logically invalidate the possibility that altruism is strong.

        Furthermore, this entire sub—literature considers a very special

subset of preferences, in that direct altruism is generally limited to

one's immediate successor and predecessor. If, for example, individuals

care directly both about their children and grandchildren

(u =    u(c,ui,u2)),         then positive bequests may prevail in

equilibrium even when capital accumulation is inefficiently high (i.e.,

on the wrong side of the golden rule——see Ray [1987]). One simply

cannot    rule out the   possibility that generations are linked by applying

this   sort   of a priori reasoning.

        A second line of criticism spins off of Bernheim and Bagwell's

[1987] observation that representative agent models abstract from

interconnections between families. They argue that ubiquitous parent—

child linkages would embed all (or nearly all) individuals in a single
interconnected network. The consumption       of   each individual would then
depend only upon total wealth, and an increment to       total   wealth would be
divided   among the entire population. Consequently, in a large dynamic

economy, any incremental bequest would be divided between the
                                    —6—



recipient's contemporaries, and the resulting increment to the

recipient's consumption would be negligable. Accordingly, the donor

would prefer to make no bequest at all. In equilibrium, many donors

would be driven to corners, so that no large interconnected network

would remain..V

       A third line of criticism argues that optimal government policy

will generally entail driving successive generations to corners

(Bernheim [1986]). The reason is simple: when transfers are positive,

each donor is indifferent on the margin between his own consumption, and

thatof the corresponding recipient. If the planner cares directly
about the donor and the recipient, he must in general prefer larger
transfers——the initial configuration could not have been socially
optimal. I have noted in the above reference that one must qualify this
conclusion when the planner can   precommit   himself to particular
policies.    In addition, note that Ricardian equivalence may still hold

in economies where the government fails to act optimally.

       I turn next to the second component of the linkage hypothesis——

that intergenerational transfers are altruistically motivated. It is

important to emphasize that Ricardian equivalence holds under all

specifications of altruism in which the utility of each individual is

determined as a function of consumption profiles: one need not require

that an altruist values only the utility of others, as in Barro [1974]

(see Bernheim and Bagwell [1986]). Various authors have suggested

alternative motivations, including uncertainty concerning length of life

(Davies   [1981]), intrafamily exchange (Sussman, Cates, and Smith [1970],
                                        —7--




Becker [1974, 1981], Ben—Porath [1978], Adams [1980], Tomes [1981],

Kotlikoff and Spivak [1981], and Bernheim, Shleifer and Summers [1985]),

and tastes for generosity (Blinder [1974], Andreoni [1986b]). In

general, these alternatives do not give rise to neutrality results (see

Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers). Unfortunately, it is very difficult

to distinguish between different formulations of preferences on the

basis of theoretical reasoning alone. Nevertheless, Bernheirn, Shielfer,

and   Summers make an a priori case for the presence of exchange
motives. They argue that        dynastic specification, which portrays
                              Barro's

families as perfectly harmonious units, is extremely restrictive, and
that more   generally the   preferences   of distinct family members will
confliot4/
       Bernheim and Bagwell [1986] offer an alternative criticism of the
Ricardian   linkage hypothesis. Building on the observation that

ubiquitous parent—child linkages would embed nearly everyone in a

single, interconnected network, they show that this hypothesis implies

the irrelevance of all redistributional policies, distortionary taxes,

and even prices. Indeed, this remains true even when some fraction of

the population makes no transfers, or is motivated by considerations

other than altruism. Since these results are untenable, they conclude

that, in some critical sense, the linkage hypothesis cannot even be

approximately valid, and that all policy prescriptions based upon the

dynastic framework are therefore suspect.

       In defense of Ricardian equivalence, one might argue that the

linkage   hypothesis is a more appropriate approximation in some
                                        —8—



circumstances than in others. Specifically, the Bernheim—Bagwell

results may depend on much longer chains of linkages than does the

neutrality of government borrowing, particularly if the debt will be

paid off within a few generations. If some sort of friction exists in

each link, this might dissipate the Bernheim—Bagwell effects, without

substantially altering the approximate neutrality of certain deficit
policies. Yet formal analysis suggests that this line of defense is
flawed, and at best leads one to a different set of untenable
conclusions       (Abel and Bernheim [1986])ei
         Recently, several authors have questioned the importance of

intergenerational issues in connection with the Ricardian debate

(Poterba and Summers [1986], Hubbard and Judd [1986b]).±/ Poterba and

Summers    argue that,   under a variety of plausible   deficit scenarios
(including      some historical ones), a substantial fraction of the deferred

tax    burden is not shifted to future generations..Z/ On the other hand, a
substantial fraction is shifted forward——is the glass half full or half
empty? Furthermore, the current deficit experience is very atypical,
and           consumers might well expect to escape liability for paying
       rational

off the lion's share of our current outstanding debt.
         Both Poterba—Summers and Hubbard—Judd also point out that, because
consumers have relatively long horizons, the nsrginal propensity to
consume out of increments to wealth is small, perhaps on the order of
.05.     They   conclude that factors such as liquidity constraints and
myopia have a much larger bearing on the Ricardian debate.
                                        —9—




         The validity of this conclusion depends upon the policy issue that

one has    in   mind. If one is concerned with short runissues, such as
stimulation     of aggregate demand within a standard Keynesian setting,
then Poterba—Summers and Hubbard—Judd are undoubtably correct (although
note that 5% of a $200 billion deficit is $10 billion, which constitutes
a non—trivial rise in consumption).       If, on the   other hand, one is
concerned    with capital accumulation in the medium and long runs,

intergenerational issues play the dominant role./ Indeed, simulations

show that, under standard life cycle assumptions, plausible deficit

policies have enormous effects on medium and long run capital stocks,

even though the short run effects may be trivial or even perverse

(Auerbach and Kotlikoff [1986]).


         2.2. Capital !brket Imperfections

        When inefficiencies in private capital markets make it difficult

or    Impossible for households to   obtain loans, government   borrowing may
have real effects (Buiter     and Tobin [1981]). Hubbard and Judd [1986a,b]

emphasize    the quantitative   importance of liquidity constraints for short

run   issues. Under    the assumption that 20% of the population is

liquidity constrained, they show that a $1 deficit—for—taxes swap could

well increase current consumption by about 254. Clearly, this is far

larger than the roughly 54 rise in consumption that would follows from a

pure wealth effect. In a somewhat different vein, studies by Drazen

[1978] and Pogue and Sgontz [1977] establish that, when liquidity

constraints bind early in life, policies involving intergenerational

transfers alter human capital accumulation, even in the presence of
                                     —10--




intergenerational aitruism.2/

        Unfortunately, these studies are all somewhat unsatisfactory, in

that they take liquidity constraints to be given exogenously.

Certainly, the effect of government policy will in general depend upon

the nature of the capital market failures which give rise to inefficien-

cies.

        Recent work explains credit rationing as the consequence of

asymmetric information (Stiglitz and Weiss [1981], Jaffee and Russell

[1976]). These approaches generate liquidity constraints as an

endogenous aspect of equilibrium. Using such models, Hayashi. [1985] and

Yotsuzuka [1986] argue that, in many situations, liquidity constraints

adjust in response to government policies, and that the nature of this

adjustment restores Ricardian equivalancer1.2/

        It is, however, apparent that the I-Iayashi—Yotsuzuka results are

highly sensitive to assumptions about the distribution of the future tax

burden. While I discuss distributional issues at greater length in the

next subsection, it is important to emphasize the particular synergy

between liquidity constraints and distribution. Accordingly, I provide

a brief analysis of Hayashi's second model, which is based upon the

Jaffee—Russell framework. I modify Hayashi's model by dropping the

assumption that the government imposes a fixed lump sum tax, and assume

instead that taxes rise with earned income.2.i/ Work effort is fixed, so

the tax is non—distortionary. I show that as long as a separating

equilibrium prevails, deficits increase the consumption of all

consumers, including those who are not liquidity constrained.
                                       —11—




Postponing taxes has real effects in this model because it allows the
government to undertake redistributions that         could   not be achieved
through current taxes (due to the existence of private information).
Strangely     enough, deficit policy is still irrelevant when a pooling

equilibrium prevails; indeed, endogenous adjustments neutralize

redistributions between individuals, despite the absence of altruistic

linkages.

         Suppose in particular that there are two types of individuals, H

and L. Both have the same first period earned income, w1. However, in

the second period,         > w. Each individual knows his type, but this is

private information. Lenders know only that the fraction p of the

population is of type L, and (1 — p)           is of type H. Following

Hayashi, I assume that default results in the loss of all period 2

resources, and that the marginal utility of period 2 consumption at

   = 0      is finite. These assumptions are for convenience only.

        Suppose for the moment that lenders make no effort to distinguish

an individual's type on the basis of his desired loan. Lenders will

then be willing to loan up to w/(1 +          r)   to each individual at the

rate r (where r is the lenders' opportunity cost of funds). Beyond

        +   r),   lenders will charge a rate r* on incremental loans, where



                                         i-p
        In figure 1, I have followed Hayashi by illustrating the decisions

of L and H consumers on the same         diagram. L's origin is at
while    H's is at          Each type's endowment point is given by E.

Under the preceding assumptions, the opportunity locus for a type H
individual is ABC.

       It is now possible to illustrate both separating and pooling

equilibria. In a separating equilibrium, lenders offer two contracts,

denoted I and S. Type L individuals would default on S (actual

consumption would then be given by J), but not on I. Given this

observation, they are indifferent between the two contracts——we resolve

thisindifference in favor of I. Type H consumers strictly prefer
S. With this pattern of self—selection, both contracts earn zero
profits. In a pooling equilibrium, lenders offer one contract, denoted
P. Type L individuals      default on the contract, and, as a result, it

yields zero profits. A pooling equilibrium prevails if and only if

type H individuals prefer P to S; otherwise, a separating

equilibrium prevails.

       Hayashi argues as follows. Suppose that the government cuts taxes

on each individual by x, and raised them by x(1 +          r)   in period 2.

Then the endowment point merely shifts along the line AB. Since the

locus ABC is unchanged, both separating and pooling equilibria are

unaltered.

       Now suppose that   taxes   are positively related   to earned income. A

tax cut in period 1 will affect after tax earned income equally for both
types. However, the attendant increase in taxes in period 2 will fall
more heavily on type H individuals.

       What is the effect of this tax cut on consumption? Note that we

can decompose the policy into two components: the deferral of a fixed,
                                                   —13—




lump—sum tax, and a period 2 redistribution from type H to type L

individuals. Hayashi's analysis demonstrates that the first component

has no real effects. I therefore focus on the second component.

       Suppose that we reduce w by x, and raise w by x(1 —
so that total resources are unchanged. w2 —                           falls, so that
                                                                w2
shifts downward to ML. They key analytic point is that ABC shifts

downward to A'B'C. To verify this, one shows that B' lies on BC.

Note that the point B' is given by the consumption vector


                  C1 = w1 + (w + x(1 —                    p)/p)/(1    + r)



                       =        —   x    —          + x(1 —   p)/p)
                  C2       w2                (w2

This   can be rewritten as

                  C1
                       =
                           w1   + w/(1 + r) + z/(1 + r*)

                            H        L
                  C2=w2—w2—z

where z     x/p, from which the desired conclusion is immediate.
       Now suppose that a separating equilibrium prevails. Subsequent to

the redistribution, the new equilibrium is given by the contracts I'

and 5'. Since type L's endowment has risen, I' will ordinarily be to

the right of I (as long as C1 is normal), and 5' must be to the

right of S (since J' lies to the right of j). Thus, deficits raise

current consumption for both types of individuals. Intuitively, the

redistribution of second period resources to type L individuals

relaxes the incentive compatability constraint on type H individuals.
                                      —14—



Type L individuals were not liquidity constrained to begin with, and

so consume more in both periods. Type H individuals were liquidity

constrained in period 1, and so increase first period consumption as

much as possible, despite the loss of lifetime resources. In fact, one

can show that when utility is time separable, type H individuals will

increase period 1 consumption by more than the present value of lost

resources in period 2. The quantitative significance of this effect may

therefore   be quite large.

       Suppose finally that a pooling equilibrium prevails. Note that as

long as the redistribution is not too large, P remains a pooling

equilibrium. Thus, redistributions between different types of

individuals in period 2 are      completely   neutralized, despite the absence

of altruistic linkages. This result is reminiscent of Bernheim and

Bagwellts analysis (although it holds for much different reasons), and

should, consequently, generate some skepticism about neutrality results

based upon models of this type.


        2.3.    RedistributIon
        Even if individuals are infinite lived and capital markets are
perfect, the deferral of taxes through deficits may alter the pattern of
incidence. Simply put, different people may bear a larger share of the
tax   burden   at different points in time. In effect, all the real effects
of debt described so far arise from redistributions of this sort, either
between successive generations, or between separate incarnations of the
same individual in distinct periods.
       A redistributlonal policy can significantly alter current
                                      —15—



aggregate     consumption only when two conditions   are   satisfied. First,
the    relevant parties must not be linked through chains of altruistically

motivated transfers (I do not give to or receive from my children; I do

not save for or borrow against my future). Second, these parties must

have    different propensities to consume resources in the      period
                                                               current

(I consume today, but my children do not, and neither do my future
incarnations). For redistributions other than those considered in sub-
sections 2.1 and 2.2 it is very easy to argue that the first condition

holds, but very difficult to establish the second in a convincing way.

As a result, there is a common presumption that, ignoring intergene-

rational issues and liquidity constraints, the distributional

consequences of postponing taxes are of second order importance.

         Certain considerations suggest that debt (Abel [1986]) and social

security (Abel [1985b]) may     stimulate   aggregate consumption by redistri-

buting resources     towards individuals with higher marginal propensities
to    consume. These policies also tend to     favor families with few
children, and this may affect fertility, thereby altering consumption
indirectly (Becker and Barro [1985],     Wildasin   [1985]).   It   is, however,
difficult to guage the quantitative importance of these effects.
      A separate set of issues arises when the distribution of future
taxes   is not known with certainty (Buiter and Tobin [1981]). To the

extent consumers save more as a precaution against uncertainty, deficits

may   actually   "crowd in" investment (Chan [1983]), although once again it

is   difficult to assess to quantitative significance of this factor. I
find   this   argument implausible. If the world was otherwise Ricardian,
                                     —16—



then one would never expect to observe deficits since the electorate

would universally oppose the gratuitous introduction of uncertainty.

Rather, huge current surpluses would result from the public's desire to

resolve uncertainty as quickly as possible.

       Future   taxes nay also be uncertain because they are related to
income, which is itself random. In this case, postponement of taxes may
result in a reduction of future net income risk, thereby inducing a rise
in   consumption (Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes [1986]). I find this

observation unsatisfactory, in that the absence of relevant insurance

markets is never explained. Hayashi's analysis of liquidity constraints

certainly drives home the point that     it   is dangerous to discuss the

effects of government policy in the presence of market failures without

modelling the failures explicitly. Indeed, in the Barsky et. al. world,

the government should intervene in insurance markets, and help to pool

risks associated with future income. Risk pooling should in no way

depend directly upon the timing of taxes. Note that a similar objection

also applies to the "crowding in" view, mentioned above.


         2.4. Distortionary Taxation

       The timing of taxes nay    be quite    important if taxes distort

behavior, and if marginal future taxes depend upon different decisions

than marginal current taxes.i.V This observation is especially relevant

to the   current   discussion when deficits are used to postpone capital

income taxes, since a reduction in marginal capital income tax rates may

cause individuals to save more, and consume less. Auerbach and Kotlikoff

[1986] argue that this effect could dominate the net wealth effect in
                                            —17—




 the short run,    even   in a life cycle world. The plausibility of this
 outcome depends in large part on intertemporal substitution elasti-
 cities. Measurement of these elasticities is a dicey problem, and well
 beyond the scope of this paper. However, in evaluating the macro-

 economic evidence discussed in sections 3 and 4,         the reader should bear
 in mind that deficits may substantially depress the long run capital
 stock   even when the short run effect is to crowd—in investment.

         A more general treatment of deficit financing in a world with

distortionary taxes gives rise to the theory of tax smoothing. This

theory suggests that tax rates should be kept relatively constant even

when    output fluctuates. Intuitively, since the deadweight loss of
taxation    rises (approximately) with the square of the tax rate, a

constant rate minimizes the average distortion (Barro [1979], Prescott

[1977], Lucas and Stokey [1983], Kingston [1984]).i/ While tax smoothing

is an important normative concept, this theory does not appear to

generate    any clear positive implications concerning the link between
deficits and    aggregate consumption.


         2.5.   Peraanent Postponement
         Feldstein [1976] criticized Barro's analysis of fiscal policy by
arguing    that, when   the   growth rate   of the economy exceeds the interest
rate,    the government can roll over deficits indefinitely. As a result,

no generation need ever actually pay any portion of the postponed

taxes. Barro [1976] responded that intergenerational linkages might

actually prevent the economy from accumulating an inefficiently large

amount of capital. This exchange spawned a separate sub—literature
                                     —18—




which focused on the relationships between gifts, bequests, and capital

over—accumulation. I have already referred to many of these papers in

subsection 2.1. While I do not think one can draw any conclusions about

the form of intergenerational altruism or the pervasiveness of inter-

generational linkages from this literature, I am convinced that two

points are now well—established. First, contrary to Barro's conjecture,

intergenerational altruism does not rule out dynamically inefficient

outcomes. Indeed, for certain specifications of preferences it     is
possible   to obtain inefficient equilibria with either positive gifts
(Weil [1984], Abel [1985]) or positive bequests (Ray [1987]). Second,
even when the economy over—accumulates capital, Ricardian equivalence
still holds as long as successive generations are operatively    linked

(Carmichael   [1982], Bernheim and   Bagwell [1986]). The key to this

second   result is that the government cannot, in the absence of other
market failures, alter the aggregate opportunity set of the private
sector through borrowing. If voluntary transfers are operative, then
individual families could mimic a policy of rolling over deficits
indefinitely by cutting the bequests (or increasing the gifts) of every
generation .141
      Despite the fact that cases of dynamic inefficiency have recieved
a large amount of attention, it is not obvious that this work is of any
practical relevance. Few if any economists today believe that the U.S.
capital stock is inefficiently large. Permanent deferral of taxes may
simply be infeasible.
                                     —19—




         2.6 MyopIa
         For Ricardian equivalence to hold, it is clearly essential for
consumers to be both highly rational and farsighted. While the rational
expectations hypothesis is much in vogue, one should be aware that
alternative    behavioral hypotheses have very different implications (see

e.g. Shefrin and Thaler [1985]). For example, consumers nay simply

choose   consumption heuristically on the basis of current disposable
income, and may   fail completely to appreciate the link between current

deficits and future taxes. If so, then the more traditional      Keynesian
view of deficits (see e.g. Blinder and Solow [1973]) is appropriate.


      2.7    Political Processes
      Government expenditures nay depend critically upon sources of

finance. Politicians may generally support various costly programs, but

oppose current tax increases. When it is possible to run deficits,

these two positions are at least logically consistent. Thus, the

availability of deficit financing may profoundly affect the size and

composition of government (Buchanan and Wagner [1977], Bohn [1985],

Alesina and Tabellini [1987]).

      Of course, it is difficult to explain such behavior on the part of

politicians without attributing appropriate views to the electorate.

One is therefore naturally led back to the issues raised in the

preceding subsections (e.g. non—neutrality in Alesina and Tabellini

[1987] results from the absence of non—distortionary taxes). It is

nevertheless   important to bear in mind the potential endogeneity of
government   expenditures, and to acknowledge that the   political process
                                       —20—



may amplify the effects of fiscal policies.



3.     Indirect   Evidence
       In this section, I evaluate the available empirical evidence on

several of the assumptions discussed in section 2. Section 3.1 concerns

the intergenerational linkage hypothesis; section 3.2 focuses on

liquidity constraints and myopia.


       3.1 Intergenerational      Transfers
       I   will organize my discussion of the linkage hypothesis around

three questions: Are significant intergenerational transfers common?

If so, are    they    intentional? Finally, are they motivated by altruism?


       U) Are        significant intergenerational transfers common?


       To begin with it is important to clarify the meaning of an

intergenerational transfer. For our purposes, feeding one's child does

not qualify. The reasons are evident: children are not generally

regarded as rational economic planners, and even if they were, they

would typically face liquidity constraints. For concreteness, consider

an individual who plans to feed and cloth his ten year old child until

age 13, at which point he expects the child to achieve full independence.

Suppose the government raises taxes on this individual, and announces

that   it will decrease taxes commensurately on his child 30 years in the
future. If the child is a rational agent with access to perfect capital

markets, the parent could simply feed him less; the child would respond

by borrowing to cover the cost of his food, and Ricardian equivalence
                                           —21—




would hold. However, if the child is unable to form sensible economic

plans or to borrow against his future earnings, the parent has few

options: if he feeds his         child   less, the child will eat less.

Consequently, the deficit policy will have real consequences. This

example establishes a general point; the Ricardian equivalence

proposition    requires the existence of operative intergenerational
linkages during a period of life in which children can form rational
economic plans, and are linked to their own futures          through borrowing or

saving.

         Some recent evidence suggests that       intergenerational   transfers
play a    very important role in the U.S. economy. In a well—known paper,

Kotlikoff and Summers [1981] calculated historical patterns of            life
cycle saving, and concluded that standard models could account for only
one fifth of aggregate capital accumulation..!! They attributed the
residual stock to intergenerational transfers, and presented some direct
evidence on gifts and bequests to support this inference (see Darby
[1979] for similar findings). Modigliani [1985] has since disputed
these results. Unfortunately, studies of this sort can at best shed
light   on the aggregate size of gifts and bequests, and provide no clue

as to the fraction of the population engaged in such transfers.

        Surprisingly, it is very difficult to obtain good microeconomic

evidence on gifts and bequests. Data on gifts seem particularly poor.

Analysis of many data sets, such as the Retirement History Survey,

suggest that intra   vivos transfers to       relatives and children living

outside   the home are   quite   small, ranging from $39   to   $60 on average,
                                      —22—




depending upon the sample year (Hurd [1986a]).       This   suggests that   gifts

are highly concentrated among the very wealthy (who, no doubt,
significantly undereport the size of their transfers). In contrast,
Kurz [1984] reports that     approximately   18% of a sample drawn from a
survey    conducted by the President's Commission on Pension Policy

received gifts averaging more than $2000, while 16% made them (tie did

not report the degree of overlap between these groups). Since the PCPP

survey collected extremely detailed and dissaggregated information about

transfers, it any well provide more reliable data. Nevertheless, Kurz's

findings may exagerate the importance of intra vivos transfers, for two

reasons. First, an unknown fraction of the observed transfers were

intragenerational (e.g. between brothers).i&/ Second, the PCPP survey

classified all persons above the age of 18 as distinct family units,

even if they lived with their parents; unmarried children were

designated "single head families." Since Kurz reports that more than

75% of those receiving transfers were single head families, these

results any in fact be consistent with those based on other surveys. To

the extent one believes that children over 18 living at home tend to be

liquidity constrained, one is led to the conclusion that intra vivos

transfers generally play a small role in      determining the effects of
fiscal    policies.

         Direct data on   transfers at death are available through estate tax
returns and probate records. Unfortunately, these data sources only

contain information on sufficiently wealthy testators, and therefore

cannot be used to draw inferences about the distribution of bequests for
                                     —23—




the   entire population.

        One can, however, in principle recover the distribution of

bequests by examining age—wealth profiles, and rates of resource

depletion after retirement. Early studies, including those using

interview surveys of saving (Lydall [1955], Projector [1968], Mulanaphy

[1974]), cross—section surveys of assets (Lydall [1955], Projector and

Weiss [1966], Smith [1975], Mirer [1979], and King and Dicks—Mireaux

[1982]), and estate   data   (Atkinson [1971], Atkinson and Harrison [1978],

Brittain [1978], Shorrocks [1975] and Menchik and David [1983]) have

with relatively few exceptions found that wealth does not decline

significantly, and perhaps even slightly increases, after retirement.

Elsewhere (Bernheim [1987a]), I have criticized these studies, and have

argued that one requires panel data to resolve these issues properly.

All recent studies employing panel data (Bernheim [1987a], Diamond and

Hausman [1984], and Hurd [1986a]) conclude that    asset   holdings decline

significantly   after retirement (by perhaps 30% over a ten year
period). While this pattern is suggestive of life cycle motives, the
avenge individual nevertheless still expects to neke a substantial
bequest.
        The dispersion of bequests is also quite important. Diamond and

Hausman [1984] and King and Dicks—Mireaux [1982] both find that      a
substantial   fraction of individuals (roughly 20%) reach retirement with

essentially no property or financial resources. In evaluating these

findings, it is essential to bear in mind that survey responses to

questions about assets are notoriously unreliable. For example, Ferber
                                       —24—




 et.al.   [1969] described the results of a validation study, which

 revealed that individuals undereport assets by as much as 50%.

 Furthermore, one would naturally expect enormous variance in the

 reliability of responses within any sample. Bernheim [1987b] reports

some evidence that corroborates this conjecture. Specifically, he finds

that if one follows the same individual through successive waves of the

Retirement History Survey, reported pension and/or social security

income varies by 50%    or more in consecutive years for a disturbingly

large fraction of the total population, and it is not uncommon to find

individuals who report no pension and/or social security income at all

between two survey years in which they reported positive benefits.     It

is therefore very difficult to distinguish low asset holdings at

retirement   from measurement error.

      (ii)    Are bequests intentional?


      A number of authors have attempted to distinguish between

intentional and accidental bequests (i.e. those caused by uncertainty

concerning length of life, coupled with failure of annuity nnrkets)

through detailed analysis of age—wealth profiles. Both Blinder, Gordon,

and Wise [1980] and Hurd [198Gb] estimate optimizing models of asset

accumulation using data drawn from the Retirement History Survey. Their

findings are extremely sensitive to functional specification. Blinder,

Gordon, and Wise's estimates of bequest motive parameters are

essentially uninformative. Hurd finds no evidence to    indicate the
presence of a bequest   motive, but this conclusion may be driven by his
                                              —25-.




specification of utility, wtich is linear in bequests. Quasi—linearity

implies    that   the marginal   propensity to bequeath out of lifetime
resources is zero      up   to some threshold, beyond which it jumps
discontinuously to unity (this          is    true    regardless of parameter

values). As a result, if         the   actual    marginal propensity is closer to
zero   than to unity, one might well expect to fit a very high threshold

value, or equivalently, a very small bequest motive.

       Bernheim [1987a] argued that            one must be very   careful about

interpretting age—wealth profiles when individuals hold a substantial
fraction   of their assets as annuities (social security,             pensions).
Previous   authors had suggested that the inclusion of annuities would

accentuate the hump—shaped age—wealth profile, since the actuarial value

of survival contingent claims falls with age (Mirer [19793). Indeed,

Dicks—Mireaux and King [1984] found evidence of "a clear life—cycle

pattern" when the actuarial value of annuity claims was included in

measures   of net worth. Bernhejm pointed out that              actuarial valuation is

inappropriate     if one wishes to judge the plausibility of life cycle
motives, and showed instead that             the simple   discounted value of future
benefits (ignoring the possibility of death) is ordinarily a good
approximation to the relevant notion of annuity value. His analysis
reversed   the findings of Dicks—Mireaux and King: the proper inclusion

of annuities generates wealth profiles that decline very little if at

all after retirement. Apparently, this point is not yet well

appreciated (see e.g. Modigliani [1986]).

       Bernheim also examined the response of rates of asset decumulation
                                    —26-.




 to changes in levels of annuitization. Theory predicts that annuities

should accelerate decumulation under the life cycle hypothesis, and slow

it in the presence of bequest motives. The evidence supports the latter

pattern, but not overwhelmingly.

        Hurd [1986a] examined differences between the age—wealth profiles

of individuals with and without children, and found that those with

children tend to dissave slightly more rapidly than those without

children (unfortunately, his test of the hypothesis of equality between

the dissaving rates for these groups is nonparametric and does not yield

a confidence interval on the   difference,   so that one cannot judge the

power of his tests against interesting alternatives). He views this as
a contradiction of the bequest motive hypothesis. It is, however,
consistent   with two—way altruism. A parent ay dissave less rapidly

because he cares for his child. However, part of his saving is also

precautionary. He will reduce this component if he believes his        child
will provide for him an an emergency. The     net   effect is ambiguous.

        Hammermesh and Menchik [1986] show that   bequests   are positively

related to expected longevity, and negatively related to unexpected

longevity. They view the first pattern as indicative of a bequest

motive: increased longivity raises lifetime resources, and bequests are

presumably normal. However, this conclusion does not follow if

increased longevity does not imply a proportionate rise in earnings

potential. The observed pattern could also be consistent with life

cycle motives if greater longevity is associated with greater

uncertainty.
                                     —27—




        A second strategy for distinguishing between intentional and
unintentional bequests is to examine the relationship between observed
bequests and the characteristics of recipients. In the absence of a
bequest   motive, recipient characteristics should have no discernable

effects. Using probate data, Tomes [1981] finds that bequests are

inversely related to the resources of children; he interprets this as

evidence in favor of a bequest motive. However, this pattern is also

consistent with the view that parents with wealthier children have less

of a precautionary motive for saving, since they can count on their

children   in   emergencies. Since emergencies might actually arise

infrequently, the typical family might still make no intergenerational

transfers. In addition, Menchik [1984] has raised    serious questions
about   the reliability of Tomes' data. One should also bear in mind the

unrepresentative nature of probate samples.

        A third strategy is to evaluate evidence concerning attitudes

towards various forms of insurance. Life cycle consumers should be

anxious to annuitize their resources, even at relatively unfair rates

(Yaari [1965]). Nevertheless, there seems to be a general resistance to

annuitization (Bernheim, Shielfer, and Summers [1985]). Friedman and

Warshawsky [1985a, 1985b] document the availability of annuities on

private markets, and conclude that one must posit a bequest motive to

explain portfolio choices and patterns of accumulation. They do not,

however, consider precautionary motives arising from fear of large

unplanned expenses, such as medical costs. These can create a

reluctance to annuitize, and would explain higher levels of accumulation
                                     —28—




(see Kotlikoff [1986b] for some simulation results).

      One can, however, distinguish between precautionary and bequest

motives by examining behavioral responses to changes in the level of

annuity provision. If a bequest motive is present, consumers can undo

annuities by purchasing life insurance. This is not the case if

resistance    to annuities arises from the fear of large unplanned
expenses. Bernheim [1985] analyzes a cross—section of elderly
individuals   drawn from the Retirement History Survey, and concludes that

increased levels of annuitization do in fact stimulate life insurance

purchases. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that a large

fraction   of elderly individuals intend to leave bequests.

      (iii)    Are bequests altruistically motivated?


      Bernheim, Schleifer, and Summers [1985] (BSS) provide evidence

linking the behavior of children (parental visits) to the bequeathable

assets of parents. This relationship is particularly strong when

parents are in poor health, and holds in families with two    or   more

children, but not in single child families. This last observation is

particularly important, since the single/multiple child distinction is

predicted by the BSS model of strategic bequests, but not by Becker's

[1974, 1981] formulation of the altruistic motive. Furthermore, this

distinction deflects nany methodological criticisms: unless one

believes that there is a spurious behavioral difference between single

and multiple child families, it is difficult to offer another

explanation of this result.
                                         —29—



        Cox [1987] and Kurz [1984] both provide evidence on intra vjvos

transfers that reinforces the BSS conclusion. Cox finds that, while the

probability of receiving a transfer falls with the recipient's income,

the    magnitude of transfers conditional upon receipt rises. The first
finding is consistent both with exchange and altruistic motives.

However, the second is strictly inconsistent with altruism. The

exchange theory yields an ambiguous prediction, since a rise in the

recipients income increases the price of his services, and since

bequests   measure expenditures on services, rather than quantity. An
additional implication of the altruistic model is that the            consumption

of each family member should depend only upon the family's total wealth,

so that a redistribution of wealth between a donor and the corresponding

recipient will be completely offset by private transfers. Kurz tests

this proposition by looking separately at the effects of donors' and

recipients' wealth on transfers. His results are strongly inconsistent

with the prediction outlined above. Unfortunately, both studies are

based upon the PCPP survey, which does not contain information on the

characteristics of both donors and recipients for any single

observation. This creates an important omitted             variables problem, since
parental characteristics (such as wealth) are undoubtably correlated
with   those   of their children, and certainly influence the magnitude of
transfers. Cox makes some corrections           for   this potential bias, and
finds that his    results are essentially unaffected.

        Independent corroboration   of   the    exchange—motive hypothesis is
provided by survey responses to direct questions about parental motives
                                        —30—



(Sussman, Cates,     and   Smith [1970], Horioka   [1983]).   In addition, this

model   can better account for consumers' evident reluctance to give
gifts, despite significant tax advantages (Shoup [1966], Cooper [1979],
ESS; see also Adams [1978] for an opposing viewpoint, and BSS, p. 1071,
footnote 25 for a response).
        Menchik, Irvine, and Jianakoplos [1986] find some evidence that           is

both    consistent with the altruistic motive, and inconsistent with one

important formulation of the exchange motive (Kotlikoff and Spivak's

[1981] "family as an annuity" hypothesis). Using data from the National

Longitudinal Survey, they show that parental expression of an          intent to
bequeath is almost completely uncorrelated with the perception that

children would provide aupport during periods of financial hardship.

Note in addition that Bernheim's [1985] finding concerning life

insurance purchases (discussed above) is also inconsistent with the

"family   as an   annuity" hypothesis: when forced to hold high levels of

annuities, a life cycle consumer would never undo this by purchasing

life   insurance, only to undo his life insurance purchase by entering
into an annuity agreement with his family members. However, the results
of these studies are compatible with the more general model of exchange
described by BSS.
        Some support for the altruism model can L found in an important

paper by Tomes [1981], which I have already mentioned in another

connection. However, his central finding——that bequests are negatively

related   to recipients' resources——is easily reconciled with the exchange
hypothesis (recall Cox's observation that      the   exchange model   yields an
                                            —31—



ambiguous prediction concerning the effect of recipients' resources on

transfers; it is, however, somewhat puzzling that Cox and Tomes obtain

coefficients of opposite signs in studies of, respectively, intra vivos

transfers and bequests). While Tomes does directly reject a link

between bequests and the behavior of one's children, he does not adjust

for many sources of potential bias, as do BSS.

            Both models of intergenerational transfers are inconsistent with

Menchik's [1980, 1984] finding that testators tend to divide bequests

equally between their children. This observation is somewhat troubling,

since it suggests that we do not yet fully understand bequest motives.

However, its importance is generally exaggerated. Suppose for example

that equal division simply reflects an egalitarian constraint

superimposed upon other motives by social norms. If consumers are

otherwise altruistic, Ricardian equivalence will still hold (Abel and

Bernheiin [1986]). Furthermore, parents could still manipulate their

children subject to the constraint that they divide transfers equally in

equilibrium (since a sizable minority of testators do not follow the

equal division rule, it seems likely that social norms do not proscribe

penalizing a miscreant offspring). Accordingly, Menchik's finding is

not   particularly telling in the        current   context.
            I   have   now discussed evidence concerning each of three components
of    the   intergenerational linkage hypothesis. Taken as a whole, this

hypothesis has an additional, directly testable implication: economic

activity should be independent of the distribution of resources across

generations. Boskin and Kotlikoff [1985] test this directly with
                                        —32—



aggregate time series data, and find that        the   age distribution of

resources matters a great deal. However, their study suffers from many

of the problems encountered in other time series investigations (see

section 4).       In   addition, their procedure is unusually dependent upon

assumptions      about preferences and uncertainty, in that they extrapolate
consumption profiles, and then attempt to explain the difference between
actual   and predicted consumption. The behavioral assumptions underlying

their calculations are very strong, and of questionable validity (see

e.g. Starrett [1986] for a discussion of isoelastic, intertemporally

separable utility functions).

         Overall, bequests seem to be significant for a large segment of

the population. In addition, much microeconomic evidence is

inconsistent with traditional life cycle models. One can explain some,

but not all of this evidence by appealing to risk aversion concerning

length    of life and unplanned expenses. Indeed, data on life insurance
holdings point directly to a bequest motive. However, much evidence
indicates      that bequests are not motivated solely by altruism. In

contrast, no existing evidence successfully isolates the altruistic

motive. I conclude that a substantial minority of individuals probably

make little or no intentional transfers,       and that    most other individuals

are   motivated    by a variety of factors.


         3.2   LiguicLity constraints and tyopia
         There   is now a large literature which tests various implications
of the joint hypotheses that consumers maximize intertemporal utility,
and capital markets function efuicently. Much of this literature builds
                                  —33--




upon Halits [1978] stochastic permanent income hypothesis. Following

Hall, many investigators have estimated consumption Euler equations to

test orthogonality conditions (i.e. innovations in consumption should be

unrelated to lagged information). Others have supplemented Hall's model

with a process describing the evolution of income, and estimated

multiple equation systems to determine whether consumption is

excessively sensitive to income innovations (see Sargent [1978] and

Flavin [1981]). In the interests of conserving space, I refer the

reader to two excellent surveys of this literature by King [1983] and

Hayashi [1985]. Despite numerous problems with estimation and

interpretation, the evidence on talance supports the view that   a   sizable

minority (roughly 20%) of individuals fail to behave in a way that is

consistent with unconstrained intertemporal optimization. Unfortunately,

these studies do not identify the constrained group (does it consists of

one set of irrational individuals, or do liquidity constraints tend to

bind at some particular point in the life cycle?), nor do they allow us

to determine the persistence of liquidity constrained states. Both

issues are extremely important in the current context.

      At this point, it is appropriate to mention a number of studies

which use microeconomic data to measure the relationship between asset

accumulation and the present value of anticipated social security

benefits (Feldstein and Pellechio [1979], Kotlikoff [1979], Blinder,

Gordon, and Wise [1980], Diamond and Hausman 11984], Kurz [1981, 1984],

Dicks—Mireaux and King [1984]). There seems to be a weak consensus

within the profession that social security partially displaces personal
                                     —34—



saving,by perhaps twenty to forty cents on the dollar. It is important
to understand that this isnota direct test of Ricardian equivalence,
since   it tells us nothing about aggregate saving. Indeed, If capital
markets   are perfect and successive generations are linked by
altruistically     motivated transfers, then family members should be

entirely indifferent about who (parents or children) does the saving...1Z/

Accordingly, one cannot test the full Ricardian hypothesis without

information about the wealth of all relevant family members.

        Nevertheless, If we reject the intergenerational linkage

hypothesis on the basis of other information, then these studies do

provide valid tests of life cycle planning models, in that     they   allow us

to determine whether the postponement of income affects current

consumption..iJ Viewed in this light, the evidence points to significant

liquidity constraints or myopia over long planning periods. There are,

of course, other explanations for these findings. Social security may

be an imperfect substitute for other assets. Heroic assumptions about

expected social security benefits may be quite wide of the mark

(although see Bernheirn [1987b]). Finally, mispecification of the social

security wealth variable may create large downward biases in estimates

of wealth displacement (Bernheim {1987c}).



4.      Direct Evidence: Aggregate Time Series
        i now turn my attention to studies which attempt to   measure the

effects   of deficits directly from aggregate time series data. In
subsection 4.1, I discuss some general problems which, taken together,
                                        —35—




may   well    be insuperable. Subsections 4.2 arid 4.3 concern studies of

real variables (especially consumption) and nominal variables

(especially interest rates), respectively. Subsection 4.4 summarizes.


        4.1   • General   problems

        It is useful to begin this discussion by summarizing eight common

problems shared by virtually all studies which use macro time series

data to measure the effects of deficits.

        First, measurement of debts and deficits is problemmatic (see

Eisner and Pieper [1984, 1986], Eisner [1986], and Boskin [1982,

1986]). Measurement issues include: inflation adjustments, adjustments

from par      to   market values, properly accounting for government assets and

investments as well as for contingent liabilities, and valuing

liabilities from social insurance programs. Many of these issues pose

thorny conceptual problems, so that the "right" measure is not obvious

(Kotlikoff j1986b]). Furthermore, econometric estimates appear highly

sensitive to the set of corrections that one actually makes (Boskin

[1986]).

        Second, completely aside from issues about the deficit, it is not

at all clear that economists have yet devised satisfactory models for

aggregate variables, including consumption and interest rates (see for

example Hayashi's [1985] discussion of aggregate consumption

relationships). To the extent one mispecifies the relationship of

interest,      estimates of fiscal effects may be   highly unreliable, being

contaminated        by biases of unknown direction and   magnitude. Evidence

that   appears to reject some hypothesis about deficits may in fact simply
                                  —36—



reject the underlying model.

      Third, it is important to distinguish between expected and

unexpected movements of explanatory variables. Indeed, under the

stochastic permanent income hypothesis, only unexpected changes matter.

Accordingly, if consumers anticipated historical movements in the

deficit perfectly, then we might well find no empirical relationship

between deficits and concurrent economic activity, even though real

activity would have been much different had the government followed some

alternative deficit policy.12/

      One method cf distinghishing the effects of unexpected changes in

the deficit is to model the evolution of deficits statistically, and

relate deficit innovations to consumption innovations (i.e. run VAR's,

and employ cross—equation restrictions implied by rational expectations).

This procedure is valid only if consumers form expectations by the same

statistical model used by the econometrician. In practice, VAR models

are very parsimonious, and omit a tremendous amount of information, so

that a portion of the deficit "innovation" may be expected. This would

create serious biases in favor of Ricardian equivaience..?2'

      I strongly suspect that VAR models omit important institutional

information, which individuals actually use to form their expectations.

Each year, a variety of organizations (including the Council of Economic

Advisors and the Congressional Budget Office) make well—publicized

forecasts of deficits and spending. These forecasts are presumably

based upon current knowledge of legislative plans and programs, in

addition to recent economic performance. I conjecture that such
                                    —37-.




forecasts   are highly correlated with the prediction error from simple

VAR   models.
        I investigated this hypothesis by estimating some simple VAR

processes for deficits, government expenditures (federal, state, and

local spending on goods and services), and net national product (all in

real per capita terms.) using annual data obtained from the Federal

Reserve data tank. In one specification, I included three lagged values

of each variable; in the other, I included five lags. I estimated both

models for the sample period 1956 to 1984, using data for years prior to

1956 to accomodate the lag structure. I then reestimated these models,

adding to each equation the forecast of deficits and government spending

published in the Economic Report of the President, beginning in 1956.

While   I suspect that these forecasts may in some cases have been shaped
as    much by politics as by the desire for accuracy, my purpose was merely

to determine whether institutionally based forecasts would enter

significantly.

        While the forecast variables did not enter into the equations for

income and government spending with statistically significant

coefficients, the forecasted deficit showed up quite strongly in the

deficit equations. Specifically, the        coefficients   were 1.01   with   a t—

stat of 5.11, and 0.92 with a t—stat of 3.92 for the three and five lag

models, respectively. These coefficients suggest that the VAR            models

entirely ignore the marginal information incorporated in the

institutional forecasts. In addition, this information accounted for a

high fraction of the residual variation: the addition of the forecast
                                    —38—



variables raised the R2's is the deficit equations from 0.900 to 0.959,

and from 0.940 to 0.974 for the three and five lag models, respectively.

      The important point here is not simply that one can explain part

of the VAR forecast error through the addition of variables——certainly,

this is almost always the case. Rather, my results suggest that more

than half of the VAR error is explainable by information that

individuals almost certainly use when forming expectations. While these

calculations do not necessarily establish that more complicated VAR

models (using perhaps more variables, more lags, and quarterly, or

monthly data) face similar problems, I take them to be strongly

suggestive.

      Fourth, the levels of explanatory variables, as well as the

innovations in these variables, convey an amalgum of information about

future events. Current deficits (or innovations in the deficit) may be

correlated with future income or government spending. Realizing this,

consumers may change spending today in response to current deficit
policy, but not because of the deficit.fl'
      Fifth, endogeneity is a severe    problem. Deficits, government

spending,    consumption, income, and interest rates   may all   be determined
simultaneously. While some authors     have employed instrumental

variables,    the exogeneity of their instruments is highly questionable.
      Sixth, it is very difficult to distinguish between the effects        of

different    fiscal policy variables. Most obviously, until very recently
government spending and deficits moved together very closely. This
aside, there is a more subtle problem concerning identification. We are
                                         —39—




generally    concerned with   five   fiscal policy variables: government

spending, transfers, taxes, deficits, and debt. Each has          an   independent

effect on economic activity. Yet the first four variables plus interest

on the debt sum to zero. Typically, one deals with this problem by

assuming that, since taxes decrease disposable income, the tax

coefficient equals the negative of the income coefficient. But this

assumption is valid only when taxes are non—distortionary. Recall that

a rise in deficits with spending constant may       well    imply a fall In

current    capital income taxes, so saving may rise even though deficits
themselves    actually stimulate consumption. To identify these        models

properly,    we therefore need data on effective marginal tax       rates,
especially    for capital income. Unfortunately,     movements in marginal tax
rates may    follow movements in revenue rather closely, making

identification difficult. Furthermore, measurement of effective tax

rates   on capital income is both complex and controversial (see e.g. King

and Fullerton [1984]). It would be extremely difficult to obtain a

reliable series.

        Seventh, no existing study has attempted to measure the relation-

ship between the effects of deficits and the       length   of the associated

payback period. Poterba and Summers [1986] argue that          deficits have
actually    been paid off rather quickly during the twentieth century. If

so, evidence from this century only bears on deficit policies where

rapid payback is envisioned. Since the current fiscal experience is

extremely atypical, it Is not at all clear that the historical pattern

will persist, and it is even less clear that the average taxpayer
                                      —40—



expects it to persist. It is therefore extremely dangerous to draw

inferences from U.S. time series about the effects of current deficit

policy, or any other policy which involves the extended deferral of

taxes.

         Eighth, it may be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to

distinguish between interesting hypotheses given the level of

macroeconomic noise. Recall the discussion of section 2: when the

intergenerational linkage hypothesis is violated, the marginal

propensity      to consume out of temporary deficits may be only five cents
on the dollar. Since this short run effect is so small, we may have
difficulty picking it up in the data, despite the existence of enormous
long run effects. Indeed, it may be hard to distinguish between zero,

five cents, and twenty five cents on the dollar (the latter being the
hypothesized effect in a world where some consumers are liquidity
constrained).

         4.2.  Studies of real variables
         4.2.1. Consumption function studies
         Table   1 summarizes the methodologies and results of studies that

estimate aggregate consumption functions in order to assess the real

impact of deficits. A cursory reading of these papers suggests that

various    authors have reached markedly different conclusions through

essentially similar analyses of U.S. time series data. I begin this

subsection by arguing that these differences are largely illusory.

Interpreted properly, virtually all studies indicate that every dollar

of    deficits stimulates between $0.20 and $0.50 of current consumer

spending.

        Apparent differences in results can                      in   most cases be traced to

different formulations of the                null   hypothesis. A number of authors set

out to estimate an equation such as the following:


                               —                      —
(1)       Ct = a0 +    ai(Y        T)    +

                                                                                 Xa
where     C is consumption, Y is national income, T is tax revenues, G

is government spending, D is debt, W is private wealth, r is the

interest rate, X is a vector of other exogenous variables, and                               is a

stochastic error term (so that Y — T                       is disposable income, and T —         G

— rD    is government surplus). The natural null hypothesis for this

specification is a2 = 0 ——the alternative is the so—called "tax

discounting hypothesis," which               holds    that       consumers at least partially
anticipate future taxes. A second group of authors estimate

                                                                                   +       +X+
(i.e.   they use gross income, rather than net income). For equation (2),

the natural    null   hypothesis is 2 = 0, which corresponds to pure

Ricardian equivalence.

        The   hypothesis that a2              0 is certainly a straw man——few people
believe   that all    consumers are completely myopic. Rather than test
polar   views, one should be ocncerned with quantifying the effects of

deficits on current consumption. In this spirit, It is useful to note
                                          —42—




that (1)   and (2) are "almost" the same. Specifically, if the interest

rate is time invariant, then one obtain (2) from (1) through a linear

transformation of variables. The coefficients and error terms are then

related as follows: P0         = a0, 1 =      'l   2 =      a2
                                                                 —

                                                       e;    a2 = 0

represents   the pure Keynesian view, a2 = a1               (2 = 0)   represents perfect

Ricardian equivalence, and a1 — a2 (p3)                measures the effect on current

consumption of a $1 tax—for—deficit swap.

        Ricardian   advocates have objected to this interpretation                  of


a1 — a2    on   two grounds. First, they claim that since government
surplus    is more variable than disposable income, one would expect to

find a2 < a (see e.g. Tanner [1978]). Yet this is plainly false.

Under the Ricardian view, variability of the surplus has no effect on

consumption, so in specification (2) one must estimate p2 =                     0

                                 In terms of equation (1), a2 = a1              is required
(equivalently, a2 =      a1).
to purge disposable income of the spurious tax component (a3                        and
                                                                                          a4

will adjust accordingly). Indeed, under the Keynesian view, high

volatility biases P2           towards zero, so if anything this consideration

suggests that P2 (a2 — a1)            understates the effect of deficits.

Second, they argue that if one measures Yt as current income rather

than permanent income, one nay well find                     * 0 simply because

government surplus      helps to predict permanent income. Indeed, if

consumption does depend upon permanent income and if current income and

taxes move procyclically, then one would expect to find p2 < 0

 (a2 < a1). However, many authors include cyclical variables in                           ——it
                                     —43—




is    then not at all clear that the partial correlation between permanent

income and taxes is negative. Other authors use cyclically adjusted

measures of deficits. In these cases, the direction and significance of

the resulting bias is not at all obvious.

        With this observation in mind, I now turn to specific studies.

The collumn labelled "a" under the heading "Deficit Effects" contains

results based upon specifications that resemble equation (1). Although

we are ultimately interested in the magnitude of a2 — a1, I report

estimates    of a2   for two reasons. First, it is often difficult to

infer         from these   studies.' Second, even if    one   had an   estimate of


a1,
       it would be impossible to calculate a standard error for the
difference    in the absence of information about correlations between

parameter estimates. I will simply note that in most cases, the

estimated coefficient of     current disposable   income is at least 0.6 or

0.7, even when one includes a lagged income variable. Since the long

run marginal propensity to consume is probably more on the order of 0.8

or 0.9, one should regard 0.6 or 0.7 as lower bounds for a1.

         Inspection of the a2 collumn reveals that most estimates tend to

cluster around 0.25. The highest is 0.29, and there are a number of

estimates that are substantially lower. In addition, most of these

coefficients are estimated fairly precisely——standard errors tend to be

in the neighborhood of 0.1. Accordingly, the evidence uniformly

supports the view that a $1 deficit—for—taxes swap raises consumption by

at least $0.40 to 0.50, and one can be extremely confident that the

estimated effect exceeds $0.10 to     0.202/
                                   —44—




       Inspection of the —2 collumn       reveals a somewhat more

conservative picture. The median estimate is around 0.2, indicating

that a $1 deficit—for—taxes swap raises consumption by about $0.20. The

range of estimates is, however, quite large. The low estimates come

exclusively from three studies: Kormendi [1983], Seater and Mariano

[1985], and Evans [1985]. In the last two cases, the corresponding

standard errors are so large that any reasonable confidence interval

subsumes every hypothesis ranging from pure Keynesianism to pure

Ricardianismr! Kormendi's [1983] estimates are far more precise, but

even in this case reasonable confidence intervals do not rule out the

kind of small positive wealth effects that would be associated with

failure of the intergenerational linkage hypothesis. Note that the

other coefficients in this collumn consistently indicate that deficits

have   significant real effects, and in many cases the estimate is quite
precise. Two studies merit further comment. Since Reid [1985] employs
multi—year full cycle avenges, the transitory components of his
v'ric.ases are presumably smaller than in other studies. It is therefore

noteworthy that he obtains relatively large deficit coefficients.

Boskin's [1985] estimates, which are based upon improved measures of the

deficit (including cyclical corrections), also imply large real effects.

        Table 1 also contains a collumn labelled "Debt Effect." To

evaluate these coefficients, one should compare them to marginal

propensities to consume out of other forms of private wealth..! Various

studies place this propensity around 0.03 to 0.05. Note that Tanner

 [1970], Yawitz and Meyer [1976], Feldstein [1982a], Seater [1982],
                                           —45—




Seater and Mariano [1985], Boskin [1985] and Modigliani and Sterling

[1986] all produce estimates in this range, many of which are                 quite
precise. This supports the view that           government   bonds are net

wealth../ Several studies, including Tanner [1979], Seater [1982], and

Evans [1985] produce very small or even negative coefficients, but in

each    case the estimated standard error is very large, and any reasonable
confidence interval subsumes         every conceivable hypothesis ranging from

pure    Ricardianism    to pure Keynesianism. Only Kormendi's [1983] results

allow    one to reject the hypothesis that a        substantial fraction of

government       bonds is net wealth.
         Since    Kormendi stands alone    in finding support for the Ricardian
view, his work deserves further comment. It is noteworthy that other
aspects of his       results   are extremely peculiar (e.g. he finds that the

long run   marginal    propensity    to consume   out of income is around 0.3),

and indicative of potentially severe mispecification. Furthermore,                    his

findings do not appear to be very robust either with respect to the

sample period, or with respect to          plausible   alternative specifications
(see Barth, Iden, and Russek [1984—85, 1986], Modigliani and Sterling
[1986], and Kormendi and Meguire [1986] for a response).
        Note that    the   preponderance of   studies   in Table I   employ   OLS (see
the colluinn labelled "Technique"). Failure to            treat   potential
endogeneity is a serious omission. Shocks to             consumption   may be
correlated with shocks to        income,   which in turn raise     tax revenues

(lower   deficits). ThUS, there is a natural bias in favor of Ricardian

equivalence, even in a Keynesian world. Although Feldstein [1982a] and
                                   —46—




Seater and Mariano [1985] employ instrumental variables, the validity of
their instruments is highly questionable.1/
      Table 1 also contains a partial listing of ?tkey omitted
variables.'t! A number of studies fail to include either a measure of
             deficits or government debt. Such studies are naturally less
government
informative, and tend to confound the effects of debts and deficits,

which are correlated. Others omit a measure of government spending.

Since deficits are highly correlated with spending, and since government

consumption appears to be a substitute for private consumption

(Kormendi [1983], Aschauer [1985], Kormendi, L.aHaye, and Meguire

[1986]), this creates a bias in favor of Ricardian equivalence.     Several

other studies (Evans [1985], Boskin [1985], Modigliani and Sterling

[1986]) include government spending, but impose the potentially spurious

restriction that government spending is neither a substitute nor a

complement for private consumption. In some cases, private wealth is

omitted. Yawitz and Meyer [1976] show that this may bias estimates of

the deficit effect downwards. In addition, private wealth is also

almost certainly correlated with government debt. Finally, all studies

 (with the exception of Seater and Mariano [1985]) exclude measures of

 marginal tax rates. I emphasized the importance of controlling for tax

 rates in subsection 4.1. Indeed, Seater and Mariano's finding that

 personal tax rates enter significantly corroborates this view.

 Unfortunately, they do not include corporate tax rates, which are

 perhaps the most critical determinants of   effective levies on capital
 income (see King and Fullerton [1984]).
                                             —47—




         Several    papers   have documented    the sensitivity of certain     results
to   the redefinition of certain variables (see e.g. Yawitz and Meyer

[1976], Buiter and Tobin [1979], Seater and Mariano [1985], Boskin

[1985],    Barth,   Iden, and Russek [1984—85, 1986], and Modigliani and

Sterling [1986]), as well as to the choice of sample period (see e.g.

Barth, Iden, and Russek [1984—85, 1986] or Tanner [1978]). The atypical

nature of war years is particularly evident, and calls into serious

question studies which focus on wartime periods (e.g. Evans [1985]).

         In addition to the studies listed above, there is also a

literature which estimates the relationship between aggregate social

security wealth and consumption (see e.g. Feldstein [1974], Munnell

[1974], Barro [1978], and Darby [1979]). These studies are subject to

the general criticisms noted          in   section 4.1. In addition, they are of

limited   interest because the critical variable, aggregate social
security wealth, is nearly impossible               to measure. Extreme sensitivity

of estimates to the      method of constructing this variable is evident in
papers    by Barro [1978], Leimer and Lesnoy [1982], and Feldstein

[1982b]. Auerbach and Kotlikoff [1983] have also conducted simulations

which suggest that macro estimates of social security's impact on

consumption are likely to be highly unstable. Little weight should be

attached    to these studies.

       4.2.2.      Consumption Euler equation studies

       There    is a close relationship between the          Ricardian   equivalence
proposition and the      stochastic    permanent income hypothesis. This
observation suggests that        it   may be possible to design more powerful
                                     —48—




tests of the Ricardian view by employing a consumption Euler equation

approach. Yet this approach has important limitations.

      Tests of the Euler equation specification are generally

unfavorable   to   the stochastic permanent income model of aggregate

consumption   (see   Hayashi [1985]). Yet this finding may reflect factors

that have nothing to do with Ricardian equivalence (e.g. failure of

conditions for valid aggregation). Furthermore, even if these factors

were related to Ricardian assumptions, one would learn very little: as

long as the Euler equation is mispecified, one cannot use it to measure

the effects of deficits (a different specification, based upon some

alternative behavioral model, would be called for).

      Failure to reject the Euler equation restrictions is, in the

current context, also uniformative. Ricardian equivalence may fail for

reasons that do not invalidate this specification (e.g. consumers plan

consumption and saving rationally, but are myopic about the link between

current deficits and future taxes). In addition, it is difficult to

gauge the power of such tests against interesting alternatives (failure

to reject may result from imprecision). Nevertheless, in this case one

 could in principle measure the effects of government borrowing by

 including a measure of the current deficit innovation.

       Relatively few studies of deficits have adopted this approach.

 Aschauer [1985] estimates a consumption Euler equation using quarterly

 U.S. data (1948—81), and finds that lagged values of deficits are

 correlated with the consumption innovation. Rather than reject either

 Ricardian equivalence or the behavioral specification, he attributes
                                    -49—



this   to two factors: first, deficits are correlated with government

spending, and second, government spending is substitutable for private

consumption. He then tests (and does not reject) the hypothesis that

lagged deficits matter only insofar as they are used to form

expectations about government spending. Aschauer claims that his

evidence jointly supports the stochastic permanent income hypothesis,

rational expectations, and Ricardian equivalence. I take this support

to be extremely weak at best, for three reasons. First, if consumers

are rational about consumption but myopic about the link between taxes

and deficits, or if the intergenerational linkage hypothesis is invalid,

one would find exactly this pattern, despite the failure of Ricardian

equivalance. Past deficits would be uncorrelated with Euler equation

errors   except insofar as they helped to predict government consumption
(a component of total consumption). Nevertheless, unanticipated changes
in the deficit would still have an independent effect on current
consumption. Aschauer does not test for this. Second, the Euler
equation   specification might still fail other tests   for reasons bearing
on   the validity of Ricardian equivalence. Third,    Aschauer does not
discuss   the power of his test against particular alternatives. It is

possible that one would also be unable to reject the hypothesis that

lagged deficits have very large effects on the current consumption

innovation,   independent of their role in predicting government spending.
       Poterba and Summers [1986] also estimate a consumption Euler
equation using quarterly   U.S. data (1970—86). They include a tax

abatement variable, which   reflects the current   year impact of tax cuts
                                    —50—




enacted into law during previous years. The coefficient of this
variable is very large, but estimated imprecisely. Furthermore, since

the abatement variable belongs to each consumer's lagged information

set, Poterba and Summers effectively reject their Euler equation

specification on the basis of an orthogonality test. This obscures the

interpretation   of the tax abatement   coefficient.

      It   is also obvious from inspection of their tables that Poterba
and Summers' results are driven by recent experience——during the 8Ots
deficits   have been high and saving low. While this could be explained

by rising expectations, the authors argue that forecasts of income and

GNP growth during this period looked relatively bad. Yet econometric

forecasts need not reflect consumer expectations. In particular, much

evidence suggests that President Reagan has inspired public confidence.2/


      4.2.3. Studies of Aggregate Demand and GNP

      Eisner and Pieper [1984, 1986] and Boskiri [1986] estimate reduced

form macro models to measure the effects of deficits on the size and

composition of GNP. Unfortunately, there is no compelling a priori

reason for excluding variables in any reduced form equation, so it is

hard to distinguish cause and effect. In my view, this evidence simply

describes correlations without permitting a behavioral interpretation.

The results of such studies are at very best suggestive of the

possibility that deficits might have real effects.

      4.3 Studies   of   nominal variables
      4.3.1.   Interest rates

      Common wisdom holds that deficits raise interest rates. Economic

theory suggests that this might occur for two reasons. First, if

deficits depress saving, then interest rates must rise to bring saving

and investment back into balance. Second, if deficits stimulate

aggregate demand, then the transactions demand for money may rise. With

a fixed stock of money, higher interest rates are necessary to choke off

the excess desire for liquidity. Since both effects can occur only if

individuals perceive government bonds to be net wealth, these

observations suggest a test of the Ricardian hypothesis.

      The value of this test depends to a very large extent upon one's

view of international capital markets. If international capital flows

equalize interest rates across countries, then U.S. deficits cannot

sustain domestic interest rates in excess of world rates. Work by

Feldstein and Horioka [1980] and Harberger [1978] has spawned a

substantial literature which studies the issues of capital mobility and

interest rate equalization. A detailed discussion of this work would

carry me much too far afield. Instead, I simply note that one cannot

distinguish between the Ricardian equivalence and perfect capital

markets hypotheses on the basis of reduced form relationships between

government borrowing and interest rates.

      There are nevertheless a very large number of studies that

estimate such relationships. The Congressional Budget Office [1987] has

recently summarized the methods and results of some two dozen studies.
                                            —52—



The evidence is extremely mixed. Rather than           reiterate this summary, I
will organize my discussion around the major problems encountered by
analyses of interest rates, and I will focus primarily upon recent
papers that    make   some attempt to overcome these problems (Dwyer [1982],
Evans [1985,     1986a, 1986b, 1986c, 1987], Plosser [1982, 1986], and

Feldstein [1986b]).

        It is important to emphasize that all of the issues raised in

subsection 4.1 are directly relevant in the          current   context. Two of

these   merit further elaboration.
        First,   a number of papers employ very specific models of interest

rate determination. Studies by Plosser [1982, 1986] and Evans [1986a,

1986b, 1986c, 1987] invoke the efficient markets hypothesis, and employ

restrictive assumptions about the term structure, such as time and

maturity invariant risk premia. One must always bear in mind that these

studies   test Ricardian equivalence jointly with these strong maintained
hypotheses.
        It is particularly interesting to note that most studies employing
highly restrictive models of interest rate determination find a

significant      negative relationship between     deficits    and interest rates.
One explanation       is that,   by introducing uncertainty, deficits crowd—in

investment.       For reasons mentioned in section 2, I regard this theory as
far—fetched. This leaves two         possibilities.    First, reductions in
marginal   capital income tax       rates   nay stimulate saving in the short
run. While this explanation may account for historical experience, it
renders    the evidence uniformative for policy purposes——deficits
                                            —53—




 resulting from cuts in labor income taxes or inframarginal capital
 income taxes might well significantly stimulate current consumption.
 Second,   restrictive interest rate models        may simply yield spurious
 result../ In either case, the evidence is of little relevance.

       Second, no study provides a fully satisfactory treatment of

information and expectations. Feldstein [1986b] has           emphasized   that
that   interest    rates   are   probably much more responsive to expected

deficits, than to either current deficits or outstanding debt. Yet it

is not at all clear that         current   deficits, or innovations in current

deficits,   are more highly correlated with future deficits than are other
measures    of                           fiscal policy. Likewise,
                 current economic activity or

current deficits may be highly correlated with the future values of
other variables. Suppose, for example, that current deficits are
generally followed by budget—balancing cuts in government spending.
Since temporary spending tends to          raise interest rates (see e.g. Barro
[1986]),   current deficits might then be inversely correlated with long

term rates2i

       Several    authors have     made some effort to cope with these

difficulties. Feldstein [1986b] and Plosser [1986] both include

measures of expected future budget deficits in various interest rate

specifications. The measurement of these expectations is, of course,

problematic, and undoubtably subject to serious error (see section

4.1). In addition, these authors fail to include measures of

expectations about other variables, including government spending,

output, and prices; the preceding remarks suggest that         omitted   and
                                    —54-.




included   variables may be highly correlated.

        Evans [1987] adopts a much different approach. He begins by

specifying a reduced form equation for current interest rates as a

function of lagged rates, current and lagged values of various other

variables (including policy instruments), and expected future values of

these other variables. His central assumption is that the coefficients

on all deficit variables (including expectations) should be positive.

He justifies this with reference to standard theory. He then supplements

this equation with a model of the term structure and a stochastic VAR

process describing the evolution of the other variables. Combining

these equations, he shows that a standard VAR should satisfy the

restriction that the deficit coefficients sum to a positive number. He

finds that this restriction is inconsistent with the data.

        Unfortunately, Evans' derivation employs some unusually strong and

objectionable maintained hypotheses..V More fundamentally, i question

the validity of his central assumption. Evan's original reduced form

equation omits expected future interest rates. To the extent future

rates   affect current behavior, Evanst basic equation represents a quasi—
reduced form, from which expected interest rates 1ive already been
eliminated. This dramatically alters the interpretation of all
coefficients. Suppose, for example, that some current (period       t)

policy variable raises future (period t +     i)   interest rates. Then

individuals will typically tend to reduce consumption in the relative

short run (periods t and t +      1),   in order to save more for the long

run. Current saving (period t) will therefore rise. To bring current
                                         —55—




saving and investment back      into   balance, current interest rates

(period t) must then fall. Evans has simply neglected such

intertempora 1   feedbacks.
        I   now turn to some problems that      are   specific to the analysis of
interest rates. These problems have a common root, which is that
interest    rate equations have no direct behavioral interpretation.
Rather, they are quasi—reduced forms, reflecting            the interplay of forces

which   alter the supply and demand for funds. Interest rate effects
depend upon the kind of behavioral relationships            discuss in section 4.2——

these are simply     behind the scenes, shrouded by another layer of
economic noise (such as term structure relations, and international
capital flows). As a result, when studies of behavior and interest
rates   conflict, I am   inclined to    be very    skeptical about the conclusions
of   the latter. Along these lines, three specific points merit

discussion.

        First, reduced form relationships may be highly unstable, and

unreliable as policy guides (Lucas [1976]). Ample evidence indicates

that this is the case in the current context..J

        Second, it is virtually impossible to assess the power of tests

based   upon interest rate equations. When estimating consumption
functions, one has     both   a pure   Ricardian   and pure Keynesian benchmark.
But in the case of interest rate equations, we have            only   a Ricardian
benchmark: deficits do not alter interest rates. Since                the   empirical
model is intended to represent a reduced form rather than a behavioral
relationship, one cannot, in the absence of extensive information about
                                         —56—




various elasticities, construct a natural Keynesian benchmark. Indeed,

given the small magnitude of plausible wealth effects and the tendency

for interest rates       to   equalize across countries, there is little reason

to believe that deficits should significantly raise interest rates in

the short run.

        These observations lead me to conclude that interest rate studies

are intrinsically uninformative as tests of the Ricardian hypothesis./

What can we deduce from the coefficient of deficits in an empirical

relationship explaining interest rates? If it is significantly positive

(as in Feldstein [1986bJ), one might conclude that consumers perceive

some fraction of government bonds to be net wealth, but one cannot

estimate this fraction. If the coefficient is not significantly

different from zero (as in Dwyer [1982}! or most of Evans [1986a]

estimates), one cannot reject Ricardian equivalence, but one also cannot

determine whether the estimates are inconsistent with any other

conceivable hypothesis of interest. If the coefficient is significantly

negative, one has probably learned nothing at all (see above).

        Third, estimated models of interest rate determination are

extremely parsimonious. It is difficult to believe that the lion's

share   of   movements   in   interest rates   are   driven by perhaps three to five

explanatory     variables. This raises the        possibility that the included

variables     simply proxy for a     variety of      omitted factors. In   most

studies, omissions of this sort undoubtably bias the coefficients of
interest..i
                                    —57—



      Not all of the evidence on interest rates is based upon

econometric estimation. Barro [1986] has argued that two episodes in

British history, during which the government ran deficits for apparently

exogenous reasons, provide natural experiments by which to judge the

Ricardian hypothesis.

      The first episode occurred during the 1830's. Following the

emancipation of slaves in the West Indies, the British government made

large compensatory payments to slaveholders, and financed these payments

primarily with borrowing. Barro points out that interest rates did not

rise during this period. Yet it is not at all clear that this finding

is contrary to the Keynesian view. Temporary deficits were not

associated with tax cuts, so the consumption of a myopic British tax-

payer would have been unaffected by this policy. Supposing that West

Indies slave owners were fully compensated, they too would have

maintained previous levels of    consumption.     In fact, if   all   assets were

perfect   substitutes, slaveowners would have been willing to purchase the
newly issued bonds with the compensatory payments received from the
government. Finally, the slaves themselves were wealthier after the
adoption of the policy, in the    sense   that   they   become owners of humam

capital. However, there is no reason to believe that their level of

consumption significantly increased following emancipation (see Fogel

and Engerman's [1974] analysis of slavery in the u.s.), and even if it

did, it is not obvious that the emancipated slaves would have spent a

large fraction of the increase on British goods. In short, if taxpayers

were myopic, then the only short run effect of this policy was to
                                   —58—




relabel certain   investment activities (spending on slaves' food,

clothing, housing) as consumption activities.

      The second episode occurred in 1909, when a political deadlock

lead to a one year lapse in the government's authority to collect

certain revenues. This created a deficit equal to 1.5% of trend GNP,

most of which was paid off in the following year. Barro finds no

evidence of abnormally high interest rates over the relevant period.

Yet this is hardly surprising, for two reasons. First, it was evidently

well understood that the revenue shortfall was extremely temporary in

nature. Certainly, no taxpayer could have anticipated significant

intergenerational transfers. Most economists would concede the

plausibility of approximate Ricardian equivalence under such extremely

special circumstances. Second, it is not at all clear that    the    effects

of this policy should have been detectable. Supposing that 20% of the

population was liquidity constrained, one would have expected aggregate

consumption in 1909 to have risen by 0.3% of GNP. Given reasonable

levels of aggregate noise, it would be difficult to distinguish between

the presence or absence of this effect using data on consumption, let

alone from interest rates.


      4.3.2. Other variables

      A small number of studies have examined the link between deficits

and exchange rates (Hooper [1985], Hutchinson and Throop [1985], Evans

[1986d], Feldstein [1986c]). Conventional reasoning holds that, by

raising domestic interest rates, deficits lead to inflows of foreign

capital. International account belance requires offsetting inflows of
                                    —59—




goods.    Accordingly, the value of the domestic currency must rise in

order to stimulate imports and discourage exports.

         Empirical evidence on this point is mixed, with Feldstein and

Evans bracketting the available estimates. This is hardly surprising:

since    the link between interest rates and exchange rates has nothing to
do with Ricardian equivalence, analysis of exchange rates merely adds a
layer of noise to the interest rate relationship. Accordingly, when
Feldstein    uses the same methodology as in his interest rate study, he

reaches the same conclusions (similarly for Evans). If anything,

estimation of exchange rate relationships is more problemmatic, in that

one must work with relatively little data (the U.S. floated the dollar

in 1973), and worry about a larger number of explanatory variables

(those describing the economic environment of each trading partner).

         Papers by Dwyer [1982], King and Plosser [1985], and Protopapadakis

and Siegel [1984] study the relationship between deficits and inflation.

According to standard theory, deficits should accelerate inflation by

stimulating aggregate demand. Prior to the 1980's, there was indeed a

high correlation between deficits and inflation in the U.S. However,

this correlation was largely spurious, since constant real deficits

imply higher nominal deficits during inflationary periods (see Dwyer).

While studies tend to find little or no effect of real deficits on

 inflation, most of the criticisms raised in the context of interest

 rates are applicable.

         Finally, Evans [1985] and Barth, Iden, and Russek [1984—85]

 estimate money demand equations. Evans focuses on World War II, during
                                      -60—




which Treasury bill rates were pegged, and finds no evidence to support
the   traditional view; Barth Iden, and Russek modify a money demand
equation originally estimated by Hafer and Hem [1984] by including a
measure of deficits, and find that     government  borrowing significantly
stimulates      money demand. In addition to   most of the problems discussed
above,    these studies may also confound supply and demand effects.

Furthermore, since the real stock of money depends upon the price level,

estimates also reflect the link between deficits and inflation.


         4.4.   Snry
         While attempts to measure the effects of deficits directly may

well face insuperable difficulties, they do supply one more piece of the

overall picture. A succession of studies have established the existence

of a robust short run relationship between deficits and aggregate

consumption. While there are many potential explanations for this

pattern,   it is at very least consistent with the traditional Keynesian
view.     Results for interest rates are mixed, and considerably more
difficult to interpret. Thus, while time series evidence weighs against
Ricardian equivalence, it does not by itself tip the scales. However,
in    the context of theoretical reasoning and behavioral analyses, a
coherent picture emerges in which the Ricardian outcome appears
relatively unlikely.
      Recent experience confirms this evaluation: during the 80's,
deficits and interest rates rose dramatically, while savings rates
plumetted (see Poterba and Summers [1986] or Feldstein [1986b] for
discussions). This period was relatively unique in U.S.        history,   in
                                        —61—




that large     deficits resulted from declines in net revenue, rather than

temporary      increases in government spending, so that    it presents us with
a fairly clean experiment. This interpretation of the 80's is, of

course,    controversial, and formal statistical analyses have produced
conflicting     results (compare Evans [1985, 1986b] with Feldstein

{   1986b]).   One key issue in this controversy concerns timing: when

exactly    did taxpayers begin to anticipate large deficits? I        tend to

believe    that changes in expectations were approximately coincident with
movements in interest rates and savings (indeed, more recently real
interest rates and deficit projections have fallen together, although
the    direction of causality is perhaps not clear). Since this issue is

extremely difficult to resolve, we are likely to learn more from longer

term movements in deficits, than from very short term movements. I am

therefore particularly struck by the comparison of the 80's with earlier

periods. There is no question whatsoever that expected deficits,

interest rates, and consumption have all on average been significantly

higher    since 1982 than   in, for example, the 70's. While this is

conceivably     attributable to spurious factors    (see subsection 4.2), the

comparison      is highly suggestive.


5.       Direct Evidence:    International Comparisons

         As an alternative to   analyzing time   series   data for individual
countries, one could also measure the effects of government borrowing
through international comparisons. This approach offers certain natural
advantages.       First, there is much more independent movement of deficits
                                     —62—




arid government   spending across countries, than there is within

countries. Second, by averaging over substantial periods of time, one

can hope to measure the more permanent components of each variable, and

thereby minimize problems arising from the informational and

expectational issues discussed in section 4.1. In addition, results

based on multiperiod averages may provide some clue as to the long run

effects of sustained deficits. Finally, if one is willing to forego

multi—year averages and pool time—series cross—section data, one can

greatly expand the number of available observations.

       On the other hand, cross—country comparisons hardly provide a

panacea. Many of the issues described in section 4     apply   equally well

to   international data. In addition, several problems become much more
serious. First, the relevant variables may     be measured differently (or

mismeasured   differently) in   different countries.Z/ Second, countries

differ structurally in terms of institutions, and the population of each

country may behave somewhat idiosynchratically. Third, deficits may

move for reasons unrelated to the Ricardian hypothesis (e.g. shocks to

oil prices)...! Finally, practical considerations may seriously limit the

number of observations available for analysis.

        It is difficult to weigh the relative importance of these

advantages and disadvantages a priori. Evidence from cross—country

comparisons is therefore neither definitive nor irrelevant——it simply

adds one more piece to the overall picture.

        5.1. SocIal   Security

        To date, relatively few studies have used data from international

cross—sections to address issues raised in the Ricardian debate. Almost

all of the existing work, including papers by Feldstein [1977, 1980],

Barro and MacDonald [1979], Kopitz and Gotur [1979], and Modigliani and

Sterling [1983], analyzes the effect of social security on private

saving or consumption. Generally, these studies describe regressions of

saving or expenditure on age distribution variables, retirement

variables, income growth, and a measure of social security benefits or

entitlements

         In attempting to reconcile the mixed findings that emerge from

these studies, Modigliani and Sterling point out that social security

has an indirect effect on saving through its impact on retirement.

Furthermore, this works to offset the direct effect.      Since Feldstein

and    Modigliafli--Sterling control for retirement, they tend to   find a

       relationship between social security and spending, while Barro—
positive
MacDonald and Kopitz—Gotur, who fail to control for retirement, find
 little    no relationship. Under this view, social security has little
          or

 effect on aggregate capital accumulation, but for reasons entirely
 unrelated     to Ricardian equivalence. However, this explanation provides
 only   a partial reconciliation of the existing results,   in that neither

 Barro—MacDoflald'S nor Modigliani—Sterlifl&s findings are robust.
                                                                   Given

 the    difficulty of measuring social security wealth, particularly in a

 way that is comparable across countries, and given the degree of

 uncertainty involved in selecting a specification that adequately allows
                                    —64—




for various socio—economic and demographic differences between
countries, sensitivity to variable definitions and changes in functional
specification is   extremely disturbing. The evidence simply does not

justify any strong inferences.


      5.2. Deficits

      In   this section, I present new evidence on the relationship
between government borrowing and private consumption. The novel aspect
of my analysis is that it is   based upon international comparisons,
rather   than aggregate time series. Work in progress by Modigliani,

Mason, and Sterling [1986] also tests the Ricardian hypothesis with

cross—country data. Their preliminary results, based upon an

alternative specification and substantially different sample,

corroborate my findings.

         The specifications estimated below are based upon equation (2),

which I modify in the following ways. First, I drop the intercept term

(i.e. assume that utility is homethetic), and divide both sides of the

equation by Y to adjust for heteroskedasticity. This obviates the

need to convert quantities to per capita figures, or to a common

currency through exchange rates. Second, due to the lack of data, I

omit W from the equation entirelyi9! Third, I add measures of real

income growth (YG) and population growth (PG). These variables may

capture at least some of the socio—economic factors that create

international variation in propensities to consume. My final empirical

specification is therefore:
                                      —65—




(3)         dY =     +           + 3G/Y   +     +        + 7PG   +


(where DEF is the deficit).
        I estimate equation (3) using data obtained from the IMF's

International Financial Statistics. I measure the       variable     Y as gross

domestic product, C as private consumption expenditure, D as total

outstanding   government debt41i and G as current government consumption,

which is calculated in the manner prescribed by the United Nation's

system   of Standard National Accounts4/ I use two different measures         of

DEF.  One is the current net deficit (surplus) of the consolidated
central government. For the other measure, I adjust the current deficit
for    inflationary erosion of the real value of outstanding government

debt. I label this second measure ADEF. I measure YG as the log of the

ratio of current to lagged real GDP; similarly, PG is the log of the

ratio    of current to lagged population.
         Data quality is a   severe problem. Many   of the governmental
variables for International Financial Statistics are evidently
constructed internally by the IMF, and are considered highly
unreliable.     Accordingly, one should think of this exercise as a

suggestive exploration. However, one should also bear in mind that

errors in measuring of the fiscal variables should bias my findings in

favor of the Ricardian hypothesis.

         For many countries, one or more critical variables are      simply
unavailable. In other cases, data are missing in particular years. The

most    troublesome variable is outstanding government debt; the
availability of this variable largely dictates sample selection. I
                                            —66—




found that by    focusing on the twelve year period from 1972 to 1983, I
could assemble a relatively          complete data set        based on a reasonably
large   sample of countries.         The sizes of the       sample used   below   depend

upon whether or not I insist on including              D   in the empirical specifi-

cation. While the total sample consists of 39                  countries4/    only 26 have

adequate     information on   government debt.

         an effort to identify robust empirical relationships, I have
        In

analyzed these data in a number of different ways. The first approach
is to take twelve year averages for each country, and run simple cross—

sectional     regressions. The primary advantage of this approach is that
it   allows me to relate      long   run   levels   of the explanatory variables to
long run     private   consumption. Transitory movements,            which may carry

spurious     information or alter expectations in unknown ways, become

significantly     less important. As mentioned above, data on certain
countries is not quite complete. In such               cases, I base averages       on the

years   for which all relevant variables are available. This may

introduce a small amount of heteroskedasticity.

        Table 2 contains the results of simple cross—sectional

regressions. Equation 2.1 corresponds to the basic empirical

specification,     where DEF (unadjusted)           is used   as a measure of government
deficits.      Note that the coefficient of deficits is extremely large, and

in fact exceeds the marginal propensity to consume. Although this

coefficient is not estimated very precisely, it does differ from zero at

the 10% level of confidence. Note also that the coefficient of debt is

negative. However, all interesting hypotheses essentially lie within

one standard deviation of the point estimate. The marginal propensity
to consume from income is both reasonable (0.8) and precisely

estimated. The estimates also suggest that government spending is a

substitute for private consumption, in that a one dollar increase in

tax—financed spending causes consumption to fall by $1.28. The

coefficients of both YG and PG are insignificant.

      The large standard error on the coefficient of debt suggests that

the data may not be able to distinguish between interesting hypotheses

on the basis of wealth effects. I therefore reestimate the basic

specification, omitting D (note that this does not bias the remaining

coefficients under the Ricardian view). This allows me to use the full

sample of 39   countries.   Results are given in equation 2.2. There are

two noteworthy changes. First, the deficit coefficient is essentially

the same as the marginal propensity to consume from income. In

addition, it is estimated much more precisely, and differs from zero at

extremely high levels of confidence. Second, the coefficient of G moves

towards the marginal propensity to consume, so that one cannot rule out

the possibility that utility is separable in public and private

consumption.

      Equations 2.3 and 2.4 provide similar estimates based upon

inflation—adjusted deficits (ADEF). Estimates of the basic specifi-

cation look essentially unchanged, except that the coefficient of D now

has the expected sign (it is still insignificant). The omission of D

raises the coefficient of ADEF, as well its precision. While the

estimated coefficient is unreasonably large, sensible values lie within

two   standard deviations of the point estimate.
        Results based upon simple cross—sectional estimates are clearly
suspect. A parsimonious regression cannot possibly capture the richness
of socio—economic factors that create variation in saving rates across
countries. Unobserved factors that are correlated with private
extravagence   (high levels of consumption) may also be associated with

public extravagence (large deficits); this nay in part explain the very

large deficit coefficients in Table 2. Differences in accounting

practices nay also nake international comparisons of deficit levels

problematic.                                -




        To address these considerations, I divide the 12 year sample into

two distinct six year subperiods (1972 to 1977 and 1978 to 1983), and

analyze the relationship between changes in consumption and changes in

deficits. Since this amounts to allowing for country—specific

differences in the propensity to consume out of income (i.e. fixed

effects), it should minimize biases arising from unobserved socio-

economic differences. In addition, fixed effects estimation eliminates

many problems arising from systematic differences between accounting

techniques,    since results depend upon changes in variables, rather than
their   absolute levels.

        To implement this second approach, it is necessary to apply a

somewhat more demanding sample selection criterion, in that one needs

enough data to calculate a reliable average for each six year

subperiod. Accordingly, I was forced to drop three countries. All of

the remaining estimates are based upon a sample of 23 countries.

        It    is possible to get a feel for general patterns by looking at

the data in a relatively unprocessed form. I refer the reader to Table

3.    For   each country, I list the change   in   private consumption, the

change in deficits, and the change in adjusted deficits between the two

six year subperiods. All values are expressed relative to concurrent

GDP. My discussion of this table will focus on adjusted deficits, but

similar conclusions follow for the unadjusted deficit variable.

        Note first that for roughly two—thirds of the sample (15 of 23

countries), deficits and consumption moved in the same direction between

the two six year subperiods. This correlation is stronger in cases

where the change in deficits was large. 16 countries experienced a

change in excess of 1% of GNP; in 11 cases, deficits and consumption

moved in the same direction. Confining attention to cases in which the

change in consumption was also large (greater than 1% of GDP), we see

that    deficits   and consumption moved together in 9    of   11 cases. If we

focus   on countries experiencing a change in average deficits exceeding
2% of GDP, the comparable numbers are 9 of 13, and 7 of 9 countries,
respectively.       By restricting attention to those countries experiencing

very large changes (more than 3% of GDP), we find that consumption and

deficits moved together in 6 of 7 cases. Finally, deficits and

consumption moved in the same direction for every country (4          of   4)


experiencing       both a very large change in deficits (greater than 3%) and

a significant change in consumption (greater than 1%). Note that while

the    U.S.   experience is consistent with this pattern, it is by no means

egregious. In fact, given my choice of subperiods, the change in U.S.

deficits was not even particularly large.

      While the relationship between deficits and consumption is

apparent   in the raw   data, one cannot measure it by inspection of the

numbers,   nor be certain that   it   does not reflect spurious correlations.
Accordingly, I regress the change in private consumption on the changes
in each    of the dependent variables. Table 4 contains results.

Equations 4.1 to 4.4 correspond       exactly to 2.1 to 2.4. Several patterns
emerge.    First, the deficit coefficients are much     smaller, generally
indicating    that a $1 deficit—for—taxes swap would raise consumption by

$0.30 to $0.50. This confirms the view that unobserved factors are

correlated with public and private extravagence, and that this biases

simple cross—sectional regressions. However, the estimated effect is

still quite sizable. Unfortunately, the coefficients are not

statistically significant at conventional levels when debt is included

in the specification. While the coefficient of debt is now positive

regardless of whether uses adjusted or unadjusted deficits, it is still

not significantly different from zero. Exclusion of the debt variable

causes    the deficit coefficient to become significant at high levels of

confidence. Note also that the coefficients of government consumption

are now consistent with the view that utility is separable, or perhaps

even exhibits some complementarity between government and private

consumption.

         As a next step, I modified equations 4.1 through 4.4 by moving

consumption in the first subperiod (lagged consumption, LC) from the

left to the right hand sides (i.e., I regressed consumption on changes

in the explanatory variables, and lagged consumption). I interpret the

resulting specifications as Euler equations. While changes in

explanatory variables between consecutive years certainly do not reflect

innovations, it is more reasonable to expect that changes in six year

avenges might approximate innovations to long—run levels. The

regression results are quite encouraging. The size of the deficit

coefficient increases in all specifications, and is generally

statistically significant at high levels of confidence. In addition,

when I use adjusted deficits, the t—statistic for debt rises to 1.5,

which is marginally significant. It is also noteworthy that a

regression of current consumption on lagged consumption and all lagged

explanatory   variables suggested that the        stochastic permanent income

hypothesis'   orthogonality    condition is satisfied——the F—statistic for

the hypothesis that all coefficients for lagged explanatory variables

equal zero was 1.0.

       By avenging over six year subperiods, one can examine the

relationships between movements in different variables without

sacrificing the advantages of using "long run" measures. As a final

step, I also estimated regressions based on pooled, single year, time

series cross—section data. Results are presented in Table 5. I will

begin with equation 5.1 through 5.4, which do not contain country

specific intercepts. While these estimates bear a strong resemblance to

those obtained    from 12 year averages, there are also some important
differences. The coefficients of deficits are large, but unlike those
in   Table 2, not "too" large. In fact, the marginal propensities to

consume from deficits and income are         almost   indestinguishable in three

of four    cases.    Standard   errors   in Table 5 are also much lower, owing to

the relative size of the data sample. As before, government spending

appears to be substitutable for private consumption. The debt

coefficient is positive in both 5.1 and 5.3; note           that it   is


statistically       significant and   of a reasonable magnitude in 5.3.

        The inclusion of country specific intercepts somewhat alters this
picture.      Not surprisingly, these estimates bear a strong resemblance to

those   based on changes between six year subperiods. Deficits now appear
to stimulate consumption by about $0.40 On the dollar, rather than
$0.70. Once again, this effect is estimated very presicely.                The

coefficient     of government spending now suggests significant complemen—
tarity with private consumption. Finally, the debt coefficient is
positive in both 5.5 and 5.7; it is statistically significant and of a
reasonable magnitude in 5.7.
        Two   remarks are in order. First, these results are very strongly
pro—Keynesian and anti—Ricardian. Equation 5.7 is, in some sense, the
preferred specification, in that it          includes   country—specific
intercepts, employs a superior measure of deficits, and retains the debt
variable. This equation suggests that a $1 deficit—for—taxes swap will
increase consumption by about $0.57, and that $1 of debt raises
consumption     by $0.06. Both effects are estimated quite precisely.

Second,    the robustness of these results across specifications and
estimation techniques is striking. It is particularly interesting to
note the similarity of results based upon yearly data, and multi—year
                                        —73—




averages.    This suggests that one does not significantly contaminate the

estimates with transitory effects by making use of yearly variation.

However, one does obtain an enormous increase in the precision of the

estimates.

       One additional puzzle merits some discussion. Throughout this

analysis, I have with few exceptions estimated the coefficient of income

growth to be negative, whereas standard life cycle theory suggests that

it should be positive. While the effect is not generally significant,

it   requires   some explanation. It is possible that    this   pattern reflects

confusion    of cause and effect: extravagent countries may sacrifice
growth for current consumption.
       My findings are generally consistent with those of Modigliani,
Mason, and Sterling [1986]. This is particularly striking in light of
the fact that      these   authors use a different sample and empirical

specification. Although they also employ data from the IMF's

International Financial Statistics, they focus on the period from 1960

to 1980, and use a somewhat different set of countries. Since data on

outstanding debt has only recently become available for many countries,

they   lack a direct measure of debt, and their attempts to construct a
substitute measure are generally unsuccessful. However, by sacrificing
the debt variable, they are able to make use of a much large sample.
        Overall,   analysis of cross—country data supports the view that

government deficits stimulate private consumption. The robustness of

this conclusion with respect to alternative specifications, estimation

techniques, and samples is quite striking.
