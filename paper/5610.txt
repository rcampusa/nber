       This paper reviews the behavior of stock prices in relation to consumption.   The paper

lists some   important stylized facts that characterize   US data, and relates them to recent

developments in equilibrium asset pricing theory. Data from other countries are examined to see

which features of the US experience apply more generally.   The paper argues that to make sense

of stock market behavior one needs a model in which investors’ risk aversion is both high and

varying, such as the external habit-formation model of Campbell and Cochrane (1995).

    The behavior of aggregate stock prices is a subject of enduring fascination         to investors,

policymakers,    and economists.     In recent years stock markets have continued to show some fa-

miliar pat terns, including high average returns and volatile and procyclical      price movements.

Economists     have struggled to understand these patterns.       If stock prices are determined by

fundamentals,     then what exactly     are these fundamentals    and what is the mechanism        by

which they move prices?

   Researchers, working primarily with US data, have documented           a host of interesting styl-

imd facts about the stock market and its relation to short-term interest rates and aggregate

consumption.


  1. The average real return on stock is high. In quarterly US data over the period 1947.2

     to 1993.4, for example, the average real stock return has been 7.’2%at an annual rate.

     (Here and throughout the paper, the word return is used to mean a log or continuously

     compounded      ret urn. )


  2. The average riskless real interest rate is low. 3-month Treasury bills deliver a return

     that is riskless in nominal terms and close to riskless in real terms because there is only

     modest uncertainty about inflation at a 3-month horizon.         In the postwar quarterly US

     data, the average real return on 3-month Treasury bills has been 0.770per year.


  3. Real stock returns are volatile, with an annualized standard deviation of 15.8% in the

     US data.


  4. The real interest rate is much less volatile.     The annualized standard deviation of the

     real return on US Treasury bills is 1.8Y0, and most of this is due to short-run inflation

     risk. The volatility of a measure of the ex ante real interest rate is likely to be lower

     than 1.8%.


  5. Real consumption       growth is very smooth.     The annualized standard deviation      of the

     grwth      rate of seasonally    adjusted real consumption    of nondurable    and services is

     1.1% in the US data.


                                                  1
  6. Real dividend growth is extremely volatile at short horizons because dividend data are

     not adjusted   to remove seasonalit y in dividend payments.     The annualized quarterly

     standard deviation of real dividend growth is 29.070 in the US data. At longer horizons,

     however, the volatility of dividend growth is intermediate between the volatility of stock

     returns and the volatility of consumption    growth. At an annual frequency, for example,

     the volatility of real dividend growth is 7.3% in the US data.


 7. Quarterly   real consumption     growth and real dividend growth have a very weak cor-

    relation of 0.05 in the US data, but the correlation      increases at lower frequencies      to

    slightly exceed 0.20 at horizons from 2 to 4 years.


 8. Real consumption     growth and real stock returns have a quarterly correlation      of 0.21

    in the US data, The correlation increases to 0.34 at a l-year horizon, and declines at

    longer horizons.


 9. Quarterly real dividend growth and real stock returns have a very weak correlation           of

    0.04 in the US data, but the correlation increases steadily with the horizon.      It is 0.14

    at a l-year horizon, 0.28 at a 2-year horizon, and 0.53 at a 4-year horizon.


10. Real US consumption      growth is not well forecast by its own history or by the stock

    market. The first-order autocorrelation    of the quarterly growth rate of real nondurable

    and services consumption       is a modest 0.2, and the log price-dividend   ratio forecasts

    less than 107o of the variation of real consumption    growth at horizons of 1 to 4 years.


11. Real US dividend growth has some short-run foreca.stability arising from the seasonality

    of dividend payments.    But it is not well forecast by the stock market. The log price-

    dividend ratio forecasts no more than about 9% of the variation of real dividend growth

    at horizons of 1 to 4 years.


12. The real interest rate hm some positive serial correlation; its first-order autocorrelation

    in postwar quarterly US data is 0.5. However the real interest rate is not well forecast
          by the stock market, since the log price-dividend         ratio forecasts no more than 1% of

          the variation of the real interest rate at horizons of 1 to 4 years.


  13. Excess returns on US stock over Treasury bills are highly forecastable.             The log price-

          dividend ratio forec~sts 2070 of the variance of the excess return at a l-year horizon,

          almost 4070 at a 2-year horizon, and 5570 at a 4-year horizon.


    These facts raise two important questions for students of macroeconomics              and finance.


    ●   Why     is the average     stock   return     so high    in relation   to the average      return

        on short    debt?


    ●   Why     are stock    returns   so volatile?


    Mehra and Prescott (1985) call the first question the “equity premium puzzle”.2             Finance

theory explains the expected       excess return on any risky asset over the riskless interest rate

as the quantity of risk times the price of risk. In a standard consumption-based           asset pricing

model of the type studied by Hansen and Singleton (1983), the quantity of stock market risk

is me=ured      by the covariance of the excess stock return with consumption            growth, while

the price of risk is the coefficient of relative risk aversion of a representative       investor.    The

high average stock return and low riskless interest rate (stylized facts 1 and 2) imply that

the expected     excess return on stock, the equity premium, is high.           But the smoothness      of

consumption      (stylized fact 5) makes the covariance of stock returns with consumption             low;

hence the equity premium can only be explained by a very high coefficient of risk aversion.

   Some authors, such as Kandel and Stambaugh               (1991), have argued that risk aversion is

indeed much higher than traditionally         tbought.    However this can lead to the “riskfree rate

puzzle”    of Weil (1989).    If investors are very risk averse, then they have a strong desire to

transfer wealth from periods with high consumption              to periods with low consumption.     Since

consumption      has tended to grow steadily over time, high risk aversion makes investors want

  ‘For excellent recent surveys, see Cochrane and Hansen (1992) or Kocherlakota (1996).    Cochrane and
Hansen discuss the puzzle using the methodology of Hansen and Jagannathan (1992).


                                                      3
 to borrow to reduce the discrepancy between future consumption           and present consumption.

 To reconcile this with the low real interest rate we observe, we must postulate that investors

are extremely patient; their preferences give future consumption          almost as much weight as

current consumption,     or even greater weight than current consumption.        In other words they

have a low or even negative rate of time preference.

      I will call the second question the “stock market volatility puzzle”,       To understand    the

puzzle, it is helpful to cl~sify    the possible sources of stock market volatility. Recall first that

prices, dividends, and returns are not independent        but are linked by an accounting    identity.

If an asset’s price is high today, then either its dividend must be high tomorrow, or its return

must be low between today and tomorrow,            or its price must be even higher tomorrow.       If

one excludes the possibility       that an asset price can grow explosively    forever in a “rational

bubble”,    then it follows that an asset with a high price today must have some combination        of

high dividends over the indefinite future and low returns over the indefinite future. Investors

must recognize this fact in forming their expectations,      so when an asset price is high investors

expect some combination       of high future dividends     and low future returns.    Movements     in

prices must then be associated with some combination            of changing expectations    ( “news”)

about future dividends     and changing expectations       about future returns; the latter can in

turn be broken into news about future riskless real interest rates and news about future

excess returns on stocks over short-term       debt.

      Until the early 1980’s, most financial economists     believed that there was very little pre-

dictable variation in stock returns and that dividend news was by far the most important

factor driving stock market fluctuations.       LeRoy and Porter (1981) and Shiner (1981) chal-

lenged this orthodoxy    by pointing out that plausible measures of expected future dividends

are far less volatile than real stock prices.     Their work is related to stylized facts 6, 9, and

11.

      Later in the 1980’s Campbell      and Shiner (1988a,b),   Fama and French (1988a,b,      1989),

Poterba    and Summers     (1988) and others showed that real stock returns are highly fore-

cast able at long horizons.    Even more striking, excess returns on stock over Treasury bills



                                                    4
are just as forecastable      as real returns on stock. This work is related to stylized facts 12 and

13. Campbell       (1991) and Campbell      and Ammer (1993) use this evidence to show that the

great bulk of stock market volatility is associated with changing forecasts of excess stock re-

turns. Changing forecasts of dividend growth and real interest rates are much less important

empirically.

    The stock market volatility puzzle is closely related to the equity premium puzzle.                    A

complete model of stock market behavior must explain both the average level of stock prices

and their movements        over time.   One strand of work on the equity premium puzzle makes

this explicit by studying not the consumption         covariance of measured stock returns, but the

consumption       covariance of returns on hypothetical        assets whose dividends    equal consump-

tion. The same model is used to generate both the volatility of stock prices and the implied

equity premium.      This was the approach of Mehra and Prescott (1985), and many subsequent

authors have followed their lead.

    Unfortunately,     it is not easy to construct       a model that fits all the stylized facts given

above. Even if one follows the literature in equating consumption            and dividends, it is hard to

produce sufficient variation in stock prices without excessive variation in expected consump-

tion (dividend)     growth and in riskless real interest rates.         The standard    model of Hansen

and Singleton (1983) and Mehra and Prescott (1985), with a constant variance for consump-

tion (dividend)     growth,   gets variation in stock prices relative to consumption         (dividends)

only from predictable      variation in consumption       (dividend)   growth which creates predictable

variation in the riskless real interest rate. In this model there is no predictable          variation in

excess stock returns.

   Since the data suggest that predictable variation in excess returns is an important            source

of stock market volatility, researchers have begun to develop models in which the quantity of

stock market risk or the price of risk change through time. ARCH models and other econo-

met ric methods show that the conditional        variance of stock returns is highly variable.       If this

conditional    variance is an adequate proxy for the quantity of stock market risk, then perhaps

it can explain the predictability       of excms stock returns.        1 here are several problems    with



                                                     5
 this approach.    First, changes in conditional       variance are most dramatic in daily or monthly

 data and are much weaker at lower frequencies.               There is some business-cycle       variation in

 volatility, but it does not seem strong enough to explain large movements              in aggregate   stock

 prices (Bollerslev,   Chou, and Kroner 1992, Schwert 1989). Second, forecasts of excess stock

 returns do not move proportionally             with estimates of conditional      variance (Harvey    1989,

 1991, Chou, Engle, and Kane 1992), Finally, one would like to derive stock market volatility

endogenously      within a model rather than treating it as an exogenous variable. There is little

evidence of cyclical variation in consumption              or dividend   volatility that could explain the

variation in stock market volatility.

    A more promising         possibility   is that the price of risk varies over time.      Campbell    and

Cochrane    (1 995), building on the work of Abel ( 1990), Constantinides              (1990),   and others,

have recently     proposed     a simple asset pricing model with this property.             Campbell    and

Cochrane suggest that assets are priced as if there were a representative agent who consumes

aggregate consumption;         but in a departure from the standard model, the agent’s utility is

a power function of the difference between consumption              and “habit”,    where habit is a slow-

moving nonlinear average of past aggregate consumption.                  This utility function   makes the

agent more risk-averse in bad times, when consumption is low relative to its past history, than

in good times, when consumption            is high relative to its past history. Stock market volatility is

explained by a small amount of underlying consumption              (dividend)   risk, amplified by variable

risk aversion; the equity premium is explained by high stock market volatility, together with

a high average level of risk aversion.

   This paper has two objectives.           First, it tries to summarize recent work on stock price be-

havior, much of which is highly technical, in a way that is accessible to a broader professional

audience.   Second,    the paper summarizes the behavior of stock markets in other countries

and asks which of the US stylized facts hold true more generally.                  The recent theoretical

literature is used to guide the exploration         of the international data.

   The organization      of the paper is as follows.        Section 1 introduces the international     data

and reviews stylized facts 1-9 to see which of them apply outside the United States. (Addi-



                                                       6
tional details are given in a Data Appendix    available from the aut her. ) Section 2 discusses

the equity premium puzzle, taking the volatility of stock returns as given.       Section 3 dis-

cusses the stock market volatility puzzle. This sect ion also reviews stylized facts 10-13 in the

international data. Section 4 presents the Campbell and Cochrane (1995) model of changing

risk aversion and explores its relevance for the international data. Section 5 concludes.
 1      International            Stock Market               Data

 The stylized facts described in the previous section apply to postwar quarterly US data. Most

empirical work on stock prices uses this data set, or a longer annual US time series originally

put together by Shiner (1981).       But data on stock prices, interest rates, and consumption

are also available for many other count ries.

     To construct an international    quarterly data set, I use Morgan Stanley Capital Interna-

tional (MSCI) stock market data covering the period since 1970. I combine the MSCI data

with macroeconomic      data on consumption,    interest rates, and the price level from the Inter-

national Financial Statistics (IFS) of the International      Monetary   Fund. For some countries

the IFS data are only available quarterly over a shorter sample period, so I use the longest

available sample for each country. Sample start dates range from 1970.1 to 1978.4, and sam-

ple end dates range from 1993.3 to 1994,3. I work with data from 12 countries:             Australia,

Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,          Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,      the

United Kingdom,      and the United States.

     For some purposes it is useful to have data over a much longer span of calendar time.

I have been able to obtain annual data for Sweden and the UK over the period 1919-1993

to complement     the US annual data for the period 1890-1992.       The Swedish data come from

Frennberg and Hansson (1992) and Hassler, Lundvik, Persson, and Soderlind              (1994), while

the UK data come from Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities (1995) and Economist                (1987 ).3

     In working with international    stock market data, it is important      to keep in mind that

different national stock markets are of very different sizes, both absolutely and in proportion

to national GDP’s.      Table 1 illustrates this by reporting   several measures of stock market

capitalization   for the quarterly MSCI data.     Column    1 gives the market capitalization      for

each country’s    MSCI index at the end of 1993, in billions of $US. Column              2 gives the

market capitalization    for each country as a fraction of its GDP. Column 3 gives the market

capitalization   for each country ~ a fraction of the US MSCI index capitalization.          Column

   31 acknowledge the invaluable assistance of Paul Sderlind with the Swedish data and David Barr with
the UK data. Pull details about the construction of the quarterly and annual data are given in a Data
Appendix available from the author.


                                                  8
4 gives the market capitalization      for each country as a fraction of the value-weighted        world

MSCI index capitalization.        Since the MSCI index for the United States is only a subset

of the US market, the last row of the table gives the same statistics for the value-weighted

index of New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange                    stocks reported by the

Center for Research in Security Pric~           (CRSP)   at the University of Chicago.

    Table 1 shows that most countries’ stock markets are dwarfed by the US market. Column

3, for example,    shows that the Japanese MSCI index is worth only 65% of the US MSCI

index, the UK MSCI index is worth only 30~o of the US index, the French and German

MSCI indexes are worth only 11% of the US index, and all other countries’                    indexes are

worth less than 107o of the US index.            Column 4 shows that the US and Japan together

account for 6670 of the world market capitalization,          while the US, Japan, the UK, France,

and Germany together account for 86~o. In interpreting             these numbers one must keep in

mind that the MSCI indexes do not cover the whole market in each country (the US MSCI

index, for example,    is worth about half the US CRSP index), but they do give a guide to

relative magnitudes    across count ries.

   Table 1 also shows that different countries’          stock market values are very different as a

fraction of GDP. If one thinks that total wealth-output         ratios are likely to be fairly constant

across countries, then this indicates that national stock markets are very different fractions

of total wealth in different countries.      In highly capitalized    countries such m the UK and

Switzerland,    the MSCI index accounts for about 80% of GDP, whereas in Germany, Italy,

and Spain, it accounts for less than 2070 of GDP. The theoretical               convention   of treating

the stock market as a claim to total consumption,            or as a proxy for the aggregate wealth

of an economy, makes much more sense in the highly capitalized             countries.    More generally,

international   differences in capitalization     deserve further study.

   Table 2 reports summary statistics for international          returns. For each country the table

reports the mean, standard deviation,       and first-order autocorrelation    of the real stock return

and the real return on a short-term         debt instrument .4 Both means and standard             devia-

    4As explained in the Data Appendix, the best available short-term interest rate is sometimes a Treasury
bill rate and sometimes another money market interest rate.

 tions are given in annualized percentage      points.   To annualize the raw quarterly numbers,

 means are multiplied by 400 while standard deviations are multiplied by 200 (since standard

 deviations increase with the square root of the time interval in serially uncorrelated         data).

     The top panel of Table 2 gives numbers for the 12-country           quarterly MSCI data; the

middle panel gives numbers for the standard postwar quarterly US data set summarized in

 the introduction;    and the bottom   panel gives numbers for the long-term      annual data sets.

The table shows that the first four stylized facts given in the introduction       are fairly robust

across countries.

    1. Stock markets have delivered average real returns of 5~o or better in almost every

country and time period.      The exceptions   to this occur in short-term quarterly data, and are

concentrated     in markets that are particulmly    small relative to GDP (Italy and Spain), or

that predominantly      represent claims on natural resources (Australia and Canada).

    2. Short-term debt has rarely delivered an average real return above 3%. The exceptions

to this occur in two countries, Germany and the Netherlands,          whose sample periods begin

in the late 1970’s and thus exclude the surprise inflation of the oil-shock period.

    3. The annualized standard deviation        of stock returns ranges from 16% to 28%.          It is

striking that the two markets with the highest volatility, Italy and Spain, are the two smallest

markets relative to GDP and the two markets with anomalously            low average returns.

   4. In quarterly data the annualized volatility of real returns on short debt is 4% for Spain,

3% for Italy, Sweden, and the UK, and well below 3% for all other countries.             Volatility is

higher in long-term annual data because of large swings in inflation in the interwar period,

particularly    in 1919-21.   Much of the volatility     in these real returns is probably     due to

unanticipated    inflation and does not reflect volatility in the ex ante real interest rate.

   Table 3 turns to data on aggregate consumption          and stock market dividends.     The table

is organized    in the same way m Table 2. It illustrates the robustness of two more of the

stylized facts given in the int roduct ion.

   5. In the postwar period the annualized standard deviation of real consumption              growth

is ,lever above 370. This is true even though data are used on total consumption,               rather



                                                 10
 than nondurable     and services consumption,    for all countries other than the US. Even in the

longer annual data, which include the turbulent interwar period, consumption              volatility is

only slightly higher than 370.

     6. The volatility of dividend growth is much greater than the volatility of consumption

growth, but generally less than the volatility of stock returns. The exceptions          to this occur

in countries with highly seasonal dividend        payments;     these countries have large negative

autocorrelations    for quarterly dividend growth and much smaller volatility when dividend

growth is measured over a full year rather than over a quarter.

    Table 4 reports the mntemporaneous         correlations among real consumption       growth, real

dividend growth, and stock returns. It turns out that these correlations are somewhat sensi-

tive to the timing convention      used for consumption.   A timing convention    is needed because

the level of consumption   is a flow during a quarter rather than a point-in-time    observation.      If

we think of a given quarter’s consumption     data as measuring consumption      at the beginning of

the quarter, then consumption       growth for the quarter is next quarter’s consumption      divided

by this quarter’s consumption.       If on the other hand we think of the consumption         data as

measuring consumption      at the end of the quarter, then consumption      growth is this quarter’s

consumption     divided by last quarter’s consumption.        Table 4 uses the former,   “beginning-

of- quarter”   timing convention   because this produces a higher contemporaneous         correlation

between consumption      growth and stock returns.

    The timing convention     has less effect on correlations     when the data are measured at

longer horizons,    Table 4 also shows how the correlations       among real consumption      growth,

real dividend growth, and real stock returns vary with the horizon.       Each pairwise correlation

among these series is calculated for horizons of 1, 4, 8, and 16 quarters in the quarterly data

and for horizons of 1, 2, 4, and 8 years in the long-term        annual data. The table illustrates

three more stylized facts from the introduction.

    7. Real consumption     growth and dividend growth are generally weakly positively          corre-

lated in the quarterly data. In many, but not all, countries the correlation increases strongly

with the measurement horizon. The quarterly correlation is negative for the Netherlands but



                                                  11
turns positive at longer horizons,    Negative long-horizon   correlations appear for Italy (with a

very small stock market ), Japan (with anomalous dividend behavior),        and Switzerland.   The

correlations of consumption     and dividend growth are moderately     positive in the longer-term

annual data sets.

    8. The correlations   between real consumption     growth rates and stock returns are quite

variable across countries.    In many countries the quarterly correlations are small but increase

somewhat at horizons of 1 or 2 years. The correlations are moderately       positive in the longer-

term annual data sets.

    9. The correlations   between real dividend growth rates and stock returns are small at a

quarterly horizon but increase dramatically      with the horizon.   This pattern holds in every

country.   The correlations   also increase strongly with the horizon in the longer-term    annual

data.

   After this preliminary look at the data, I now use some simple finance theory to interpret

the stylized facts.

 2      The Equity Premium                              Puzzle

 To understand       the equity premium puzzle, consider the intertemporal               choice problem of a

 representative     investor who can trade freely in some asset i and can obtain a gross rate of

 return (1 -+ ~,t+l ] on the asset held from time t to time t + 1. If the investor consumes Ct at

 time t and has time-separable           utility with discount factor 6 and period utility U(Ct),       then

her first-order condition       is


                                      U’(C,)   = 6Et [(1 + &,t+l)U’(C~+l)]    .                           (1)


The left hand side of (1) is the marginal utility cost of consuming one real dollar less at time

t; the right hand side is the expected             marginal utility benefit from investing the dollar in

asset z at time t, selling it at time t + 1, and consuming the proceeds.              The investor equates

marginal cost and marginal benefit, so (1) must describe the optimum.

     The cl~sic     statement of the equity premium puzzle assumes that there is a representative

agent who maximizes a time-separable               power utility function:

                                                     w   c:;;
                                                Max ~ b~ —                                               (2)
                                                    j =0 l–~’

where ~ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. This utility function has several important

properties.     First, it is scale-invariant;    with constant return distributions,     risk premia do not

change over time as aggregate             wealth and the scale of the economy        increase.   Related to

this, if different investors in the economy           have different wealth levels but the same power

utility function,    then they can be aggregated          into a single representative    investor with the

same utility function as the individual investors. A possibly less desirable property of power

utility is that the elasticity of intertemporal          substitution   is the reciprocal of the coefficient

of relative risk aversion ~. Epstein and Zin (1991) and Weil (1989) have proposed                    a more

general utility specification        that preserves the scale-invariance of power utility but breaks the

tight link between the coefficient of relative risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal

substitution.

                                                                      Ct+l-’

This way of writing the model is due originally to Grossman and Shiner (1981); Hansen and

Jagannathan      (1992) have developed its implications in detail.

    For simplicity I now follow Hansen and Singleton (1983) and assume that the joint condi-

tional distribution of asset returns and consumption                   is lognormal and homoskedastic.          While

these assumptions are not literally realistic – stock returns in particular have fat-tailed dis-

tributions with variances that change over time – they do make it e~ier to discuss the main

forces that should determine the equity premium.

    When a random variable X is conditionally                  lognormally distributed, it has the convenient

property that

                                 log E,X = E, log X + ~Vart log X ,                                                (4)

where Vart log X s Et [(log X — Et log X)2].                If in addition X is conditionally         homoskedastic,

then Varf log X = E[(log X–E~ log X)2] = Var(log X–Et                       log X).       Thus with joint conditional

lognormality    and homoskedasticity         of asset returns and consumption,                  I can take logs of (3)

and obtain

                    O = E~ri,t+l + log 6 – ~EtAct+l +                  ~ [~~ + ~z~~ – 2~~iC] .                     (5)
                                                                     ()

Here Ct = log(Ct)     and Tit = log( 1 + Rit), while u: denotes the unconditional                         variance of

log return innovations     Var(~i,t+l – E~ri,~+l) , u: denotes the unconditional                      variance of log

consumption     innovations Var(c~+l – EtCt+1), and uiC denotes the unconditional                        covariance of

innovations    Cov(~i,~+l — Etri,l+l, C~+l— Etct+l).

   Equation (5) has both time-series and cross-sectional                   implications.       Consider first an asset

with a riskless real return ~j,t+l.         For this ~set         the return innovation         variance u; and the

covariance afC are both zero, so the risklas real interest rate obeys

                                                                             72U:
                               ~f,t+l   =    – logd        + ~EtA~+l       – ~        .                            (6)

This equation says that the riskless real rate is linear in expected                      consumption    growth, with

slope coefficient equal to the coefficient of relative risk aversion.


                                                             14
     The assumption of homoskedasticity           makes the log risk premium on any asset over the

 riskless real rate constant, so expected real returns on other assets are also linear in expected

 consumption    growth with slope coefficient ~. The log risk premium is




 The varianm term on the left hand side of (7) is a Jensen’s Inequality adjustment                    arising

from the fact that we are describing expectations           of log returns. This term would disappear

if we rewrote the equation       in terms of the log expectation          of the ratio of gross returns:

log Et[(l + ~,t+l)/(l     + Rf,t+l)]    = ~O:c. The right hand side of (7) says that the log risk

premium     is determined    by the coefficient     of relative risk aversion times covariance          with

consumption    growth,    Intuitively, an asset with a high consumption          covariance tends to have

low returns when consumption           is low and the marginal utility of consumption         is high. Such

an asset is risky in that it fails to deliver wealth precisely when wealth is most valuable to

the investor. The investor therefore demands a large risk premium to hold it.

    Table 5 uses equation      (7) to illustrate the equity premium puzzle.             For each data set

the table reports the average excess log return on stock over short-term                debt, adjusted for

Jensen’s Inequality by adding one-half the sample variance of the excess log return to get a

sample estimate of the left hand side of (7). This adjusted average excess return is multiplied

by 400 to express it in annualized percentage points. The table then reports the annualized

standard deviation      of the excess log stock return (given earlier in Table 2), the annualized

standard deviation of consumption         growth (given earlier in Table 3), the correlation between

the excess log stock return and consumption         growth, and the product of these three variables

which is the annualized covariance ~iCbetween the log stock return and consumption                  growth.

Finally, the table gives two columns with implied risk aversion coefficients.                  The column

headed RRA( 1) uses equation           (7) directly, dividing the adjusted average excess return by

the estimated covariance      to get estimated risk aversion .5 The column headed RRA(2)                 sets

the correlation of stock returns and consumption          growth equal to one before calculating risk

 aversion,    This is often done implicitly in calibration         exercises such as Mehra and Prescott

 (1985), Campbell and C!ochrane (1995), or Abel (1996).

     Table 5 shows that the equity premium puzzle is a robust phenomenon                     in international

 data. The coefficients of relative risk aversion in the RRA(l)              column are generally extremely

 large. They are usually many times greater than 10, the maximum level considered plausible

by Mehra and Prescott          (1985).     In a few cases the risk aversion coefficients        are negative

because      the estimated    covarianm     of stock returns with consumption            growth is negative,

but in these cues      the covariance       is extremely     close to zero.     Even when one ignores the

low correlation     between    stock ret urns and consumption              growth   and gives the model    its

best chance by setting the correlation              to one, the RRA(2)       column still has risk aversion

coefficients above 10 in most cases. Thus the fact shown in Table 4, that for some countries

the correlation    of stock returns and consumption            increases with the horizon,      is unable by

itself to resolve the equity premium puzzle.

    The risk aversion estimates in Table 5 are of course point estimates                    and are subject

to sampling error.     No standard errors are reported for these estimates.                However authors

such as Cecchetti,    Lam, and Mark ( 1993) and Kocherlakota                  ( 1996), studying the long-run

annual US data, have found small enough standard errors that they can reject risk aversion

coefficients below about 8 at conventional            significance levels.

    One response to the equity premium puzzle is to consider larger values for the coefficient

of relative risk aversion ~. Kandel and Stambaugh                (1991) have advocated       this.6 However

this leads to a second puzzle.           Equation    (5) implies that the unconditional       mean riskless

interest rate is
                                                                    72u:

where g is the mean growth rate of mnsumption.                 Since g is positive, as shown in Table 3,

high values of ~ imply high values of ~g. Ignoring the term –720~/2                    for the moment,    this

Stambaugh(1991) point out that int rospection can deliver very different estimates of risk aversion depending
on the size of the gamble considered. This suggests that introspection can be misleading or that some more
general model of utility is needed.

can be reconciled with low average short-term real interest rates, shown in Table 2, only if

the discount factor 6 is close to or even greater than one, corresponding              to a low or even

negative rate of time preference.        This is the riskfree rate puzzle emphasized by Weil (1989).

    Intuitively,    the riskfree rate puzzle is that if investors are risk-averse then with power

utility they must also be extremely unwilling to substitute intertemporally.              Given positive

average consumption         growth, a low riskless interest rate and a positive rate of time preference,

such investors would have a strong desire to borrow from the future to reduce their average

consumption        growth   rate.   A low riskless interest rate is possible in equilibrium      only if

investors have a negative rate of time preference that reduces their desire to borrow.

    Of course, if the risk aversion coefficient ~ is high enough then the negative quadratic 72

term in equation      (8) dominates     the linear term and pushes the riskless interest rate down

again. The quadratic term reflects precautionary           savings; risk-averse agents with uncertain

consumption    streams have a precautionary        desire to save, which can work against their desire

to borrow.    But a reasonable rate of time preference is obtained only as a knife-edge case.

    Table 6 illustrates the riskfree rate puzzle in international         data.   The table first shows

the average riskfree rate from Table 2 and the mean consumption             growth rate and standard

deviation of consumption        growth from Table 3. These moments and the risk aversion coef-

ficients calculated    in Table 5 are substituted      into equation   (8), and the equation   is solved

for an implied time preference         rate.   The time preference     rate is reported   in percentage

points per year; it can be interpreted         as the riskless real interest rate that would prevail if

consumption     were known to be constant forever at its current level, with no growth and no

volatility. The table shows that risk aversion coefficients in the RRA(2)         range imply negative

time preference rates, whereas larger risk aversion coefficients          in the RRA( 1) range imply

time preference rates that are often positive but always implausible and vary wildly across

countries.

   The discussion in this section has taken the volatility of stock returns as given.             I now

ask what accounts for this volatility.

 3        The Stock Market                                 Volatility                     Puzzle

 To understand the stock market volatility puzzle, it is useful to have a framework relating

 movements         in stock prices to movements in expected                               future dividends and discount rates.

 The present value model of stock prices is intractably                                         nonlinear when expected             stock re-

 turns are time-varying,            but Campbell and Shiner (1988a) have suggested a useful loglinear

approximation            to the exact present value model.                          Campbell           and Shiner’s loglinear relation

between prices, dividends, and returns provides an accounting framework:                                                 High prices must

eventually be followed by high future dividends or low future returns, and high prices must

be associated          with high expected             future dividends or low expected                             future returns.      Simi-

larly, high returns must be associated with upward revisions in expected future dividends or

downward revisions in expected                   future returns.

     The loglinear approximation                 starts with the definition of the log return on stock i, ri,t+l =

log(Pi,t+~ + D;,i+~) – log(Pit).             The timing convention here is that prices are measured at the

end of each period so that they represent claims to next period’s dividends.                                               The log return

is a nonlinear function of log prices pit and pilt+l and and log dividends di,t+i, but it can be

approximated           around the mean log dividend-price                       ratio, (di~ – pit), using a first-order Taylor

expansion.        The raulting       approximation             is


                                    ‘i,t+l   =   ‘i   +   PiPi,t+l   +    (1    –   Pi)di,t+l      –    pit   ,                           (9)


where pi and           ki are   parameters of linearization                    defined by pi s 1/(1 + exp(di~ – pit)) and

ki s – log(~i)          – (1 – pi) log(l/~i           – 1).      When the dividend-price                          ratio is constant,    then

Pi   =   Pi/(Pi    +    Di),    the ratio of the ex-dividend                    to the cum-dividend                  stock price.      In the

postwar quarterly US data shown in Table 3, the average price-dividend                                                ratio has been 26.4

on an annual b=is,              implying     that pi should be about 0.964 in annual data.                                    The Taylor

approximation           (9) replaces the log of the sum of the stock price and the dividend                                            in the

exact relation with a weighted average of the log stock price and the log dividend.                                                 The log

stock price gets a weight pi close to one, while the log dividend gets a weight 1 — pi close

to mro because the dividend                  is on average much smaller than the stock price, so a given


                                                                     18
 percentage     change in the dividend            has a much smaller effect on the return than a given

 percentage change in the price.

    Equation (9) is a linear difference equation for the log stock price. Solving forward, impos-

 ing the “no-bubble”     condition that limj~~               p{pt+j = O, taking expectations,                and subtracting

the current dividend, one gets

                                             ki               m

This equation says that the log price-dividend                    ratio is high when dividends are expected                 to

grow rapidly, or when stock returns are expected to be low. The equation should be thought

of as an accounting      identity rather than a behavioral                    model;    it has been obtained           merely

by approximating       an identity, solving forward subject to a terminal condition,                              and taking

expectations.     Intuitively,   if the stock price is high today, then from the definition of the

return and the assumption         that the stock price is non-explosive,                      there must either be high

dividends or low stock returns in the future. Investors must then expect some combination

of high dividends     and low stock returns if their expectations                      are to be consistent with the

observed price.

    Equation (10) describes the log price-dividend                    ratio rather than the log price itself. This

is a useful way to write the model because in many data sets dividends                                    appear to follow a

loglinear unit root process, so that log dividends and log prices are nonstationary.                                  In this

case changes in log dividends            are stationary,          so from (10) the log price-dividend                 ratio is

stationary provided     that the expected          stock return is stationary,               Thus log stock prices and

dividends are cointegrated,      and the stationary linear combination                       of these variables involves

no unknown parameters since it is just the log ratio.

   Table 7 reports some summary                  statistics for international              stock prices in relation         to

dividends.    The table gives the average price-dividend                  ratio, the standard deviation of the log

prim-dividend     ratio in natural units, the first-order autocorrelation                          of the log price-dividend

ratio, average growth rates of prices, dividends, and the log price-dividend                              ratio in percentage

points per year, and a test statistic for the null hypothesis that the log price-dividend                                ratio

 has a unit root.     Following standard practice,        the price-dividend     ratio is measured as the

 ratio of the current stock price to the total of dividends paid during the past year.

    Average price-dividend         ratios vary considerably across countries but generally lie between

20 and 30. The extreme outlier is Japan, which has an average price-dividend                    ratio of 86.

The volatility and first-order autocorrelation       of the log price-dividend      ratio are also unusually

high for Japan, reflecting an upward trend in the Japanese log price-dividend                ratio for much

of the sample period which is also visible in the average growth rates of prices and dividends

at the right of the table.

    Other countries in the quarterly data set, with the exception              of France, have first-order

autocorrelation     coefficients for the log price-dividend     ratio of between 0.S5 and 0.95.          Unit

root tests do not reject the unit root null hypothesis           for most of these countries,      but this

may reflect low power of the tests in short data samples.                Equation    (10) implies that the

log price-dividend      ratio must be stationary      if real dividend    growth and stock returns are

stationary, so this gives some reason to assume stationarity for the series.

    So far I have written asset prices as linear combinations        of expected future dividends and

returns. Following Campbell          (1991 ), I can also write asset returns as linear combinations        of

revisions in expected     future dividends and returns. Substituting           (10) into (9), I obtain




This equation     says that unexpected       stock returns must be associated         with changes in ex-

pectations   of future dividends or real returns.         An increase in expected      future dividends    is

msociated    with a capital gain today, while an increae           in expected      future returns is asso-

ciated with a capital loss today.        The reason is that with a given dividend           stream, higher

future returns can only be generated by future price appreciation from a lower current price.

   I now use this accounting          framework    to illustrate the stock market volatility         puzzle.

Following    Campbell     (1986)    and Abel (1996)     I assume that the aggregate          stock market,

denoted by subscript m, pays a dividend equal to aggregate consumption                   raised to a power

A. In logs, we have

                                                                                                         (12)

 Abel (1996) shows that the coefficient       ~ can be interpreted as a measure of leverage.                 The

 standard    model of Lucas (1978),       Grossman    and Shiner (1981),         and Mehra and Prescott

 (1985) h=     A = 1, but dividends      can be made more volatile than consumption                   by setting

 A>l.

       The representative agent reset pricing model with power utility, conditional lognormality,

and homoskedasticit y (equations        (6) and (7)) implies that


                                       Etr~,t+l = pm + ~EiAct+l       .                                      (13)


The expected      log return on the aggregate stock market, like the expected               log return on any

other asset, is just a constant term plus 7 times expected           consumption          growth,

      Substituting   equations (12) and (13) into equations (10) and (11 ), I find that


                                                                                                             (14)

Expected     future consumption     growth has offsetting        effects on the log price-dividend            ra-

tie. It has a direct positive effect by increasing expected         future dividends A-for-one, but it

has an indirect negative effect by incre~ing          expected    future real interest rates ~-for-one.

The unexpected       log return on the stock market is A times contemporaneous                      unexpected

consumption     growth (since contemporaneous         consumption     growth increases the contempo-

raneous dividend A-for-one),      plus (A – ~) times the discounted           sum of revisions in expected

future consumption      growth.

   These equations       can be simplified if I assume with Mehra and Prescott                      (1985)   that

aggregate consumption       growth follows a first-order     autoregressive           ( AR( 1) ) process of the

form

                                  Aci+l = (1 – ~)g + ~Act + Zt+l ,                                           (16)

where g is mean consumption        growth and Et+l denotes the innovation               in consumption.      The

coefficient ~ is the first-order autocorrelation     coefficient for consumption          growth, as reported

    These formulas show how difficult it is to account for stock market volatility within the

standard model.      First consider the case where # > 0, so consumption                    growth is positively

autocorrelated.     In this case a positive consumption            shock raises the current dividend           and

expected future dividend growth, but it also raises real interest rates. These offsetting effects

make it hard to explain both the equity premium and the volatility of stock prices.                           From

the previous section we know that a large ~ is needed to explain the equity premium;                           but

then ~ – ~pm~ tends to be small (implying                  that stock returns are not volatile)         or even

negative (implying     that stock returns are negatively           correlated with consumption          and the

equity premium is negative).

    Next consider     the case where # < 0.           Here a positive       consumption        shock raises the

current dividend,     lowers expected       future dividend     growth,     and lowers real interest rat es.

Now A – Tpm# can be large and positive when 7 is large, implying volatile and procyclical

stock prices.

   Unfortunately      this case has several unappealing            implications.     The log price-dividend

ratio is a linear function    of consumption         growth so it follows an AR(1)            process with the

same persistence parameter @ as consumption              growth.      In the data, log price-dividend     ratios

have large positive autocorrelations        (Table 7) which are inconsistent with ~ <0.

   Negative autocorrelations       in consumption        growth also tend to make the riskless real in-

terest rate volatile relative to the log price-dividend          ratio. The price-dividend         ratio reflects

a discounted sum of long-run expected future real interest rates, and this discounted                     sum is

less volatile than the current real interest rate when consumption                 growth and hence the real

interest rate are negatively autocorrelated.         As 7 increases, the ratio Var(rft ) /Var(p~t         -   dmt
                                                                                                                )
approaches      (1 – pm@)2, which is greater than one when @ <                0,   Empirically,    the standard


                                                      22
 deviations for real ret urns on short-term debt given in Table 2 (which are reported in per-

 centage points) are much smaller than the standard deviations for log price-dividend                    ratios

 given in Table 7 (which are reported in natural units).7

     Finally, it is troubling that the standard model must rely so heavily on negative autocor-

 relation of consumption       growth, for which there is no strong evidence.         While some countries

 in Table 4 show negative autocorrelation          in consumption     growth, this is by no means a con-

sistent pattern.     8 out of 12 quarterly datasets show negative autocorrelation,              but only 4 of

these negative correlations          are less than -I).1, and 2 out of 3 annual data sets show positive

autocorrelation.a

    All of these calculations          rely heavily on the assumptions        of the representative      agent

model with power utility, lognormal distributions,            and constant variances.        Another    way to

use the loglinear asset pricing framework is to study the empirical relationships between log

price-dividend     ratios and future consumption         or dividend growth rates, real interest rates,

and excess stock returns. According           to equation (10), the log price-dividend        ratio embodies

rational forecasts of dividend          growth rates and stock returns (which in turn are the sum

of real interest rates and excess stock returns), discounted             to an infinite horizon.       One can

compare     the empirical     importance     of these different forecasts      by regressing long-horizon

consumption      and dividend growth rates, real interest rates, and excess stock returns onto

the log price-dividend      ratio.

    Table 8 reports the results of this exercise.           For each quarterly data set, consumption

growth, dividend growth, the real interest rate, and the excess stock return are computed                    in

natural units over 4, 8, and 16 quarters (1, 2, and 4 years) and regressed onto the log price-

dividend   ratio divided by its standard deviation.           Thus the regression coefficient        gives the

   71n most countries the level (not the log) of the dividend-price ratio haa a standard deviation close to that
of the riskless real interest. rate. Since the standard deviation of the dividend-price ratio is approximately
the average level of the dividend-price ratio times the standard deviation of the log price-dividend ratio, this
implies that the log price-dividend ratio has a standard deviation many times greater than the standard
deviation of the riskles real interest rate,
   8There are sever~ data problems that may affect these autocorrelations, but they go in both directions.
Consumption for most countries includes durables, which tends to bias autocorrelation downwards, and is
time-averaged and seasonally adjusted, which tends to bias autocol relation upwards.

growth rate or rate of return in natural units. The table reports the regression coefficient,

heteroskedasticity-     and autocorrelation-consistent     i statistic, and R2 statistic.

    In the benchmark       postwar quarterly US data, the log price-dividend         ratio has no clear

ability to forecast    consumption    growth, dividend growth,       or the real interest rate at any

horizon.     What it does forec~t     is the excess return on stocks, with t statistics that start

above 4 and increase, and with R2 statistics that start at 0.20 and increase to 0.55 at a

4-year horizon.    In the introduction    these results were summarized       as stylized facts 10, 11,

12, and 13. Table 8 extends them to international data.

    10. Regressions of consumption       growth on the log price-dividend       ratio give very mixed

results across countries.    There are stat istically significant positive coefficients in Germany,

the Netherlands,      and Spain, but statistically   significant negative coefficients      in Australia,

Italy, and Japan.      Canada,   France, Sweden, Switzerland,      and the UK resemble the US in

that they have no statistically significant consumption        growth forecasts.

    11. Results are somewhat        more promising for real dividend growth in many countries.

Positive and statistically significant coefficients are found in Canada, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. It seems clear that changing forecasts of real dividend

growth have some role to play in explaining stock market movements.

   12. The short-term       real interest rate does not seem to be a promising candidate for the

driving force behind stock market fluctuations,        One would expect to find high price-dividend

rat ios forecasting low real int crest rates, but the regression coefficients are significantly pos-

itive in France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,        Sweden, Switzerland,    and the UK. This pre-

sumably reflects the fact that stock markets in most countries were depressed in the 1970’s,

when real interest rates were low, and buoyant during the 1980 ‘s, when real interest rates

were high.

   13. Finally, the log price-dividend      ratio is a powerful forecaster of excess stock returns

in almost every country.     The regression coefficients are uniformly negative, and statistically

significant everywhere except Japan.



                                                  24
    In the long-term annual data for Sweden, the UK, and the US, I use horizons of 1 year, 4

years, and 8 years. In the US data the log price-dividend    ratio fails to forecast real dividend

growth, suggesting that authors such u Barsky and De Long (1993) overemphasize            the role

of dividend forecasts in interpreting long-run US experience.     Consistent with the quarterly

results, the log price-dividend   ratio also fails to forecast consumption    growth or the real

interest rate but does forecast excess stock ret urns.

    The UK data are similar, although here the 8-year regression coefficients for consumption

growth and dividend growth are even statistically significant with the wrong (negative)      sign.

The 8-year regression coefficient for the real interest rate is also significantly negative, con-

sistent with the idea that the UK stock market is related to the real interest rate. But much

the strongest relation is between the log price-dividend    ratio and future excess returns on

the UK stock market. The Swedish data are quite different; here the log price-dividend       ratio

forecasts dividend growth positively    but has no predictive power for consumption       growth,

the real interest rate, or the excess log stock return.

   Overall, these results suggest that a new model of stock market volatility is needed. The

standard model drives all stock market fluctuations from changing forecasts of consumption

(dividend)   growth and real interest rates; forecasts of excess stock returns are constant.

The data for many countries suggest instead that forecasts of consumption       growth and real

interest rates are cons tant, while the stock market is driven by changing forecasts of excess

stock returns.

4      Changing Risk Aversion and the Stock Market Puz-
       zles

In previous sections I have documented           a challenging array of stylized facts and have dis-

cussed the problems they pose for standard asset pricing theory. Briefly, the equity premium

puzzle suggests that risk aversion must be high on average to explain high average excess

stock ret urns, while the stock market volatility puzzle suggests that risk aversion must vary

over time to explain predictable      variation in excess returns and the associated volatility of

stock prices.     I now present the model of Campbell                and Cochrane          (1995), which has these

features, and show how it resolves at least some of the difficulties with the standard theory.

    The Campbell- Cochrane model assumes that a represent at ive investor derives utility from

the level of consumption   relative to a time-varying subsistence or habit level. The importance

of habit has been emphasized        by many authors,            including           Constantinides   (1990),   Ferson

and Constantinides     (1991), Heaton (1995), Ryder and Heal (1973), and Sundaresan (1989).

Following   Abel (1990),   Campbell      and Cochrane         assume that the habit is external in the

sense that it is determined    by the cons umpt ion of the community                       as a whole, and not by

the consumption     of any individual investor. This assumption,                    which Abel calls “catching up

with the Joneses”, greatly simplifies the analysis since the investor does not have to calculate

the effect of today’s consumption     decision on future marginal utility of consumption.

    Campbell    and Cochrane   assume that log consumption                  follows a random walk. This fits

the observation    that most countries do not have highly predictable                    consumption      or dividend

growth rates (Tables 3 and 8). The consumption               growth process is


                                            Act+l = g +      Et+l ,                                              (19)


where Zt+l is a normal homoskedastic          innovation      with variance u:.             This is just the AR(1)

model (16) of the previous section, with zero persistence in consumption                        growth.

    The utility function of the representative       agent takes the form


                                  Et ~      fij(c~+~ –    Xi+j)l-T      –   1                                    (20)

                                                    26
Here X~ is the level of habit, 6 is the subjective discount factor, and ~ is the utility curvature

parameter.       Utility depends on a power function of the difference between consumption                    and

habit; it is only defined when consumption                exceeds habit.

    It is convenient         to capture the relation between consumption             and habit by the surplus

consumption        ratio St, defined by
                                                    S=ct–xt
                                                     t   c,          “
                                                                                                              (21)

The surplus consumption                ratio is the fraction of consumption         that exceeds habit and is

therefore available to generate utility in (20).               If habit Xt is held fixed as consumption         Ct

varies, the local coefficient of relative risk aversion is


                                                                                                              (22)


where Uc and Ucc are the first and second derivatives of utility with respect to consumption.

Risk aversion rises as the the surplus consumption                ratio St declines, that is, as consumption

approaches      the habit level. Note that ~, the curvature parameter in utility, is no longer the

coefficient of relative risk aversion in this model.

    To complete       the description       of preferences, one must specify how the habit Xt evolves

over time in response to aggregate consumption.                 Campbell and Cochrane suggest an AR(1)

model for the log surplus consumption               ratio, St s log(St):


                                        s,+, = (1 –v)~+vs,       +~(st)zf+l     .                             (23)


The parameter        p governs the persistence of the log surplus consumption                 ratio, while the

“sensitivity     function”     ~(st)    controls   the sensitivity   of st+l and thus of log habit Zt+l to

innovations      in consumption         growth ~t+1.

    Equation (23) specifies that today’s habit is a complex nonlinear function of current and

past consumption.           A linear approximation        may help to understand        it. If I substitute    the

definition     St s log(l    – exp(z,     – et)) into (23) and linearize around the steady state, I find

that (23) is approximately             a traditional habit-formation       model in which log habit responds




                                                          27
slowly and linearly to log consumption,




The linear model (24) has two serious problems.               First, when consumption             follows an exoge-

nous process such as (19) there is nothing to stop consumption                     falling below habit, in which

case utility is undefined.        This problem does not arise when one specifies a process for st,

since any real value for St corresponds          to positive St and hence Ct > Xt. Second, the linear

model typically implies a highly volatile riskless real interest rate. The process (23) with a

non-constant     sensitivity function       J (st) allows one to control or even eliminate variation in

the riskless interest rate.

   To derive the real interest rate implied by this model, one first calculates the marginal

utility of consumption      as


                                    U’(et) = (Cf – x~)-7 =          st-~ct-v.                                  (25)


The riskless real interest rate is then


                 (1 +R{)    =
                                 ( :~:;;))-’=
                                  6E,
                                         (~Et(*)-’(*)-’)-’
                                                      .                                                        (26)


Taking logs, and using equations          (19) and (23), the log riskless real interest rate is


                   T/ = –log(J)+Tg–            T(l –V)(st     –~)    –   Mz      [A(s,) + 1]2 .                (27)


   The first two terms on the right hand side of (27) are familiar from the power utility

model (8), while the last two terms are new.                 The third term (linear in (St – ~)) reflects

intertemporal    substitution.      If the surplus consumption            ratio is low, the marginal utility

of consumption     is high.      However,    the surplus consumption             ratio is expected    to revert to

its mean, so marginal         utility is expected      to fall in the future.         Therefore,     the consumer

would like to borrow       and this drives up the equilibrium             risk free interest rate.       Note that

what determines intertemporal           substitution    is mean-reversion        in marginal utility, not mean-

reversion in consumption         itself. In this model consumption              follows a random walk so there


                                                        28
is no mean-reversion      in consumption;      but habit formation          causes the consumer to adjust

gradually to a new level of consumption,         cresting mean-reversion           in marginal utility.

    The fourth term (linear in [A(st) + 1]2) reflects precautionary                  savings.   As uncertainty

incre~m,      consumers   become     more willing to save and this drives down the equilibrium

riskless interest rate. Note that what determines precautionary                  savings is uncertainty about

marginal utility, not uncertainty       about consumption            itself. In this model the consumption

process is homoskedastic    so there is no time-variation        in uncertainty about consumption;         but

habit formation     makes a given level of consumption           uncertain y more serious for marginal

utility when consumption        is low relative to habit.

    Equation    (27) can be made to match the observed stability of real interest rates in two

ways. First, it is helpful if the habit persistence parameter ~ is close to one, since this limits

the strength of the intertemporal         substitution     effect.     Second,    the precautionary    savings

effect offsets the intertemporal subst itut ion effect if A(St) declines with St. In fact, Campbell

and Cochrane      parametrize     the A( st ) function    so that these two effects exactly offset each

other everywhere,     implying    a constant    riskless interest rate.          They choose the sensitivity

function   A(st) to satisfy three conditions:     1) The real risk free rate is constant.          2) Habit is

predetermined     at the steady state St = E. 3) Habit is predetermined                near the steady state,

or, equivalently, positive shocks to consumption           may increase habit but never reduce it.

   To understand conditions        2) and 3), recall that the traditional           notion of habit makes it

a predetermined    variable. On the other hand habit cannot be predetermined                    everywhere, or

a sufficiently low realization of consumption        growth would leave consumption               below habit.

To make habit ‘as predetermined          as possible”,    Campbell       and Cochrane      assume that habit

is predetermined     at and near the steady state.           This also eliminates        the counterintuitive

possibility that positive shocks to mnsumption            cause declines in habit.

   Using these three conditions,      Campbell and Cochrane show that the steady-state                 surplus

consumption     ratio must be a function of the other parameters of the model, and that the

sensitivity function A(st ) must take a particular form. Campbell                 and Cochrane pick param-

eters for the model by calibrating it to fit postwar quarterly US data. They choose the mean



                                                     29
 consumption    growth rate g = 0.4470 per quarter and the standard deviation of consumption

growth a. = 0.56% per quarter to match the moments of the US consumption                     data.

    Campbell    and Cochrane follow Mehra and Prescott by assuming that the stock market

pays a dividend        equal to consumption.     They use numerical         methods    to find the price-

dividend    ratio for the stock market as a function        of the state variable St. They set the

persistence of the state variable, p, equal to 0.97 to match the persistence of the log price-

dividend ratio.g They choose ~ = 2.37 to match the ratio of unconditional                mean to uncon-

ditional standard deviation      of return in US stock returns.          These parameter     values imply

that at the steady state, the surplus consumption         ratio S = 0.05 so habit is about 95% of

consumption.    Finally, Campbell and Cochrane choose the discount factor 6 = 0.97 to give a

riskless real interest rate of 170 per year.

    It is important      to understand   that with these parameter         values the model uses high

average risk aversion to fit the high unconditional     equity premium.       Steady-state   risk aversion

is ~/S   = 2.37/0.05    = 48. In this respect the model resembles a power utility model with a

very high risk aversion coefficient.

    There are however two important differences between the Campbell-Cochrane                  model and

the power utility model with high risk aversion. First, the Campbell-Cochrane                model avoids

the riskfree rate puzzle of Weil (1989).     Evaluating equation (27) at the steady state surplus

consumption    ratio and using the restrictions on the sensitivity function           A(st), the constant

riskless interest rate in the Campbell- Cochrane model is

                                                                 2 02
                                  r{ = –log(6)    +?g–
                                                           ().
                                                            :     ~                                   (28)


In the power utility model the same large coefficient           ~ would appear in the consumption

growth term and the consumption          volatility term (equation      (8)); in the Campbell-Cochrane

model the curvature parameter y appears in the consumption               growth term, and this is much

lower than the steady-state     risk aversion coefficient ~/S     which appears in the consumption

volatility term. Thus in the Gampbell-Cochrane           model a much lower value of the discount

   ‘Rather than matching quarterlypersistencedirectly, Campbell and Cochrane use the fourth root of the
estimated annual persistenceof the log price-dividend ratio.


                                                   30
factor 6 is consistent       with the average level of the risk free interest rate, and the model

 implies a less sensitive relationship between mean consumption               growth and int crest rates. 10

       Second,     the Campbell- Cochrane    model has risk aversion that varies with the level of

consumption,        whereas a power utility model h= constant risk aversion. The time-variation in

risk aversion generates predictable movements in excess stock returns like those documented

in Table 8, enabling the Campbell-Cochrane            model to solve the stock market volatility puzzle.

Results are reported in detail in Campbell and Cochrane (1995).

       A full application    of the Campbell-Cochrane       model to international      data would be out

of keeping with the exploratory          spirit of this paper.    Instead, I undertake       a more modest

exercise.     I use the traditional    linear habit-formation      model (equation       (24))   to construct

the difference between log consumption            and “habit”,   where habit is just a backward moving

average of past log consumption.        That is, I construct Ct–xt where Zt = g+~xt_l            + (1 –W)C~_l

and at the first date in the sample “habit”              equals consumption .11 The parameter             ~ is

arbitrarily      set to 0.97 in quarterly data, or 0.974 in annual data.           This can be seen as a

simple way to construct        a stochastically   detrended, stationary consumption         series.

       According    to the basic Campbell-Cochrane       model, high levels of stochastically      detrended

consumption        forec~t   low excess stock returns but do not forecast consumption              growth or

real interest rates. In this sense the stock market is “cyclical”            but the real interest rate is

not.    Campbell     and Cochrane     also present a modification      of the model that allows modest

countercyclical      variation in the real interest rate; the modified model implies that high levels

of stoch~tically      detrended consumption        forecast low real interest rates.

    Table 9 repeats the regressions of Table 8 using the stochastically           detrended consumption

series for each country       as the explanatory     variable in place of the log price-dividend        ratio.

Once again the dependent           variables are measured        in natural units and the explanatory
  10The preferences suggested by Epstein and Zin (1991) and Weil ( 1989), which break the link between
the coefficient of relative risk aversion and the elsst icity of intertemporal substitution, also allow average
consumption growth to have a much smaller effect than consumption volatility on the risk free interest rate,
but these preferences do not display time-varying risk aversion.
  11In the underlyingth~ry, of course, habit must lie below consumption but this is ~hieved in the linear
model by subtracting a constant from the “habit” variable. The constant does not affect the dynamics of
“habit” so I set it to zero in the empirical work.

variable is normalized     by dividing by its standard deviation.

    In quarterly data, some countries show some evidence of long-run mean reversion in con-

sumption growth; stochastically         detrended consumption     forecasts slow consumption     growth

at long horizons      in Australia,    Canada,    Germany,   Italy, the Netherlands,    Spain, and the

United Kingdom.       The long-run annual US data also show this pattern.

    There is fairly strong evidence that the stochastically       detrended consumption     series fore-

casts real interest rates in the manner predicted by the modified Campbell- Cochrane model.

All countries except Germany and the UK show negative coefficients in quarterly real interest

rate regressions; however this effect is entirely absent in the long-run annual data.

    Finally, the stochastically   detrended consumption        series often forecasts low excess stock

returns.   In quarterly data negative significant coefficients         are found in Australia,   France,

the Netherlands,     Spain, the UK, and the USA, while all three annual data sets display this

pattern.

    While these results are encouraging        for the Campbell-Cochrane      model, one should inter-

pret them with some caution.          Plots of the data show that for many countries the stochas-

tically detrended consumption         series exhibits low-frequency    movements   associated with the

growth slowdown       of the mid-1970’s.      These movements         are different in nature from the

cyclical swings emphasized      by the Campbell- Cochrane model, and may distort some of the

results. A symptom of this problem is that the correlation between stochastically            detrended

consumption      and the log price-dividend      ratio, which should be positive, is negative in 7 out

of 12 quarterly data sets.

    As a more direct way to examine the data, I plot consumption             and its backward moving

average for the annual Swedish, UK, and US data sets in Figures la, 2a, and 3a. I plot the

stochastically   detrended consumption        series and the log price-dividend    ratio (both normal-

ized to have zero sample mean and unit sample standard deviation)               for the same data sets

in Figures lb, 2b, and 3b.

   These figures illustrate the sense in which national stock markets respond to medium-

term swings in national consumption.         In each of the three countries there are some important

common    movements    in detrended    consumption    and the log price-dividend   ratio.   These   are

the movements     that can be fit by an asset pricing model based on aggregate consumption,

such as the model of Campbell and Cochrane (1995).            But there are also some movements of

the two series that do not correspond.     In Sweden, for example, detrended consumption            was

particularly   high in the 1920’s and much lower in the 1980’s, reflecting shifts in the long-

run growth rate of the economy        and in the allocation    of national income between private

consumption     and government spending.     The log price-dividend    ratio on the other hand has

tended to rise over the pmt 75 years. The Campbell- Cochrane           model does not account for

these low-frequency   characteristics of the data.

 5       Conclusion

 In this paper I have presented a list of stylized facts about US stock market behavior.                          I

have shown that many of these facts describe the behavior of other countries’ stock markets

M well. The facts present two puzzles for standard asset pricing theory.                     The better-known

puzzle is the large size of the average equity premium, but this is easily resolved by assuming

that investors are highly risk-averse. The deeper puzzle is the high volatility of stock prices,

which seems to be associated with predictable time-variation                 in excess stock returns. I have

argued that this can be explained by a model of time-varying                  risk aversion such as the one

presented by Campbell        and Cochrane (1995).

     In arguing for this model of stock market behavior                I have left several    mportant   topics

unexplored.    First, I have followed the literature and have assumed that dividends                     equal

consumption       or equivalently,    that the aggregate stock market equals total national wealth.

This assumption       is clearly untrue even for the United States, and is even less appropriate

for countries with smaller stock markets. It is straightforward               to generalize the assumption

slightly by modelling      stocks as a leveraged claim to aggregate con sump tion in the manner

of Abel (1996), but it may be appropriate             to go further by introducing      human capital into

the model in the manner of Campbell             (1996) or by distinguishing       between the consumption

of stockholders     and non-stockholders       in the manner of Mankiw and Zeldes (1991).

     Second, I have treated each national stock market as a separate entity with its own pricing

model.   That is, I have assumed that national economies                  are entirely closed so that there

is no integrated world capital market.           This assumption        may be appropriate      for examining

long- term historical data, but it seems qumtionable           under modern conditions.         An interesting

exercise would be to study the pricing of imperfectly                correlated   national stock markets in

a model with an integrated           world capital market.     Such a model might be able to explain

the fact that the short-run          cross-country   correlations    of stock returns are higher than the

short-run cross-country      correlations     of consumption        or dividend growth rates. If there is a .

representative investor whose risk aversion varies over time, then shifting risk aversion would

move all countries’ stock markets together even if their dividends are only weakly correlated.

    Third,     I have worked with a representative      agent utility function    and have not asked

 what features of individual preferences produce this utility function.          Several authors have

 recently argued that rigidities in market structure with heterogeneous           agents can produce

shifting aggregate risk aversion (Aiyagari and Gert ler 1995, Grossman and Zhou 1994). This

deserves further exploration.

    I conclude with some more general lessons for economic policy makers and commentators.

The stock market is commonly         used as a leading indicator of the state of the economy.      The

results of this paper suggest that while the stock market does forecast medium-term             growth

rates of corporate    dividends,   it is much less successful at forecasting     medium-term    growth

rates of aggregate consumption.12

    There hm recently been a tendency         for economists   to downplay the importance       of eco-

nomic fluctuations    in favor of an emphasis on long-term economic growth.          But the model of

habit formation    presented here implies that consumers take fluctuations extremely seriously.

Fluctuations    have important     negative effects on welfare because they move consumption         in

the short term, when agents have little time to adjust; reductions          in long-term    growth, on

the other hand, allow agents’ habit levels to adjust gradually.

    This conclusion    is not an artifact of a particular utility function       and habit formation

process.   As Atkeson and Phelan (1994) emphasize, it must result from any utility function

that explains the level of the equity premium.         The choice between risky stocks and stable

money market instruments offers investors a tradeoff between the mean growth rate of their

wealth and the volatility of this growth rate. The fact that so much extra mean growth is

available from volatile stock market investments implies that investors find volatility to be

a serious threat to their welfare. Economic      policy makers should take this into account when

they face policy tradeoffs between economic       growth and macroeconomic         stability.

prices in US data.

    Notes    for Tables



    Notes for Tablel:     ~isthestock    index market capitalization in billions of1993 US dollars.

All stock index data are from Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), except for USA-

CRSP which is from the Center for Research in Security Prices. ~-/GDPi            is the index market

capitalization   as a percentage of 1993 GDP, ~/VuSMScI is the index market capitalization

as a percentage    of the market capitalization    of the US MSCI index, and ~-/(~i            ~)   is the

percentage   share of the index market capitalization     in the total market capitalization         of all

the MSCI indexes.       AUL denotes Australia, CAN Canada, FR France, GER Germany, ITA

Italy, JAP Japan, NTH Netherlands, SP Spain, SWD Sweden, SWT Switzerland, UK United

Kingdom,     USA United States.



    Notes for Table 2: R      is the mean log real return on the market index, multiplied by 400

in quarterly data or 100 in annual data to express in annualized percentage            points.      a(r~)

is the standard deviation     of the log real return on the market index, multiplied by 200 in

quarterly data or 100 in annual data to express in annualized percentage points. p(r~) is the

first-order autocorrelation    of the log real return on the market index.       V, O(rj),    and p(~~)

are defined in the same way for the real return on a 3-month          money market instrument.

The money market instruments vary across countries and are described in detail in the Data

Appendix.



   Notes for Table 3: ~       is the mean log real consumption   growth rate, multiplied by 400 in

quarterly data or 100 in annual data to express in annualized percentage points. o(Ac)              is the

standard deviation of the log real consumption       growth rate, multiplied by 200 in quarterly

data or 100 in annual data to express in annualized percentage         points.     p(Ac)     is the first-

order autocorrelation     of the log real consumption   growth rate. Ad,   u(Ad),and p(Ad)are
defined in the same way for the real dividend growth rate. Consumption            is nondurable       and

services consumption      in the US, and total consumption   elsewhere.
     Notes for Table 4: The table gives the contemporaneous                   cross-correlations      of real con-

 sumption growth Ac, real dividend growth Ad, and the stock index return r~, where these

 variables are measured at horizons of 1, 4, 8, or 16 quarters in quarterly data and 1, 2, 4,

 or 8 years in annual data.         The timing convention        used for consumption          is that consump-

 tion memured      in a given quarter corresponds           to beginning-of-quarter         consumption,      so log

consumption       growth for the quarter is the log of next quarter’s consumption                divided by this

quarter’s consumption.


                        —.
     Notes for Table 5: aerm IS the average excess log return on stock over a money market

instrument, plus one half the variance of this excess return: ~
                                                              aer                 = rm – Tf+az(rm          –rf)/2.

It is multiplied by 400 in quarterly data and 100 in annual data to express in annualized

percentage    points.     a(er~)   and o(Ac)      are the standard deviations of the excess log return

er~ =rm       — Tj and consumption         growth Ac, respectively,         multiplied by 200 in quarterly

data and 100 in annual data to express in annualized percentage                     points.     p(er, Ac) is the

correlation   of e~~ an d Ac.       cov(er~,    Ac) is the product      a(er~)o(Ac)p(er,       At).    RRA(l)        is

100aerm/cov(er~,        Ac), a measure of risk aversion calculated using the empirical covariance of

excess stock returns with consumption            growth. RRA(2)        is looaern/o(er~)o    (Ac)”,     a measure

of risk aversion calculated        using the empirical standard deviations           of excess stock returns

and consumption         growth, but assuming perfect correlation between these series.



    Notes for Table 6: ~           is the mean money market return from Table 2, in annualized

percent age points.       &   and a(Ac)        are the mean and standard          deviation    of consumption

growth from Table 3, in annualized percentage                points.    RRA( 1) and RRA(2)            are the risk

aversion coefficients from Table 5. TPR( 1) = v – RRA(l )Ac + RRA( l)2a2(Ac)/200,                               and

TPR(2)     = ~ – RRA(2)&            + RRA(2)202(Ac)/200.           These time preference          rates give the

real interest rate, in annualized percentage points, that would prevail if consumption                     growth

had zero mean and zero standard                deviation   and risk aversion were RRA(l)              or RRA(2),

respect ivel y.
      Notes for Table 7: P/D                  is the mean price-dividend            ratio.     a(p – d) is the standard

 deviation of the log price-dividend               ratio in natural units (not annualized percentage points).

 p(p – d) is the first-order              autocorrelation       of the log price-dividend           ratio.      ADF(l ) is the

 augmented          Dickey-Fuller       t-ratio for the lagged log price-dividend              ratio when the change in

 the log price-dividend            ratio is regressed on a constant, four lagged changes, and the lagged

 log price-dividend           ratio. (*) indicates a rejection of the unit root hypothesis for the log
                                                _—
 prim-dividend          ratio at the 5% level. Ap, Ad, and Ap – d are the mean changes in log prices,

 log dividends,        and the log price-dividend           ratio respectively.



     Notes for Table 8: The table reports regression coefficients ~(k), t-statistics t(~(k)),                                 and

R2 statistics R2(k) for regressions whose dependent variables are real consumption                                     growth,

real dividend growth, real ret urns on 3-month money market instruments, or excess returns

on stock over money market instruments,                         all measured in natural units (not annualized

percentage         points)    at horizons       k of 4, 8, or 16 quarters in quarterly                 data or 1, 4, or 8

years in annual data. The independent                   variable in every regression is the log price-dividend

ratio, normalized            by dividing     by its standard deviation.           The t-statistics are corrected               for

heteroskedasticity           and serial correlation in the equation errors using the Newey- West method.



     Notes for Table 9: The table reports regression coefficients ~(k), t-statistics t(~(k)),                                 and

R2 statistics R2(k) for regressions whose dependent                        variables are real consumption              growth,

real dividend growth, real ret urns on 3-month money market instruments, or excess returns

on stock over money market instruments, all measured at horizons k of 4, 8, or 16 quarters

in quarterly        data    or 1, 4, or 8 years in annual          data.   The    independent         variable    in every     re-

gression       is stochastically       detrended   log consumption,        normalized        by dividing      by its standard

deviation.       Stochastically        detrended    log consumption        is the difference        between      log consump-

tion G and a “habit”           measure       Zi, constructed     from   ~t = g + ~xt.l        +(1   – ~)ct_l,     where     x = c

at the first date          in the sample.       ~ = 0.97 in quarterly        data    and 0.974 in annual            data.     The

t-statistics      are corrected        for heteroskedasticity      and serial correlation           in the equation         errors

using the Newey-West               method.
    Notes for Figures la, 2a, and 3a: The figures show log consumption       as a solid line and the

stochastic trend in log consumption    as a dashed line. The stochtitic   trend in log consumption

is constructed   ~ zt = g + pZt_l + (1 — ~)ct_l,    where z = c at the first date in the sample

and ~ = 0.974. Stochastically     detrended log consumption     is the difference between the two

lines. Figure 1a uses Swedish annual data, figure 2a uses UK annual data, and figure 3a uses

US annual data.



   Notes for Figures lb, 2b, and 3b:       The figures show the log price-dividend       ratio as a

solid line and stochastically   detrended log consumption   as a dashed line. The two series are

normalized so that they both have zero mean and unit standard deviation.            Figure lb uses

Swedish annual data, figure 2b uses UK annual data, and figure 3b uses US annual data.
