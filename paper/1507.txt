                  The Order of Liberalization of the
                    Current and Capital Accounts of
                        the Balance of Payments


                                  ABSTRACT




         The opening up of an economy to the rest of the world has generally

been considered an Integral part of economic reform aimed at increasing the

role of markets. Until recently, however, very little discussion was devoted

to the order in which the capital and current account should be liberalized in

developing countries.

         This paper deals with several aspects of the order of liberaliza-

tion. The different arguments usually given to advocate a particular ordering

are critically reviewed. Then a three-good two—factor model is used to

analyze the effects of alternative ordering on production and income distribu-

tion. A two—period model of a small economy is also used to investigate the

welfare effects of opening the capital account in the presence of distor-

tions. While the discussion does not yield a theorem regarding the appro-

priate order of liberalization, there are strong presumptions that it is more

prudent to liberalize the current account first.

 1.   Introduction

           For many years economists have argued that developing countries

should rely more heavily on the market mechanism. In particular it has        been
argued that liberalization processes, consisting of "freeing" domestic markets

and opening up the economy to the rest of the world, should be implemented. A

large amount of effort and resources have been devoted to the study of the

relationship between the degree of market use, economic efficiency and eco-

nomic growth. These studies have resulted in the accumulation of an impres-

sive body of empirical evidence that indicates that liberalized and export—

oriented economies outperform -— both in terms of growth and equitable income

distribution -—   repressed   and closed economies. .1!   However, despite this

evidence, and the widespread belief among economists of the merits of liberal-

izing the LDC's economies, little serious efforts to that effect have been

taken by these countries. Many times liberalization attempts are frustrated

at different stages, with these economies reverting to repressed inward—

looking developing strategies.

          Why, then, if liberalization is so desirable don't we observe more

successful liberalization attempts? There are a number of possible answers to

this question. First, even if a liberalization process results in an overall

(for the economy as a whole) welfare gain, there are sectors that will gain

and sectors that will lose from it. If losing sectors are politically power-

ful they may frustrate these liberalization efforts.          This problem becomes

      Bhagwati 1978; Bhagwati and Srinivasan 1978; Krueger 1978, 1981, 1983.
      On the order of liberalization see Edwards (1985b).

      This statement, of course, assumes away the possibility of fully
      compensating the losers of the liberalization effort.
                                           —2—




 more complicated once it is recognized that short—run winners and losers may

 differ from long—run winners and losers [see Mayer 1970, Mussa 19714]. From a

 policy perspective this fact suggests that the identification of different

groups affected by the liberalization process, and the possible compensation

of   (short—run?)   losers could be important to generate a successful process.

             Second, to the extent that there are short-run rigidities and

adjustment costs, a liberalization process may result in short-run output (and

welfare) losses. Even if these losses are more than compensated in the future
——   with   the present value of the change in society's welfare being positive ——

governments may be reluctant to embark into a liberalization episode. The

reason for this is that the time horizon relevant to a government may be

different (i.e.., shorter) than that relevant to the economy as a whole. From

a policy perspective this problem indicates that the analysis of the dynamics

of liberalization ——    differences   between short— and long—run effects ——   is
critical. Once this dynamic process is understood, policies aimed at reducing

the short—run costs of the adjustment could be implemented.

            Third, many times liberalizations have been attempted at the same

ti.me as a major stabilization program, aimed at reducing inflation and solving

a serious balance of payments crisis, is underway. 1" As a result of this the

costs of the liberalization process are confused with those of the stabiliza-

tion program, with the consequent resistance against the liberalization

effort.

            Finally (fourth), sometjnes the transition between a repressed and

liberalized economy is mismanaged at a macroeconomic level, generating



     See Krueger (1978, 1981), LIttle (1982), Mlchaely (1982).
additional costs, which can become associated with the liberalization process

itself.

          It is clear from   this   discussion that the dynamic aspects of

liberalization episodes are extremely important. The transition between a

repressed state and a liberalized economy should be implemented carefully, in

order to avoid the abortion of the liberalization attempt itself. Among these

dynamic aspects, those related to the speed and order of liberalization are

particularly important. With respect to the former, the main question is how

fast should an economy be liberalized? In analyzing this problem considera-

tions related to (a) efficiency gains, (b) income distribution,

Cc)   credibility   of the liberalization reforms, and Cd) feasibility of the

attempt should be taken into account.!" Regarding the order of

liberalization, the main question is which markets should be liberalized

first. This is a complicated question that has both micro (welfare) and macro

implications. At the micro level typical second—best problems are present,

while at the macro level, different orders of the liberalization process will

imply different paths f or the critical variables, including the real exchange

rate, aggregate output and unemployment.

          The present paper deals with a particular aspect of the order of

economic liberalization: the order of liberalizing the current and capital

account of the balance of payments. It has generally been considered that the

opening of the economy to the rest of the world is an integral part of any

economic reform aiming at increasing the role of markets in LDC's. Until




      On the speed of liberalization see Aizenman (1983), Learner (1980), Pindyk
      (1982), Krueger (l983b), Mussa (1982, 1983).

 recently,    however, very little discussion had been devoted to the order in

 which the current and capital accounts should be liberalized. ! The recent

 experience of a group of countries from the cone of South—America ——

 Argentina,   Chile and Uruguay —- has generated new interest on the subject.

These countries followed opposite orders -—      Argentina   and Uruguay opened the

capital account first, while Chile opened the current account first —-       with a
common fate in the early 1980s: deep economic recession and (partial) rever-

sal of the liberalization attempt. An important policy question that has

emerged from these experiences has to do with defining liberalization policy

packages (including a specific order) that would increase the possibility that

the reforms will indeed be undertaken and will not be reverted.

         In the present paper some of the most important issues related to the

order of liberalization of the current and capital accounts of the balance of

payments are surveyed. The paper is organized in the following form: In

Section 2 the literature on the subject is reviewed, and some interpretations

are suggested. In this section the central role o' credibility in any

successful policy reform is emphasized. In SectIon 3 a positIve analysis of

the effects of liberalizing the cpital and currnt accounts on production and

income distribution Is presented. The framework used for this discussion is a

3 goods—two factors node1 with sector specific capital in the short-run. This

analysis proceeds with great detail and shows that each reform on Its own will

tend to have opposite effects on production and income distribution.        In




    Of course, this question is only relevant in a world with market
    imperfections and/or externalities. In a world without externalities or
    frictions the question of the orders of liberalization Is trivial: all
    markets should be liberalized simultaneously and Instantaneously.

Section    14 a two—period model of' a small economy is used to investigate the

welfare effects of opening the capital account (i.e., allow some foreign

borrowing or lending) in the presence of         trade   restrictions. This discussion

provides    a general multi—period framework useful for analyzing the welfare
consequences of partial reforms. It is shown that the welfare effects of
opening the capital account in the presence of trade distortions will depend
critically on whether the foreign funds obtained          from abroad are used to

(directly)      increase present consumption or if they are used to finance capital
accumulation.       Finally, in Section 5 a   summary and some concluding comments
are   presented. Also in this section some thoughts regarding future lines of

research on the subject are presented.



2.    The Order of Economic Liberalization: A Review of the Literature

            The order of economic liberalization —— understood as whether the

capital or the current accounts should be liberalized first -— has become an

explicit topic of analysis only during the last few years. It was          basically
the recent liberalization and stabilization experience of the countries of the

cone of South-America (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) that triggered a broad

discussion on the subject. Since 1980 an increasing number of conferences,

papers, Ph.D. theses and research projects have been devoted to the subject. -Y

Even though the explicit analysis of the order of liberalization of the

current and capital accounts is only recent, it is possible to find some

important discussions on the topic in some earlier work devoted to other



      See, for example, Mckinnon (1932), Blejer and Landau (1984), Corbo and de
      Melo (1981), IMF Staff Papers (June 1983), Khan and Zahler (1983), and
      Krurnrn   (1983).
                                             —6—




 aspects of economic liberalization [i.e., McKinnon 1973, Chap. 11; Little,
 Scitovsky and Scott 1970, Ch. 10].

           The different authors that have analyzed the order of liberalization

 have tended to focus on different aspects of the problem. However, in order

 to organize this review these arguments will be grouped Into three broad cate-

 gories: (a) Macroeconomic Stability and real exchange rate movements;

 (b) Welfare effects of alternative orderings; and (C) Costs of the

 adj ustment process.




          2.1 Macroeconomic Stability and Real Exchange Rate Movements

          It has been suggested that the opening of the capital account of the

 balance of payments will result, in the short—run, in large destabilizing

 capital flows. 21      If   the capital account Is opened at a stage where the

 domestic capital market is still repressed, with Interest rates fixed at arti—

fically low levels, massive capital outflows will take place. For this reason

most, if not all authors that have discussed this issue have suggested that

the capital account should only be opened after the domestic capital market

has been liberalized, and domestic Interest rates have been raised. .!         It   is

also generally accepted that in an inflationary environment the domestic

financial market should only be liberalized after the fiscal deficit has          been




.1!   See, for example, McKinnon (1973, 1982), Dornbusch (1983), Corbo (1983),
      Arriazu (1983b), Little, Scitovsky and Scott (1970, Ch. 10, p. 365).

      Interestingly, in most of the literature on domestic financial markets
      liberalization authors have referred to "raising" interest rates rather
      than "freeing" them (see, for exarip1e, Mc}Cinnon's 1973 classical
      treatment of the subject).
                                            —7-




controlled.            The reason for this is that, as emphasized by McKinnon and

Mathiesori   [1981], the existence of a large fiscal deficit, which is financed

by an inflation tax, necessitates that reserve requirements are kept high and

interest payments on deposits are kept low. In this way it is assured that

the base on which the inflation tax is collected -—       the   stock of high powered

money --     is    not eroded. J-2!

             If,    on the other hand, the fiscal deficit has been controlled and the

domestic fInancIal market liberalIzed, the presumption is that the opening of

the capital account of the balance of payments will result in large inflows of

foreign capital, triggered by the existence of substantial interest rates

differentials [see MeKinnon, 1973]. These inflows of foreign funds will then

be monetized and, under a fixed exchange rate will result in inflation and a

real appreciation of the domestic currency. IL"         if,   on the other hand, the

country In question chooses to adopt a floating exchange rate, the massive

inflow of capital will result in an appreciation of the nominal (arid real)




2!   Most of the discussion on the order of liberalization in the context of
     the southern cone countries has focused on the problem of liberalization
     with stabilization. The reason for this is, of course, that these
     countries attempted to liberalize and reduce extremely high inflation
     rates (up to 500% per year) simultaneously.

     See McKinnon (1982) and 'IcKinnon and Mathieson (1981) for discussions on
     the subject. It has been suggested that the inability to control the
     fiscal deficit in Argentila wa ne of the major causes of the failure of
     the recent liberalization 4ith stabilization attempted in that country.
     See, f or example, Rodriguez (1fl3), Nogues (1983), Fernandez (1983),
     Sjaastad (1983), Arriazu (1933) and McKinnon (1982).

IL! The implicit assumption here io rHt as a result of the opening of the
    capital account an excess sUp3ly of' money will be generated.

 exchange rate.        Not only will the opening of the capital account generate

 a real appreciation of the domestic currency, but since financial markets

 adjust fast —— indeed much faster than goods markets ——   this   real appreciation

 will be quite abrupt [see Frenkel 1982, 1983].

            While the opening of the capital account will generate a real

 ciation, it has been argued that a successful liberalization of the trade

 account will require a real devaluation of the domestic currency. This real

 depreciation would help the exportables sector to expand as the new structure

 of relative prices replaces the old protective structure.         If, however,

 due to the opening of the capital account this devaluation is precluded, the

 transition in the tradeable goods sector from a protective to a freer envi-

 ronment will become more difficult. The appreciation generated by the opening

 of the capital account will tend to squeeze profitability in the tradeable

 goods sector at a moment when this sector (or part of it in the import substi-

tution industries) is going through a costly readjustment. -Li"     Consequently
some authors have suggested that the capital and current accounts should not

be open simultaneously, and that during the transition period after trade has

been liberalized, capital Inflows should be tightly controlled.      It is



       On the relationship between capital flows and the real exchange rate In
       LDCs see, for example, the discussions in Harberger (1982); Harberger and
       Edwards, (1982); Munoz (1982); Diaz—klejancjro (1981); Cline (1983); Calvo

 interesting to quote what McKinnon wrote on the subject in 1973, since the

 hypothetical situation described by him closely reflects some of the problems

 faced by the southern cone countries during their recent (late l9lOs—early

 1980s) liberalization efforts:




            .unusually large inflows of foreign capital.. .inhibit
          the exchange rate to depreciate sufficiently....
          [F]reviously protected competing industries, which face a
          significant adjustment problem, could have their
          difficulties magnified... .[HJence the capital inflow
          could trigger a decline Ir overall domestic
          output...                                      (page 160)

         McKinnon then goes on to recommend that an economy that liberalizes

its foreign trade should "deliberately avoid an unusual or extraordinary

injection of foreign capital" [1973, p. 161, emphasis added].   More recently
this kind of reasoning has also been made by Dornbusch [1983], Arriazu [1983],

again by McKinnori [1982], and Harberger [1983]. The general theme is that

during the transition of a trade liberalization process capital inflows should

be controlled, since otherwise the real exchange rate will appreciate

producing harmful effects, and even destroying the liberalizing experiment.

As Dornbusch [1983, p. 176] has recently put it: "The worst thing to do is to

liberalize the capital account.. .before the required real depreciation has

been achieved".

         A critical question regarding this line of argument is to what extent

the freeing of the capital account will result in an "extraordinary" Injection

of foreign capital, in the sense of the McKinnon quote. If the opening of the

capital account results in large capital inflows which are sustainable in the

long—run, the resulting appreciation should be viewed a a long—run equilib—

 rium phenomenon. Under those circumstances it is not clear that the opening

 of the capital account should be delayed on the grounds of its effects on the

real exchange rate.         It turns out, however, that it is not difficult to

build simple models of an economy that restricts capital Inflows, where an

opening of the capital account will result in short-run overshooting of the

level of capital inflows. Possibly one of the simplest ways of modelling this

behavior is by assuming    that   capital inflows (AK) respond to the following
equation:


                   L,K =
                           m1nCO(D*_D1),]
where D* is the desired or sustainable level of foreign debt, which will

depend on the level of "the" world interest rate, real
                                                          Income, real wealth and
the perceived profitability of investments at home, among other things. D_1

is the actual stock of debt in the previous period, 0 is a partial adjust-

ment coefficient, and K is the maximum (possibly zero) amount of (net)

capital inflow allowed by the economic authority In every period.




    See the discussion in Stockman (1982) on the merits of opening the
    capital account as soon as possible.

    The term 0[D* -
                     D1] responds to the idea, advanced by Harberger (1982)
    for example, that there is a long-run equilibrium ratio of foreign debt
    to GDP. If GD? grows at g% per annum so will the stock of debt. If,
    on the other hand, the real interest rate on the foreign debt is r*,
    net annual capital inflows will grow at a rate of (g —     r*).
                                                                  Notice that
    a problem with this formulation is that it only looks at the phase where
    foreign debt is accumulated, and does not explicitly incorporate the
    existence of an intertemporal budget constraint. On the different phases
    of the accounts of the balance of payments see Fischer and Frenkel
    (1972).

 Clearly, if bJC < e(D* —           the gap between desired and actual debt will
                              D1)
 increase through time. Once the restrictions on capital inflows are lifted,

actual inflows will become equal to O(D* —                  That means that immediately

following the opening of the capital account capital flows will jump to a

fraction 0 of the accumulated gap between the desired and actual debt. As

this gap is closed, the level of capital inflows will slowly be reduced until

they reach a new equilibrium level. For the case of a simple economy the

behavior through time of capital flows that emerges from this formulation can

be represented in Figure 2.1. Alternatively, it is possible to assume that

once the capital account Is liberalized the perceived profitability of domes-

tic investrent will dramatically increase [McKinnon, 19733. This will result

in a (significantly) higher 0* ——       sustainable     level of foreign debt —— and in

a jump In the level of capital inflows, as shown in Figure 2.1.

            This sudden increase (i.e., overshooting) of capital inflows will

produce a large current account deficit -— as was the case of Chile during

1980—1981. .11-" As has been pointed out by McKinnon (1976), Corden (1982) and

Harberger    (1982,   l983)) among others, as long as a fraction of these flows are

spent on nori-tradeable goods, theabsortjri of           these capital inflows will
require   an increase In the relative price        of these goods and a real apprecia
tion of domestic currency.          Once the gap between desired and actual debt
begins to close, the relative price of riorl—tradeables will slowly tend to

    (1983) and Rodriguez (1983) ror a discussion of the Argentinian case.
    Harberger (1982) actually caloulated that the increase in the level of
    capital inflows in Chile is capable of "explaining" a real appreciation
    of the peso of up to 25 percent.

 decline towards its new long—run equilibrium. At this point of the adjustment

 process another problem may emerge if the country has fixed its exchange

 rate: If f or some reason -—    the existence of minimum wages, or of backward
 indexation, f or example —-   the nominal price of non—tradeables is Inflexible

 downward, the decline of this relative price will not occur, and unemployment

 will result.

             It Is interesting to notice that the dynamic effect of a capital

 account liberalization on the relative price of nontradeable goods resembles

 that    of the Dutch—Disease, in that in order to adjust to a large increase in
absorption a real appreciation of the domestic currency will have to take
place. !2/ Also, it should be pointed out that there are other reasons
besides the "jump" in the level of capital flows discussed above, why the
opening of the capital account could result in a short-run appreciation of the
domestic currency that will exceed the long—run appreciation. One of such
cases is related to the difference between short— and long—run elá$ticities of
supply of the nontradeables goods sector.
             The conflicting movements of the real exchange rate as a result of
opening the capital or current accounts (i.e., real appreciation and depre-
ciation respectively) captures the fact that these policies will exercise
pressures for resources to move in opposite directions. The opening of the
capital account will generate (at least in the short—run) an expansion
of the nori—tradeable goods sector and a contraction of the importables and



!21     On Dutch-Disease see, for example, Corden (1981, 1982), Corden and Neary

        (l98i4a,b).

exportables     sectors.       The opening of the current account, on the other

hand, will result in an expansion of the exportables sector, a contraction of

the production of Importables, with the nontradeables sector either expanding

or contracting [see the discussion in Section 3 below]. To the extent that

there could be advisable to implement policies that would avoid unnecessary

resource switches (I.e., resource movements that will be reversed after a

short period of time). .-i_"    In   particular a synchronization of the effects of

opening the capital and current accounts, in the sense suggested by Frenkel

[1982, 1983] might be called for. Frenkel has proposed that given the

differential speeds at which the goods and capital markets adjust, this

synchronization     could be achieved by   opening the current account first, and

only   after   some time opening the capital account. In Section 3 below, a

specific analysis of the effects of both types of liberlization, that spells

out the difference between short- and long—run effects on resource movements

is presented.

           An alternative view has been recently presented by Deepak Lal

[1982]. According to Lal, sInce exchange rate behavior is critIcal during the

transition period from a protected towards a liberalized trade account, it is

better not to let the government manipulate the nominal exchange rate during

this transition. There have been plenty of cases, he argues, where exchange



       This indeed has been the case in countries that have opened the capital
       account. In Chile, for example, after the capital account was opened in
       1979/80, an important fraction of the massive capital inflows was used to
       finance the expansion of the construction sector. This was also the case
       of Argentina and Uruguay (see Nogues 1983; Hanson and de Melo 1983).

       A critical question at this stage is why wouldn't the private sector take
       into account these considerations when making their decisions about
       production and resource movements.

 rate management has been inappropriate    and   has resulted in   the trade reform

 being finally aborted (i.e., the recent experience of Argentina). -?_?J      For
 this reason Lal has proposed that a floating exchange rate system with full
currency   convertibility, should   be implemented before   the trade reform takes

place. This, of course, means that the capital account should be liberalized

before the trade account. A problem with this proposition however is that Lal

does not spell out how to handle the real
                                                appreciation problem resulting from
the opening of the capital account —- even
                                           though admittedly its effects will
be less severe if the trade side has not been reformed yet,            nor does he
specify how much in advance the capital account should be opened. Also, in

his discussion on the subject Lal does not refer to the Institutional setting

that would be required for a floating exchange rates system to succeed in a

developing country.



           2.2 Welfare Effects of Alternative Orderings

           A second line of argument used in discussions related to the ordering

of economic liberalization refers to traditional welfare analysis. It has



    Other authors that discuss how to handle the exchange rate during the
    transition period after a trade reform include McKinnon (1973), Kapur
    (1983), Michaely (1982), Balassa (1982). One possible way to deal with
    the exchange rate problem during the transition is to
                                                          adopt a dual
    system, with a fixed (or managed) rate for trade transactions, and a
    floating rate for financial transactions. The problem with this kind of
    system, however, is that it becomes verycumbersome and difficult to
    manage. On dual exchange rate systems see, for example, Meade (1951, p.
    302); Flood (1978); Lainy (1975, Fleming (1974) and Dornbusch (1976).

    On thi8, see however, Branson (1983).

    Some authors have argued that due to the lack of some basic institutional
    requirements (freely) floating exchange rates systems are not feasible In
    developing countries. See, for example McKinnon (l979a,b).
                                          —16—



been argued that if the current and     capital   accounts are   not   liberalized

simultaneously there might be welfare implications of reducing one distortion

while other distortions are kept In place.           This kind of argument has been

made by Frenkel [1982, 1983], Krueger [1983] and McKinnon [1973]. These

authors have generally concluded that welfare considerations indicate that the

current account should be liberalized first. The main reason for this is that

the (negative) indirect welfare effect of opening the capital account in the
presence of trade distortions will exceed the indirect effects arising from
the opposite ordering. MeKinnon [1973, P. 157], for        example stated that "the

liberalization [of] capital inflow[s]. . .   increase[s]   the basic distortion in

the economy". Frenkel [1983], has expressed that

                    when the trade account is opened first the cost of remaining
                    distortion (i.e., the closed capital account)...is likely to
                    be relatively small. On the other hand, when the capital
                    account is opened up first the cost of the remaining distor-
                    tion (i.e., the close trade account)...is likely to be very
                    large. Thus a comparison of the costs of distortions...
                    supports the proposition that the trade account should be
                    opened first.                                      [p. 167].

Kruger [1983] has stated that

                    Since exchanges of assets are exchanges of capitalized values
                    of income streams, income streams generated by distorted
                    prices are probably the inappropriate ones at which to
                    trade. It would then follow that capital account libera—
                    lization should not be undertaken unless both current account
                    and domestic financial transaction are already
                    liberalized.                                            [P. 19].
           In   some sense this type of reasoning, which focuses on the welfare

effects of opening the capital account in the presence of trade distortions,



      As mentioned in the introduction, in a world with no distortions the
      Optimal (i.e., welfare maxirnizing) strategy is to liberalize both accounts
      simultaneously and instantaneously.
                                         —17—




can   be related to the irnnilserizing capital accumulation argument originally

advanced by Harry Johnson [1967]. ?_"      This   argument points out that if there

are tariffs and the importable goods is capital Intensive, capital accumula-

tion may be welfare reducing. The reason for this is that when capital is

accumulated, production of the capital Intensive (i.e., the importable) sector

will increase, [Rybczynskl 1955], and the effect of the pre—existing distor-

tion will be reinforced. This effect can be strong enough, so that the accu-

mulation of capital will result in a reduction of welfare.           An obvious

question at this point Is why would the recipients of capital inflows use them

to accumulate capital (i.e., to invest) if welfare might be reduced? The

answer     is that while from a private perspective the accumulation of   capital

may   be   beneficial, since under our assumptions regarding capital intensity,

the domestic rental rate of capital will exceed the world rental rate,

from a social perspective, it will be less desirable —- and could even he

immiserizing. This suggests, then, that if once the capital account is opened

investment decisions are made using shadow prices, welfare will never decrease

[see Edwards and Van Wijnbergen 1983].




      Of course, irnmiserization represents an extreme case. However, the
      analytics of this case can be applied to more plausible results, where the
      increase in welfare resulting fron capital accumulation is lower in the
      presence of trade distortion. See also Bertrand and Flatters (1971) for
      extensions on the welfare efrects of the accumulation of capital.

      The condition for this welfare reduction to take place is that the
      Rybczynski line is flatter' than tie world's relative price line. See
      Johnson (1967).

      This,   of course, according to Solper-Sarnuelson's theorem.
                                      —18—



          The analysis of the welfare effects of foreign investment in the

presence of tariffs —— as developed by Bhagwati and Srinivasan [1982], and

Brecher and Diaz—Alejandro [1977], among others —— can also be useful for the

present discussion regarding the order of liberalization. Brecher and Diaz-

Alejandro, for example, have shown that in the presence of tariffs if the

importable goods is capital Intensive a small amount of foreign investment

will always be welfare reducing if foreign capital is paid its marginal

product. This will happen even If the conditions required for the Johnson

[1967] immiserlzation discussed above, do not hold. If, however, the return

to foreign capital is taxed, foreign investment may be welfare improving.

They argue that if the amount of this tax Is equal to the difference between

capital's marginal productivity valued at domestic prices, and capital's

marginal productivity valued at world prices, welfare will remain unaffec-

ted. Again, the main reason for this result lies on the fact that under the

assumption that the importable goods is capital Intensive foreign investment

—-   or for that matter any form of capital accumulation ——   will   result in an

increase in the production of the sector that already produces too much from a

social perspective.

           In general, the welfare effects of additional investment resulting

from the liberalization of the capital account can be analyzed within the

context of the emerging literature on factor trade.       If before the

liberalization process the (private) domestic rate of return to capital

exceeds the world rate of return, once foreign borrowing is allowed some of



      On factor trade see, for example, Grossman (1983), Bhagwati and Srinivasan
      (1983), Brecher and Findlay (1983), Brecher (1983) and Srinivasan (1983).
                                           —19—




these   funds    will   be used for the importation of machines. Analytically this

is equivalent to allowing trade in machines (today), and thus can be analyzed

within   the factor trade framework.
           The above discussion -— and,     to some extent, the argument of MeKinnon

[1973], Frenkel [1982, 1983] and Krueger [1983] presented above ——      focus

exclusively on the case where, as a result of the liberalization of the

capital account, the additional borrowing is used to increase investment.

This, of course, needs not be the case. A fraction (possibly zero) of the new

borrowing could be used to increase present consumption. Indeed that will

happen as long as prior to the liberalization the domestic rate of time

preferences exceeded the world rate of interest. It is easy to show that,

under    these   circumstances, if all of the (new) foreign borrowing is used for

additional present consumption (with the world rate of interest below the

domestic rate of time preferences) welfare cannot deteriorate even if there

are tariff's.

           We now briefly turn to discuss the welfare effect of liberalizing

trade in the presence of a closed capital account. The question here is if

there arecircumstarices urder whiô'n this particular order of liberalization

will result in some indirect negative welfare effects.            In principle, at a

theoretical level, it is conceivable that some models might yield this kind of

result. Specifically, if the restricitons In the capital account take the

form of a tax on foreign borrowing that introduces a wedge between the world

and domestic rates of interest, and the liberalization of the current account




    A different, and more relevant question of course, is whether the total -—
    direct plus indirect effects -- can be negative.
                                         —20—



results In a reduction (i.e., leftward shift) of the dnand for foreign

borrowing, an indirect negative welfare effect could result.

             In practice, however, this case is quite Implausible. First, It is

unlikely that the reduction of tariffs will generate a reduction of the demand

for foreign borrowing. The reason for this is that once tariffs are reduced

the demand for importables will increase, with part of the Increase in con-

sumption of this type of goods being financed by additional foreign borrow-

ing.          Second, In a large number of cases the distortions associated with

capital account take the form of quantitative restrictions, where a given

maximum amount of foreign borrowing is allowed. In this case then, there is

no indirect welfare cost (i.e., welfare rectangle), in the borrowing market

associated with the reduction of trade distortions. In general, these

considerations constitute a part of the presumption that trade liberalization

is welfare improving even if distortions in some other markets are maintained

             2.3 Adjustment Costs and Assistance

             Some authors have postulated that in order to increase the

probability of success (i.e., non—reversal) of a trade reform, the adjustment

costs (unemployment and others) related to the tariffs reduction should be




il-'1   There is an important problem, however, related to the speed of tariff
        reductions. it is conceivable that if a slow tariff reform schedule is
        announced today, borrowing will decrease, since the public will postpone
        consumption towards the future, when tariffs will be lower.
                                             -21 -



minimized [see for example Michaely, 1982].
                                                     i! It   has then been argued that

one way of reducing these adjustment costs is through the importation of

foreign capital, which would be used to finance a smoother adjustment of the

import competing industries. According to this view then, the capital account

should be opened first, or simultaneously with the trade account. This would
increase the availability of "cheap" funds that could then
                                                           be used to ease the
adjustment process. Paul Clark [1982], for example, argues that the success-
ful   liberalization of    the Egyptian economy in the 1970s was due, to a large

extent,      to the adjustment assistance provided by foreign sources. Anne

Krueger [1983a] on the other hand, while not agreeing with the order "capital

account first      and trade—account second", has also recognized the possible

important      role of foreign   funds to   help   achieve a smoother transition. As   she


puts   it:




                 [O]ne of the important contributions international lending can
                 make to a country when its leaders are genuinely committed to full
                 liberalization, [is to].. .permit higher levels of imports than
                 would otherwise be feasible....Not only does this reduce the
                 economic and political strains associated with liberalization, it
                 also reduces uncertainty of business as to the likelihood that
                 liberalization will persist. [1983a, p. 11].

              The arguments for using foreign funds to       smooth the adjustment

 process     during a trade liberalization episode are, to some extent, equivalent




       Usually the idea of' minimizing adjustment costs is translated into two
       forms of policy recorarnentations:
                                          (1) liberalization of trade should be
       done slowly [see Michaely 1982; Little, Scltovsky, Scott, 1970); and
        (b) adjustment assistance —-- usually in the form of foreign funds —-
       should    be provided.

       See also, for example, Little, Scitovsky and Scott (1970, Ch. 10);
       Michasly (1982, p. 17).
                                         —22—




to the arguments in favor of providing adjustment assistance to industries
that are negatively affected by (exogenous) changes In the terms of trade.          A

recent NBER study edited by Jagdlsh Bhagwatl [1982] contains a number of

interesting papers on the subject.          As Bhagwati himself puts it in the

introduction to this volume, the analysis of the adjustment assistance issue

requires knowing the path the economy will take following the change of rela-

tive prices (i.e., changes in terms of trade and/or tariff reductions).

According to the simple textbook case, following a change in relative prices,

resources will immediately move out of the sector whose relative price has

declined and into the expanding sector. In more complex models however, there

will be adjustment costs and resource reallocation will only take place

slowly, and will possibly result in a short—run loss of output.            However,

it is very important to clearly specify    the   nature of these adjustment costs

before making inferences regarding the desirability of intervention. If these

costs are related to the activity of moving resources between sectors, as in

Mussa's [1978] model, and there are no externalities, there is no welfare—

related reason to provide adjustment assistance.           If, on the other hand,

adjustment costs arise from market imperfections ——      like   the existence of

minimum wages for example --   there   is some room for intervention. The first

best policy, of course, is to try to eliminate the source of these market




11" See, for example, Bruno (1932), ieary (1982), and Mussa (1982).

    The most popular models wit-i adjustment costs are of the Ricardo-Viner
    type. See for example Jones (197L), Mayer (19724), Mussa (19711, 1978,
    1982), Neary (1978, 1982), and Jtit and Norman (1980).

    However, adjustment assistance mIght be called for other reasons, like
    income distribution consider'.3tIn. See Learner (1981).
                                        —23—



 imperfections. If, for whatever reason, this first best policy is not

 available, second best solutions should be sought.

            McKinnorj [1973, 1982], however, has strongly opposed the idea of

 using foreign capital flows to assist the trade reform transition period. In

 fact, in his 1973 book he characterized aborted liberalization
                                                                   episodes as

 "partial liberalization with foreign capital" [1973, p. 155]. This view,

 which is consistent with his position of
                                            tightly controlling capital inflows

 throughout the trade liberalization, is based on the idea that short—term

 capital movements provide incorrect signals to the private sector:


                  [T]rade liberalization should proceed without relying on
                  unusual short—term inflows of private oapital...Such capital
                  inflows are simply not sustainable In the long—run; and during
                  the liberalization process itself they throw out incorrect
                  market signals. [1982, p. 163]

           There are two problems with this view. First, it is not clear what

is meant by "unusual" inflows of capital.      Second, there is no theoretical a

priori reason to believe that these "unusual" capital inflows will provide the

wrong signals. In order for this argument to make sense it Is necessary to

explicitly specify why the private sector will not realize (as the government

presumably does in McKinnon' model) that these inflows are     temporary   and
"unusual". If, on the other hand, the private sector does realize the

temporary nature of the inflows, they will not throw incorrect signals and

there is no reason, at least on these gounds, to restrict capital movements.

           A critical question regarding this problem is related to the

credibilit1 of the trade reform. If the public believes that there is some

probability that the reform will be reversed in   the future, foreign funds,
obtained   through the opening of the capital account, may be used by the owners
                                          —214-




 of capital in the Import substitution industries to maintain their firms

 functioning at a (temporary) loss. Alternatively, these funds could be used

 to finance lobbying activities aimed at convincing the government officials of

 the desirability of reversing the trade reform. .31-"

             Also,   If agents believe that the trade reform will be reversed, they

 will tend to borrow heavily today, in order to finance a higher present con-

surnption. This, of course, is a rational strategy if it is expected that

 (importable) goods in the future will be more expensive, due to the perceived

hike of tariffs. This optimal behavior from a private perspective, however,

may result in excessive (i.e., non—optimal) borrowing from the social point of

view.

             The above discussion suggests that depending on the degree of credi—

bilty a larger availability of foreign funds may either help the adjustment

process -— by making it politically more pallatable as Krueger suggests -—      or
may frustrate the whole experience. However, the degree of credibility --

which is critical for the analysis of the order of,liberalization -— should

not be viewed as an exogenous variable. On the contrary, the strategy

followed during the liberalization process will affect the degree of credibi—

lity. If the economic reforms are pursued in a way such that credibility is

low, agents will not make the required adjustments and the likelihood of

failure of the economic reform will be high. In that sense, a fundamental and

critical aspect of establishing credibiiity is related to the Internal consis—

tency   of the policies being pursued.          In that respect, for example, the

inconsistency of the Argentinian fiscal policy —- which maintained a very

large fiscal deficit —— and the pre—announced exchange rate policy severely

undermined the degree of credibility of the whole reform package.



          2.11 Summary

           In this section the literature on the order of economic liberali-

zation has been reviewed and discussed. The discussion has basically abstrac-

ted from th relationship between liberalization and stabilization (see

however the brief discussion in Section 5 of this paper) and has focused on

different arguments used to suggest a specific ordering for liberalizing the

capital and the current accounts of the balance of payments. It is important

to emphasize that a large part of this literature has asked the following

question: given that the liberalization of the trade account (I.e., the

dismantlement of QR's and reduction of tariffs) is a policy objective, should

the capital account be opened simultaneously, or only after tariffs have been

reduced? In that sense, then, the existing literature has focused on a

narrower question than the one addressed here.

          In this section the arguments that have appeared in the (brief)

literature on the subject were organized into three broad categories:

(a) macroeconomic stability and real exchange rate movements;        (b) welfare

effects of alternative orderings and (c) adjustment costs and assistance.



   On problems of credibility in the context of' anti—inflationary policy see
   Schelling (1982), Taylor (1982) and Fellner (1982).

   See Sjaastad (1983) for an illustration of the degree of inconsistency of
   these policies using an inflation tax view.

            An interesting policy question related to the order of liberalization

advocated by MoKinnon, Frenkel and others —-       "current   account first" -— stems

from the recent Chilean experience. Chile followed almost exactly the

McKlnnon-Frenkel order, liberalizing the trade account first and only after

tariffs had reached their final goal of 10%, partially opening the capital

account. 9_"     However, the Chilean economy recently entered Into the worst

recession in its history with real output declining by 15% in 1982. While a

complete analysis of the Chilean experience is well beyond the scope of the

present paper, .J_"    it   is possible to point out some of the major causes of the

the Chilean crisis. First, the adoption of a fixed exchange rate to the

dollar (In June 1979), at the same time as real wages were fully indexed

created serious policy inconsistencies. The pegging of the peso, in the

presence of massive capital inflows in 1980 and 1981 resulted in a real appre-

ciation of the Chilean peso of almost 30%, which was translated into an

important loss of competitiveness of the tradeables goods sector. This situa-

tion was aggravated by the presence of extremely high real rates of interest
--   partially   generatedby generalized expectations of a large devaluation --,

the woi'ld reöessiOn, and the decline in Chile's terms of trade. The failure
to take corrective policy measures in time aggravated the situation, generat-

ing speculation against the peso, with the consequent loss of international

reserves.




     Mckinnon (1982, p. 159) states that "The correct order of
     liberalization.. .approxirnates the successful Chilean experience after
     1975. Chile is to be treated as a norm or standard of reference."

     On the recent Chilean experience see Harberger (1982), Corbo (1983),
     Edwards (1981, 1985a) and Sjaastad (1983).

         The Chilean experience indicates the macroeconomic management

following a liberalization attempt is much more difficult than what it has

been thought. Also, this case confirms the central role of expectations and

credibility in any major economic reform. If credibility is low, and there

are expectations of policy reversal, it will be very difficult for the reform

to succeed. Since, as it was argued above, expectations and credibility are

largely endogenous, one of the considerations that should be taken into

account when formulating the reform policy is to set the speed and ordering of

the liberalization in a way such that these expectations of reversal will be

low.

         An important problem related to the opening of the capital account,

which has not received the attention it deserves has to do with the level of

foreign indebtedness resulting from the opening process.      The main

question here is to what extent can a liberalization of the capital account

result in a foreign debt crisis because the private sector over—borrows? In

principle, it could be argued that this is unlikely, since the private sector,

which now faces the "correct" signals, will take loans only if the marginal

return obtained from those funds exceeds the cost of the loans. Theoreti-

cally, in the simplest class of models, the free interaction between the




   Of course, this is more easily said than done. The role of policy
   credibility is clearly one or the nore important topics of macroeconomic
   research at the moment. Some early and promising contributions on the
   subject include Taylor (1982), Schelling (1982) and Fellrier (1982).

   Mcklnnon (1973), however, briefly rentions this problem in his taxonomy of
   the successful and unsuccessful Leralization attempts.
                                           —28—




private     domestic sector and the foreign banks will result in an optimal

borrowing/lending strategy. From a practical point of view and in more

sophisticated models, however, there are a number of reasons to believe that

this will not be the case. First, as the recent experience of some Latin—

American countries has shown, the distinction between private and public

foreign debt is highly artificial. Once a country's private sector runs into

debt problems, the government takes over (or is forced to take over) this

private debt.          This   means that to the extent that the private sector knows

that it will be bailed out by the government, the possibility of moral hazard

type of behavior becomes highly likely. Under these circumstances, there will

be an important difference between socially and privately optimal borrowing

strategies, with a tendency on behalf of the private sector to over-borrow.

Second, contrary to the textbook case, even small countries cannot borrow

infinite amounts at "the" given world rate of interest. Quite the contrary,

even small countries face (up to a certain point) upward sloping supplies of

foreign funds, where the Interest rate charged is an increasing function of

the amount borrowed.           This fact also suggests that the private sector will

tend   to   over-borrow once the capital account Is opened. Specifically, there

is an argument for Imposing an optimal tax on borrowing at a rate of

 1/c, where c is the elasticity of supply of foreign funds. And third, If

the private sector expects that the trade reform will be reversed In the




   See, for example, Diaz—Alejandro (1983).

   risk. See also Edwards (19814) and Harberger (1976, 1980).

future (i.e., that tariffs will be raised), they will perceive a very low

consumption     interest   rate (measured     as the   rate at which they can exchange

traded goods between today and tomorrow) today, and will thus tend to increase

its foreign borrowing.              While this is a perfectly optimal strategy from

the private point of view it may not be so             from a social perspective.



3.   Prices and Resource Movements During Capital and Current Account
     Liberal izat ion
             The purpose of      this   section is to set up an analytical framework f or
analyzing     the process of' economic liberalization in a small economy. The
discussion will focus on          two   different aspects of economic liberalization:
(a) the liberalization of foreign trade, and (b) the liberalization of'
capital      flows (i.e., allowing foreign borrowing), and will emphasize price and
resource movements during the liberalization episode. The analysis presented
here is largely positive and develops a model of a simplified economy, with
three goods and two factors. The discussion traces in detail how both reforms
will   affect prices, resource movements and production in the short and long-
run. The analysis is        largely      based on the extension of the Viner—Ricardo
model for the case of three goods as presented by Corden and Neary (1982).
The model used assumes that there is no capital accumulation. For this
reason, the analysis of the effects of opening the capital account is somewhat
simplified, since it assumes that all funds obtained from abroad are used to
increase present consumption. However, the framework presented here can be



       See Dornbusch (l983b) for a discussion on the subject. See also Martin
       and   Selowsky (19814).
                                        —30—



also used to deal with the more general case where capital accumulation is

also allowed.

             The main objective of the analysis presented here is to provide a

clear picture of the real consequences of the process of economic libera—

lization, Including changes in production and in income distribution. At the

risk of being repetitive, the analysis proceeds slowly, trying to make clear

every Important step in the chain of events that follows a liberalization

episode. The model developed In this section shows that as a result of each

of these reforms on their own resources and production will tend to move in

opposite directions. Also the effects on Income distribution of both reforms

will be the opposite. While a trade reform (i.e. the removal of tariffs) will

result In resources moving into the exportables sector; the opening of the

capital account will result in resources moving out of that sector. To the

extent that resource movements involve some costs, this fact suggests that

from a policy perspective some efforts should be made to coordinate the real

effects of the two reforms. A general principle that should be considered

when deterrniing the order of these two reforms in that the (unnecessary)

reversal of reéource movements should be avoided.          Then, the opening of

the two account should be synchronized in a way such that resources do not

move in and out of a sector in a short period of time, since the economy will

incur   an   unnecessary cost.




    In Section II, however, a nore general model that allows for foreign funds
    to be used both to increase present consumption and to accumulate capital
    is presented.

    It is important to note that in the real world this should be only one of'
    the principles used for determining the correct ordering. Others -- not
    mentioned in this section due to the nature of the model -— refer to
    issues related to credibility and continuity of the reform.

        3.1   The Economy Under Consideration

        Assume the case of a small country that produces three goods:

exportables CX), importables (M) and non—tradeables      (N). Production is

carried out using capital arid labor. Production functions have the conven-

tional properties and it is assumed that in the short-run capital is sector—

specific, with labor being perfectly mobile between the three sectors.

         Imports are initially subject to a tariff, and external borrowing is

not allowed. With respect to the labor market, it will be assumed that it is

free of distortions. However, the consequences of assuming the existence of

an economy wide minimum wage, which is binding in the short-run, will also be

investigated. The domestic capital market is free of distortions, with the

rental rates of capital being equalized in the long—run, across sectors.

Regarding factor intensity, it will be assumed that importables have the

highest capital/labor ratio. With respect to exportables and non—tradeables,

alternative assumptions regarding factor intensities will be briefly discussed

in sub—section 3.2.1.

         ! riticai assumption made in this section is that there is no capi-

tal acóumulation and, consequently, one international borrowing is allowed, the

proceeds of foreign loans are fully used to Increase present consumption.

In that sense, then, it is assumed that at the initial point the rate of' time

preference exceeds "the" world rate of interest. The analysis presented




    On sector—specific models see, for example, Jones 1971; Mayer 19714; Mussa
    l97, 1978, 1982; Neary 1978a,b, 1982.

    In that sense, then, this analysis from the possibility of negative
    welfare effects of allowing foreign investment in the presence of'
    tariffs. On this, however, see Section 14 of this paper.
                                         —32-



 here   also assumes that there is no initial inflation, and   that   tariff proceeds

 are returned to consumers in a nondistorting lump—sum fashion. These two

 assumptions represent a simplification of the real world characteristics of

 countries that have embarked in liberalization attempts. As has been pointed

out by Krueger (1981), (1983) and Little (1982), among others, most

liberalization attempts by developing countries have started from crises

situations with high inflation. However, by ignoring inflation in the present

section, it is possible to focus on issues related to liberalization,

abstracting from those of stabilization. On the relationship between stabili-

zation and liberalization, however, see Krueger (1981). See also Section 6 of

this paper.



           3.2 Trade Liberalization

           In this section the effects of reducing (eliminating) tariffs in a

three—goods small economy are     investigated.   It is assumed, for analytical

convenience, that initially there are no quantitative restrictions (or that

they have been already replaced by tariffs), and that the exchange rate is

fixed and equal to one. It is also assumed that capital is sector specific in

the short-run,   while it   can freely move between sectors in the long—run. The

discussion   will first deal with long—run effects, then, the short—run effects
and the transition towards the long-run will be discussed. The analysis will
concentrate   on the   behavior of good prices, factors rewards (i.e., income
distribution) and production. tt ts assumed that while all prices are
flexible   in the long-run, some or tnen (i.e., wages) may he   rigid   in the
short—run.

    3.2.1     LongRun Effects of Trade Liberalization

            In   this class of   models   of a small economy with three goods (import—
ables, exportables      and non—tradeables), two factors (capital arid   labor), and
the usual competition assumptions, long—run domestic prices are fully deter-

mined (under non—specialization) by world prices, technology and tariffs.

Equilibrium can be described in the following way: world prices of export—

ables and importables (plus the tariff) determine the rewards to both factors

of production; these rewards, on their turn and under the assumption of compe-

tition, determine the price of non-tradeables. Demand considerations f or non-

tradeables determine total output of non—tradeables and total factors used In

their production. This leaves a certain amount of factors that Is used in the

production of exportables and Importables In a traditional Hecksher-Ohlln

(11—0) fashion.

         In the rest of the analysis the price of exportables will be taken to

be the numeraire (i.e., P =         1).    Consider now the effect of a reduction

(elimination) of the level of the import tariff on the relative prices of

final goods and on factors rewards. This effect will basically depend on the

assumptions made regarding factor intensities. Two cases will be considered

here: Case 1 assumes (K/L) < (K/L) < (K/L)M; while Case 2 assumes (K/L)N

< (K/L) < (K/L)M.

         Consider first Case 1, where imports are assumed to have the highest.

capital labor ratio with exports having the lowest. The effect of a reduction

of the taritf on factor rewards and the relative price of non—tradeables

can be analyzed using Figure 3.1, which is the dual to the well—known Lerner-

Pearce diagram. The initial equilibrium is given by the Intersection of the
                                       —3±' —




three is000st3 MM, XX and NN. These curves present the cnbinations of
wages and   rental rates of capital that result in a constant   cost of producing
these goods at the existing technology [see Mussa, 1979]. The slopes of these
curves are equal to the capital labor ratio, and as may be seen in Figure 3.1,
correspond to the assumptions of Case 1. Initially equilibrium is obtained

at   A with a wage rate (relative to exports) equal to          and a rental rate

equal to r0.

          The reduction of the Imports tariff will result in a leftward shift

of the MM curve towards M'M'. The reason for this is that now, in order to

rnanitain equilibrium between domestic costs and the world price of' import-

ables, plus the tariff, lower canbinations of wages and rental rates will be

required. New long—run equilibrium will be obtained at B where the new

M'M' curve intersects the XX curve. As the Stolper—Samuelson theorem indi-

cates, the reduction of the import tariff in an economy where exportables are

labor intensive, will result in higher wages and lower rental rates (i.e.,

     > W0, and r1 < r0).

          The new equilibrium point B is below the NN isôcost,indicating

that as a consequence of the tariff reduction the price of non—tradeables in

terms of exportables will nave to fall. This conclusion, of course, will not

hold under Case 2, where non-tradeables are more labor intensive than export-

ables. In that case the intersection of the XX and M'M' curves will be

above the NN curve, and in order to restore equilibrium in the non—

tradeables sector their relative price will have to increase.               In order

to simplify the discussion, through the rest of this paper we will focus on

Case 1, [(K/L) < (K/L), < (K/L)M].

           While the long-run (relative) price of non—tradeables is completely

determined by technological considerations, the amount        produced   of this type

of   goods will also depend on the demand side. In particular, production of

N    will be such that, at    the prevailing prices, the non—tradeables market

clears. The production side of the model can be analyzed using a three goods

Edgeworth—Bowley box as      developed   by Melvin (1968). Figure 3.2 illustrates

the case where exportables are the most labor intensive good. [See Corden and

Neary (1982) for an application of this diagram to a Dutch—disease type of

analysis.] In this diagram       non-tradeables    Isoquants are drawn from origin

      At the Initial prices the non-tradeable goods market clears at a level of

production given by isoquant MN0. The capital—labor ratio in non—tradeables

production   is given by the slope of 0N0M• Production of exportables
measured   from O, and that of importables by distance OMR. In equilibrium
the slope of MN0 Isoquant at °M equals the slopes of the corresponding
isoquants for exportables and importablès, which are tangent at R.
           The discussion regarding factor rewards and relative prices (Figure
3.1) showed that the reduction of the tariff will generate, in the long-run,
an increase in the wage rate relative to the rental rate. That means that all
three sectors will now become more capital intensive. This Is shown in


     Notice then that theoretically depending on the assumptions regarding
     capital-labor intensity the real-exchange rate, defined is the domestic
     relative price of tradeables to non-tradeables may either increase or
     decline.

Figure 3.3, where the dashed rays depict the new (after tariff reduction)

capital/labor ratios. However, in order to determine the new equilibrium it

is necessary to know what will happen to the demand of non-tradeables, as a

consequence of the tariff reduction.

           Assume first, in order to organize the discussion,that the quantity

demanded for non—tradeables does not change after the imports tariffs are

reduced. This assumption will be relaxed later. In this case, the new

equilibrium point in production of non-tradeables will be obtained at the

intersection of the new (higher) capital-labor ratio and the initial NN0

isoquant, at point O. Production of importables will be reduced to OAT,

and   production of exportables will increase to MxT. This result was obtained
under the assumption that the quantity demanded of non—tradeables was not
affected by   the   reduction of tariffs. In general, however, this will not be
the   case. Moreover, given our assumptions regarding capital/labor intensity,

it is expected that the demand f or non—tradeables will increase as a result of

the liberalization. The reasons for this are two: (a) As shown in Figure

3.1, after the liberalization of trade the (relative) price of nori—tradeables

will decline, producing a substitution effect in demand towards non—trade—

ables; and    (b) the trade liberalization will generate a positive incane

effect, as national income at international prices increases, which will also

have a positive effect on the quantity demanded of N. If the demand for non—

tradeables increases, long—run equilibrium in Figure 3.3 will be on the new

capital—labor ratio ray to the left of the NN isocost. In terms of Figure

3.3 this new equilibrium is obtained at O, with production of exportables

being equal to OS, production of imnportables having     been reduced to OS
and production of non—tradeables being equal to

             In   summary,   under Case 1 capital intensity assumptions, the long—run
effects of    a tariff reduction will be:

    (i)       Prices of nori—tradeables, relative to exportables will fall.

    (ii) Wages, relative to all goods, will increase.

    (iii) The rental rate of capital, relative to all goods, will

              decrease.

    (iv) Production of exportables will expand.

       (v)    Production of non—tradeables will expand.

       (vi) Production of Importables will decline.



    3.2.2 Short—Run Effects

             This section investigates the short—run effects of a tariff reduction

under the Case I assumptions about capital labor intensity.               It is assumed

that    in the short—run capital is sector specific, while labor cart move freely

across sections. The representation used in this model, then, is an adapta-

tion for a three goods case of the Virier—Ricardo models of Jones (1971), Mayer

(1974) and Mussa (19714).         [See   the paper by Corden and Neary 1982, for an

application of this kind of model.]

             The initial equilibrium situation can be illustrated using Figure

                  is adapted from Mussa (19714) for the case of the three goods.          In
3.4,    which
this figure, the horizontal axis measures             total   labor available in the

economy, while the vertical axis depicts the wage rate in terms of export—

 ables. LT is the denand for labor by the tradeable goods sectors and is

 equal to the (horizontal) sum of the demand for labor by the exportable sector

 (which is given by              In this rigure) and the demand for labor of the

 icnportables sector.             on the other hand is the demand for labor of the non-
                                          —In —




tradeable    goods sector. The initial equilibrium is characterized, then, by a

wage rate equal to W0, with OTLA labor used in the production of

exportables, LALB labor used in the production of importables and OLB used

in the production of rion—tradeables.

            There are several differences between this short—run model and the

long—run model discussed in the previous sub—section. FIrst, since capital Is

now sector specific, the direct link between tradeable goods prices and fac-

tors rewards is broken. For this reason Stolper—Samuelson theorem does not

hold (in the short—run), and the price of non—tradeables will be determined by

the Intersection of the demand and supply schedules for these kind of goods.

The strategy Is now to analyze the short-run effects of trade liberalization

on prices, production, resource movements and income distribution, (i.e.,

factor rewards). This analysis is then combined with the long—run results

already   discussed in the previous section to find out the characteristics of
the   transition, in a   way similar to that proposed by Peter Neary (1978).
            In   the short run, the reduction of the tariff, under the assumption

of sector—specific fact'ors, will generate changes both In the (relative) price

of importables and non—tradeable (see, for example, Dornbusch 19714, 1980).

While the price of importables will unambiguously fall, the behavior of the

price of non-tradeables will depend on the assumption regarding substitu-

tability and the magnitude or the income effects. Assuming that the three

goods are   gross   substitutes in consumption and production, and that the income

effect does not exceed the substitution effect, it can be shown that as a

result of the reduction of the tarirf' the price of non—tradeables will fall

relative to that of exportables and increase relative to that of importables.

            The reduction in the level of the tariff will reduce the domestic

price of importables, generating a downward shift of the LT curve       (with
the    Lx curve con8tant). In Figure 3—5 the new LT curve will intersect

the LN curve at R. However, this is not a final equilibrium situation,

since, as already discussed the tariff reduction will also result In a decline

in the price of non—tradeables (relative to exports). As a consequence, LN

will shift downward (by less than LT) and final short-run equilibrium will

be achieved at S. In this new equilibrium, production of exportables has

Increased -—    with   labor used by this sector increasing by LALQ. The produc-

tion of non-tradeables may either increase or decrease, and production of

importables will fall. In the case depicted in Figure 3.5 labor has moved out

of irnportables goods sector, into exportables and non—tradeables sectors.

            What has happened to factors rewards in the short—run? Wages have

declined    in terms of the exportable good (from W0 to W1 in Figure 3.5).
Also, wages decline In terms of the non—tradeable good, since the vertical
distance between the LN and            curves is smaller than the reduction of
W from W0 to W1 Esee Mussa 19714]. However, wages increase relative to the
importable good, since the domestIc price of Importables has fallen by more
than wages. In the exportables sector, the rental rate of capital will
increase in terms of all three goods, while the rental rates of the capital
decrease.



      Formally, the rental rate of capital specific to the importable sector
      will decrease in terms of importables, and could either increase or
      decrease In terms of the other two goods. With respect to capital
      specific to the non—tradeables sector, its rental rate will in terms of
      flOn—tradeables, and could either increase or decrease In terms of the
      other two goods.

              The above discussion has a3sumed that all prices (of goods and

factors) are fully flexible. However, this needs not be the case. In a

number of countries the labor market is usually characterized by the existence

of (real) minimum      wages.   It is easy to see from       Figure   3.5 that If wages,

expressed in terms of exportables are inflexibly downward, short—run unemploy-

ment will result as a consequence of the reduction of tariffs. In terms of

Figure      35,   the magnitude of this unemployment will be equal to distance

FG. This unemployment will only be a short—run phenomenon, which will tend to

disappear as capital moves between sectors in the medium and long—run.                     In

general, in the presence of sector specific capital and wage rigidity in the

short-run, there will be a second—best argument for slow trade liberalization

and adjustment assistance. The first—best policy, however, Is to act directly

on the labor market, removing the sources of wage rigidity.

              Under the assumption of wage flexibility, the short-run effect or

trade liberalization on the levels of production can be depicted in Figure

3.6.    The initial (pre—reform) equilibrium is givei by points A and G,

with production of exportables proportional to distance OA, production of

non—tradeables given by iocost N0,           and     production of importables




       See Neary (1982) and Edwards (1982) for discussions regarding trade
       liberalization, sticky wages and unemployment. It i$ interesting to note
       that an effect of this type can be used to analytically derive short—run
       output losses following a trade liberalization process, as is done by Khan
       and Zahler (1983).

       In   the specific case of Chile, the tariff—reform proceeded at the same
       time   as the minimum wage was raised in real terms. Elsewhere I have
       computed that the combination of the         tariff
                                                   reduction process and the
       increase In the minimum wage in Chile resulted in an increase in the rate
       of unemployment in Chile of approximately —- percentage points. See
       Edwards (1982).

proportional to distance GA. Notice that Initially the nontradeable goods
sector uses    ONKN capital, the exportables sector uses OK capital, and

the importables will use the rest (KNKx). Since in        the   short—run capital is

sector specific these amounts   of   capital will also be used by each sector

after the tariff reform. This means that the new short-run equilibrium points

will necessarily lay on the KNKN and KK          lines.
           The tariff reduction will result in an increase in the use of labor

(and thus in production, for given amounts of capital) in the exportables and

importables sectors. This is shown in Figure 3.6 by the movement of the

equilibrium points to B and F. The new capital—labor ratios are now given

by the dashed lines, and as may be seen both the exportable and nontradeable

sectors become relatively more labor intensive, while the importables sector

has become more capital intensive. A comparison of Figures 3.3 and 3.6

provides some indication on how the transition period will look like, with

factors moving from their post—reform short—run allocation (Figure 3.6)

towards thair long-run post-reform allocation (Figure 3.7).

           In summary, for the general case with wage flexibility, the short-run

effects of a tariff redubtiori on production, prices, arid factors rewards are

the following:

    (i)     Production of exportables increases.

    (ii)    Production of importables is reduced.

    (iii) Production of nontradeables increases.

    (iv)    Wages increase in terms of importables, and decline in      terms   of
            exportables and nontradeables

    (v)     The rental rate of capital in the exportable sector
            increases relative to all goods.
                                       —147




   (vi)    The rental rate of capital in the irnportables sector will decrease
           relative to the importable good. It could increase or decrease
           relative to the other goods.

   (vii) The rental rate of capital in the non-tradeables sector will
          increase relative to non—tradeable goods, and could either increase
          or decrease relative to the other two goods.


   3.2.3 The Transition Period After aTradeLibera1i
          According to the model used in this section the main difference

between short— and long-run effects of a trade liberalization is that In the

short-run capital IS   locked into Its sector of origIn. As time passes,
however, capital will (slowly) move between sectors.    In the present model,

and in order to simplify the exposition, we assume that the movement of

capital does not require the use of resources. However, the analysis could be

modified by introducing a "moving industry", which uses labor and some

specific factor, as In Mussa [1978].

          The transition period will, be basically characterized by factors

(both capital and labor) moving between sectors, until the new long-run
                                                        ratios and levels of
equilibrium (i.e., post-liberalization) capital—labor

production are attained. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, and as may be seen

from Figure 3.3, in the final long—run equilibrium all sectors will be more

capital—intensive, with the exportable sector using more capital, in absolute

terms; and with the importable sector using less capital in absolute terms

than prior to the trade reform. As may be also seen from Figure 3.3, the non-

tradeable goods sector could use either a larger or small absolute amount of

capital than before the tariffs reduction.    Th.e nature of factors movements

during the transition period cn be seen in Figure 3.7, which combines Figures

 3.3 and 3.6. Initial (i.e., pre-1,iberalizatlOn) equilibrium is given by

points A and G. Short—run equilibrium is given by points             B and F; while

long-run equilibrium will be attained in points       H   and   C.   In order to avoid

cluttering the diagram, only the post—liberalization capital—labor ratios have

been drawn. The arrows between points B and C and F and H, respect-

ively, show the way resources will move during the transition. As may be seen

in Figure 3.7, for the particular case considered here, the transition will be

characterized by:

       (I)      Capital and labor will move out of the importable goods sector;

       (ii)     Capital and labor will move into the exportable goods    sector;
       (iii) Capital will move into the r'iontradeable goods sector, and
              labor will move out of the nontradeable goods sector.

              Table 3.1 summarizes the movement of resources that follows a trade

liberalization. Column (1) depicts the movement of resources in the short—

run.     Column (2) shows how resources move in the long—run, when compared with
the    initial situation. This column is a summary of the situation described in

the Melvin—Edgeworth-BoWly box in Figure 3.3. Finally, in column (3) the

movement of resources during the transition period' is presented.

              An important question that has not been discussed yet is related to

the timing of these prices and resources movements. Broadly speaking, it

would be expected that following a eariff reduction some time would pass

before       goods arbitrage will result in relative prices adjustments. In that
sense    the initial effect of tariff reductions on resource movements will not

be instantaneous.           On the other hand, it is difficult to know a priori,



       From a practical point of view there are a number of considerations, like
       the creation of the required infrastructure to increase imports, that tend
       to indicate that the actual reduction in domestic prices will take more
       time.

how fast the adjustment process between the short— and long—run will take.

This is largely an empirical question whose answer will require country—

specific analyses.

         3.3 The Liberalization of the Capital Account

         In this sub—section the model presented above is used to investigate

how the opening of the capital account (only) will affect relative prices,

income distribution, production and resource movements. The analysis assumes

that the icnportables sector is subject to a tariff and that the world relative

price of exportables and importables is constant, so that these two goods can

be aggregated into a single tradeable good.

         It is clear that the framework used in this section (a 3 goods—2

factors model) is not the most appropriate one to deal with intertemporal

problems related to the financial sector, as those generated by the opening of

the capital account. However, this model is still rich enough to allow us to

investigate how the opening of the capital account will affect the real side

of the economy.      In order to do this, an approach similar to that

suggested by McKinnon 11976] for analyzing a transfer related adjustment is

used.. 1t is assumed that prior to the bpening of the capital account the

domestic rate of time preferences exceeds the world rate of interest. This

means that once the capital account is opened, domestic agents will borrow

from abroad in order to increase present consumption. It is further assumed

that all of the foreign funds   obtained,   once the capital account is opened are



    Ideally one would want a fully specified multi-period general equilibrium
    model of both the real and financial sectors of the economy. Clearly,
    however, a model of this kind is not analytically tractable. An
    alternative way to tackle the problem of the opening of the capital
    account is to use a simulation fr'amework as in Khari and Zahier (1983).

used to increase present consumption. 21"    Even though this is not a very

realistic assumption, it simplifies the exposition. The case where the funds

obtained   when the capital account are used to increase investment is discussed

in the next section. The discussion will then focus on the adjustment problem

created by the inflow of foreign capital that will follow the opening of the

capital account.

           The analysis presented in this section assumes that once the capital

account is opened, foreign capital will flow into the domestic economy at a

stable rate for some time. This means that during a certaIn perIod of time

expenditure will exceed income and foreign debt will be accumulated.          For

expositional convenience this discussion does not deal specifically with the

following stage, where the foreign debt has to be paid. However, the analytical

tools developed here can easily handle this stage of the problem.    It is

possible to say, then, that in this section the time horizon for the analysis

has been broken into three distinct runs: the short—run, characterized by

positive foreign borrowing, and sector—specific capital; the long—run, where

there still is a positive inflow of foreign funds, but where capital can move

between sectors; and the long-lonrufl (nQt specifically considered), where the

foreign debt begins to be repaid.



21'   We abstract, then, from the issues related to welfare reducing investment
      discussed in Section 2.2. See, however, Section 14

      This idea responds to the notion, developed by Fischer and Frenkel (1972a,
      l972b) among others, that there are stages of the different accounts of
      the balance of payments through which contries pass. In that sense, then,
      we assume that our country is in the. stage of development where foreign
      debt is accumulated.

      Of course, once the foreign debt has to be repaid the analysis will be
      similar to what is discussed here, in the sense that a distinction between
      the period when capital is sector-specific and when it can move across
      sectors has to be made.
                                      —514—




          The basic effect of opening the capital account is that expenditure

will exceed income during some period of time. In order to simplify the

discussion the core of this sub—section assumes that the amount by which
expenditure exceeds income (i.e., the current account deficit) is
                                                                  the same in
every period. However, the case where there is an initial overshooting of the
level   of capital inflows, as discussed in Section 2.2, is also briefly

investigated. The relevance of this latter case stems from the fact that it

has generally been observed that following an opening of the capital account

there is a jump, and consequent reduction (i.e., an overshooting), of the

level of capital inflows (for example, Korea 1965; Chile 1980; Argentina 1978;

Uruguay 1979).



    3.3.1 Long—Run Effects

           In the long—run -— when capital can move between sectors --   relative
prices of the three goods are completely given by world prices, technology and

the tariff [see the discussion in Section 11.2].       For this reason, in the

present model the opening of the capital account will have no long-run effect

on relative prices of gooçls or factors. However, to the extent that a

fraction of the new funds obtained from abroad are used to finance a higher'

consumption of non-tradeables, the production of these goods will increase.

Since a higher production of N, requires an increase in the amount of




    However, as will be discussed below, in the short—run there will be
    changes on relative prices, generated by demand effects.

resources used in that sector, production of the two tradeable goods will have

to decline. The long-run effects of the opening of the capital account on

production can be summarized in Figure 3.8, which is a by—now familiar Melvin—

Edgeworth-Bowley box. The initial equilibrium conditions are summarized by

points G and A. Since in the long-run the opening of the capital account

has no effect on relative prices or factors rewards, the original capital—

labor   ratios   are   not   altered. The increase in the demand    for   nontradeables,

however, requIres a hIgher        production of thIs   type   of goods. The expansIon   of

the nontradeable goods sector will then take place along the original capital

labor ratio ONG, with new (after liberalization) production of nontradeables

proportional to distance OMG, and given by isoquant NM1; new production

of exportables will be proportional to distance XA'; and              new production of
importables      will be proportional to distance G'A'. It can then be seen that

the long—run effects of opening the capital account will be the



    (i)    Production of nontradeables will Increase, with capital and labor
           moving into this sector.
    (ii) Production of importables will decrease, with capital and labor
          moving out of this sector.
    (iii) Production of exportables will decrease, with capital and labor
           moving out of this sector.
    (iv) Prices of goods and factors will not be altered.

    3.3.2 The Short—Run Effects
           In the short-run, however,      capital   will be sector—specific, and the
increase in the demand for riontradeable goods will be reflected in an increase
                                     —57—




of their relative price.      The short—run effects of a capital inflow on

production can be summarized in a Salter—type diagram, as used by MoKinnon

[1976] in his analysis of transfers and the adjustment problem. In Figure

3.9, the importable and exportable goods have been aggregated into a composite

tradeables good. TT is the (short—run) production possibilities curve between

tradeables and nontradeables and has been constructed under the assumption

that when relative prices change only labor can move between sectors. Initial

equilibrium is attained at point Q, with the trade account being equal to

zero, and the nontradeable goods market in equilibrium. The inflow of capital

that takes place after the opening of the capital account has the property of

allowing the consumption possibilities schedule to exceed the production

possibilities frontier. The new consumption possibilities schedule is equal

to NT, which exceeds TT by the amount of the capital inflow, measured in

terms of tradeables [see McKinnon 1976, and Datta 1983].

          After the opening of the capital account, and assuming that OE is

the income—expenditure path corresponding to the initial relative price,

consumption will tend to move to S, while production will remain at Q.

However, at this point there wilt be an excess demand for nontradeables

goods. As a result of this, the relative price of riontradeables will increase

until   a new equilibrium situation, characterized by points R (consumption)

and T (production) is attained. In this new equilibrium there is a current

account deficit, and the non-tradeab1- goods market is in equilibrium. We can

see,   then, that in the short—run the opening of the capital account will

result in an increase of the relative price of nontradeables relative to

tradeables ——    this   is the real appreciation effect of opening the capital

account pointed out by several authors, and discussed in Section 2.1.            The

production of nontradeables will increase from N0 to N1, and the produc-

tion of tradeables will decline from T0 to T1 in Figure 3.9.

           We can now translate the short—run effects of opening the capital

account into a Melvin-Edgeworth-Bowley box. This will prove to be useful f or

the analysis of the transition. Figure 3.10 summarizes the short—run effects

of opening the capital account.       Initial equilibrium conditions are given by

points G and A. Once the capital account is opened, expenditure will

exceed   income, with production of nontradeables increasing    and that of import-

ables and exportables decreasing. New (short-run) equilibrium is attained        at
points    H and G, which, by definition, are characterized by the fact that

the same amount of capital is used in each sector as prior to the liberali-

zation process. However in order to increase its putput, the nori—tradeables

sector becomes more labor intensive; while both tradeables sectors become more
                                      -

capital intensive.

           In   the short-run the wage rate increase in terms of both tradeable

goods and declines in terms of non-tradeables. The return to capital specific

to the rion—tradeables sector goes up in terms of all goods, while the return

to capital in the two non-tradeable goods declines.



       See McKinnon (1973, 1976, 1982), Harberger (1982), Diaz—Alejandro (1981),
       Harberger and Edwards (1982), Oline (1983), Edwards (19814).

       This can be seen by following an analysis similar to that presented in
       Figure 3.6.

           In   summary, the short—run effects of the opening of the capital

account are the following:

(1)      Relative price of nontradeables increases in terms of both tradeable
         goods.

(ii)     Production of nontradeables increases.

(iii) Production of both nontradeables decline.

(iv)     The wage rate increases in terms of both nontradeables and declines in
         terms of the nontradeable.

Cv)      The rental rate of capital in both tradeable goods sectors declines,
         in terms of all goods.

(vi)     The return to capital in the nontradeable goods sector goes up in terms
         of all goods.


       3.3.3 Transition

           As in the case of the trade liberalization, the transition will be

characterized by resources moving from their short—run equilibrium (Figure

3.10) towards their long—run equilibrium (Figure 3.8). As before, the best

way to look at these resource novements is by combining the short— and long—

run diagrams. This is done in Figure 3.11. In this diagram A and G are

initial (i.e., pre—liberalization) equilibrium points; H and B depict the

short—run equilibrium after liberalization; and A' and G' are the long—run

post-liberalization equilibrium points. It may be noted that in Figure 3.11

the final equilibrium level of production of N, given by isoquant NN1           (G')

exceeds short—run level of production (given by the isoquarit that passes

through point H). The reason for this result is that while the income effect

——
      stemming from the higher absorption allowed by the opening of the capital
account ——      is   by assumption the same in the short- and long—run, the relative

price   of nontradeables is higher in the short—run. Consequently the equili-

brium level of production of non—tradeables will be higher in the long—

run. .-_"   If,   however, it is assumed that in the short—run the level of

capital inflows will overshoot their long—run levels, the result will be

somewhat different [see Figure 3.12 below].

            Under the present assumptions --   that   the current account deficit is

the   same in short- and long-run -— the transition will be characterized by
resources moving from H to G' and from B to A' in Figure 3.11.
Capital and labor will move into the nontradeables sector and out of both
tradeable sectors. The production of nontradeables will further expand during
the transition, with     the production of both tradeables declining. Table 3.2

presents a summary of the short- and long—run resource movements that will

follow   an opening of the capital account, under the maintained assumptions.
This table is equivalent to Table 3.1 constructed for the case of the trade
reform   only. A comparison of both tables shows that both reforms, on their

own, will tend to generate opposite movement of resources.         This fact, of

course, is reflected by the fact that the real exchange rate will tend to move

in opposite directions under each reform.

            At this point, it is important to recall some of the critical assump-

tions that have been made for this exercise. First, it was assumed that as a

consequence of the opening of the capital account, capital would flow into the

domestic country, allowing absorption to exceed income. It was         further


      The reason for this is that while in both cases (short— and long—run) the
      demand curve for non-tradeables will shift to the right by the same
      amount, the supply curve is more elastic in the long—run. Thus, the
      equilibrium output of non-tradeables will be higher in the long—run.
                                          —6 —




assumed   that this situation was sustainable for a (fairly) long period of
time,   and that all   the funds   obtained   from abroad were   channeled into addi-

tional consumption. In that sense in this section the time horizon of the

analysis was broken into three distinct lengths. The short-run, characterized

by a positive foreign borrowing (absorption > income), and by capital being

sector specific. The long—run, where there also is positive borrowing

(absorption > income) but where capital can move between sectors; and the

long-long—run when the foreign debt has to be paid.          It was assumed that the

long-long-run takes place in the (distant) future, and was not analyzed.

           A second important assumption made here is that once the capital

account is opened a stable inflow of foreign capital takes place.            In that

sense, the possibility of an overshooting of the level of capital flows was

ignored. This is not an innocent simplification, since, as has            been

mentioned, the stylized facts indicate that generally following the opening of

the capital account there is an initial jump in the level of capital

inflows. If such a behavior of capital flows was allowed, the analysis

presented here will change with more resources moving into the rioritradeable

goods sector into the short—run. This case is presented in Figure 3.12, where

short-run production of non-tradeables --         given by isoquant NN2 —- exceeds
long—run production of this kind of goods (given by isoquarit NN1).              In this

case the transition will differ from our previous analysis.            As may be seen in

Figure 3.12, in this case while capital will move into the nontradeable

sector, labor will move out of the non-tradeable goods sector during the

 transition.

            A critical question related to he effects of opening the capital

 account of the balance of payments has to do with the speed at which these

price and resource movements will take place. In general -- and as has been

emphasized by Frenkel [1982, 1983] ——     it    is expected that the inflow of

capital following the opening of the capital account will be fast. In that

case then, it is expected that the short—run consequences of liberalizing this

account of the balance of payments -—     in    particular the increase of the

relative price of N and the tendency for labor to move into this sector ——

will   be felt quickly. In fact, as will be argued below, and has been

suggested by Frenkel [1983], the difference in the speed of adjustment of the

capital and current account suggests that an appropriate order will consider

opening the current    account   first. It will also be argued that the capital

account   should be opened slowly, following a multi—stage procedure.


       3.4 Summary
           This   section has presented a three-goods two—factors model to analyze

the real effects -— i.e., production and income distribution effeäts -— of the
liberalization of the current and capital account of the balance of payments.

The analysis presented provided details on the characteristics of these

processes,   comfirmirig prior conjectures: each reform on its own will result

in opposite effects on resource movements and incc*ne distribution.

           Abandoning the sphere of positive analysis, a critical question at

this stage is If there is anything to be learned regarding the appropriate

order of liberalization from this liscussion? The answer to this question is

a qualified yes. To the extent that in the real world resource movements

across sectors are costly, there Ls i r'eason to try to avoid "unnecessary"
                                        —67—




shifts   in resources.       A possible instance where these kind of costs will

occur will emerge if, for example, due to a given policy labor and capital

move out of the exports sector, and shortly afterwards, due to a different

policy labor and   capital   have to move back into this sector. These

"unnecessary" adjustment     costs could be avoided if resources are directly
reallocated into their final sectors of use. This could be        achieved by


syiachronizirt
                 the openings of the capital and current accounts as has been
suggested by Frenkel (1983), At this point it could be argued that the
principles
           of reducing the adjustment costs would call for a simultaneous
opening   of both accounts. In this case, the argument would go, resources

would move directly into their final sectors without "unnecessary" switches.

The problem with this reasoning, however, is that it implicitly assumes that

the adjustment process following the opening of these accounts is equally

fast. If however, this is not the case, and the adjustment of the capital

account is faster —— as Frenkel 1982, 1983, Khan and Zahier (1983) and others

have suggested ——    the simultaneous opening of both accounts will result in
resources moving first into the non-tradeable goods        sector and out   of


exportables and importables. In      dthe.r   words, if both accounts are opened

simultaneously, in the short-run the capital account effects will tend to

dominate. If the capital account adjusts faster,             the avoidance of




     A possible way to model moving costs is through the existence of a "moving
     sector" as in Mussa (1978).

     In terms of this model a faster adjustment of the capital account means
     that interest arbitrage is faster than good arbitrage, and that
     immediately following the opening of the capital account resources will be
     borrowed and absorption will exceed absorption. On the other hand,
     following trade reform some time will pass befOre goods arbitrage will
     result in resource investment.

"unnecessary" adjustment costs, and the synchronization of both effects would
be obtained    following the order of liberalization suggested by Jacob Frenkel

(1982, 1983): the current account should be opened first, and only when this

is open should restrictions on capital movements be restricted.



1L   Welfare Implications of   Opening The Capital Account In the   Presence of
     Trade   Distortions

             As discussed in Section 2 above, one of the arguments that has been

used to suggest that the trade account should be liberalized first Is that if

capital inflows are allowed In the presence of trade distortions (i.e.,

tariffs) welfare losses will result [McKinnon 1973; Frenkel 1982, 1983;

Krueger 1983]. In this section this proposition is investigated in detail

using a multi—period general equilibrium model of a small open economy.

First we investigate the welfare effects of allowing foreign borrowing in an

economy without trade distortions. The results obtained are, of course, the

standard ones: welfare will increase if prior to the liberalization of the

capital account the domestic consumption rate of interest exceeds the world

rate of interest. Next we introduce tariffs into the picture and investigate

the welfare effects of opening up the capital account in the presence of trade

distortions. The analysis shows, as it was      suggested   in Section 2.2, that the

welfare effects of opening the capital account will depend on how the funds

obtained     are used. If these resources are used to increase present consurnp

tion, and the domestic consumption rate of interest exceeds the world rate of




JJ' Much of the discussion in this section draws from Section 3.1 of a joint
    paper with Sweder van Wijnbergen. See Edwards and Van Wijnbergefl (1983).
                                        —70—



interest, the opening of the capital account can never be welfare deteriorat-

ing. If, however, these funds are     used   to finance capital accumulation,

welfare may deteriorate as long as the importable goods is capital intensive.

As   discussed   in Section 2.2, this is a direct extension of the literature on

welfare—reducing    capital accumulation in a static framework.
           An important question regarding this line of argument is the
following: Why would the resources borrowed from abroad be used to accumulate
capital,   if society's welfare will be reduced? The answer is     that, while
socially   capital accumulation might be immiserizing (since it increases a pre-

existing distortion), privately it may be profitable. Indeed this will be the

case since, under the assumptions of capital intensive importables, due to the

presence of tariffs the marginal product of capital in the domestic country

will exceed the world marginal product of capital [Stolper and Samuelson

l9'3]. It is also possible to show that If shadow prices are used to make

investment decisions the opening of the capital account can never result in

welfare reductions [Edwards and van Wljribergen, 1983].




           14,] ii! Model

           The model assumes a two—period world where total welfare depends on

the levels of utility obtained in periods 1 and      2 respectively.   If foreign

borrowing is not allowed, in each period the budget constraint has to hold,




      See, for example, Johnson (1967), Bertrand and Flatters (1971) and Brecher
      and Diaz-Alejandro (1977).
                                          —71 —




with   total expenditures being equal to total revenues. In this section a

general version of the model (with trade distortions) is presented. In

Section 14.2 the welfare effects of opening the capital account (i.e., allowing

a small amount of foreign borrowing) is investigated under the simplifying

assumption     of no—trade distortions. In Section    14.3 the assumption of trade

distortions     are reintroduced into the analysis.
             It is assumed that there are two goods in the economy CX     and    Y).

Good X is taken to be the numeraire and is assumed to be the exportable
(i.e., the labor intensive good). It is also assumed that prior to opening

the    capital account the domestic consumption rate of interest exceeds the

world rate of' iriteres (r*). The essentials of the model, under the assump-

tion that foreign borrowing is forbidden are presented in equations        (14.1)


through (14.8), where throughout the analysis a super index I        refers to the

ith period. [For analyses using this kind of' model see, for example, Svensson

and Razin 1983; Van Wljnbergen 19814; and Edwards and van Wijnbergen

1983]. .12/




fi2! In     some sense the effect3 of opening the capital account can be analyzed
       as   a two—way transfer, where the domestic country receives a transfer in
       the first period   and   gives a (1rger) transfer in the second period.

      in trade analysis. See Mussa (147) for a geometric exposition.

equal to unitary expenditure functions. .11!' Equation (14.6) establishes that

the domestic relative price of the inportable (Pr) is equal to the world

price (F) plus a tariff r.                        Notice that by (14.6) we are assuming that

greatly simplifies the exposition, it is not essential for the results

obtained [see Edwards and Van Wijnbergen 1983, for a similar discussion where

the domestic price               declines in period 2 due to the reduction of the level

                 This equation captures the assumption of a closed capital
respectively.

account, since it indicates that total revenues

function R plus tariff collection iM —- has        to   equal total expenditure in

each period. If on the other hand a fully open capital account is assumed

equations (11.7) would be replaced by a single intertemporal budget cons-

traint. .1?-"   Equation (11.8) defines the level of imports In every period.
Total imports are equal to the difference between the quantities demanded and

supplied of good y in each period.
          One of the simplifying assumptions of the model is that prior to the

opening of the capital account there is no capital accumulation in the economy

                 0). However, it is assumed that when the capital account is
(i.e., dK1
opened domestic firms can     borrow abroad and use the proceeds of these loans to
increase their capital stock. While this is clearly a simplifying assumption

it allows us to focus on the essentials.



           11.2 Opening the Capital Account in the Absence of Trade Distortions

           Assume, in order to simplify the discUssiOrl and to set up the general

analytical framework, that tariffs are equal to zero:       t   = 0.   Consider now

 that a small amount of foreign borrowing is allowed, and that the proceeds of

 this loan are   used   to increase present consumption. Analytically we assume




     See van Wijnbergen (19811) for example., and Edwards and van Wijnbergen
     (1983).

     However, It is possible to interpret the results presented here as
     resulting from an increment in the rate of capital accumulation, which is
     made possible b the opening of the capital account.
                                              —711—




that    the loan is in terms of the numeraire good. However, under the assuinp-
tion of an open economy, domestic agents will obtain the desired consumption

bundle through international exchange [see Dixit and Norman, 1980].

           Under the present assumptions, the opening of the capital account

will imply that consumption will increase             in period 1 by the   amount of   the
loan,   and will decrease in period 2, by a larger amount, since principal plus

interest have to be paid in that period. The effects of this operation on the

levels of utility in periods 1 and 2 can be found by totally differentiating

equation (11.7). The effect of opening the capital account on total welfare

(W) is then found by totally differentiating equation (4.1) and by then

inserting the results for dU1 and dU2.

            The changes in utility in periods 1 and 2 are given by expressions

(4.9) and (4.10) respectively where dB is the amount borrowed in period 1,

which is fully used to increase present consumption, and where r* is the

world rate of interest.



                      dU1 =               dB > 0                                         ('4.9)
                               (l/E11)
                                   U

and
                      dU2 =   — [(l+r*)/E22]       dB < 0                               (4.10)
                                              U

            The total effect on welfare of allowing (some) foreign borrowing is

then obtained by totally differentiating equation (1Ll), and by using (4.3),

(4.9), and (4.10).

                      dW =    [1   —   (l+r*)X]   (3W/1113U1) dB                        (14.11)

                          (3W/IiU3')
is   equal to the inverse of one plus the consumption rate of interest In the

domestic country (1 + CR1).            Under the assumption of closed, capital

account, assuming that intertemporal substitutions is not allowed, the

consumption   rate of   interest will exceed the world rate of interest r*.

Consequently,    (1 + r*)A   < 1 and In equation (i.ll)
                          >0                                                        ('1.11')


           The opening of the capital account will be welfare improving. Of

course, if prior to the opening of the capital account present consumption was

"too high" in the domestic economy X(l+r*) will be smaller than one.                 In

this case, however, the opening of the capital account will still be welfare

improving since once it Is opened the domestic country will lend in the world

market! In that case (.ll) would be dW              [(l+r*)A -   1] (3W/fl1aU1)dB. Of

course, what generates an improvement in welfare is to allow (some) Inter—

temporal substitution of consumption, which was         previously   banned.

           Assume now that once the capital account is opened, the proceeds from

the foreigri loans are used to    increase 'capital accumulation in the domestic
country   (i.e., machines are Imported). This will allow the economy           to
increase production in period i. J—!        In    period 2, however, the loan has to be

paid. In order to simplify the discussion it will be assumed, at his stage of




.IJ See, for example the discussion in Svenssori and Razin (1983, p. 109-
      110). See also Van rJijnbergen (19814).

      It is assumed that capital begins producing in the same period it is
      installed. Alternatively it could be assumed that there was a one period
      lag. The'results will remain essentially the same, however.

the analysis, that the loan is also paid in the form of machines (i.e.,

disinvestment takes place in the second period).

          Totally differentiating (4.7), and             ('Li)   the following expression,

very similar to (4.11), is found —— where           RK, the partial derivative of the

revenue function in respect to the stock of capital and is equal to the

domestic marginal productivity of capital [see Dixit and Norman (1980)]:

                      dW =   [1   —   (l+r)A]   (3W/ItlU1)RK dK                         (4.12)


           As may be seen, also in this case if the consumptIon rate of Interest

exceeds the world interest rate (i.e.,            (1 +    r*)A   < 1) the opening of the

capital account -— where the proceeds from the loan are used to accumulate

capital -—   will   be welfare improving (i.e., dW/dK > 0). The main difference

between (4.12) and (4.11) is that instead of dB we now have RKdK.                     This

last term, of course, represents the increase in national income in period 1,

in terms of the numeraire good, resulting from an increase in the stock of

capital   equal   to dK. From the comparison of (4.11) and (4.12)                it follows
that   to the extent that the price of machines in terms of the numeraire good,
(i.e., Tobin's "q") is equal to (1/RK) it Is indifferent whether once
foreign borrowing is allowed the resources obtained from                abroad   are used to
add one machine to the stock of capital or directly to increase present
consumption. 21! As will be shown in Section 4.3 below this is not the case
once   trade distortions are allowed into the picture. the reason for this is

that, while in the presence of trade distortions, the private price of

       present problem in a way such th3t        the loan is paid in the form of goods,
       and notof machines. The resul.ti,         however, are exactly the same as those
       presented here.

machines is still (l/RK), from               a   social perspective this price is lower arid


could   even be negative.



           It.3 The   Opening     of the Capital Account               in the Presence of Trade
            Distortions

           In this section it is assumed                that there is a tariff on the import of
good y      (i.e.,    t   > 0),   and   the welfare effect of opening the capital

account is investigated.          Following           last section's strategy It          is first


ass timed that the proceeds from         the foreign loan are             used      exclusively to
Increase    present   consumption.
            Assume, as before, that the world rate of interest is                         equal to r*.

As in the previous case, consider first what happens when the proceeds from
                                                    consumption. The effects
the foreign loan are fully used to increase present

on each period's utility of a loan obtained in period
                                                      1 and repaid (with an
interest equal to r*) in period 2 is now given by                             (14.13) and (14.114):

                                                    d )}
 and

from changes in real income.12! Since tdEy is smaller than one, (14.12) will
be positive and (14.13) negative..2! As before, the effect on total welfare is

found by totally differentiating (14.1) and using (14.13) and (14.1i4).              The

result obtained is:

                                                               1
                         dW =    El — (l+r*)A] (3W/rfU1)    1 —        )   dB              (14.15)



which under our assumptions of X(1+r*) < 1 is greater than zero. That means

that In the presence of trade restrictions allowing foreign-borrowing to

increase present consumption is still welfare improving.

             Assume now that the private sector uses the proceeds of the foreign

loans to increase its stock of capital. That would be the case if                   the   (world)

price    of a machine, in terms of the numeraire good is equal or lower than

 (l/RK).      Assume in   order to simplify the exposition that this price is
exactly equal to (l/RK). In this case the welfare effect of opening the

capital account, under the assumption that the loan is also paid in •the form

of machines, will be given by equation (14.16):




12.!   In   order to derive (5.12) and (5.13) the following property was used: dEy
            =       See Dixit and Norman (1980, p. 62).


       This statement can be proven in the following way: Py                    is the
       marginal propensity to spend on y and consequently smaller than one.
       Also, since Py > t         it   follows that (PydEy) (fr—)   = dEyt   < 1.

       Thus (1 —          > 1.

where R1, 1<   is a Rybczynski term that captures the effect of capital

regarding factors proportions ——       the importable good y is capital intenzive
in our developing economy -—
                                   RyK   > o

          Equation (14.16) is interesting for several reasons. First, as may be

seen it can be either positive or negative. It can be negative even If the

world rate of interest Is below the consumption rate of Interest [I.e.,

(l+r*)X < 1]. This will be the case if              < rR K     This is nothing else

than the Johnson [1967] condition f or imrniserizing capital accumulation. 8

          Intuitively the possibility that the opening of the capital account

will result in a welfare loss Is easy to explain. Under the presence of

tariffs there will be a difference between the private and social marginal

productivities of capital. While the private marginal productivity of capital

is K (as it was in the absence of tariffs), its social marginal If shadow

prices are used to make investment decisions this welfare reducing effect of

opening the capital account in the presence of trade distortions will not

arise [Edwards and van Wljnbergen 1983]. Productivity Is (RK -
                                                                         TRPK).
                                                                                    !
   It   is interesting to note that, contrary to the Brecher—Diaz—Alejandro
    (1977) one—period analysis on foreign investment, if              > tR K capital
   accumulation cannot be immenserizing even if r* = RK. The reson for
   this is that in the present intertemporal framework the important
   comparison   is between r* and the consumption rate of           interest, and not
   between        and r*.
   An alternative way of looking at this is comparing RK evaluated at
   domestic tariff inclusive prices, and evaluated at world prices. It is
   easy to show that this last expression will be equal to (RK —
                                                                               y
                                            —80—




The reason for this is that capital accumulation will result in lower total

imports and thus lower tariffs collection (term         tM in equation 14.1). It is

possible then that the negative effect on welfare of the reduction of tariffs

collections will generate an      overall   welfare reduction. This is a typical

second   best type of argument that indicates that reducing some distortions
only can result in     total   welfare being reduced. Of   course,   if   shadow   prices
are   used to make investment decisions this welfare reducing effect of opening

the capital account in the presence of trade distortions will not arise

[Edwards and van Wijnbergeri 1983].




5.    Summary and Concluding Remarks

           In   this paper I have surveyed some of the most important issues

related   to the order of liberalization of the current and capital accounts            of

the   balance of payments. This topic has recently attracted considerable
attention   both from academic and policy—oriented circles. From a theoretical

point of view the question of the appropriate order of liberalization is only

relevant in a world with some kind of adjustment costs, market imperfections

and/or externalities.       If, on   the contr4ary, a textbook economy free of

imperfections is assumed, the answer to this question becomes trivial: both

accounts of the balance of payments should be liberalized simultaneously and

instantaneously.       However, there are a number of   reasons, both economic and

political,      why a simultaneous arid instantaneous liberalization might not be
feasible. In this context, then, the question regarding         the order of libera-

lization becomes important.
                                         —81—




          The problem of the order of liberalization of the current and capital

accounts of the balance of payments has become more interesting in light of

the recent experience of a group of countries from the Cone of South America
                                                                                    -—
(Argentina, Chile and Uruguay). These countries followed opposite orders

Argentina   and Uruguay opened the capital account first, while Chile opened the

current   account first—— with a common fate in the     early   l980s: deep economic
recession   and (partial) reversal of the      liberalization attempt. This
Southern-Cone   experience has triggered greater concern on the issue of the

adequate order of liberalization. At the present time there are no definite

answers regarding these experiences and more research on the subject should be

encouraged.

            The present paper has focused exclusively on the analysis of some

aspects of the order of liberalization of the capital and current accounts of

the balance of payments. However, there are        a number of   important issues

related   to a broadly defined liberalization process that deserve to be briefly
mentioned.     There are four major   issues   related to these reforms: First, if a

liberalization will not fully eliminate all distortions, the question of

welfare effects of partial reforms will become critical. Even though from a

second—best perspective almost anything, in terms of welfare, can happen as a

consequence of a partial reform, there are well founded conjectures that the

liberalization of some    markets   only will be welfare improving. .i"     Second,

the question of the speed of liberalization is also Important. In the absence

of market imperfections and/or exterrtalities, markets should be liberalized

very quickly (now). If externaUties are present, however, and the first best

policies to deal with them are   not   available, a gradual liberalization might

be called for.!! Third, the relationship between liberalization and

stabilization is crucial to understand the success or failure of liberaliza-

tion reforms, since most liberalization attempts have been undertaken in con-

junction   with major stabilization programs.          The reason for this is that,
in   the first place, the initial Imposition of restrictions and controls is

usually related to an increase in the fiscal deficit and inflation. There are

some important aspects of the relationship between these two policies ——

stabilization   and liberalization ——   that    deserve further attention. In

particular, the desirability of implementing a major        (almost   full) liberaliza—

tion   at the same time as a stabilization program is      on its way, should be

further    investigated. And, fourth, the      order of liberalization (i.e.,   which

market should be liberalized   first) is also      important. There is generalized
agreement    among experts about some aspects of the order of liberalization.

There is agreement, for example, that the capital account should only be

opened after the domestic capital market is freed, and that this can only

happen after the fiscal deficit has been substantially reduced. There has

been less agreement, however, on the .order of liberalization of the capital

and    current accounts. This is the topic that has been discussed in the
present paper.
          In Section 2 of the present paper the existing literature on the
 order of liberalization of the capital and current accounts of the balance of

payments was critically reviewed, and some interpretations were suggested.
The existing     arguments were grouped in three broad categories for this

discussion. The first line of argument is           concerned with real exchange rate
behavior   and   macroeconomic stability during the liberalization effort. Some
authors have argued that to the extent that the opening of the capital account

will generate destabilizing capital flows, the real exchange rate will be

highly volatile after this account is liberalized. For this reason, the

reasoning goes, the capital account should only be opened after the trade

reform has      been   completed, and the new structure of production is "conso-

lidated".       Other authors, however, have argued that the best way to avoid

undesired real exchange rate movements is by having a freely floating exchange

rate with full convertibility. This exchange rate system, they argue, should

be implemented before the trade reform. Consequently, according to this view

the capital account should be liberalized first. The second line of argument

that appears in the literature is related to welfare effects of particular

orderings. This analysis centers on plausible values of cross elasticities

and of indirect welfare effects. The third group of arguments deals with the

problem    of   adjustment costs and ttle provision ot adjustment assistance through

cheaper foreign credit. While some authors believe that the higher availa-

bility of cheaper foreign credit --          obtained through the opening of the

capital account -—        will   help the adjustment process, others think that the

effect of this credit will be highly 'indesirable since the "wrong" signals

will be provided, and that capital flows should be avoided during the tran-

sition following a trade reform.

             In   Section 3 a positive analysis of the effects of liberalizing both

accounts was presented. A three goods-two factors model of trade was              used    to

analyze how both reforms will affect production and income distribution in the

short— and long—run.        The model assumes   that   the short-run can be character-

ized by a Ricardo—Viner setting, while in the long—run a Hecksher—Ohlin

framework Is used. This discussion shows that both reforms, on their own,

will      tend to generate opposite effects on production and income distribution.
To the extent that there are real costs related to resource movements, there
is   an   argument to synchronize the effects of opening both accounts, in         order

to   avoid resources moving In and out of particular sectors. If, as has been

suggested by Frenkel [1982, 1983] and Khan and Zahler [1983] among others, the

speed of adjustment of the capital account Is faster than that of the current

account, this synchronization of the economic effects of opening both accounts

will require that the current account is opened first.

             In   Section   a two-period model      of a small open economy was developed
to analyze the welfare consequences of liberalizing the capital account in the
presence     of trade distortions. It was shown that these welfare effects will

depend on two key variables. First the relationship, prior to the liberaliza-

tion   reform, between the domestic consumption rate of interest and "the" world
interest rate will be critical. If        the   domestic consumption Interest      rate

exceeds     the world rate of interest the opening of the capital account will

result in an importation of capital and welfare will improve. Second, the

social welfare consequences of opening the capital account in the presence of

tariffs will depend on whether the additional funds obtained from abroad are

used for capital accumulation or for consumption.             It   was shown that if funds
                                            —85—



are   used to increase   present    consumption welfare will always improve. More-
over it is shown that under these assumptions the welfare increase will be
greater   in the presence of    tariff's. If, however, these funds     are used to

increase investment in the presence of tariffs welfare may be reduced as a

consequence of the capital account liberalization. This welfare reduction

will not take place, however, if shadow prices are used to guide investment

decisions.

           The purpose of this paper has been to survey the major issues related

to the order of libralization, presenting the different aspects of this

problem in an organized fashion. While the analysis has not yielded a strong

theorem regarding the appropriate order for liberalizing the current and capi-

tal accounts of the balance of payments, both the historical evidence and the

theoretical considerations discussed suggest that a more prudent strategy

would be based on liberalizing the current account first.

           A central aspect    of   any reform package is related to the degree of

credibility that the public has on the reform. If there is no credibility,

agents will not make the decisions required for the new policy to have an

effect: on the economic structure. Moreover, in the particular case of the

liberalization of the current and capital accounts of the balance of payments,

the lack of' credibility can result -- as was the case of Argentina --         in
agents using foreign funds to increase investments in the "wrong"

sector.        Of course, the degree of'     credibility of   a reform package is not




      Of course, if the lack of credibility was founded, and the reforms are
      reversed, the investment was being done (from a private perspective) in
      the "right" sectors.
                                     —86—



an exogenous variable, but will depend on a number of variables. One of the

most important determinants of the degree of credibility is the perceived

consistency of the proposed policies. If these policies are perceived as

inconsistent, then agents will expect that the reform attempt will be

discontinued or reverted. This is a basic, but important principle that

should be kept in mind when implementing global economic reforms. In that

sense, it may be argued that more important than determining the correct order

of liberalization, it is important to define consistent and credible policy

packages that will support any particular order that is chosen.
