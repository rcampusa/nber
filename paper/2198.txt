      The Gold-Exchange Standard and the Great Depression



                                ABSTRACT




     A number of explanations for the severity of the Great Depression focus
on the malfunctioning of the international monetary system. One such
explanation emphasizes the deflationary monetary consequences of the
liquidation of foreign—exchange reserves following competitive devaluations
by Great Britain and her trading partners. Another emphasizes instead the
international monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of
France. This paper analyzes both the exceptional behavior of the U.S. and
France and the shift out of foreign exchange after 1930. Uhile both Franco-.
American gold policies and systemic weaknesses of the international monetary
system emerge as important factors in explaining the international
distribution of reserves, the first of these factors turns out to play the
more important role in the monetary stringency associated with the Great
Depression.

     Two broad approaches dominate the literature on macroeconomics of the

Great Depression. One, associated mainly with studies of the United States,

emphasizes misguided policy responses at the national level as an explanation

for the Depression's singular depth and long duration. The other, with a long

tradition but associated prominently with the work of Charles Kindleberger,

emphasizes instead the malfunctioning of the international system. The

strength of the first approach is the transparency of the propagation

mechanism, usually taken to be deflationary monetarytrends. The weakness of

the second is precisely the opposite, that the propagation mechanism tends to

be opaque. It is not clear what dimension of the international system

malfunctioned after 1929, nor through what channels its malfunctioning

contributed to the Depression.

     A prime suspect is surely the gold-exchange standard of the Interwar

years. That system was a hybrid, neither a pure gold standard like that

which prevailed in various countries prior to World War I nor a fiat money

system like that which succeeded the breakdown of Bretton Woods. As under a

gold standard, countries were required to maintain convertibility between

domestic currency and gold and to leave international gold movements

unfettered. But they were permitted -- indeed encouraged --   to   hold

international reserves in the form of foreign exchange. This introduced into

the operation of the gold standard "a new psychological element never present

before the war."1 When financial crisis culminating in currency

inconvertibility struck the system in 1931, central banks alarmed by

fluctuations in the foreign-exchange value of reserve currencies rushed to
                                     —2—


liquidate their foreign asset positions. It is argued that the consequent

reduction in global reserves constrained money supplies in countries required

to maintain statutory ratios of reserves to notes and deposits, heightened the

difficulties of gold bloc countries attempting to defend their gold standard

parities, and exacerbated the monetary deflation associated with the deepening

of the post-1929 slump. As a result of this experience, the gold-exchange

standard has come to be viewed as inherently unstable due to its

susceptibility to the operation of Gresham's Law, and its instability has come

to be viewed as an important part of the explanation for the severity of the

Great Depression.

     The gold-exchange standard was adopted in response to the widely

perceived danger of an international shortage of gold.2 Between 1915 and

1925, prices had risen worldwide due to the inflation associated with wartime

finance and postwar reconstruction. These higher prices combined with

economic growth to increase the transactions demand for money. Vet world

money supply was constrained by the availability of reserves. Statutory

regulations prevented central banks from reducing the reserve backing of their

money supplies, while recent experience with inflation deterred politicians

from moving to revise those statutory regulations. The output of newly mined

gold had been depressed since the beginning of World War I, and experts

offered pessimistic forecasts of future supplies. The alternative to

increasing either the supply of monetary gold or the intensity of its

utilization, namely forcing a reduction in the world price level, was viewed

as undesirable since it would only add to the difficulties of an already

troubled world economy.

     The solution to this problem was to permit central banks to supplement

the gold backing of their currencies with exchange reserves. Much was done to

encourage the habit. Observers preoccupied by the spectre of a worldwide gold

shortage argued, however, that this practice was never systematized

sufficiently nor carried far enough.    According to their interpretation of

events, when deflation set in starting in 1929, the gold shortage had come

home to roost.

     There are analytical difficulties with the explanation for interwar

monetary problems that emphasizes a global gold shortage. For one, the danger

of a shortage of gold constraining the volume of transactions was alleviated

by the all but complete removal of gold coin from circulation.3 Hence, the

supply of monetary gold backed a considerably increased volume of central bank

liabilities and supported a relatively stable price level through 1928. The

percentage gold cover of the short-term liabilities of all central banks was

little different in 1928 than it had been in 1913. It is unclear why a gold

shortage, after having exhibited only weak effects in previous years, should

have had such a dramatic impact starting in 1929. As the Gold Delegation of

the League of Nations concluded, "The world's total stock of monetary gold,

apart from any considerations as to its distribution among different

countries, has at all times in recent years been adequate to support the

credit structure legitimately required by world trade and.. .the rapid decline

in prices which began in 1929 cannot be attributed to any deficiency in the

gold supply considered in this sense."5

    As this quotation presages, the alternative characterization of the

monetary problem associated with the operation of the gold-exchange standard
                                     —4-


emphasizes mismanagement of gold and foreign-exchange reserves rather than

their overal1 insufficiency. There exist two versions of this argument, one

which focuses on the distribution of gold, the other which focuses on the

demand for foreign exchange. The first posits a maldistribution of gold,

blaming France and the United States for imposing deflation on the rest of the

world by absorbing disproportionate shares of global supplies. As the point

was expressed by Britain's Macmillan Committee in the summer of 1931, "The

present distribution of gold is very generally held to be unsatisfactory; a

maldistribution to which is to be attributed a large measure of responsibility

for the heavy fall in prices in recent years."6 Between the ends of 1928 and

1932 French gold reserves rose from $1247 million to $3257 million of constant

gold content, or from 13 to 28 per cent of the world total. The gold backing

of the notes and public deposits of the Banque de France rose from 47 to 78

per cent.7 In the U.S. case, critics complained not of the rate of increase

of gold reserves, which was 8 per cent over the period, but of their high

level. In contrast to the period 1925-28, when the Federal Reserve

facilitated the reconstruction the international gold standard by releasing

substantial quantities of gold, after 1928 the U.S. persistently maintained 35

to 40 per cent of global gold reserves.8 As shown in Table 1, by the end of

1932 France and the U.S. together possessed nearly 63 per cent of the world's

central monetary gold.

     The second version of this argument blames the collapse of fixed parities

and central banks' systematic liquidation of foreign assets for reducing the

availability of international reserves just when they were most desperately

needed. Since even those central banks that devalued their currencies were

obliged to back their notes and (in many cases) sight liabilities, the shift

out of foreign exchange, by reducing the available stock of reserves, could

have reduced the money supplies that could be supported. Any one central bank

might succeed in importing additional gold to be used to back an expansion of

its note circulation but only at the expense of heightened monetary stringency

abroad. Between 1928 and 1932 the share of foreign exchange in the reserves

of 24 European countries fell from 42 to 8 per cent (see also Table 2). In

large part this liquidation reflected the persistent efforts of the Banque de

France to convert its foreign assets into gold.9 But when France is excluded,

the share of foreign exchange in the reserves of the remaining 23 countries

still declines dramatically, from 36 per cent in 1928 to 11 per cent in 1932.10

     The major portion of the decline in the share of foreign exchange in

global reserves took place between the ends of 1930 and 1931. Prior to 1931,

the share of exchange in the reserve portfolios of 23 European countries,

excluding France, remained steady, varying only between 35 and 40 per cent.11

Between 1930 and 1931, it fell from 35 to 19 per cent. Because of its timing,

this dramatic decline is blamed on the 1931 financial crisis, the imposition

of exchange control in Europe, and the devaluation of sterling, which combined

to undermine faith in the stability of the two reserve currencies, sterling

and the dollar, and induced central banks to substitute gold for foreign

exchange in the effort to avoid capital losses on their reserves.12 To some

extent, the liquidation of exchange reserves was a consequence of central bank

statutes, many of which required the liquidation of sterling reserves once the

pound was rendered inconvertible. But in addition, the newly-introduced

element of risk due to foreign devaluation discouraged central banks from

holding exchange reserves. Countries holding London balances which had

previously harbored no doubts about the stability of reserve currencies

learned an expensive lesson from sterling's devaluation and altered their

behavior accordingly. For example, after having lost 25 per cent of the

domestic value of its £12 million sterling reserve, the National Bank of

Belgium quickly moved to liquidate its dollar balances.13 When speculative

pressure shifted from sterling to the dollar, such Eastern European countries

as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria also shif ted their balances out of New

York.14 As one contemporary expert observed, "The risks involved in currency

depreciation have been very forcibly -- and for some gold exchange central

banks, disastrously -- demonstrated during the recent period."15

international distribution of gold and foreign-exchan9e reserves under the

interwar gold-exchange standard with which these issues can be addressed. I

analyze both the exceptional behavior of the U.S. and France and the shift out

of foreign exchange after 1930. While both U.S. and French gold policies and

systemic weaknesses of the exchange standard emerge as important factors in

explaining the international distribution of reserves, the first of these

factors turns out to play the more important role in the monetary stringency

associated with the Depression.16

     It is important to bear in mind the implications of this analysis for the

literature on the Great Depression. A number of authors have emphasized

international aspects of the Depression, arguing that the boom and slump are

properly understood not simply as an outcome of misguided U.S. policy but as

a result of an unstable international system subjected to a shock to
                                     -7-


confidence.17 One way in which "international interactions across boundaries"

could have magnified an initial disturbance was through the collapse of the

international monetary system. Convertibility crises, forced devaluations and

a loss of confidence in the stability of reserve currencies, by inducing

central banks to shift out of foreign assets reduced the stock of

international reserves available to back domestic liabilities. If the

availability of reserves remained a constraint on monetary authorities'

willingness to increase national money supplies, then the collapse of the

gold-exchange standard and the liquidation of foreign-exchange reserves would

have limited the scope for ref lation and exacerbated the money stringency that

contributed to the severity of the Depression.18

     Alternatively, if Federal Reserve and Banque de France policies leading

to the concentration of gold in the US, and France rather than the scramble

for gold unleashed by the gold-exchange standard's disintegration were

primarily responsible for exacerbating monetary stringency throughout the

world, then responsibility for the Depression should be assigned not to

systemic weaknesses of the gold-exchange standard system but to misguided

national policies. Note, however, that the national policies blamed for the

Depression need not be limited to the United States and still may be

transmitted across national borders by the international monetary system.

     Finally, it is possible that this entire emphasis on international

monetary forces is misplaced. If the collapse of the gold-exchange standard,

the liquidation of foreign assets and the advent of exchange-rate flexibility

offered central banks the opportunity to free their monetary policies from the

reserve constraint, they could have chosen to initiate an expansionary
                                     -8-


response to the Depression regardless of the state of international reserves.

Were this the case, international aspects of the Depression would have had to

operate through different channels than those emphasized in the literature on

international monetary forces.

     This focus on external constraints on domestic monetary policies is not

new.19 However, previous studies which have acknowledged the role of external

constraints have analyzed them on a national basis rather than considering

global monetary conditions and the global availability of reserves as factors

in the global Depression. Even if national policies rather than systemic

failures ultimately prove dominant in the explanation for the Great

Depression, an implication of this paper is that their effects can only be

fully understood when analyzed in an international setting.



I. The Mechanics of the Gold Exchange Standard


    Had the interwar gold-exchange standard possessed a birth certificate, it

would have read 'born in Genoa during the Economic and Financial Conference of

1922.' The distinguishing feature of the new monetary regime was not the

practice by central banks of holding foreign currency reserves, for many

countries, particularly smaller ones and members of the British Empire, had

done so on a substantial scale prior to 1913.20 The significance of Genoa lay

rather in the effort to institutionalize and encourage the practice. The

Financial Commission of the Genoa Conference proposed the adoption of an

international monetary convention, formally entitling countries "in addition

to any gold reserve held at home, [to] maintain in any other participant
                                        —9-


country reserves of approved assets in the form of bank balances, bills,

short-term securities, or other suitable liquid resources."21 Participating

countries were required to fix their exchange rates against one another, with

any failing to do so losing the right to hold the reserve balances of other

participants. Foreign exchange would be used in the same manner as gold to

settle accounts and defend exchange rates. The principal creditor nations

were encouraged to take early steps to "establish a free market in gold and

thus become gold centres" where the bulk of foreign-exchange reserves would be

held.

        If the official convention advocated by the Financial Committee failed to

materialize, it nonetheless exercised considerable influence over the

practices of central banks.22 The first effect of the Genoa resolutions was to

encourage the adoption of statutes permitting central banks to back notes and

sight deposits with foreign exchange as well as gold. Central banks of

countries that stabilized their currencies with League of Nations assistance,

including Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Greece, were empowered to hold the

entirety of their reserves in convertible foreign bills and balances. The

newly created Latin American central banks designed by Kemmerer Commissions

were permitted to hold both gold and foreign exchange, generally in

proportions of their choosing. Various restrictions were placed on the form

of eligible exchange reserves: the reserve of new Central Bank of Chile, for

example, was to consist of gold coin and bars in the vaults of the Bank,

earmarked gold abroad, and deposits payable in gold on demand in banks of high

standing in London and New York. In the later 1920s, the statutes adopted by

newly created or reformed central banks tended to require that a specified
                                     —1 O-



minimum proportion of total reserves be held in the form of gold; these

proportions ranged from 33 per cent in Albania to 75 per cent in Belgium,

Poland and Germany.23 Finally, a number of the older central banks retained

long-standing regulations requiring them to back their liabilities exclusively

with gold. Central banks whose eligible reserves were limited to gold

included those of Denmark, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and, of

course, the two reserve currency countries, the United States and the United

Kingdom.24

     Statutes regulating central banks also differed in the amount of backing

required. Most of the older central banks, exemplified by the Bank of England

and the Norges Bank, were required to back only notes in circulation but,

after an exemption for the fiduciary issue (a certain fixed quantity of

notes), to maintain 100 per cent cover on the margin. Newer banks, as well as

such older institutions as the Netherlands Bank and Banque de France which had

modernized their statutes, typically had no fiduciary issue but were required

instead to hold proportional backing against liabilities, on the order of 35

or 40 per cent. This was viewed as a useful method of economizing on the use

of gold. But the statutes requiring proportional reserves often extended the

definition of liabilities to be backed to include not only notes but in

addition sight deposits at the central bank, an amendment which tended to

increase the use of reserves.25 According to one expert, the move to

proportional backing and the requirement to back sight liabilities other than

notes had roughly offsetting effects on the global demand for international

reserves 26

    The upshot of these regulations was that there existed under the
                                     —11—


gold—exchange standard a stable if somewhat flexible relationship between

international reserves and the domestic monetary base. Although that

relationship differed across countries and was more elastic than under a gold

coin or even a gold bullion standard, it existed nonetheless. It existed as

much because of convention as official regulation, since statute provided only

a general guide as to the relationship between money supplies and reserves.

The minimum 9old cover, for example, was under normal circumstances never

employed. Banks of issue attempted to maintain excess reserves over their

minimum legal requirements, typically on the order of 7 to 10 percent of

liabilities.27 Not only was this prudent banking practice, but it provided

leeway for open market operations designed to insulate the domestic economy

from the impact on domestic money supplies of gold outf lows.28 Moreover, the

minimum was not always binding. Some banks of issue, including those of

Austria, Chile, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, were entitled, upon payment of a

special tax, to temporarily reduce their gold cover ratios below the statutory

minimum. Denmark and South Africa required only a special government permit.

In Salvador the central bank was merely required to raise its discount rate by

half a percentage point f or each per cent by which its reserve fell below 30

per cent.29 Similarly, the proportions in which central banks held gold and

exchange reserves only loosely followed statutory regulation. Some central

banks entitled to hold foreign exchange chose not to do so. Others without

this right chose to maintain lar9e amounts of exchange outside their legal

reserve.

     Critics of this system noted the wide variation across countries in the

relation of gold reserves to money supplies, arguing that in principle "the
                                     —12—


gold which a central bank holds ought to have no particular relation to its

note issue."3° They were especially critical of the practice of holding excess

reserves. They admitted, however, that so long as other central banks

maintained conventional backing ratios, public confidence in any one country's

currency hinged upon its continuing to do the same. A solution to this

problem was to arrange an internationally coordinated reduction in cover

ratios which would not undermine confidence in any particular currency.31 In

practice, the major central banks could not be brought to cooperate in such

action.

     Even most of those countries which went off the gold standard following

the onset of the Great Depression maintained gold cover ratios not far

different from those which had traditionally prevailed, either because of

statutory requirements or out of concern to prevent depreciation due to

loss of confidence. Some countries, including of course the members of the

gold bloc, simply left their cover regulations unchanged. In contrast, Germany

and Italy suspended central bank reserve requirements in 1932 and 1935,

respectively. Although four countries with a fixed fiduciary system varied

the amount of the maximum uncovered issue, most of those variations were

small. The Bank of England's limit was raised from £260 million to £275

million or August 1st, 1931, in response to pressure on sterling, and returned

to £260 million on March 31st, 1933, when the dollar was under attack. The

Bank of Sweden's was raised from 250 to 350 million kroner in 1933 to

facilitate an expansion of the domestic money supply. The most dramatic

change was that of Japan, where the limit was raised in 1932 from 120 to 1000

million yen. Of the proportional reserve countries, legal cover ratios were
                                      —13-


lowered by Austria in 1932 (from 24 to 20 per cent), by Danzig in 1935 (from

40 to 30 per cent), and in 1936 by Denmark, Bulgaria and Latvia (from 33 1/3

to 25 per cent, from 33 1/3 to 25 per cent, and from 50 to 30 per cent,

respectively) 32

     An implication of the preceding discussion is that the positive

association between domestic money supplies and international reserves

depended ultimately on central bank preferences rather than the mechanical

linkages posited by theoretical models of the gold standard. What then

determined the preferences of central banks? Contemporary observers such as

Keynes, Gayer and Nurkse argued that the basic motivation for holding reserves

was precautionary, deriving from the desire to smooth the impact of temporary

fluctuations in export earnings on the capacity to purchase imports. They

suggested that deviations of the reserve proportion from the 33 to 40 per cent

norm were explicable in terms of costs and benefits of financing instead of

adjusting to temporary disturbances to the balance of payments. As Charles

Hardy put it, "The size of the gold stock which a country needs depends on the

size and also on the character of the probable gold movements out of the

country."33 Arthur D. Gayer termed this "the magnitude of the probable

external drain,., the amount a country is likely to require for equalizing the

balance of its international payments in the interval during which corrective

measures are being applied internally to remove the causes of the gold export

and thus restore equilibrium."34

    Observers agreed that agricultural producers, particularly those whose

exports were heavily concentrated in a single crop, were especially vulnerable

to fluctuations in export earnings and therefore in need of additional
                                      -14-


reserves to insure their ability to purchase imports.35 They noted that, along

with countries with highly variable exports, those with large shares of

exports and imports in GNP had reason to maintain additional reserves, since

the costs of responding to an export shortfall by foregoing imports were

highest where trade was most important. At the same time, they acknowledged

that the precautionary motive for holding reserves was a luxury good. Nurkse

likened the demand for reserves to the individual's demand for cash balances.

"A rich man can afford and will probably want to hold a large idle cash

reserve, while a poor man will not. In the same way a poor country is less

likely than a rich one to sacrifice potential imports and to tie up some of

its limited wealth in an international cash reserve."36

      Readers will note the resemblance of these interwar analyses to modern

discussions of optimal international reserves.37 Attempts to estimate models

of optimal reserves specify the demand for reserves as a function of income,

openness and some measure of balance-of-payments variability. The

specification estimated by Frenkel (1974) is typical:


(1)
          r=a0+a1t+a2s+a3y

where r is reserves, t is the import-to--GNP ratio, s is balance-of-payments

variability measure, y is GNP, and the a1 are parameters to be estimated. The

expectation is that a1, a2 and a3 are positive. The specification suggested

by the above discussion differs only by the addition of a measure of domestic

monetary base h:


(2)
          r=a0+a1t+a2s+a3y+a4h
                                          —15-


where a4, the cover ratio, is positive.38 Variants of this specification are

estimated below.

      The internal consistency of inferences about the effects of a decline in

willingness to hold exchange reserves and/or a rise in the central bank demand

for gold can be analyzed theoretically by embedding eq. (2) in a model like

that which informs P4urkse's (1944) discussion. Since I am concerned with the

impact of global reserves on global money supply and global income, the

framework for analysis is, as in Barro (1979), a model of the world economy

under fixed exchange rates. Although it is straightforward to analyze the

impact of changes in the supply and demand for reserves in a multicountry

setting, as in Eichengreen and Sachs (1986), for present purposes the

multicountry analysis is unnecessarily elaborate.

      The first equation, the demand for reserves, is eq. (2) above. r now

measures global reserves, y global income, etc., and all variables are

expressed in nominal terms. (For simplicity, remaining equations will also be

expressed nominal form.)

  Total reserves are the sum of gold g and foreign-exchange f:


(3)       g=a0+o1t+a2s+c3y+a4h

(4)          f=70+71t+y2s+73y+y4h

where a1 =     + ' (i   =   O   1, 2, 3, 4) and r =   g   +   f.   While the global supply

of monetary 9old g is exogenously fixed (hence ignoring mining and nonmonetary

uses of gold), the supply of exchange reserves f is demand determined.39

      The demand for nominal money balances is assumed to take Cambridge

transactions demand form:
                                      —16-


(5)        m=Ay

The broadly-defined money supply can be decomposed into the base and the

multiplier,


(6)        m=*0+*1h

      Equations (3) through (6) and the identity r = g +   f   (equivalently (2)

and the coefficient restrictions) determine five endogenous variables; r, f,

h, m and one to be selected. It is not obvious why openness or export

variability might be affected by financial market conditions, and in any case

such effects are remote from the questions at hand. Income is therefore the

logical remaining endogenous variable.

      It is useful to consider how this approach compares to conventional

models of the money supply process under the gold standard. The textbook

model of the gold standard, as in McCloskey and Zecher (1976) or Barro (1979),

assumes that the money supply m bears a fixed relationship to the stock of

reserves r:


(7)        m=Or

In contrast to (7), eqs. (1) and (2) focus on the relationship of reserves to

the monetary base rather than to the broadly-defined money supply. They

introduce other variables affecting the link between reserves and the base and

leave open the possibility that other factors may influence the relationship

between the base and broad monetary aggregates. In addition, eq. (2) differs

from conventional treatments of the monetary base by not explicitly mentioning
                                        —17—


that the base is the sum of domestic credit and foreign reserves. This

difference is apparent rather than real, however, since domestic credit is

simply the difference between h and r, and the implicit central bank reaction

function determining credit can be derived by solving (2) for h -          r.4°   In

treating foreign exchange as a component of international reserves, this paper

differs from Fremling (1985, p. 1183), who questions this procedure on the

grounds that "what is a foreign reserve asset for one country is an equally

sized liability for another." As the framework of this section makes clear,

the import of this observation hinges on the form in which foreign reserves

were held. When they were held as government securities, they do not need to

be netted out of the money supply available to domestic residents, and the

argument has no force. When they were held as deposits in commercial banks,

they should be subtracted from m. But since m is a multiple of h and h is a

multiple of r, any such adjustment has only minor implications for the

analysis conducted here.

     I consider the impact on income of two exogenous shocks: a shift out of

foreign exchange into gold (d'y0 =   -do0   <   0),   and a decline in the willingness

to hold foreign exchange not accompanied by a rise in the demand for gold

(dy0 <   0).
     The effects of the latter are particularly simple. Since the stock of

exchange reserves is demand determined while stock of gold reserves is

exogenously given, the monetary base is determined by eq. (3) alone. The base

determines the money supply through (6), which determines nominal income

through (5). Changes in y0, i.e. in the willingness to hold foreign exchange

reserves, have no impact on h and therefore no Implications for m or y. A
                                         -18-


decline in the demand for foreign exchange not accompanied by a rise in the

demand for gold therefore has no direct effect on money supply or income,

since the supply of foreign exchange simply adjusts to accommodate it.

       In the case of a shift out of foreign exchange into gold, the results are

dramatically different:


(8)
              .- =           1
              dy0    )t04
                            - *103


which is negative, assuming the denominator to be positive (a necessary

condition for an increase in gold to be expansionary). The shift into gold

(do0   > 0)   reduces the monetary base that can be supported by a given gold

supply. The consequent decline in income increases with the elasticity of

money supply with respect to the base       and the income elasticity of demand

for gold 03 and falls with the income elasticity of money demand X and the

elasticity of gold demand with respect to the base a4. Thus, what is crucial

is not whether the demand for foreign exchange fell significantly after 1929

but whether any such fall was accompanied by a rise in the demand for gold.



II. Empirical Analysis


       Despite the popularity of the explanation that ascribes the concentration

of gold reserves to the beggar-thy-neighbor policies of the United States and

France and the growing reliance on gold rather than foreign exchange to the

uncertainties created by the gold standard's collapse, it is not obvious that

observed movements in the distribution of reserves reflect these factors

rather than the effects of changes in incomes, balance-of-payments variability
                                     —19-


and openness which normally affect the demand for reserves, especially since

the Great Depression was marked by dramatic fluctuations in all three

variables. Merely to note, as did the Gold Delegation of the League of

Nations, that in 1928 a mere 15 countries held over 90 percent of the world's

monetary gold reserves does not establish the existence of a problem. As

Nurkse expressed the point somewhat later, "the fact that the distribution of

reserves was highly unequal in the later 'thirties does not itself prove that

it did not represent an equilibrium position from the point of view of the

individual countries concerned, given the existing structure of basic

conditions."41

     In order to analyze the international distribution of reserves and its

determinants, I estimate demands for gold and foreign exchange by 24 countries

using a specification based on eq. (2). To test the hypothesis that the U.S.

and France held reserves in excess of those which can be ascribed to the

normal determinants of reserve demand, I introduce dummy variables for these

countries. To test the hypothesis that the years after 1930 witnessed a

liquidation of foreign exchange reserves, with or without an accompanying

shift into gold, I introduce dummy variables for individual years.

     The sample of countries included in the econometric analysis was dictated

by data availability. Some countries were excluded because of the lack of

reasonable national income estimates, others because the absence of a central

bank meant that information on money and foreign reserves was not provided on

a compatible basis. Nonetheless, most of the important repositories of gold

and foreign assets are included in the sample.42 Note that the sample of

countries is not the same as in Table 2.
                                     -20-


     Data on reserves are taken from the Statistical Bulletins and Monetay

Reviews of the League of Nations, which draw in turn on published returns of

central banks.43 I utilize figures on the book value of gold and exchange

reserves of central monetary institutions (apart from Exchange Equalization

Funds) at the end of calendar years. Gold reserves are valued at legal

parities. Although the paper value of gold exceeded its book value in

countries which continued to value that specie at par despite having

depreciated their exchange rates, I only revalue these reserves when this was

done by the central bank itself, since this was when capital gains on gold

were reflected in the central bank's backing ratio.44

     In contrast to gold, foreign assets are valued at market rates, since

this was the practice of central banks. As already noted, a number of central

banks functioned under restrictions on what type of foreign assets qualified

for backing liabilities. Most of these countries held their foreign assets

exclusively in eligible form. But for a small minority, there was a

difference between the total and eligible foreign assets of the monetary

authorities. Since total foreign assets is the more encompassing measure of

exchange reserves, in those few cases where the two figures differed, the

total was used. The two exceptions are Germany and Denmark, which reported

negative total foreign assets (but positive eligible assets) for selected

years.45 Since it is impossible to analyze these negative figures using the

standard specification which takes as its dependent variable the log of

foreign reserves, for those years where total foreign assets were negative,

eligible foreign assets were used instead.

    Except for data for the U.S. and U.K., which are drawn from U.S.
                                     -21—


Department of Commerce (1976) and Feinstein (1972), respectively, the

remaining variables are assembled from sources described in the appendix to

Eichengreen and Portes (1986). The share of imports in GNP is used as the

measure of openness, note circulation as the measure of the monetary base, and

the variance of exports over three years (centered upon the year for which the

dependent variable is defined) as the measure of balance—of—payments

variability.

     Since the controversy surrounding the international distribution of gold

centers on the years 1931-33, the period spanned by the 1931 devaluation of

sterling and the 1933 devaluation of the dollar, I estimate the model for a

period bracketing those years: 1929-35. 1929 is the first year following the

revaluation of the Banque de France's gold stock and France's official return

to gold, events commonly taken to indicate that reconstruction of the

international monetary system was complete, while 1935 is the last year before

the collapse of the gold bloc and final demise of the gold-exchange standard.

     Equation (2) is estimated using two-stage least squares to account for

the endogeneity of money. The appropriate instruments are the arguments of

the demand for money function, taken to be income, the opportunity cost of

holding money, and lagged money balances.46 Results for individual years and

for the entire period 1929-35 are reported in Table 3. The demand for

reserves is an increasing function of log GNP, the import share and export

variability, as in modern estimates of models of optimal international

reserves. With the exception of export variability, the coefficients

consistently exceed zero at the 90 percent confidence level or better. Even

the coefficient on export variability is consistent with modern estimates, in

which the coefficient on balance-of-payments variability tends to be

unstable.

     Changes in money consistently exhibit the anticipated positive

association with the demand for reserves. The pooled time-series cross-

section estimate suggests for the entire period a gold and foreign exchange

cover of 21 per cent on the margin, confirming that, despite their maintenance

of excess reserves, central banks were concerned to increase their reserves

when increasing money supplies. However, both the size of the coefficient and

its statistical significance tend to decline over time, suggesting that once

countries began to leave the gold standard in 1931 the links between money

supplies and international reserves were loosened. This is consistent with

the steps, described above, to alter but not eliminate legal cover ratios.

consider below whether the link between money supplies and international

reserves loosened significantly as the period progressed, and whether shifts

in this linkage were sufficient to neutralize the potential impact on money

supplies factors constricting the availability of reserves.

     These four economic characteristics of countries explain a large share of

international distribution of reserves, ranging from 86 to 97 per cent

depending on year and averaging 90 per cent over the period. In other words,

it may be unnecessary to appeal to exceptional French and American appetites

for gold or to the collapse of the gold-exchange standard to account for the

observed distribution.

     This specification does not explicitly test the hypothesis that the

observed distribution of reserves was an equilibrium allocation. This may be

a significant omission since, in a period marked by convertibility crises and

unanticipated devaluations, countries may have been unable to maintain their

desired reserve stocks. To test this hypothesis, the rate of change of the

exchange rate over the preceding period is added to the model.48 The exchange

rate is measured as a percentage of its 1929 gold parity, so negative values

signify depreciation.49 The sign of its coefficient is theoretically

ambiguous: if devaluation was forced, as was the case for several primary

producers in 1929-30, then depreciation should be associated with reserve

losses and the coefficient should be positive; but if devaluation was

voluntary, as in the case of the U.S. depreciation of 1933-34, then

depreciation should be associated with reserve gains and the coefficient

should be negative.

     The results of estimating the disequilibrium model are reported in

Table 4. The only year for which the coefficient on depreciation differs

significantly from zero is 1929, when countries forced to depreciate held

reserves significantly less than desired.5° In general, the results tend to

support the equilibrium specification.

     In Tables 5 and 6 I estimate separately the demand for the two components

of international reserves: monetary gold and foreign assets. Consider first

the pooled time-series cross-section results. Both demands depend positively

on income, openness and export variability. While the coefficients on export

variability again exhibit instability, their movement displays no obvious

pattern. However, only gold and not foreign exchange reserves are

consistently related to the size of national money supplies at standard

significance levels, especially after 1930. This result is broadly consistent

with the views of Nurkse (1944): since the primary objective of backing the

note circulation was "to maintain confidence in the currency," Nurkse

suggested that backing for notes would tend to be held in the

confidence-inspiring form of gold, while reserves maintained for other

purposes would be held in the form of foreign exchange as well.51 The Table 5

coefficients on money supplies are significantly greater than zero at the 90

percent level or better for every year except the last and tend to decline

over time. While in Table 6 there appears to be no association between

exchange reserves and money supplies after 1930, contrary to Nurkse there is

weak evidence of an association in the gold standard years 1929-30. It

appears that both gold and foreign exchange were used to smooth external

transactions and, to a lesser extent for gold than foreign exchange, to back

the central bank's domestic liabilities during the period of the global

gold-exchange standard; once that standard began to collapse, however, while

gold was still held both to smooth external transactions and to provide

backing for money supplies, foreign assets were held only for the first of

these purposes.

     Table 7, where dummy variables for the U.S. and France are added, can be

used to assess the contention that the Federal Reserve and the Banque de

France held reserves in excess of those explicable by their economic

characteristics and normal patterns of central bank behavior.52 It is not

clear that the proper interpretation of this contention is that the two

countries held disproportionate quantities of global reserves or

disproportionate quantities of gold. The results lend support to both

interpretations. From the third equation, U.S. gold reserves were fully

110 percent and French gold reserves 280 percent above levels that can be

accounted for by their economic characteristics and the behavior typical of

the sample of countries.53 From the sixth equation, U.S. monetary gold stocks

were nearly three times and French gold stocks nearly five times those

predicted by the international cross section.54

     These magnitudes are economically important in the context of the Great

Depression. Recall that in 1931 France and the United States possessed

between them some 60 per cent of the global stock of monetary gold. The

results in Table 7 suggest that, had France and the U.S. adhered to the same

patterns as other countries, their combined share would have been less than

one-quarter, almost exactly doubling the gold reserves of other countries.

Assuming that central banks were concerned to retain some proportion between

their reserves and domestic liabilities, like that shown in Tables 4 and 5,

and that they were constrained in their desire to ref late by the availability

of gold, this redistribution of reserves would have provided considerable

scope for an expansion of money supplies.

    Table 8 adds dummy variables for years subsequent to 1929 to analyze

shifts over time in the willingness to hold reserve assets.55 The

interpretation of reserve movements which emphasizes the shift out of exchange

and into gold due to the collapse of the gold-exchange standard predicts

negative coefficients for later years in the demand-for-exchange-reserves

equations and significant positive coefficients in the equations for gold.

Only the first of these predictions receives strong support. Except in 1932,

the demand for exchange reserves is significantly lower in every year after

1930 than in 1929.56 As before, the orders of magnitude are striking: by 1931

the demand for foreign assets has fallen by almost exactly 50 per cent

compared to 1929. This is more than a restatement of the fact that between

1929 and 1931 the share of foreign exchange in the reserves of 24 countries

fell from 37 to 19 percent (37 to 13 percent when France is excluded). It

establishes that the decline in income, contraction of trade and changes in

money supplies associated with the Depression cannot by themselves account for

this development.

     The results do not provide compelling support for the contention that

this liquidation of foreign exchange was at the same time a shift into gold.

While in the equations f or gold the coefficients on 1930 and subsequent years

are uniformly positive, they tend to differ insignificantly from zero. On the

basis of these estimates one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the demand

for gold rose insignificantly at the same time the demand f or exchange

reserves fell. Unfortunately, neither do these results permit one to reject a

range of other equally plausible null hypotheses, such as that the demand for

gold rose by approximately a third. Evidence on this question must be judged

inconclusive. Nevertheless, on the basis of point estimates the exceptional

demands for gold by the U.S. and France contributed more to the global reserve

stringency than the liquidation of the gold—exchange standard.

     The conclusion that the demand for gold reserves rose insignificantly is

entirely consistent with the finding that the demand for foreign exchange

fell. What may have happened starting in 1931 as a result of the gold

exchange standard's collapse was that countries reduced their propensities to

hold exchange reserves as backing for their money supplies without

substituting additional gold. The devaluations which led to the scramble out

of exchange reserves at the same time loosened the reserve constraint on

national money supplies. Rather than substituting gold for recently

liquidated foreign assets, some central banks appear to have simply reduced

their excess gold reserves.

        Perhaps the strongest evidence against the hypothesis that there occurred

in the course of the 1930s an upward shift in the global demand for gold is

that the coefficients for 1930 and 1931 in the gold equations are virtually

indistinguishable. 1931 was the year of the most serious uncertainty due to

Continental financial crises, Central European exchange control, sterling

devaluation, and competitive depreciation, the year over which the share of

foreign exchange in the reserves of 23 European central banks fell from 35 to

19 per cent. If uncertainty ever increased the demand for gold, it should

have been between the ends of 1930 and 1931. That the point estimates of the

dummy variables for those years indicate increases of no more than five per

cent is difficult to reconcile with the gold-exchange—standard-liquidation

view.

        This conclusion contrasts with the implications of the analysis of French

and American behavior. When the dummy variables for years are added to

Table 8, the coefficients on the dummy variables for France and the U.S.

remain positive and significant at the 99 per cent level in the equations for

both gold and total reserves. Because the practice of backing money supplies

with gold remained, the exceptional demands f or gold by the Federal Reserve

and Banque de France placed downward pressure on global money supplies. This

effect is large relative to any which might be ascribed to the liquidation of

the gold-exchange standard.

III. Summary and Implications


     This paper has presented the first systematic analysis of the

distribution of international reserves under the gold-exchange standard. The

demand for reserves has been shown to depend on, among other variables,

national money supplies. That dependence changed, however, in Important ways

after 1930. Where it had previously been the practice of gold-exchange

standard countries to back their money supplies with both foreign assets and

gold, the instability of reserve currencies caused central banks to liquidate

that portion of their reserve portfolios which had taken the form of foreign

assets. Had no other change in behavior occurred, this would have placed

downward pressure on money supplies. Yet the results of empirical analysis do

not permit us to rule out other changes sufficiently important to eliminate

any such effect. Instead of attempting to maintain the overall reserve

backing of their money supplies by substituting gold for foreign exchange,

central banks may have reduced their cover ratios to permit the maintenance of

previously establishedrelations between money supplies and gold reserves. It

is not clear that the deflationary linkage running from international monetary

instability to domestic financial stringency was operative.

     But since central banks attempted on average to maintain previously

established ratios between money supplies and gold, any factor which reduced

the availability of gold reserves served as an impediment to monetary

expansion. Here the gold policies of the Federal Reserve and the Banque de

France emerged as crucial. According to the estimates provided here, the

exceptional policies of these two countries reduced the the gold reserves
                                     —29-


available to other countries by fully one half, an effect larger than any

which can be ascribed to the liquidation of the gold—exchange standard.

     As noted in the introduction, these findings have clear implications for

the literature on monetary forces In the Great Depression. These implications

only emerge, however, when the demand for reserves and supply of money are

viewed on a global basis. Since central banks generally maintained a

relatively stable relationship between their money supplies and gold reserves,

any factor which constrained the availability of gold constrained their

ability, given regulations and attitudes, to engage in monetary ref lation.

U.S. and French gold policies must therefore share the blame for exacerbating

the monetary aspects of the Great Depression.

     These findings also have implications f or the dichotomy between

explanations for the Great Depression which emphasize national policies and

those which emphasize the international system. They suggest that the

distinction is overdrawn. The conclusions of this paper are entirely

consistent with the view that the Depression can only be fully understood as a

global phenomenon. They support the notion that international considerations

were significant determinants of national monetary policies. But they suggest

that national monetary policies, rather than systemic features of the

international regime, were the source of the most important destabilizing

monetary impulse transmitted by the international system.

     Another way of looking at these results is in terms of the debate over

the exchange-rate devaluations of the 1930s. Previously, Jeffrey Sachs and I

have argued, in contradistinction to the existing literature, that the

devaluations of the 1930s were useful ref lationary initiatives when taken
                                     —30-


individually, although as executed they had beggar-thy-neighbor effects

abroad.58 Had they been undertaken more widely, we speculated, they would have

had at worst no effects and at best extremely favorable effects, depending on

accompanying monetary measures. The only caveat to this conclusion lay in the

possibility that the uncoordinated manner in which devaluation was undertaken

created uncertainty which led to a shift out of exchange reserves and into

gold, putting downward pressure on global reserves and national money

supplies. The results reported here confirm the shift out of exchange

reserves, but provide no compelling support for the implication of

deflationary consequences.

9.   Under the monetary law of 1928 which marked France's official return to
the gold standard, the Banque de France was no longer permitted to purchase
foreign exchange. When the law was passed, the Bank already possessed
contracts for foreign exchange for forward delivery. As these contracts
matured late in 1928, the Bank's foreign exchange holdings rose substantially
and, given the dubious legal status of these reserves, the French authorities
engaged in persistent efforts over the subsequent year to convert them into
gold. These efforts were renewed following sterling's depreciation in
September 1931.

10. These are the calculations of Nurkse (1944), p. 41 and Appendix II.

11. Nurkse (1944), pp. 34-35. This stability was especially pronounced among
countries that stabilized either very early or very late -- that is, among
those which stabilized before or together with Britain in 1925 and those which
did not carry out stabilization programs before 1929. Brown (1940), p. 737.

12. Withdrawing sterling balances remained straightforward even once the
pound was rendered inconvertible. Countries simply sold sterling for
convertible currencies on the London foreign exchange market at the current
rate and, if they wished, proceeded to convert those currencies into gold.

13. For example, the Netherlands Bank, in its Annual Report for 1931—32,
defended its failure to avoid losses on its London balances by joining the run
on sterling on the grounds that "Management were of opinion that they should
not do this because they were convinced that the British Government and the
Bank of England firmly intended to maintain the gold standard and to make the
                                     -32-


gold stock of the said Bank entirely available for this purpose. This
conviction was based on the conversations which Dr. Vissering and Dr. Tetrode
had with the Management of the Bank of England on August 26th, 1931, when
anxiety concerning the financial position of England began to prevail." Cited

16. In this paper I do not analyze the causes of the initial downturn, as
opposed to reasons for its singular depth and long duration; my central
concern is to analyze instead the response to that event. The argument that
follows is compatible with both real and monetary explanations for the initial
contraction, as advanced by Temin (1976) and Friedman and Schwartz (1963).
Nor do I explore the bases of the French and U.S. gold policies that emerge as
critical, not because they are unimportant but because, unlike the issues
addressed here, they are fully analyzed elsewhere. I have analyzed the
reasons for France's post—1928 import of gold in Eichengreen (1986). u.s.

25. The origin of these ratios is "somewhat obscure," in the words of C.H.
Kirsch, quoted in Royal Institute (1931), p.151. The regulations emulated
what legislators viewed as prudent banking practice, often taken to be
Bank of England practice prior to Peel's Act of 1844, when it was the Bank's
convention to maintain a 33 per cent cash reserve against notes and deposits.
Or as the League of Nations (1930), p.19 put it, "But the minimum reserves
which are required by law today are to a large extent the outcome, not of
these considerations, but of past tradition, of convention and habit, of the
natural fear which each individual legislature has that a departure from
general practice may impair confidence in the currency."

38. The monetary variable used to explain movements in the demand for
reserves should be treated as endogenous since, unless gold and foreign
exchange flows are completely sterilized, disturbances affecting the stock of
reserves are likely to result in a change in the base. This, however, is a
matter of estimation rather than specification, and is considered further
below.
                                                   —34-


39. Ignoring the impact on stocks of the flow supply of new gold is
appropriate only given a short time horizon. Fremling (1985) notes that there
was in fact a considerable flow supply of new monetary gold in the 1930s.
Since the issue of whether that new supply was or was not a response to
deflation induced changes in the real price of gold is distinct from the
issues with which this paper is concerned, the exogeneity assumption is
maintained throughout.

40. Denoting domestic credit as c,

          c =             -        -         -         -
                (1-a4)h       a0       a1t       a2s       a3y.
Alternatively, domestic credit can be written as a function of reserves and
other variables:

              1-a4 - —
          C =     r a0 - —t
                         a1              -   a2
                                             —s    - a3
               a4    a4 a4                   a4        a4

Since the sign of dc/dr is theoretically ambiguous, no implicit assumption is
necessarily made about whether central banks play by the "rules of the game."

42. To facilitate the pooling of time series and cross section data, in the
final analysis I included only those countries for which data were obtained
for all years. Hence Belgium is excluded because income estimates are
available only for selected years. The countries analyzed are Austria,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Australia, Japan, Chile,
the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Rouniania, Spain, Sweden, Guatemala, El Salvador, and the
United States.

43. The main sources are League of Nations (1937) and League of Nations
(1939).

44. Attitudes toward revaluation and the toward the disposition of capital
gains are discussed in Eichengreen and Sachs (1985).

45. In the case of Germany, the difference is due to the $100 million loan
made in 1931 by the Bank for International Settlements, the Bank of England,
the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which was fully
repaid only in 1933. In the Danish case the discrepancy is due to an item
listed in the National Bank's balance sheet as correspondents abroad. The
results proved insensitive to the exclusion of these observations.

46. Since the variable to be instrumented                   is nominal money supply, the
instruments are nominal income and lagged                   nominal balances, along with the
opportunity cost variable. In the absence                   of market interest rates for the
entire sample of countries, the inflation                   rate is used to measure the
opportunity cost of holding money.

47. See the discussion in Kenen (1986). A possible explanation for this
problem is that export variability is only one component of balance-of-
payments variability. But studies which have used more comprehensive measures
of the balance of payments such as the variance of recent changes in the level
of reserves or the variability of detrended reserves are marked by the same
instability of coefficient estimates. A notable aspect of the results in
Table 2 is that the point estimate of the income elasticity of the demand for
reserves tends to be less than unity, rather than greater than unity as in
modern estimates and as suggested by the luxury good argument. This result is
attributable to the inclusion of log money as an additional explanatory
variable. The total elasticity of the demand for reserves with respect to
national income is the direct elasticity plus the income elasticity of money
demand times the coefficient on log money. If the income elasticity of money
demand is unity, the two coefficients simply can be added, yielding a total
income elasticity of demand for reserves on the order of 1.1.

48. Edwards (1983) estimates a similar specification, including a dummy
variable for years preceding a devaluation and interpreting the coefficient
estimate of -0.3 as suggesting that, prior to devaluation, reserves were some
30 percent below desired levels.

49. This follows Eichengreen and Sachs (1985). More precisely, it is
measured as the change in the annual average exchange rate between the
current and preceding years. Since reserves are measured at the end of the
year, the use of annual average exchange rates should minimize simultaneity
bias due to the impact of changes in reserves on changes in the exchange
rate.

50. In contrast, in 1931, a year marked by major convertibility crises, the
disequilibrium model adds nothing to the explanation provided by the
equilibrium version. A plausible explanation for this failure is that the
variable conflates the effects of Britain's convertibiTity crisis, which
should yield a positive coefficient, and the effects of simultaneous
devaluations by countries attempting to protect their shares of British
markets, which should yield a negative coefficient. However, adding a dummy
variable for Britain interacted with the rate of depreciation variable does
not change the result.

51. Nurkse (1944), p. 96 and passim.

52. It might be argued that a dummy variable for the U.K. should also be
included to pick up any effects associated with its (and America's) reserve
currency roles (and their liabilities to the outside world). Adding such a
variable yields a uniformly insignificant coefficient, with a t—statistic of
0.45 in the pooled equation in Table 4 and one of 0.27 in the third equation
of Table 7, for example. In the latter instance the coefficients on
individual years remain uniformly insignificant.

53. Since the dummy variables for France and the U.S. are 1.343 and 0.745,
respectively, the gold reserves are e1343 3.83 and e0'745      2.11 times
those predicted by their characteristics and the average behavior of other
countries.
                                    -36-


54. In contrast, French exchange reserves differ insignificantly from those
of other countries with similar characteristics.

55. An alternative specification is to interact the dummy variables for years
with money, under the assumption that what shifted over time was not the
average propensity to hold reserves but their elasticity with respect to the
money supply. Since the results of estimating this alternative specification,
shown in the appendix, are virtually indistinguishable from the results of
estimating the basic specification only the latter are discussed in the text.

56. The coefficients differ significantly from zero at the 95 percent level
for the one-tail test and at the 90 per cent level for the two—tail test.
