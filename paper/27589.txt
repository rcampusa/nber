Does the Commodity Super Cycle Matter?
Andrés Fernández, Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé, and Martín Uribe
NBER Working Paper No. 27589
July 2020
JEL No. F41

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper investigates empirically the role of the commodity price super cycle in explaining real
activity in developed and emerging economies. The commodity price super cycle is defined as a
common permanent component in real commodity prices. Estimates using quarterly and annual
data from 1960 to 2018 indicate that world shocks that affect commodity prices and the world
interest rate explain more than half of the variance of output growth on average across countries.
However, the majority of this contribution, more than two thirds, stems from stationary world
shocks. These results suggest that world disturbances that are responsible for low frequency
movements in commodity prices play an important but not dominant role in driving fluctuations
in aggregate activity at the country level.

1     Introduction
World commodity prices are known to display long cycles. These cycles have a periodicity
of 20 to 30 years and are called commodity price super cycles. The existing literature on
commodity price super cycles has mainly focused on documenting their frequency, amplitude,
and turning points. Less work has been devoted to estimating the importance of commodity
price super cycles for economic activity. The contribution of this paper is to identify global
disturbances that cause regular cycles and super cycles in world commodity prices and to
estimate the contribution of these global shocks to aggregate fluctuations in emerging and
developed countries.
   The econometric oriented related literature typically uses spectral analysis to identify
commodity price super cycles. Cuddington and Jerrett (2008) pioneered the use of the
asymmetric band pass filter of Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003) to identify super cycles in
commodity prices with periodicity between 20 and 70 years. Specifically, they apply this
technique to the prices of six metals traded on the London Metal Exchange. Subsequently,
Erten and Ocampo (2013) apply this methodology to the identification of super cycles in
real non-oil commodity prices.
    The present paper proposes a different methodology to identify long cycles in world com-
modity prices. It identifies the commodity super cycle as a common permanent component
in all commodity prices. The paper finds that this approach produces an estimate of the
super cycle that is in line with the one delivered by the spectral approach. In particular, as
in the works of Cuddington and Jerrett and Erten and Ocampo, the super cycle induced by
the permanent component approach displays two peaks post 1960, one in the early 1980s and
one in the early 2010s. In the academic and the financial-industry literatures, the upswing in
commodity prices leading to the 1980s peak is typically attributed to the post World War II
reconstruction of Western Europe and Japan and to the cartelization of the crude oil market.
The second peak in the super cycle is often attributed to the accession of China and other
south east Asian countries to world markets.
    The proposed permanent component approach to identifying the commodity price super
cycle has two desirable properties. First, the spectral approach applies the band pass filter
to individual commodity price time series separately. As a result, it delivers one super cycle
per commodity price. The super cycles estimated in this way are positively correlated with
one another (Cuddington and Jerrett, 2008; Erten and Ocampo, 2013). This correlation has
been interpreted as reflecting the existence of a common driver. The permanent component
approach delivers this common driver by identifying the nonstationary world shock respon-
sible for the super cycle in all commodity prices. The present paper finds that the common


                                              1
permanent component plays an important role in explaining movements in commodity prices
at frequencies typically associated with the super cycle. Specifically, it explains on average
across commodities between 67 and 91 percent of the forecast error variance of commodity
prices at horizons between 5 and 30 years.
    A second desirable property of the permanent component approach proposed in this paper
for the identification of the commodity super cycle is that it allows for the simultaneous
estimation of transitory and permanent domestic and world disturbances affecting aggregate
activity in individual countries. As a result, the permanent component approach provides a
natural environment for estimating the contribution of the shock responsible for the super
cycle to explaining variations in output at the country level.
   The paper formulates an empirical model that includes eleven commodity prices, the
world interest rate, and output of over forty small open developed and emerging economies.
All commodity prices are assumed to be cointegrated with a common nonstationary world
shock. In addition, commodity prices and the world interest rate are assumed to be buf-
feted by stationary world shocks. Output at the individual country level is driven by the
nonstationary and stationary worlds shocks, a nonstationary country specific shock, and a
stationary country specific shock. Thus, a constellation of stationary and nonstationary
world and domestic shocks compete for explaining movements in country-specific output.
The nonstationary world shock is the one responsible for the commodity price super cycle.
Thus, ascertaining the role of the super cycle in accounting for output movements in a given
country amounts to estimating the share of the nonstationary world shock in the variance
decomposition of the country's output.
   Following Uribe (2018), the model is cast in terms of detrended endogenous variables and
exogenous shocks. Since the exogenous shocks and the stochastic trends are unobservable,
almost all variables in the model are latent variables. The estimation exploits the fact
that the model delivers precise predictions for variables that are observed. In particular,
the observable variables used in the estimation of the model are the growth rates of 11
commodity prices, the level of the world interest rate, and the growth rates of output of the
countries included in the sample. The likelihood of the data is computed using the Kalman
filter, and the econometric estimation employs Bayesian techniques. The model is estimated
on quarterly data covering the period 1960 to 2018. For countries for which quarterly output
data since 1960 is not available, the model is estimated on annual data.
   The paper delivers two main results. First, world shocks that drive commodity prices and
the world interest rate are major drivers of aggregate fluctuations in developed and emerging
small open economies. Jointly the stationary and nonstationary world shocks explain more
than half of the variance of output growth on average across countries. Second, the bulk


                                              2
(more than two thirds) of the explanatory power of world shocks stems from stationary
shocks. These results obtain not only unconditionally but also conditionally on time horizons.
Importantly, even at forecasting horizons typically associated with the super cycle (20 years
or longer) stationary world shocks play a larger role than the nonstationary world shock in
explaining the forecast error variance of the level of output in individual countries. Taken
together these results suggest that the commodity price super cycle matters for explaining
aggregate activity at the country level, but that its contribution is smaller than that of
stationary world shocks.
    This paper is related to a body of work on the role of world prices as mediators of world
shocks for economic outcomes in small open economies. Mendoza (1995) and Kose (2001)
using calibrated real business cycle models fed with estimated stochastic processes for the
terms of trade find that disturbances to this international price accounts for more than thirty
percent of fluctuations in aggregate activity. More recently, Miyamoto and Nguyen (2017)
and Drechsel and Tenreyro (2018) find similar results using a Bayesian estimation approach.
Schmitt-Groh´ e and Uribe (2018) apply a more agnostic approach based on structural vector
autoregressions and find that the contribution of terms of trade shocks to explaining aggre-
gate fluctuations in poor and emerging economies is only 10 percent. These authors argue
for the need to consider more disaggregated measures of world prices to better capture the
transmission of world shocks to individual economies. Fern´
                                                          andez et al. (2017) employ a sim-
ilar empirical strategy as Schmitt-Groh´
                                       e and Uribe (2018) but expand the set of world prices
from one to four, three commodity prices and the world interest rate, and find that world
shocks mediated by this set of prices explain one third of output fluctuations on average in
a set of 138 countries over the period 1960 to 2015. This figure more than doubles when
the estimation is conducted on a more recent sample beginning in the late 1990s, as shown
by Shousha (2016), Fern´
                       andez et al. (2015), and Fern´andez et al. (2017). In the papers just
cited shocks to commodity prices, if explicitly modeled, are assumed to be stationary, and
as a result this body of work does not speak directly to the importance of commodity price
super cycles.
   Closer to the present investigation, as mentioned above, Cuddington and Jerrett (2008)
and Erten and Ocampo (2013) are key references on the estimation of commodity price super
cycles using spectral analysis. These papers and the early work by Pindyck and Rotemberg
(1990) speculate on the existence of common drivers of commodity prices, which serves as
motivation for the common component approach proposed in the present paper. Alquist
et al. (2020) apply a factor-based identification strategy to estimate the role of commodity
prices in explaining global economic activity. Benguria et al. (2018) identify the commodity
price super cycle by HP filtering and analyze its transmission using firm-level administrative


                                              3
data from Brazil.
   Finally, the present paper contributes to a literature assessing the role of transitory
and permanent shocks in driving business cycles in developed and emerging economies (see,
among others, Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007; Garc´
                                             ia-Cicco et al., 2012; Chang and Fern´
                                                                                  andez,
2013; and Miyamoto and Nguyen, 2017). It finds that for both developed and emerging
countries transitory shocks play a larger role than permanent shocks even if one conditions
on world shocks or on country-specific shocks.
    The remainder of the paper is organized in seven sections. Section 2 presents the em-
pirical model. Section 3 introduces the observables, the priors, and the estimation strategy.
Section 4 presents the definitions and sources of the quarterly data on commodity prices,
world interest rates, and output in twenty four predominantly developed economies span-
ning the period 1960Q1 to 2018Q4. Section 5 analyzes the estimated commodity price super
cycle. Section 6 presents variance decompositions, forecast error variance decompositions,
and impulse response analysis to ascertain the importance of the commodity super cycle for
aggregate activity in the small open economies considered. Section 7 estimates the model on
annual data from 1960 to 2018 for twenty-four emerging and seventeen developed countries.
Finally, section 8 concludes.


2     An Empirical Model of the Commodity Super Cycle
The empirical model is an adaptation of the methodology developed in Uribe (2018) for the
study of permanent monetary policy shocks to the study of permanent world shocks.
   The world block consists of the vector pt containing 11 real commodity prices and the
gross real interest rate all expressed in logarithms. The commodity super cycle is modeled
as a nonstationary exogenous variable Xtp with the property of being cointegrated with the
11 commodity prices. We can then define a vector of transformed world prices, denoted p
                                                                                      ^t ,

The identification assumption that all commodity prices have the same cointegrating vector
with Xtp is based on the observation that in the raw data commodity prices do not seem to
diverge from one another over time.
   The vector p
              ^t is assumed to be buffeted by a nonstationary shock, given by variations in
the permanent component of world prices, Xtp , and twelve stationary world shocks denoted
 p
zt . The vector of world prices evolves according to the following autoregressive process

where Bpp  for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, CpX p , and Cpzp are matrices of coefficients of order 12-by-
12, 12-by-1, and 12-by-12, respectively. Without loss of generality, assume that Cpzp is
lower triangular with ones on the diagonal. This is not an identification restriction. The
             p
elements of zt should be interpreted as combinations of stationary world shocks affecting
commodity prices and the interest rate. The present study does not aim to identify these
shocks individually, but rather to ascertain their joint contribution to explaining movements
in world prices and aggregate activity and to compare it to that of the nonstationary world
shock Xtp driving the commodity super cycle.
   The domestic block consists of the vector yt containing real output for 24 small open
economies expressed in logarithms. In each country, output is assumed to be cointegrated
with a linear combination of a country-specific nonstationary shock, denoted Xti for i =
1, . . . , 24 and the nonstationary component of real world commodity prices, Xtp . The ra-
tionale behind the assumption that Xtp enters in the cointegrating relationship of output is
that in models of small open economies with nonstationary commodity prices these prices
can have permanent effects on output just like nonstationary technology shocks do. We note
that this long-run relationship between output and the nonstationary component of world
shocks is not subject to the observation made by Kehoe and Ruhl (2008) that depending
on how real GDP is measured in the data, terms of trade shocks may not act like technol-
ogy shocks. Their observation has to do with the direct effect of terms of trade shocks on
measured GDP and not with the indirect effect on quantities. Allowing for the possibility
that output is cointegrated with the permanent component of world shocks is justified on
the grounds that in standard theories of the open economy, the former inherits the long-run
stochastic properties of the latter.

For each country i, the country-specific shocks consist of the growth rate of the permanent
component of output, Xti , and a stationary shock, zt

Specifically, let ut denote the vector of exogenous shocks

We assume that ut obeys the law of motion

                                                  ut = ut-1 + t,                                (3)

where t  i.i.d. N (0, I61). The matrices  and  are assumed to be diagonal. This implies
that the permanent component of world prices, Xtp , is uncorrelated with the stationary world
         p
shocks, zt ; that the permanent and transitory country-specific shocks are uncorrelated with
each other and with other country-specific shocks; and that country-specific shocks, Xti and
 i
zt , are uncorrelated with the world shocks, Xtp and zt
                                                      p
                                                        . The latter assumption is motivated
by the fact that the countries in the sample are small open economies and as such their
idiosyncratic shocks do not affect world prices. We assume that all of the correlation of output
                                                                      i
across countries stems from world shocks. Accordingly, the matrices Byy  for i = 1, . . . , 4,
as well as the matrix CyX , are restricted to be diagonal. The assumption that the world

domestic block, equation (2), allows for the possibility that world shocks affect country level
output both directly and indirectly mediated by world prices. A direct effect of world shocks
on country level output could occur, for example, via productivity shocks that are correlated
across countries.


3     Observables, Priors, and Estimation Strategy
All variables in the system (1), (2), and (3) except for the interest rate, rt

and therefore unobservable. As a result, the system cannot be directly estimated on data.
However, we will exploit the fact that the model has precise predictions for variables that
are observable. Specifically, the data used in the estimation includes the growth rates of
the commodity prices, pi
                       t for i = 1, . . . , 11, the level of the world interest rate, rt , and the
                                                                                       

growth rates of output, yt. The observable variables are related to the latent variables
through the following identities:

                                          p

where µt is a 36-by-1 vector of measurement errors distributed i.i.d. N (0, R) and R is a
diagonal matrix. We restrict the measurement errors to explain no more than ten percent
of the variance of the data.
    The relationship between the observables and the latent variables, the fact that the model

                                                 7
is linear, and that all innovations are Gaussian, makes it possible to compute the likelihood
of the data, which in turn allows for the estimation of the parameters of the model. To
calculate the likelihood it is convenient to express the model in state space form. To this
end, let
                 ^t =
                 x       p  ^t
                         ^t y         and     t =     ^t x
                                                      x       ^t-2 x
                                                         ^t-1 x    ^t-3 ut          .

Then the state space representation of the model, equations (1)-(7), is given by

                                        t+1 = F t + P t+1                                          (8)

and
                                            ot = H t + µt ,                                        (9)
                                                                                    i    i     i
where the matrices F , P , and H are known functions of the matrices Bpp              , Byp , Byy , for
i = 1, . . . , 4, CpX p , Cpzp , CyX p , Cyzp , CyX , , and  . The model is estimated with Bayesian
techniques. Draws from the posterior distribution are obtained by applying the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm. We construct an MCMC chain of 2.5 million draws and discard the first
1.5 million.
   The prior distributions of the estimated parameters are summarized in table 1. We
                                                      i     i         i
impose normal prior distributions to all elements of Bpp , Byy , and Byp for i = 1, . . . , 4. In
accordance with the Minnesota prior, we assume that at the mean of the prior parameter
distribution the elements of x
                             ^t follow univariate autoregressive processes. So when evaluated
                                                 1       1
at their prior mean, only the main diagonals of Bpp and Byy take nonzero values and all
                      i     i         i
other elements of Bpp   , Byy , and Byp for i = 1, . . . , 4 are nil. We impose an autoregressive
                                                                                          1
coefficient of 0.95 in all equations, so that all elements along the main diagonal of Bpp    and
 1
Byy take a prior mean of 0.95. We assign a prior standard deviation of 0.5 to these elements,
which implies a coefficient of variation close to one half (0.5/0.95). Also along the lines of the
Minnesota prior, we impose lower prior standard deviations on all other estimated elements
                 i     i         i
of the matrices Bpp , Byy , and Byp for i = 1, . . . , 4, and set them to 0.25.
   All estimated elements of the matrices CpX p , Cpzp , CyX p , Cyzp , and CyX are assumed
to have normal prior distributions with mean zero and unit standard deviation, with one
exception: the diagonal elements of CyX , which govern the responses of y
                                                                        ^ti   i

to an innovation in Xti for i = 1, . . . , 24, are assumed to have a prior mean of -1. This
means that a shock that increases output in country i in the long run by 1 percentage point,
under the prior, has a zero impact effect. This prior is motivated by a strand of the business
cycle literature suggesting that the impact effect on output of a permanent productivity
shock could have either sign depending on the strength of the wealth effect on labor supply

    The diagonal elements of the matrix  , representing the standard deviations of the in-
novations in the exogenous shocks are all assigned Gamma prior distributions with mean
and standard deviations equal to one. We impose nonnegative serial correlations on the
exogenous shocks (the diagonal of ), and adopt Beta prior distributions for these parame-
ters. We assume relatively small means of 0.3 for the prior of the serial correlations of the
nonstationary shocks (Xtp , and Xti for i = 1, . . . , 24) and a relatively high mean of 0.7
                            p
for the stationary shocks (zt and zt). The prior distributions of all serial correlations are
assumed to have a standard deviation of 0.2. The variances of all measurement errors (the
diagonal elements of the matrix R) are assumed to have a uniform prior distribution with
lower bound 0 and upper bound of 10 percent of the sample variance of the corresponding
observable indicator. Although not explicitly discussed thus far, the estimated model in-
cludes constants. These constants appear in the observation equation (9), for details see the
appendix. The unconditional means of the 36 observables are assumed to have normal prior
distributions with means equal to their sample means and standard deviations equal to their
sample standard deviations divided by the square root of the length of the sample period.

4         The Data
The model is estimated on quarterly data on eleven world commodity prices, the world inter-
est rate, and the gross domestic product of twenty-four small open economies. The sample
period is 1961.Q1 to 2018.Q4. The eleven commodity prices included in the estimation are
beverages, food, agricultural raw materials, fertilizers, metal and minerals, gold, platinum,
silver, coal, crude oil, and natural gas. The raw data is monthly and expressed in current
U.S. dollars. The source is the World Bank's Commodity Price database (Pink Sheet) with
the exception of coal prices, which come from Global Financial Data (GFD). The GFD coal
price is identical to the one in Pink Sheet, except that it begins in 1960.M1 whereas it begins
only in 1970.M1 in Pink Sheet. Quarterly real commodity price indices are constructed by
first deflating the monthly nominal price indices by the monthly CPI index of the United
States, then taking a simple average of the deflated values across the corresponding months
in each quarter. The data are normalized by dividing by each series' 2010.Q4 observation.
The World Bank publishes data on prices of 40 individual commodities. The aggregation
into 11 prices responds to the need to economize on degrees of freedom in the estimation.
The prices that are aggregates of individual commodities are beverages, food, agricultural
raw materials, fertilizers, and metal and minerals. The aggregation follows the definitions
in Pink Sheet. Thus the eleven commodity prices included capture information from all 40
commodity prices in the World Bank's Commodity Price database.

        Output is measured by seasonally-adjusted real gross domestic product from the quarterly
national accounts of the OECD.2
   For a country to be included in the sample, we require at least 50 years of quarterly
observations of real output. The rationale behind this restriction is that identifying the
real effects of the commodity super cycle requires observing the behavior of output over a

relatively long period of time. In addition, since commodity prices and the world interest
rate are assumed to be exogenous to the country, we exclude large economies. These selection
criteria result in the following 24 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the
United Kingdom. The panel includes only four emerging economies, Korea, Mexico, South
Africa, and Turkey. Section 7 estimates the model on annual data, which allows for the
inclusion of a larger number of emerging economies.


5     The Commodity Price Super Cycle
Figure 1 displays the estimated common permanent component, Xtp , of real commodity
prices. It is constructed by Kalman smoothing at the posterior mean of the parameter
estimate. The figure also displays the eleven observed commodity prices. We interpret the
variable Xtp as the commodity super cycle. The figure suggests that this interpretation


                                                             11
is sensible as Xtp appears to capture well the low frequency comovement of the individual
commodity prices. Over the period 1960 to 2018 commodity prices display two distinct super
cycles, one peaking in 1980 and the other in 2008. The rapid growth in Xtp between the
early 1970s and 1980 coincides with the OPEC oil price crises. As the market power of the
oil cartel weakened in the 1980s and the supply of other countries (e.g., the United States
and those located around the North Sea) rose, the downswing of the super cycle began.
The expansionary phase of the second commodity-price super cycle begins around the time
of China's accession to the WTO in 2001 and the peak is reached with the onset of the
global financial crisis of 2008. The prediction of two commodity super cycles post 1960 and
their dating is in line with the estimates reported in Erten and Ocampo (2013) using an
asymmetric band pass filtering approach on real non-oil commodity prices that picks out
cycles with periodicity between 20 and 70 years.
   The permanent component of commodity prices, Xtp , plays a significant role in explaining
movements in these variables. Table 2 displays the fraction of the variance of changes in
commodity prices accounted for by changes in their permanent component. On average
across prices, Xtp explains more than one fourth of the variance of changes in commodity
prices. The variance shares are estimated with precision, with standard deviations equal
to two percentage points on average. The permanent component plays the largest role in
explaining movements in crude oil prices with a variance share of 60 percent.
   Estimating the price block of the model separately from the output block (not shown)
yields similar results for the time path of Xtp . Also this estimation approach yields a similar
result for the average share of the variance of the growth rates of world prices explained
by Xtp (21 percent when the price block is estimated separately versus 27 percent when
it is estimated jointly with the output block). However, estimating the price block using
only information on prices yields a smaller role for the permanent component, Xtp , in
explaining the variance of the growth rate of crude oil prices (35 versus 60 percent). This
finding suggests that even though the price block is independent of the output block, data
on country level output is informative for the estimation of the parameters governing the
dynamics of world prices.
   Figure 2 presents the impulse responses of the eleven real commodity prices and the
world interest rate to a unit long-run increase in the permanent component Xtp along with
95-percent asymmetric confidence bands, computed using the methodology proposed by Sims
and Zha (1999). In general, such an innovation is estimated to induce a positive but less
than unity impact effect on commodity prices and a slow convergence to the permanently
higher level, which by construction is equal to one. Outside of this pattern crude oil displays
overshooting on impact and a convergence from above, and natural gas, fertilizers, gold, and

silver display delayed overshooting.
   Notably, an increase in the permanent component of commodity prices has a negative
effect on the world interest rate. The estimated negative conditional comovement between
commodity prices and interest rates is of import for commodity exporters with external
debt because it suggests that when commodity prices increase the country also benefits
from favorable conditions in international financial markets. Similarly, during a downturn
in commodity prices the costs of external debt rise. This result is in line with the work of
Shousha (2016) who finds that movements in the interest rate are in part driven by variations
in commodity prices. The novel aspect of the result documented here is that the negative
comovement between commodity prices and interest rates is conditional on a permanent
change in commodity prices. The finding that interest rates fall when commodity prices
increase can also be interpreted as representing a particular manifestation of a phenomenon
that Kaminsky, Reinhart, and V´
                              egh (2005) refer to as `When it Rains, it Pours.'

6     How Important is the Commodity Super Cycle for
      Economic Activity
Thus far we have documented that the permanent component of commodity prices explains
a sizeable fraction, over one fourth, of movements in commodity prices. In other words
we have documented that there is a significant commodity super cycle. We now wish to
ascertain the role of the commodity super cycle in explaining business cycle fluctuations in
individual countries.
   Table 3 displays the variance decomposition of output growth for the 24 countries in
the sample. On average across countries the permanent component of commodity prices
explains only 8 percent of the overall volatility of output growth. By contrast the transitory
components of commodity prices jointly explain 62 percent of the variance of output growth.
This result suggests that world shocks are important in explaining output movements in small
open economies. However, the vast majority of the movements stem from stationary world
disturbances. In this sense the role of the commodity super cycle is modest in accounting
for business cycles. The importance of the commodity super cycle in explaining output
fluctuations does not vary much across countries. The cross-sectional standard deviation of
the variance share of output growth accounted for by Xtp is only 2.4 percentage points.
This means that the relatively modest role played by the super cycle is not just valid on
average but applies to most countries in the sample.
    Table 3 also speaks to a large literature assessing the role of permanent versus transitory
shocks in accounting for aggregate fluctuations in emerging and developed countries (see, for
example, Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007). It shows that in the present sample of 24 countries
the vast majority of fluctuations in output growth is driven by stationary shocks. Jointly
                                           i      p
the domestic and world stationary shocks (zt and zt ) explain 80 percent of the variance of
output growth on average across countries. Noticeably this result obtains not only for the
developed countries in the sample but also for the emerging ones (Korea, 80 percent; Mexico,
93 percent; South Africa, 91 percent; and Turkey, 95 percent). The finding that stationary
shocks explain the lion's share of output fluctuations in emerging countries is in line with
those reported in Garc´ia-Cicco, Pancrazi, and Uribe (2010), Chang and Fern´   andez (2013)
and Singh (2020).
    It is of interest to ascertain the effects of the commodity price super cycle on commodity
prices and aggregate activity at different time horizons. Table 4 presents forecast error
variance decompositions of the level of commodity prices and the level of output at horizons
of 5, 10, 20, and 30 years computed at the posterior mean of the parameter estimate. The top
panel of the table shows that the commodity super cycle plays a sizeable role in explaining

the level of commodity prices at all forecasting horizons considered. The median share of
Xtp in the forecast error across the eleven commodity prices ranges from 67 percent at the
5-year horizon to 93 percent at the thirty-year horizon. This suggests that the commodity
super cycle affects commodity prices not just at its own frequency of 20 years or higher, but
also at shorter frequencies of 5 to 10 years.
    By contrast, the commodity super cycle appears to play a secondary role in explaining
movements in the level of output at horizons of 5 and 10 years, which are typically associated
with business cycle fluctuations. The bottom panel of the table shows that the contribution
of Xtp in accounting for the forecast error variance is at most 12 percent at horizons of
10 years or less. At horizons of 20 and 30 years, which fall into the range of frequencies
of the commodity super cycle itself, the contribution of Xtp to explaining the variance of
forecast errors of output increases to 19 percent. By contrast, stationary world shocks, the
                        p
elements of the vector zt , account for the majority of the forecast error variance of output at
all horizons considered. Their median contribution ranges from 75 percent at the five-year
forecasting horizon to 58 percent at the 30-year horizon. This indicates that the economic
impact of the commodity super cycle on output relative to that of stationary world shocks
is small at business cycle frequencies (10 years or less) and moderate at its own frequency
(20 years or more).
                                                            p      i
   The fact that the world and domestic stationary shocks, zt and zt , jointly explain the
majority of the forecast error variance of output even at horizons of 20 and 30 years, 65 and
60 percent on average, respectively, indicates that the world and domestic nonstationary
components, Xtp and Xti , are not the dominant drivers of movements in output.
   Figure 3 displays the impulse responses of the level of output, yt , in each of the 24
countries to a permanent world shock, Xtp , that increases commodity prices in the long run
by 1 percent. In most countries the permanent commodity price increase is contractionary.
One possible explanation for this finding is that the sample includes mostly developed open
economies that are not important primary commodity producers. As we will see in section 7,
in emerging countries the output response to an increase in the permanent component of
world prices is in general positive. But even for primary commodity producers an increase
in Xtp could have an ambiguous effect on output for at least two reasons. One is that when
Xtp goes up, all commodity prices go up. To the extend that some commodities are imported
and used as intermediate inputs in domestic production, an increase in Xtp would result in
an increase in marginal costs, which in turn, may lower domestic employment. The second
reason is that because Xtp represents a permanent increase in real commodity prices, it
might entail a large positive wealth effect for the commodity producing country. In turn,
this positive wealth effect could lead to a contraction in labor supply and in this way lower

7    Emerging Countries
As mentioned earlier, long quarterly time series for output are available mostly for developed
countries. As a result emerging countries are underrepresented in the sample. To shed light
on the importance of the commodity super cycle in emerging countries, this section turns to
an analysis based on annual data for which the coverage of this group of countries is more
comprehensive. The empirical model is the one described in section 2 except for the number
of lags and the number of commodity prices included. Because the data is annual, the model
includes only one lag of prices and output, p
                                            ^t and y
                                                   ^t . To economize on the number of pa-
rameters estimated, the 11 commodity prices are aggregated into three indices, energy, non
energy, and precious metals following the Pink Sheet aggregation scheme. Energy commodi-
ties include coal, crude oil, and natural gas. Non-energy commodities include beverages,
food, agricultural raw materials, fertilizers, and metals and minerals. And precious metals
comprise gold, silver, and platinum. The sample includes 24 emerging countries and 17
developed countries, which are listed in table 6. The output data comes from World De-
velopment Indicators. The selection of countries follows a number of criteria, which include
data availability since 1960, a population of more than three million people in 2018, not
having transitioned from a planned to a market economy, and having a common secondary
data source for output. As in the analysis using quarterly data, the model is estimated using
Bayesian techniques. The prior distributions for the model parameters are the same as those
presented in table 1.
   Figure 4 plots with thin lines the three real commodity price indices and with a thick line
their estimated permanent component, Xtp . As in the case of the estimation on quarterly
data, the commodity super cycle is a smooth stochastic trend of the three prices, and displays
two peaks since 1960, one in 1980 and the other in 2012. The peaks and troughs of the
estimated commodity price supercycle line up with the ones identified using quarterly data
on the more disaggregated commodity prices plotted in figure 1.
   As shown in table 5, the permanent component, Xtp , explains more than 90 percent of the
variation in the growth rate of the three commodity indices. Thus, as in the quarterly esti-
mation, the commodity super cycle is an important driver of commodity prices. A difference
is that now the share of the variance of the growth rate of prices explained by the permanent
component is much larger than the one estimated in quarterly data. This is to some extend
expected since aggregation across time and across commodities tends to average away the
effects of commodity specific and transitory disturbances. The table also shows that the

commodity super cycle explains 25 percent of movements in the world interest rate, a share
somewhat higher than the one obtained in the estimation on quarterly data (15 percent).
   Table 6 displays the variance decomposition of output growth in the 24 emerging and 17
developed countries considered. As in the case of the analysis using quarterly data of mostly
developed economies, it continues to be the case that all world shocks taken together, Xtp
     p
and zt , play a major role in explaining the variance of output growth. It also continues to
be the case that of the contribution of world shocks to output fluctuations the majority is
                                        p
attributed to stationary disturbances, zt . On average world shocks explain more than fifty
percent of the variance of output in emerging countries and of this two thirds are attributable
to stationary world shocks.
                                           p
   The fact that stationary world shocks, zt , explain a much larger share of the variance of
output growth than of the variance of the growth rate of prices, indicates that these world
shocks may be only partially mediated through commodity prices. An example of a world
shock that could have an output effect both directly and through world commodity prices
are productivity shocks that are correlated across countries.
    Table 6 also speaks to the literature on the role of stationary and non-stationary shocks
in explaining business cycles in emerging countries. The posterior mean joint contribution

                       p      i
of stationary shocks, zt and zt , to the variance of output growth is 57 percent with the
remaining 43 percent explained by non-stationary shocks, Xtp and Xti . This result suggests
that the majority of fluctuations in aggregate activity in the emerging countries considered
stems from stationary domestic and world disturbances.
    The explanatory preponderance of stationary world shocks in accounting for movements
in output in emerging economies also manifests itself at different forecasting horizons. Table 7
displays the forecast error variance decomposition of the level of output at horizons 5, 10,
20, and 30 years. At forecasting horizons of 5 and 10 years, which are typically associated
with business cycle frequencies, the mean share of variance explained by the stationary world
        p
shocks zt is 40 and 38 percent, respectively, compared to 19 and 24 percent explained by
the nonstationary world shock, Xtp . At longer forecasting horizons of 20 and 30 years, the
role of nonstationary world shocks increases, as expected, but does not clearly dominate
that of stationary world shocks. Specifically, the variance of the forecasting error of output
explained by Xtp has a mean of 30 and 34 percent at horizons 20 and 30 years, compared to
34 and 31 percent for the stationary world shocks.
   Figures 5 and 6 display the impulse response of output in the seventeen developed and
twenty-four emerging economies, respectively, to a shock in Xtp that increases energy, non-
energy, and precious metal prices in the long run by 1 percent. The figures also include
95-percent confidence bands. In line with the results obtained in section 6 using quarterly
data (figure 3), in developed economies a permanent increase in world commodity prices is
contractionary for most countries. By contrast, for most emerging countries a permanent
increase in commodity prices is expansionary. As pointed out in section 6, a possible ex-
planation for this difference could be that in emerging countries the production of primary
commodities represents a larger share of total output than it does in developed countries.

8     Conclusion
This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature on the transmission of world shocks through
commodity prices to economic activity in open economies. An existing literature has docu-
mented the presence of a commodity price super cycle. An empirical techniques employed
in many of these studies is based on spectral analysis and identifies one super cycle per
commodity price. The resulting super cycles are positively correlated across commodities
suggesting a common driver.
    The first contribution of the present paper is to propose an alternative definition of the
commodity price super cycle consisting in representing it as the common stochastic trend
in all commodity prices. The so-identified super cycle turns out to share a number of key
characteristics with the ones obtained using spectral analysis. An advantage of the common
permanent component approach is that it lends itself to a joint estimation of the contributions
of domestic and foreign transitory and permanent shocks to aggregate fluctuations in open
economies.
    The results of the paper suggest that world shocks are responsible for more than half of
observed variations in aggregate activity in developed and emerging economies. However,
more than two thirds of the contribution of world shocks is due to temporary disturbances
leaving less than one third to the permanent world shock that drives the commodity su-
percycle. This result obtains both unconditionally and conditional on forecasting horizons.
Importantly, even at horizons of 20 and 30 years, which are typically associated with the
periodicity of the commodity price super cycle, the permanent world shock does not clearly
dominate temporary world shocks in accounting for variations in aggregate activity.
   Taken together these findings indicate that the permanent world shock that drives the
commodity price super cycle does matter but does not play the central role in shaping short-
or medium-run business cycle fluctuations.

Appendix
In section 2, the presentation of the model omitted constant terms to facilitate the exposition.
This appendix presents the model including those omitted constant terms. As we will see
this will introduce a vector of constants, denoted A, into the observation equation (9). We
will also derive expressions for the matrices F , P , and H of the state space representation
of the model, equations (8) and (9).
