                                           ABSTRACT

We document wide and persistent variation in women’s representation and success across
graduate programs in economics. Using new data on early career outcomes for recent graduates,
including first job placement, publications and promotion, we compare (anonymized)
departments on outcomes for women relative to men graduating from the same program. We then
conduct interviews with faculty and former students from five programs higher and lower relative
outcomes. We find that departments with higher outcomes for women also hire more women
faculty, facilitate advisor-student contact, provide collegial research seminars, and are notable for
senior faculty with awareness of gender issues. We offer our qualitative evidence as the first step
in learning about “what works” in expanding women’s representation in economics.

        In 2017, women made up 32 percent of entering PhD students in economics. The share of

women in economics is below many other fields in science, technology, engineering, and

mathematics, and has not increased since the 1990s (as discussed by Bayer and Rouse, 2016).

This paper adds new data — both quantitative and qualitative — on graduate programs in

economics to understand the wide and persistent variation in women’s success across

departments. We then use these insights to identify departmental characteristics and policies

associated with a greater presence of women and higher outcomes for women relative to men.

        Our quantitative data come from two sources: newly available annual surveys of graduate

departments conducted by the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession

(CSWEP), and our own hand-collected faculty rosters from PhD-granting economics departments

in the United States from 1994 to 2017. The CSWEP survey contains information on the number

of men and women graduating from each program by year, and the number of job market

placements by job type and gender. 1 We organize our roster data to associate each faculty member

with their graduation cohort and alma mater to examine other early career outcomes, such as

placement rank, publications, and promotion.

        The opening four sections of this paper document a number of facts. First, there was wide

variation in the average share of women in the graduating classes of economics PhD programs

during the past 30 years, ranging from 10 percent to more than 50 percent of the class. This

variation is primarily explained by differences in initial admission, rather than differential attrition

from the program. Many programs, particularly the largest ones, increased the share of women on

the student body from the 1990s to the 2010s. Yet, the share of women in a PhD program tends to

be a persistent attribute of a department, with a strong correlation in the gender composition of

graduating classes over time.

       Second, we show that departments with a greater share of women on their faculty also have

more women in their student body: a 10 percentage point increase in faculty share is associated

with a 2.5 percentage point increase in student share. This relationship could be causal if, for

example, women on the faculty serve as role models for women students or it could reflect other

departmental attributes that are attractive to both women faculty members and graduate students.

       Third, we document that, on average, men and women who graduated from the same

program between 1994 and 2017 are no different in their propensity to be offered and accept a

faculty position at a US PhD-granting department or to be promoted to associate professor within

ten years of graduation. But conditional on taking a job in a US PhD-granting economics

department, men land placements at higher-ranked departments and publish more in the top

journals in the first seven years after obtaining their degree.

       Fourth, we rank 22 large (anonymized) programs on the gender gap in these early career

outcomes. We focus on programs with sufficient data for both men and women; these 22 programs

train two-thirds of the faculty at PhD programs in the US. Our ranking identifies large variation

in relative success for women in placement, publication and promotion across graduate

programs. For example, women graduating from departments with the highest outcomes for

women relative to men have 10 percent higher placement rates than men, while women

graduating from departments with the lowest relative outcomes have 8 percent lower

placement rates than men. Yet, in all cases, men are more likely than women to publish in top

journals, suggesting that women face a common set of impediments in their early careers

regardless of their graduate institution.



                                                                                               2
       These comparisons across departments guided our selection of departments for a set of

structured qualitative interviews, designed to learn more about variation in the mechanics and

culture of graduate instruction in economics. We conducted 31 interviews with faculty members

and former students at five programs — two that achieved high relative outcomes for women, two

that achieved low relative outcomes for women, and one that is in the middle of the pack. All

interviews were conducted and transcribed by Leyla Mocan, a Masters in Public Policy student at

the Woodrow Wilson School. Our interviews confirm that having women on the faculty inspires

women in the student body to succeed. The interviews also uncovered several features of graduate

programs that are associated with higher relative outcomes for women: structuring the graduate

program to formalize key aspects of advisor-student contact; creating a collegial atmosphere in

research seminars; and developing awareness of gender issues, especially by senior male faculty.

We see many of these ideas as “gender neutral,” in the sense that they would likely affect the

climate of graduate instruction for all students regardless of gender. However, our interviews

suggest that these policies may have a disparate impact on women.



The Share of Women Graduating from Economics PhD Programs



       This section presents new facts about variation in the share of women in graduating classes

from economics PhD programs. We limit our analysis to 88 economics departments (out of 127)

with a large enough number of entering and graduating PhD students that responded to the CSWEP




                                                                                                3
survey. 2 We aggregate the annual data into two broader graduation cohorts: students graduating

between 1994-2005 and between 2006-17. These periods divide our data in half.

       Figure 1 illustrates that the share of women in the graduate student body ranges from 10

percent to more than 50 percent. The share of women in a program is a persistent attribute, with a

correlation between the two time periods of 0.38 (0.45 if weighting by size of the program, and

0.53 when focusing on programs above the median size). Figure 2 shows a strong relationship

between the share of women in entering first-year cohorts (1994-2012) and graduating cohorts

(1999-2017). The coefficient from regressing share of women in the graduating class on share of

women in the entering class cannot be statistically distinguished from one, suggesting that

variation in share of women across programs cannot be driven by differential attrition, such as

gender differences in the probability of leaving the program after failing general exams. The year

groupings in this figure are selected to approximately match entering first-year cohorts with

corresponding graduating classes. We assume that students take around five years to graduate but

the result is robust to alternative assumptions.




Correlations With Observable Departmental Attributes



       Differences in the share of women graduating from PhD departments in economics are

correlated with some observable characteristics of these programs. Table 1 considers the

association between share of women in the graduating class and six attributes of a PhD program:



2
   We focus on departments that were above the 25th percentile in the number of entering
first-year students (123) and the number of graduates (68) reported to CSWEP during the full
period, and for which we have faculty rosters, to permit other analyses.
                                                                                                4
its US News department ranking; the share of women on its faculty; the field mix of its faculty; the

average size of its entering class; the share of non-US-citizen entering students, and the

institution’s location in a small, medium or large city.

       The first six columns enter each attribute separately and the last column includes all control

variables that were individually statistically significant. With 88 observations, we have limited

power to detect relationships. Yet we find that the share of women in the graduating class rises in

a clear way with the share of women on the faculty. The final column suggests that a 10 percentage

point increase in the share of women on the faculty (roughly equivalent to the inter-quartile range)

is associated with a 2.5 percentage point increase in the share of women in the graduating class.

This positive association is consistent with Hale and Regev (2014), which uses retirements of men

to consider exogenous changes in share of women on the faculty.

       A few other departmental characteristics influence the gender composition of the student

body. Programs located in the country’s fifteen largest metro areas have more women in the student

body, as do departments further down the 2017 US News ranking. Faculty research field mix,

program size, and the share of non-US students, as measured by the NSF Survey of Graduate

Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, do not seem to affect gender balance. In

other calculations not shown here, we also see no association between any of these department

attributes and the relative placement rates of women.

       To measure gender and field composition of faculty, we compile data on academic rosters

across departments of economics from three sources: the Prentice Hall Guide to Economics

Faculty, published in seven editions between 1994 and 2006; departmental and faculty webpages

accessed using the Wayback Machine (www.archive.org) to the present; and the 1989 and 1993




                                                                                                   5
AEA biographical surveys of members. More details on construction of the faculty roster are

available in Langan (2018).



Early Career Outcomes by Gender



        We now turn to examining differences in early career outcomes of recent economics PhDs

by gender. We calculate a set of relative ratios for men and women graduating from the same

programs for outcomes like academic placement, placement rank, and so on. We then ask in the

next section how those ratios vary across departments. Here, we start by identifying two average

tendencies: First, women and men who graduated from the same department are equally likely to

place into US doctoral departments. But second, conditional on receiving an academic placement,

women place into lower-ranked departments and publish fewer papers in the first seven years of

their career.

        Figure 3 graphs the job placement rate by gender for graduates of the 88 PhD programs in

our core sample from 1994 to 2017. We consider five placement categories: faculty jobs in US

PhD-granting departments, other US academic jobs, US private sector jobs, US public sector jobs,

and jobs outside of the US. The p-values under each panel refer to the null hypothesis that rates of

placement are equal for men and women. We find no statistically significant difference on average

in the placement rate of men and women graduates from the same department into faculty jobs in

US PhD granting institutions, as shown in the first panel. In contrast, women are more likely to

accept other US academic jobs, and men are more likely to take jobs outside of the United States.

        To develop more detailed early career outcome measures, we move from CSWEP’s job

placement data to our faculty rosters. We create ratios of men and women who graduated from



                                                                                                  6
each department by associating each faculty member in our roster with their department of

graduate instruction. For example, we observe one of our co-authors, Leah Boustan, in her first

job placement in the UCLA Department of Economics in 2006, but we associate her outcomes

(including her placement at UCLA) to her graduation cohort at Harvard University. We use the

reshaped roster to define additional outcomes for 22 departments with at least ten women placed

into PhD-granting economics departments in order to calculate reasonable averages. Because our

rosters include only academic economics departments and not, for instance, business, public

policy, or resource economics programs, they constitute only a subset of the CSWEP placements,

but the two placement rates are highly correlated overall, and by gender (correlation = 0.75).

       Figure 4 compares a set of early career outcomes for men and women who graduated from

the each of the 22 departments. Men place at departments ranked higher by US News and have

more publications within their first seven years of graduation. The average gap in placement rank

between men and women graduates of the same program is 5.7 rank points (Figure 4a). Figure 4b

and 4c show that men publish more papers in Top 5 or Top 55 economics journal within seven

years of graduation; publications are culled from the table of contents data provided by journals to

RePEc. The average gap in Top 55 publications between men and women graduates of the same

program is 0.58. 3 Figure 4d shows that women are marginally less likely to be promoted to

associate or full professor at a PhD-granting economics department within ten years of graduation,

relative to men from their alma mater. 4 Balanced promotion rates by gender could arise if men



3
  The relative publication records of men and women in our sample is consistent with Antecol et
al. (2018) and Sarsons (2017) for economics, and with broader results across fields summarized in
Ceci et al. (2014). For additional work on gender and publication in economics, see Blank (1991),
McDowell, Singell and Stater (2006), Abrevaya and Hamermesh (2012), Bransch and Kvasnicka
(2017) and Hengel (2018).

  Ginther and Kahn (2004, 2015) find that men are more likely than women to receive tenure in
economics, controlling for year of graduation and institutional quality of alma mater.
                                                                                                  7
publish more than women but also face a higher publication bar for tenure, given their higher-

ranked first placement.



Documenting Differences in Relative Outcomes for Women Across Departments



       We are particularly interested in documenting the variation across departments in relative

outcomes for women, including graduation rates, placement into an academic job, and later

research performance. In Table 2 we rank 22 anonymized graduate programs from A, the

department with the highest outcomes for women graduate students, relative to men in their

program, to V, the department with the lowest relative outcomes. The ranking is derived by

converting each of the outcomes into a z-score and then calculating the mean z-score across

outcomes for each department; details are presented in Appendix A.

       Average outcomes for three ranked categories (high, neutral, and low relative outcomes)

are reported in the last three rows of the table. Across these categories, women made up a similar

share of the student body (28 to 29 percent) and first-year students were equally likely to graduate

from the program, regardless of gender. Differences arise at the job placement and assistant

professor stages: at programs where women’s outcomes are higher relative to men’s, women have

10 percent higher academic placement rates than men, placement ranks that are identical to men

in their program, and only marginally lower numbers of top 55 publications. At programs where

women’s outcomes are relatively lower, women have 8 percent lower academic placement rates

than men, place into substantially lower-ranked departments, and publish 30 percent fewer papers

in a top 55 journal.




                                                                                                  8
       Check marks indicate the departments that were in the highest 10 percent or highest 25

percent of any given outcome (out of 22 departments), and Xs indicate the departments that were

in the lowest 10 or 25 percent. Departments that have higher relative outcomes for women on

average are not necessarily higher across the board. Even the highest departments by our

assessment have some low relative outcomes for women (for example, department B has low

promotion rates), and even the departments with the lowest relative performance for women have

some high relative outcomes for women (department U places women at higher-ranked

departments relative to men).



Interviews about Why Some Departments Have Higher relative Outcomes for Women



       Why are relative outcomes for women graduate students higher at some departments than

at others? One natural approach to answer this question as empirical economists might have been

to gather systematic data about each department (perhaps by conducting a survey) and then

performing a quantitative analysis to determine which attributes of a program predict success for

women. However, we only have complete outcome variables for 22 programs and we do not have

a clear a priori sense of which explanatory variables may matter, nor how to measure them.

       Instead, we conducted a series of exploratory interviews. We selected six departments to

include in our interview sample: two departments with higher than average outcomes (departments

B and C), two departments with lower than average outcomes for women (departments Q and U),

and two departments in the middle of the group (departments F and K). For each of these

departments, we started by contacting the current department chair for a short interview. From

there, we developed a snowball sample, asking the chair for a few names of faculty members and



                                                                                               9
former students to reach out to next. In the end, we spoke with six or seven graduates or faculty

from five departments, primarily in June and July 2018. Due to idiosyncratic scheduling

difficulties we dropped one department (Department F) from the sample. Otherwise, we had a 91

percent response rate for all interview subjects contacted. Our interview subjects were 55 percent

women and 45 percent men. Interviews ranged from 8 to 45 minutes, with the typical conversation

lasting 15 minutes.

       Each interview consisted of nine questions. We asked respondents to describe student

contact with advisors, seminar culture and job market preparation, and also included open-ended

questions about women in economics; we report the standard interview script in Appendix B. All

interview subjects were told that their answers would be confidential. In our discussion of

qualitative patterns, we suppress all names of individuals and of institutions, and we redact a few

details to prevent department or subject identification.

       From the interview responses, we observe a series of differences between departments with

higher and lower relative outcomes for women that are worth keeping in mind for departments

interested in raising women’s representation or balance in outcomes for their members. The

departments with the highest relative outcomes tended to have a commitment to hiring women

onto the faculty; regular and transparent processes for student-advisor contact; a more collegial

seminar culture; and a stronger general awareness of gender issues among senior faculty. Many of

these departmental characteristics could affect all students, but our interviews suggest that they

may help to narrow gender gaps in particular. In the remainder of this section, we have organized

a series of representative quotations from our interviews, emphasizing points of difference along

these dimensions between departments with higher and lower relative outcomes for women

graduate students.



                                                                                                10
Women on the Faculty

       One obvious difference between departments with higher and lower relative outcomes for

women is their commitment to and success in hiring women on the faculty. Students trained at

Departments B and C talked about what they saw as the benefits of having been taught by women

faculty, and having informal interaction with women faculty outside of the classroom. A former

student from Department B said: “Every semester we always had one female teaching us in the

core first year classes. Starting with that introduction to graduate department made me feel like ‘I

can do this and be a woman.’” 5 A faculty member at Department B agreed, touting the value of

the “women in economics group, female faculty who have lunches and dinners and coffees with

female graduate students, a group that has been around as long as I can remember.” One faculty

member from Department C described how the program was able to build up a group of women

faculty, emphasizing that “our dean puts a lot of emphasis on diversity. It could even amount to an

extra position if we come up with an additional excellent female candidate.”

       In contrast, interviewees from departments with lower outcomes for women graduate

students noted – and often lamented – their historical lack of representation of women on the

faculty. These departments were only recently beginning to prioritize hiring women or had limited

plans to do so. At our median Department K, the faculty were concerned about how their historical

lack of women faculty affected their graduate students. One faculty member said, “[W]ell it starts

with hiring. I’ve seen over the years that role models are incredibly important. I know that in our

[redacted] field, for example, we currently have five faculty members who are all male. And I



5
  Throughout the paper, we use the terms “men and women” instead of “male and female” when
discussing gender in order to emphasize that gender identity is a social phenomenon. However, we
leave the quotations from our interview subjects as stated.
                                                                                                 11
think we are all nice guys and inviting and encouraging and try to be gender neutral, yet whenever

we have a female [visitor or speaker], women graduate students flock to her much more readily,

there’s a comfort level and a role model that’s very important.” A faculty member at Department

U concurs, relaying: “I have a student who is a woman who graduated maybe ten years ago… she

thinks her experience would have been better if there were more senior female faculty, that she

would have felt more comfortable. So we’re working on that, we make offers, but like everyone

else in the senior market it’s really tough…. [I]t’s hard to get acceptances.” Unlike Departments

B and C (and even Department K), Department U has not made an intentional effort to hire women.

Instead, the chair simply tries to ensure that women are not overlooked on the job market, saying:

“I look at the women we didn’t fly out and I want to make sure that they’re not better than the

worst men that we fly out…. [We] pay attention to see if we’re gender neutral, at least in our junior

hiring.” Our interview subjects also articulated clear mechanisms whereby women on the faculty

benefit graduate students by serving as role models and mentors. 6



Advisor Contact

       In many other disciplines in the sciences and the humanities, prospective PhD students

apply to work with a particular faculty member before admission. In economics, it is typical for

prospective students to apply to the department as a whole without specifying intended field. All

of the programs in our interview set have a decentralized process for second- or third-year students

to select dissertation advisors. Many students reported approaching faculty with whom they took



6
  Neumark and Gardecki (1998) and Hilmer and Hilmer (2007) find no positive association
between the share of women on the faculty or woman-woman student-faculty advising pairs and
students’ early career outcomes. Though our findings do not necessarily directly contradict these
papers, it is worth noting that they use data from the 1970s to the early 1990s, which mostly lies
outside our study window.
                                                                                                  12
a course in the first year core or in second year field courses. This student’s experience at

Department Q is typical of the decentralized search process: “I got [Faculty Member X as my

advisor] just by talking a lot in class and by doing reasonably well… that distinguished me and

made me seen as a relatively attractive person to work with.”

       Students and faculty speculated that the current laissez faire approach can be intimidating

for many students. It may be particularly hard for students who are in the minority in economics

departments (including women) who may fear the actual or perceived skepticism of faculty. One

student at Department B reported: “I think there was some implicit bias. I remember in the first

year of the PhD program, I got [a high score on a core exam]… and my husband did not do

particularly well in the course. But I remember the professor who was teaching the course reached

out to my husband and tried to encourage him to go into [the field] and didn’t say anything to me.”

       One feature that distinguished departments with higher relative outcomes for women was

the mandatory and regular nature of student works-in-progress seminars — that is, public venues

for fourth- and fifth-year students to present new research and gather comments from a group of

committed faculty. According to a student from Department B, “you would actually enroll in a

course that was your lunchtime workshop; you were required to attend and present at least once a

quarter. The faculty were really good about going to those things. They came regularly, and they

would give you comments.”

       In contrast, at the departments with lower relative outcomes for women in our sample,

works-in-progress seminars are offered for student research presentations, but students are not

required to attend. As one faculty member describes the process, “[Department U] doesn’t have…

a centralized policy around making sure everyone presented once or twice a year…. There are

certainly students who aren’t going to any lunch, or if they are going they are not presenting. We



                                                                                                13
don’t do record keeping.” Another faculty member agrees, saying that “one or two students get

almost completely lost, they don’t make appointments with advisors, and their advisors don’t reach

out…. There are some students who are not into getting advice very much. Unless they’re a genius

and come up with some fantastic thing, they tend to get lost.”

       Offering regular public venues for student feedback may be especially important for

women, who mentioned off-campus advising settings in which they felt uncomfortable or to which

they were not invited. This concern arose at departments of all levels on our ranking. One student

from Department C described how “one senior male faculty was known for having these weekly

‘salons.’ He would take a bunch of students out to a bar. A bunch of students would go, it routinely

felt like an old boys’ club…. I know one woman who went, but I wouldn’t have felt comfortable.”

A student from Department B reported that she missed advising opportunities because of her

gender: “[My advisor] would often take graduate students for beers, and he would take the men

one on one. When I was first working with him, he said ‘we should just meet in the office, we

shouldn’t get a beer, it could be misconstrued or you might feel I’m taking advantage of you.’ So,

either my husband would have to tag along, which was really boring for him, or another male

graduate student would have to come, but I wouldn’t get as much one-on-one attention.”

       Given the highly decentralized nature of the advising process in economics, we think that

all departments have some room to experiment with developing more formalized points of student-

advisor contact. One of our interview departments recently established a procedure to match

incoming first-year students with a faculty mentor to address the unique challenges of the first-

year program. Another department is experimenting with third-year research advising groups,

wherein students are paired with field-specific faculty members. The chair of this department

acknowledges that “before, it was all decentralized, students just had to reach out” and expressed



                                                                                                 14
hope for the new structure. We have heard that other departments have instituted regular faculty

meetings to assess student progress and ensure that no students are falling between the cracks. One

model for how to regularize the various steps of graduate training is the recent and widespread

efforts to formalize the process of preparation for the job market – including holding information

sessions, conducting mock interviews, designating a faculty member to be placement coordinator,

and so on.



Seminar Culture

       Another theme that emerged from our interviews is that departments with higher relative

outcomes for women are reported to have a less aggressive and more constructive climate in their

research seminars. A faculty member at Department C portrayed seminars as “not enormously

aggressive… we don’t take someone apart for the sake of taking them apart.” A student from

Department B had a similar impression. “Like most economics departments, [seminar] was

aggressive, but it wasn’t as aggressive as some I’ve been to. You would get through your first few

slides without being asked ‘why did you choose this title? This is stupid.’ Especially with the

graduate students. They would ask questions more gently like ‘don’t you think that this would be

a problem with identification?’ Compared to ‘this is not how to identify it.’ But they wouldn’t sit

and let you make mistakes.”

       Two of the three departments with lower outcomes for women were noted for having

aggressive seminar styles. A faculty member from Department K said that “the word that comes

to mind is combative, perhaps aggressive. People start to talk about their work and much of their

audience seems to think it’s their job to find the faults and tear it all down.” A student trained at




                                                                                                  15
Department Q recalled that seminars were “fiercely competitive.” On the other hand, Department

U was described as having seminars that are “pretty polite.”

       Unlike new hiring or a reorganization of the graduate program, working toward a more

supportive seminar culture is an action that individual faculty members can take on their own,

without the need to create consensus at the departmental level. One tactic some professors take is

to save some comments on student work for a short private meeting held after the public seminar.

Meeting one-on-one after seminar can help students take stock of the various suggestions and

prioritize which next steps are most important without the immediate pressures of a presentation.

       We are agnostic about why some of the specific policies described here, including

developing a more supportive seminar culture, might be particularly helpful for women students.

Interview subjects mentioned the possibility that women are more averse to competitive

environments, more likely to take harsh feedback personally, more likely to be left out of informal

(“old boys”) networks, and so on. There is observational and experimental evidence for some of

these channels (for example, see Goldin 2015 on differential response by gender to receiving low

grades as undergraduates), and others channels would be interesting subjects for future study.



Awareness of Gender Bias

       A final difference that we noticed between departments with higher and lower relative

outcomes for women was an awareness of gender bias, particularly in its more subtle and implicit

forms, among the senior male faculty who often make up the majority of leadership positions in a

department. Awareness of gender bias may influence how these senior faculty interact with women

in their classes and in their advisory roles on a day-to-day basis. Moreover, we noticed that senior

faculty with more cognizance of gender bias react differently to incidents of harassment (which,



                                                                                                 16
although rare, were mentioned at three of our five interview departments). One woman made this

point quite succinctly, saying “my personal view is that a lot of it has to come from the men, [the

field is] still very male dominated, so until the men are comfortable nothing much good is going

to happen for the women.”

       Differences in awareness of gender bias were most obvious in responses to the interview

question “do you see any difference in the [graduate department] environment for men and

women?” Faculty at departments with higher relative outcomes for women responded to the

question in what struck us as more observant and thoughtful ways. A senior faculty member at

Department K was typical of this view in saying: “I’m confident that there is no explicit

discrimination but perhaps what is happening is more subtle or subconscious … The same

behaviors in a man say he’s forceful and defends his ideas; he’s aggressive in a good way. Those

same behaviors when taken by women tend to get a different reaction in a subtle kind of way.”

       In contrast, faculty members at Departments Q and U focused exclusively on the lack of

overt discrimination against women students and did not seem aware of (or to put much credence

in) the subtle differences in the way men and women experience the culture of the field. A

professor at Department Q said “I’m not aware of people explicitly treating anyone different in

one way or another [by gender], at least from faculty perspective. I can’t – I’m not aware of any

specific instances to that effect. As far as I can tell, nothing that I can think of comes to mind.” A

male faculty member from Department U answered similarly, reporting that he talked to graduate

students and never heard complaints about poor treatment of women students. “I’m still a little

perplexed about this,” he said. “I ask graduate students what the atmosphere is like for them, and

I never hear about any problem of them being harassed in the kind of extreme form, but even in

more subtle ways. My sense, and I acknowledge that I might be misreading, is that women in the



                                                                                                   17
department are treated well. That’s my sense but I’m suspicious about if I’m gathering information

correctly.”

       Differences in awareness of gender issues can have important consequences in how

department leadership respond to instances of harassment in a learning environment, which were

mentioned at three of the five departments that we profiled. By harassment, we do not mean

individual cases of unwanted sexual attention, although this may also happen. Instead, we heard

about intentional attempts on the part of one or more men in the student body to make women

graduate students feel unwelcome. These instances of harassment, while certainly not the norm,

did occur across the board. We also we noticed clear differences in how the faculty at each

department responded to such events. In each case, administrators condemned the harassment and

sought to punish the individuals responsible, but the responses differed in whether further action

was taken to change the underlying culture or institutions that contributed to the problem.

       At Department B, the faculty considered the event to be outside of the norm and

immediately searched for an underlying cause, which they then acted to remedy. A faculty member

at Department B tells this story: “We actually had an incident [recently] that I think was unusual,

[details redacted]. One thing we realized is that we had [a new admissions director] for the last

couple of years, and[…] we had ended up with a couple of classes with way too few women

students. Maybe only 20 percent, rather than [our usual] much higher figure. And so, the chair

basically leaned on the person in charge of admissions that we had to have a lot more women, and

our entering class this year is 50-50, which is the first time it’s been so high. We’re hoping that

means it won’t happen again, if you have more women even guys who think like that will feel

pressured not to act. That was the first time that we had anything like that in all the years I’ve been




                                                                                                    18
here, and I was really pleased that the Chair really got on it and pressured the admissions chair

rather than ignoring it.”

       At Departments K and U, instead, the harassing behavior itself was condemned but there

was no further action to assess and perhaps adjust the culture. A faculty member at Department U

described an instance of harassment and the departmental response: “We’ve had problems in the

past. For example, there were some men [engaging in redacted activities], which is an extreme

form of harassment ... In those cases, the chair went nuts. No one could figure out who was doing

it, but they warned that they would be thrown out of the university if this happened again. I believe

it has not happened anymore.” According to a student trained at Department K, a similar reaction

occurred there in response to one individual’s harassing actions. “The Chair tried to make some

statement the next year, held a meeting at the beginning of the year for all PhD students, and said

that there had been [harassing behavior], people saying things about women that you shouldn’t say

because you could hurt someone’s feelings.”

       We acknowledge that improving awareness of gender bias—in oneself and one’s

environment—is an amorphous policy, and hard to convert into direct action. Nonetheless it

seemed to us worth mentioning given its important implications for how departments reacted to

serious issues like harassment.



Conclusions



       We document substantial variation in the representation of women and in the earlier career

success of women across economics PhD programs. We provide suggestive evidence, based on a

set of structured interviews, that there are large differences in culture and practices across graduate



                                                                                                    19
programs in economics; these differences are associated with higher and lower relative outcomes

for women. Important differences across departments include the number of women on the faculty,

regularized opportunities for contact between advisors and students, and collegial research

seminars.

       Of course, such qualitative observations are only the beginning of establishing hypotheses

about how some programs have increased the representation and relative performance of women.

We encourage other scholars to test the hypotheses suggested by this paper in more detail. In

addition, it would be interesting to know whether prospective graduate students consider the types

of factors underlying these rankings when selecting departments. If so, the association between

share of women in the graduate program and positive early career outcomes could be, in part, due

to the choices of students in where to matriculate.

       Typical studies of the underrepresentation of women in scientific and technical fields focus

on early educational experiences (e.g., differential treatment in high school courses by gender) or

on the job market and in academic workplaces (see, for example, Ceci et al., 2014). These

emphases, while certainly important, overlook the potentially central role of the learning

environment in graduate school. To the extent that the culture and policies of a graduate program

matter, there may be meaningful steps that we can all take to encourage and support women in

economics. We hope that our findings will help to inform ongoing discussions – or to initiate new

ones – in departments seeking to equalize opportunities and outcomes for all their graduates.

Note: This figure plots women’s versus men’s rate of placement into various types of job, for economics PhD recipients in
1994–2017, by department (indicated by circles). The p-values shown refer to a test of the null hypothesis that placement
rates for a given job type are equal for men and women (a small p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.)
“US PhD-Granting Faculty” refers to tenure-track faculty jobs in a department that awards doctoral degrees. Points are
weighted by the total number of graduates over the entire period per department. We exclude years with imputed counts of
PhD graduates or academic placements at PhD granting institutions and large outliers from department totals.

Note: This figure plots, for various graduate departments, women’s average outcome against men’s for four early-career
outcomes. We focus on PhD graduates from 22 large US economics departments for which we can identify at least 10 women
placed from the 1987 through 2017 graduating cohorts into US economics departments with doctoral programs (or for Figure
4D, 18 graduate departments with 10 women placed between 1987 and 2010). In Figure 4A, we plot the average rank for the
first economics department where individuals place after graduation. (Departments not ranked by US News are assigned a US
News rank of 100). In Figure 4B, for each graduate department, we plot the average number of publications for men versus
women graduates in a Top 5 journal (American Economics Review (excluding Papers and Proceedings), Quarterly Journal of
Economics, Econometrica, Journal of Political Economy, and Review of Economic Studies) in the first 7 years after PhD. In
Figure 4C, for each graduate department, we plot number of publications for men and women in journals ranked 55 or higher
in the RePEc aggregate journal rankings in the first 7 years after a PhD. For post-2010 graduates, both top 5 and top 55 total
publications are predicted for those with at least one publication. In Figure 4D, for each graduate department, we plot the
share of men and women, graduating ever observed as an associate or full professor in our faculty rosters within 10 years after
receiving their PhD. The p-values are taken from a t-test of the null hypothesis that men and women’s average outcomes are
equal within department (a small p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis). Points are weighted by the
total number of graduates over the entire period per department. Dots shaded lighter indicate graduate departments that are
more equal in terms of having higher relative outcomes for women, as summarized in Table 2.

 Source: The sample includes 88 departments that responded to the CSWEP survey, exceeded the 25th percentile
of both the number of entering and graduating students among respondents, and for which we have departmental
rosters available from Langan (2018). Economics department rank comes from the 2017 edition of US News and World
Report. Faculty share women and average cohort size come from 1994–2016 CSWEP responses. Field composition is
obtained from our academic roster (Langan 2018) by counting total person-years in the department by individuals’
stated fields, using JEL codes from the 1997 AEA members survey, the Prentice Hall Guide to Economics Faculty,
1994–2006, and keyword matching from statements on individual and department websites. Share of foreign first
year students comes from 1994–2017 department responses to the National Science Foundation’s Survey of Graduate
Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering.
Note: This table reports the results of regressing women’s share of PhD recipients from economics departments on
various department characteristics: its US News and World Report department ranking; the share of women on its
faculty; the field mix of its faculty; the average size of its entering class; the share of non-US-citizen entering students;
and the institution’s location in a small, medium, or large city. Column 6 regresses share women on the size of the city
in which the department is located: the top 15 metro areas are considered “large” and smaller areas with more than
150,000 population are considered “medium.” When calculating women’s share of graduates from each department
in the CSWEP survey data, we drop department-year observations with imputed values for graduates or academic
placements at PhD granting institutions and large outlier values.

 Note: This table ranks 22 graduate departments for which we can identify at least 10 women graduates who placed into an economics department with a doctoral program from 1987 to
2017. The ranking is conducted according to relative student outcomes for women versus men. Details for the ranking procedure are in Appendix A. Icons represent a department’s position
in the distribution of each statistic (!!= top 10%; != top 25%; #= bottom 25%; ##= bottom 10%). Averages for the statistics by group are shown in the lowest three rows. Share
women is the fraction of first year women over all first year students for the whole period. For other statistics, graduate departments are ranked on relative rates, where a value greater
than 1 reflects women outperforming men (or positive growth in the case of change in share women). Change in share women reports share women graduates (women graduates divided by
total graduates) from 2006–2017 divided by share women graduates from 1993–2005 (see Figure 1). Retention is the share women graduates from 1999–2017 divided by share women first
year students from 1994–2012. This statistic compares the gender ratio at entrance and graduation, allowing 5 years for matriculation. Rates of placement at PhD is from CSWEP, and is
defined as for Figure 3. Placement rank, Top 55, Top 5, and Promotion are defined as for Figure 4.
                        Appendix A: Ranking Methodology for Table 2
To sort PhD programs according to women’s success compared to men’s, we used eight metrics
for each department:
1) Share women: the share of all first-years in the department, from 1994-2012, who are women.
2) Change in share women: the percent change in the share of women among departmental PhD
graduates from 1994-2005 to 2006-2017.
3) Retention: the share of women among graduates from 1999-2017 over the share of women
among first year students from 1994-2012.
4) Doctoral Placement: women’s placement rate, relative to men’s, into tenure-track faculty roles
in any PhD-granting department .
5) Placement Rank: the average US News rank for women’s economics doctoral placements,
relative to men’s placements from the department. For consistency of sign with other metrics, we
replace rank with 100-(US News rank), so that the “best” programs are ranked 99. Programs
without a US News ranking are assigned a value of zero on this scale.
6) Top 55: the ratio between women’s and men’s average number of publications in top 55
journals within seven years after graduating with a PhD.
7) Top 5: the ratio between women’s and men’s average number of publications in top 5 journals
within 7 years after graduating with a PhD.
8) Promotion: the relative probability that a woman, compared to a man, who graduated from the
program before 2011 is observed as an associate or full professor within 10 years after receiving
her/his PhD.
We then converted each of these relative rates into z-scores with respect to the distribution of 22
departments, and calculated the mean z-score over the eight metrics. (For the four departments
where fewer than 10 women graduate before 2011, we treat the promotion measure as missing.)
We first looked for jumps in the mean z-scores to establish natural groupings. On the “less
equal” side of the distribution, there were two large jumps of .2 standard deviations each. These
served as natural division points into the “less equal” (<-.2 SDs) and “least equal” (<-.5 SDs)
groups. There were fewer large shifts in the “more equal” side of the distribution, so we
identified smaller shifts in the same vicinity as the “less equal” thresholds. After sorting the
PhD programs into one of the five categories, we assigned anonymous IDs from A-V based on
the average z-score, with A being the highest.

Hi, is this XX?

Hi XX, My name is Leyla Mocan and I’m a research assistant working with Professor Boustan at
Princeton on a project about women in economics for the Journal of Economic Perspectives.
How are you? We are talking to several departments and trying to learn more about the outcomes
and experiences of men and women in graduate school. We were hoping to talk to you to learn
more about the experience of students in your PhD Program. All of your comments will be
anonymous, and we will not disclose your department either. Do you have any questions before
we start? [pause]

   •   To start, could you tell me a bit about the graduate program? Do most students who start
       the program end up graduating with a PhD?
           o Follow up: Are all students guaranteed funding or is the funding competitive?

   •   How do students first get connected with their advisors? When does this match tend to
       take place (first year, second year, after)?

   •   How frequent would you say the average students’ contact with their advisor is? Do
       students tend to meet with their advisors weekly or monthly, or more sporadically?

   •   Are their regular seminars or workshops for students to interact with faculty?
          o What is the seminar culture like?

   •   What is the classroom culture like?

   •   What is job market preparation process like for the average student?
         o Is the process very structured or professionalized?

   •   What do you think is distinctive about your graduate program? What sets it apart?

   •   Is the department doing anything specific to address the special challenges faced by
       women in economics?
            o Do you see any difference in the environment for men and women?

   •   Is there anyone else who I should talk to?
            o Specifically, we were hoping to talk to two additional people to get a deeper sense
               of your department: one would be a faculty member (or former faculty member)
               who can offer a long-run perspective, and another would be a graduate of the PhD
               program, preferably from before 2010, again so that person would have a longer-
               run perspective.
