                    INFlATION AND TAXATION WITH OPTIMIZING GOVERNMENTS


                                          ABSTRACT


     This   paper   extends   and evaluates previous work on the positive theory of

inflation.    We examine the behavior of governments concerned solely with

minimizing the deadweight loss from raising revenue through inflation and tax

finance.    We show that both governments that can commit to future policy actions,

as well as those that cannot precommit, will choose a positive contemporaneous

association between inflation and the level of tax burdens.         We examine the

empirical validity of this prediction using data from Britain, France, Germany,

Japan, and the United States,       Inflation and tax rates are as likely to be

negatively as positively correlated, so the results cast doubt on the empirical

relevance of simple models in which governments with time-invariant tastes choose

monetary policy to equate the marginal deadweight burdens of inflation and taxes.

 inflationary policy when the government can commit to future inflation rates is

 different from that when it cannot.     In his model, unanticipated inflation is

 more attractive ax post than
                              anticipated inflation.     Unanticipated inflation is
 at least in part a "taking," with the government expropriating consumers' wealth

 by reducing the value of real money balances.     Anticipated inflation, on the
 other hand, also distorts behavior by leading consumers to economize on real

 money balances.

      Since models with commitment lead to the first best level of
                                                                   inflation,

optimizing governments will try to bind themselves when possible.      The commitcent

case appears implausible on a priori
                                     grounds, however.      We know of no examples in
which monetary policy is regulated by law, much less
                                                     by an irrevocable monetary
constitution.      Commitment, if it exists, must therefore be enforced by zeputa-

tional considerations.      Existing models in this spirit2 rely on the ability of

consumers to change their behavior if the government deviates from the
                                                                       reputa-
tional equilibrium, a discipline that will only operate if households can

identify government deviations from equilibrium strategies.     Such identification

may however be extremely difficult in practice if the reputational equilibrium
involves the kind of fluctuations in
                                     monetary policy that we regularly observe.

the government at each point in time
                                     may view increases in the price level as a

lump aum tax.   Inflation is therefore a least-cost instrument for raising

revenue, so other taxes would not be used.     We believe models with this charac-
teristic take an overly simplistic view of the
                                               government's preferences, and we

inflation as costly.

     Models with and without commitment imply a positive relationship between the

inflation rate and tax rates.    In both cases, the marginal social cost of raising

additional revenue with the inflation tax is an increasing function of the

inflation rate.    The marginal deadweight burden of tax finance also rises with

the tax rate.     An optimizing government which equates the marginal social costs

of obtaining revenue from inflation and taxation will therefore raisa both the

inflation rate and tax rates in response to higher revenue demands.

     Although it has no bearing on the prediction of a positive correlation
between inflation and tax rates, resolving whether governments can precommit to

monetary policy is of central importance for evaluating the welfare effects of

inflation.   On dimensions other than the contemporaneous correlation between tax

rates and inflation, the possibility of committment affects the predictions of

optimizingmodels,      We focus on one such difference.   Unanticipated inflation

reduces the value of outstanding nominal government debt.      A government that

cannot restrict its future actions will therefore find it more attractive to

inflate when the stock of outstanding nominal debt is large.      This temptation

does not arise for a government that has committed to future policies, so the

correlation between the debt stock and inflation may prove useful in distinguish-

ing models with and without commitment.     Unfortunately we also show that if the

government can tax outstanding government debt without resorting to the inflation

tax, then the correlation of inflation with various measures of nominal liabilit-

ies does not depend on the possibility of commitment.

     Readers who pay serious attention to the actual pronouncements of policy

makers may believe that revenue considerations have no place in a positive theory

of monetary policy.     Central bankers rarely, if ever, mention the seigniorage
                                       -4-

that results from alternative monetary policies.   While we view this as evidence

against the class of optimizing models studied below, and this skepticism is con-

firmed by our empirical findings, it might nevertheless be possible to reconcile

the actual speeches of policy-makers with the optimizing government models.     When

government spending is high governments tend to raise taxes and also to increase

debt finance.   Central bankers who react by purchasing government bonds with

newly minted money, thereby raising seigniorage revenues, may rationalize this

behavior with feat of high interest rates generated by large government debt

scocks.   Theic behavior may however be consistent with the predictions of

positive models of government based on deadweight burden minimization.

     Our analysis of inflation and taxation is divided into two parts,   The first

part, which consists of sections 1 through III, develops the theory while the

second part presents the empirical tests. Section 1 considers the classic case

of inflation and tax choice when the government is able to commit.   Section II

assumes instead that committmenc is impossible and that the government is unable

to tax govecnment bonds directly.   The third section introduces bond taxation in

a model without commirrent and shows its implications are similar to those of the

commitment case.   Section IV studies the empirical relationship between taxes and

inflation in the U.S., U.K., Japan, West Germany and France.   We show that a

positive association between inflation and the level of tax burdens obtains only

in the U.S. and Japanese data;   a negative relationship emerges in the other

three countries.   We therefore conclude that simple positive models of government

behavior such as those analyzed here are incapable of explaining monetary and



     3Our analysis only applies if the central government and the central bank
are actually cooperating. Alesina and Tabellini (1987) present a model in which
these arms of government behave noncooperatively.

fiscal policy.

I,   Inflation and Taxation with Precommittment

     This section models an optimizing government's choice of inflation and tax

rates when committment is possible and when these policies are chosen only with

regard to their revenue effects.      The government's objective is to minimize the

total cost of raising revenue, given by

increasing function while h(    ),   the   tax distortion, is increasing and convex.

       The increasing and concave function v( ) gives the benefits from deflation

so that the costs of inflation are         -v(    )   -   This   function is not just intended to

capture the distortionary effects of inflation on the demand for money, as in the

work of Drazen (1979), Phelps    (1973),         Kimbrough (1986) and Lucas (1986).

Instead, it reflects the many possible consequences of inflation enumerated by

Fischer and Modigliani (l978).        In particular, the government might be concerned

with the distributional consequences of inflation as well as with the difficul-

ties inflation introduces in a world with pervasive nominal contracts.                         The

specification of inflation's cost in (I) is therefore more general than that

which would emerge from explicit analysis of a representative consumer economy.

      The government's budget constraint is described by the evolution of real


     4Because we consider relatively many effects of inflation, there is no
presumption, as in the more narrow models of Kimbrough (1986) or Faig (1987),
that the optimal tax rate on money is given by the Friedman rule. This presump-
tion actually disappears as soon as money services are not viewed as perfect
substitutes for other arguments in the utility function (see Romer (1987)).

balances and the nominal interest rate at t depend on anticipated inflation

between t and t+l.          Real money balances could also depend on income and taxes

without altering our substantive conclusions, although for simplicity we ignore

these effects through most of our analysis.

         Commitment can be aodeiled by allowing the government, which maximizes (I)

subject to (2) at time         t,   to pick a contingency plan for tax rates and prices st

t+l.     This plan, which allows taxes and inflation to depend on the realizations

of all tel variables including                 and       is chosen before households choose

their money holdings.          Thus real money demand and interest rates are determined

after the government chooses the next period's taxes and inflation.                     Allowing the

government to choose a contingency path for prices is only an expository device,

It    is equivalent    to having the government pick the contingent path for the money

supply in all future periods.

        When the government at t chooses taxes and inflation for period t+l. it must

take as given the end-of-period stock of government liabilities, b, +                   m.       This

is the only state variable for the government's problem:                tax and inflation

choices beyond period t are affected by the past only through b, + m,.                     The

division of these liabilities between money and bonds, however, depends on the

government's decisions in period t.            Beosuse the stock of liabilities is the only

they cannot affect the government's welfare,

The government faces this constraint in minimizing the social losses defined by

         Equation (5) links the equilibrium level of inflation to the tax rate for

given values of income and real money balances.                    It states that positive shocks

to government spending that raise taxes and their associated excess burden should

be accompanied by increases in inflation that raise the marginal excess burden

from seigniorage.             It also states that inflation between t and t+l should be an

increasing function of            m/y1.          When this ratio is large, the revenue from a

given inflation rate is high since, with commitment, revenue from inflation is

obtained at t+l as people replenish the money that has been depleted by infla-

tion.    The more money they carry over, the larger these replenishments must be

and the lower the relative cost of inflstion.6




II.     Inflation and Tax Policy without Committment or Bond Taxes

       We now consider the government's choice of inflation and tax rates when

committment is impossible.                 This implies that the government in period t can only

is more costly when money holdings are higher. While this might be true when the
only costs of inflation ate the distortions in money holdings it is unlikely to
be true for other costs of inflation.

government is thought of as picking the price level with interest rates and
                                                                            money

       The inflationary erosion of government liabilities is totally anticipated,

III.    Inflation and Tax Policy: No Committment. with Taxes on Bonds

       The previous section provides one channel for distinguishing    the commitment




     8This raises the question of why governments choose to issue nominal
liabilities.  Bohn (1987) provides one possible explanation for this puzzle.
                                                          -   12


and no-commitment             cases.     This   Section       ShOws that         this       approach        is   sensitive   to

the   menu of taxes available to the government.                               The level of nominal bonds

affects inflation in the previous section's model because inflation is the only

way to tax these bonds.                 We now consider a model in which the government can also

levy direct taxes on government bonds, and show that it is much more difficult to

distinguish between scenarios with and without commitment.

      If the government can tax government bonds at rate r, real debt evolves as:


(8)           bt
                    =
                             [b1(l+i1)z           +                        +     g      -
                                                                                              5y        -

                                                                                                                 m.
where z
          t
               1   -    rt      The existence of r        t does       not affect the results in the

commitment case,             since if a modification of the bond tax is known in advance,

nominal interest rates will adjust to keep after-tax returns constant.

      Without commitment, however, a government would not use distortionary taxes

if increasing direct taxes on government bonds were possible and if such taxes

were perceived to be costless.                   To explain the existence of other taxes and

inflation, direct bond expropriations must therefore be perceived as costly.9                                                     We

thus assume that the government now maximizes:

                        j=O

                                                                       -

                                                                                                       t+j


where f( ),    which is          increasing and concave, represents the government's utility

from repaying its debt.                 In this no-commitment scenario, the state variables that

affect the government's choices in period t are the level of real debt obliga-

                                 and the level of past money balances,

     9One possible cost is the redistribution associated with bond taxation.
Rotemberg (1987) explores a model in which the government cares directly for the
welfare of the bondholders.

       By the argument in the previous section, money demand as well as interest

rates at t depend only on the level of bonds and not on the revenue mix between

taxes and inflation.     The government at t must therefore be indifferent to small

                                                                                             The same

approach to analyzing optimal choices that we followed above then yields                             first

order conditions equating the marginal cost of income tax finance with that from

inflation and bond taxation:

                                   ,   t                c-I

       Equation   (10) describes equilibrium             inflation as             a function of real money

balances, income, and the tax rate.                It differs from the first order condition

without commitment only in the absence of                    art   m. term)0          Although the two first

order conditions are empirically indistinguishable, it is plausible that infla-

tion will be lower under (5).              Regardless of whether the government can precom-

mit, inflation raises revenue because individuals need more printed money to

retain their real money balances.                Commitment dampens this effect because the

government realizes that raising expected inflation reduces desired real money

balances.    Without commitment the current government cannot affect future

inflation, so raising prices appears to have a less deleterious effect on

government                is only an illusion. Without commitment inflation
              revenue. This
tends to be higher, reducing earlier governments' revenue from money creation.

       10The elasticity of money demand with respect to expected price changes, m.
will   be treated as constant in what follows. As Mankiw (1987) notes, treating 1
this elasticity as depending on inflation would not affect the analysis. This
dependence would be confounded with the dependence of v' on inflation.

Past   revenue losses are however ignored by the current government, so inflation

is a more attractive revenue source for governments that cannot precommit than

for those that can.

       Since equation (5) is so similar to (10) the relationship between taxes and

inflation cannot really be used to test for the presence of commitment.             This

does not imply that it is impossible to distinguish the commitment case from the

no-commitment scenario        since the two may yield different predictions along other

dimensions.     For example, the two cases differ in their implications for the

intertemporal behavior of tax rates,           An optimizing government that is able to

commit must be indifferent between the actual path of taxes and an alternative

path which raises one additional dollar of revenue today and one less dollar (in

present value terms) tomorrow,           Barro (1979) has shown this implies that tax

rates must follow a martingale:


(12)                      =

In the appendix, we derive the analogous relationship without commitment:


             h'(9)            + (R   -
(13)                  PEt[R              P/P1)(dm/dO)Jh'(91).
Equation (13) shows that the expected tax rate change is related to expected

inflation.     The sign of this relationship, however, will depend upon the second

derivatives of money demand with respect to inflation and taxes.



IV.    The Empirical Relationship between Inflation and Taxes

       This section evaluates the models of the previous sections in light of the

relationship between taxes and inflation in several nations and over several time

periods.     We first consider the empirical counterpart of equation       (5),   which is
                                                    -    15       -




valid   with bond taxation regardless of whether the government can commit and

without bond taxation provided the government can precommit.U                                       Mankiw (1987)

estimates an equation similar to this on post-war U.S. data.                                      We also estimate

the empirical counterpart of (7), the first order condition that holds with

neither commitment nor bond taxation.                   Although inflation and the level of

taxation have moved together during the last century in the United States,

evidence from other nations yields very little support for the view of government

behavior analyzed above.

        To estimate the first order condition implied by government optimization, we

must specify functional forms for h(               )    and v(             ),   the   deadweight losses due to

taxation and inflation resecttvely.                     We assume constant elasticity functions so

that our objective function is a generalization of the CES welfare function:

h(9) —                                            z2(Pi/P)1 for Zl                                 a and $   positive
           zl(8t)m and    v(Pi/P)                                                           z2,

constants.      This implies that (5) can be written as


(14)          ln(F/Pi)        m     +     i                   +
                                                                      12   ln(m1/y)
where
         11    a/$ and 12
                          =   l/$.      This      specification                 relaxes Mankiw's (1987) assump-

tion that the ratio of               to       is constant.

model is easy to reject.           We are not, however, interested in testing the proposi-

tion that the theory can explain the exact relationship between taxes and

                                                                         fraction

     11Under our assumption that the Fisher hypothesis holds, the empirical
results do not depend on whether inflation or the nominal interest rate is used
as the dependent variable. Mankiw (1987) found similar results in the United
States time series using both dependent variables.
                                         -   16   -




of   the movements in these series.    We rherefore test the prediction that higher

taxes tend to be associated with higher inflation by simply adding an ertor term,

     to (14) and estimating the resulting equation for several countries.

      Our estimation employs annual data for five countries: the United States,

Britain, France, Germany, and Japan.      Taxes and gross national product are flows

during the calendar year.     Our analysis is confined to taxes levied by the

central government, since this is the level of government choosing monetary

policy.   Price indices, measured using consumer prices in each country, are

annual average values.     The stocks of money and debt are measured as mid-year

values or yearly averages.     Since both inflation and the tax rate are highly

persistent, ordinary least squares estimation of (14) would recover the trends in

the two aeries.   We therefore add a time trend to (14) and estimate the resulting

equation allowing for residual autocorrelation, or we difference        (14) and

estimate the resulting specification by ordinary least squares.

      We begin by analyzing the time series evidence for the United States, using

two measures of the tax rate          The first is the ratio of federal government

tax receipts to GNP.     If the government chooses its mix of tax instruments

optimally, then the level of taxes divided by ONP is a summary statistic for the

degree of tax distortion.    Ir also avoids the problem of computing the marginal

deadweight loss of particular tax instruments taking account of the interactions

between tax instruments and of the other pre-exiscing distortions, and it is

available for a long time period.     The second measure of the tax burden is the

weighted average marginal tax rate on labor income computed by Barro and Sahasa-
kul (1986).   Their tax measure, including both federal income and Social Security

taxes, is available for the 1916-1985 period.         Data limitations restricted our

sample period    to begin in 1890, even when we use T/GNP for our tax measure.12

      The results of estimating equation (14) for a variety of different sample

periods are shown Table 1.      The tax rate is positively correlated with the

inflation rate for all of the sample periods, but the strength of this correla-

tion is strongest for the post-World War II period.          For the entire 1891-1986

period, a ten percentage point increase in the share of taxes in GNP predicts a

one half of one percentage point increase in the inflation rate.          The tax rate

and trend, however, explain less than six percent of the variation in inflation

rates.    The estimates in the AR(l) with trend and the differenced equations are

similar, with slightly larger effects of the tax rate on inflation in the latter

equations.      For the period since 1919 but excluding World War II, the coefficient

estimates are close to those for the full sample, although now the null hypothe-

sis of no tax effect on inflation cannot be rejected at standard levels.

         This conclusion is reversed when the sample is restricted to the post-war

period.    A   ten percent of GNP increase in taxes now raises the inflation rate by

approximately 3.4 percent, and the impact coefficient is estimated much more

precisely than for the longer sample periods.          When the Barro-Sahasakul marginal

tax rate series is used in place of the tax-to-GNP ratio, the estimated inflation

effect of a tax increase is smaller.      A ten percentage point rise in the marginal

tax rate raises the inflation rate by just under two percentage points.

         The coefficient on                  in the full sample equations in Table   1   is
                              log(m1/y)

     12The Consumer Price Index for the United States is reported in Historical
Statistics of the United States, and was updated using the Economic Report of the
President. The money stock is the stock of high powered money, reported in
Friedman and Schwartz (1982, Table 4.8). The interest rate is the nominal call
money rate, again as reported in Friedman and Schwartz with updates by the
atthors. Government debt is measured as the publicly-held stock of government
debt on July 1 of each year, as reported in Federal Reserve Board, Banking and
Monetary Statistics.

available for Britain.    For the period 1872-1985, we constructed a tax-to-GNP

these four countries.    The positive association between inflation and taxes -hat

appears in U.S. data does not generalize.        The French and British data show a

statistically     ignificant and negtiye relationship between tax levels and the

inflation rate.    In Germany the relation is again negative although the standard

error of the estimated coefficient is too large to reject the null hypothesis of

no tax effect,    Only the Japanese data confirm the U.S. finding of a positive

relationship between inflation and taxes.        A ten percent of GNP increase in the

tax burden is estimated to increase the inflation rate by 3.1 percent in the

AR(1) specification, and by 4,7 percent in the differenced equation.       The

estimated effects of log(m1/y1) on inflation are positive in each equation in

Table 3, in contrast to the often negative coefficients for the United States.

the notion that seigniorage is available even when dollars are measured in terms
of a commodity. Seigniorage is possible as long as the gold stock held by the
government doesn't bear any relation to government minted currency. Of course,
the gold standard might be viewed as providing a commitment to prices so that
inflation can indeed be optimally chosen as in the model of Section I.

       When the   inflation-tax        intetaction        is estimated   using   a specification

            log(m1/y)
statistically significant negative coefficienta on the tax variable.                           For

Britain, the absolute size of the tax coefficient declines substantially in the

AR(l) specification although not in the differenced specification.                           For Japan,

the tax variable baa an even stronger poaitive association wirh inflation when we

exclude the money-to-income            rati          Finally, the coefficient on the tax share for

Germany moves from negative in the equation with                      ln(m1/y)     to positive withbut

this variable, but the coefficient is never statistically significant.

       The failure of the estimates of equation (14) to reflect positive associa-

tion between tax rates and inflation might he due to an incorrect apecification.

We have asaumed that governments can either precommit, or that if they cannot,

that they can tax outstanding government debt without resorting to inflarion.                              If

these assumptions are incorrect, the appropriate first-order condition linking

taxes and inflation ratea ia equation (7), which includes the government's

outstanding interest bearing debt.                   Under the same parametric aaaumptiona used to

derive (14) from (5), the version of (7) that we estimate is:


(15)    ln(F/F11)             m    +
                                        l   ln(e) +            2   ln((b1(l+c1) +      m1)/y]        +


Since the earlier results auggeat that differencing and autoregreaaive correc-

tions with time trends yield similar results, we present only the latter.

       Table 5 reports estimates of (15) for all five countries in our sample.                            The

inclusion of the broad government liabilities variable does not substantively

alter our estimates of the aaaociation between taxes and inflation.                           In par-

ticular, the coefficient on the tax rare remains negative and statistically

significant for Britain and France, positive and significant for Japan and the

United   States, and statistically insignificant for Germany    The broad liability

measure is less correlated with inflation than the                 variable that
                                                      log(m1/y)
appeared in Table 3.    This is reflected in lower B2 values, as well as lower t-

ststistics.   The point estimstes for the liability variable are negative (i.e.,

incorrectly signed) for Germany and Japen, whereas the money-to-ON? ratio hsd the

sign predicted by the foregoing theory.

     The superiority of models including only the ratio of money to ON?, relative

to models with total government liabilities as a abate of ON?, can be demonatat-

ed by estimating tegteseion equations which include   kth variables.
                                                                   Thia      is

equivalent to the non-nested hypothesia teat of the null hypothesis that one

variable affects the inflation tate against the alternative that the other

variable affects it.    For the U.S., Germany, and Japan, including both variables

yields a negstive coefficient on the liability variable but a positive and

usually statistically significant coefficient on the money variable.     For France

both variables have positive but statistically insignificant coefficients, while

for Britain both are positive and statistically significant, but the coefficient

on money ia roughly three times as large as that on the broader liability

measure.    Overall, the results are more aupportive of a specification including

the ratio of lagged money to ON? than the total level of government liabilities.

     The final empirical issue we address concerns the links between intertem-

poral changes in tax rates and other government choices, notably inflation.        In

the last section we showed that with commitment the tax rate should evolve as a

martingale, while in the nc commitment case future tax rates should be partially

predictable using lagged inflation rates.     We explore this question by estimating

simple regression models relating the change in the tax-to-ON? ratio between

periods t-l and t to the inflation rate in period t-l:

       Table   6 presents estimates of equation (16).      In four of the five nations,

high inflation predicts an increase in the level of taxation.          In the U.S. and

France a one percent increase in the inflation rate predicts an increase of

approximately one half of one percent in the tax-to-GNP ratio.          The finding for

France is statistically significant at conventional levels, while in the U.S. th

null hypothesis that inflation cannot forecast tax changes would be rejected at

the 10 percent level.      In Britain and Germany each percentage point of inflation

predicts higher taxes of approximately one quarter of one percent of CNP, with

the British results rejecting the null hypothesis of no effects at high con-

fidence levels.       Finally, in Japan, there is a negative but imprecisely estimate

relationship between the inflation rate and the change in tax burdens.           These

                                                                      the

martingale models of taxation developed by Barro (1979) and others,15

because they provide weak evidence against the assumption that governments can

precommit to future actions.

possibility,   which begs the question of what objectives guide monetary policy, is

that inflation is determined without regard to government revenua needs.

Inflation might be chosen to stabilize GNP, for example.      Even though traditional

                                                           for coincident
Keynesian presciptions for stabilization policy would call

reductions in tax burdens and increases in the money stock, however, tha observed

correlation between taxes and inflation is likely to remain positive.      Stabili-

zation policy in large part responds to shocks,      When exogenous factors cause a

business slowdown, borh inflation and the share of taxes in GEP are likely to

decline)'6     If the government responds with a monetary expansion accompanied by a

tax cut, the ratio of taxes to GNP will be unambiguously lower than without the

shock and associated stabilization.     Inflation will also be lower, unless the

stabilization policy rote then offsets the disturbance it was designed to

correct)'7     The positive correlation implied by the deadweight-loss minimization

above is therefore also characteristic of stabilization-induced variation.

     A second potential explanation is that governments are unable to adjust the

structure of taxes frequently enough to enforce the first order conditions

implied by optimizing models.     This view is implicit in the work of Feldstein

                                                           burdens as largely
(1983) and others who view the effects of inflation on tax

accidental and unanticipated.     Even when tax rules are costly to change, however,

                                         the links between taxes and inflation
policy makers might be able to implement


                                                                            aith
     16Hollowsy (1984) suggests that the elasticity of federal tax receipts
        to GNP is about 1.4.  A decline in output will therefore lead to a
respect
decline in the tax-to-GE? ratio. Given the progressivity of the income tax it
will also generally lower the average marginal tax rate.

stabilization policy could appear in the data if a substantial share of
        variation was due to          tastes on the part of government. Such
policy                       changing
variation is predicted, for example, by models of "political business cvc.es

described   above.   An unindexed tax aystem which raises corporate tax burdens

during inflationary periods because depreciation is based on historic cost, for

example, generates a positive association between tax rates and inflation.

     A final possibility is that the government's objective function which guides

inflation and tax policy varies over time.         This could explain our findings,

regardless of whether inflation is chosen on the basis of revenue or stabiliza-

tion considerations.    The perceived costs of inflation and taxes may change with

the political perty in power, shifts in voter preferences, or changes in the

transactions or tax-collecting technology.8 Alesina and Sachs          (1988) provide

aome support for the view that different political parties in the United States

have different aacroeconomic preferences, and Hibbs (1986) doonments apparent

variation through time in the inflation-unemployment preferences of the U.S.

electorate.     If governments that are willing to tolerate inflation also like

expansionary policies in general, then total revenues will decline in periods of

high inflation, reinforcing the negative inflation-tax correlation.19
      The view that negative inflation-tax correlations are due to unstable

government tastes is mildly supported by the fact that countries with more stable

governments and less diverse political parties, such as postwar Japan and the

United States, exhibit positive tax-inflation correlstions.        Countries with more

political instability, such as Britain and France, tend to exhibit negative

correlations.     Further work could usefully explore how political institutions or

other   aspects of social structure are related to the inflation-tax correlation,

        The premise that governments raise revenue by equating the marginal

deadweight losses on different tax instruments can also be tested in other

contexts.    Provided consumer tastes, production parameters, and the tax technol-

ogy do not vary auhatantilly over rime, the marginal deadweight lossea from dif-

ferent tax instruments should move together.            An increase in one tax rate, due to

increased spending, should raise the marginal deadweight burden from that tax and

          Aorendix:    Tax Dynamics Without Commitment or Direct Bond Taxation

       In an equilibrium of the game between successive governments which cannot

commit to the path of the money supply, the government must always be indifferent

between maintaining the equilibrium level of taxes and changing taxes by a slight

amount.    Otherwise, given the differentiability of our problem, the current

government would change taxes.             By raising taxes slightly today, the government

incurs a cost              The reason such slight tax increases are not detrimental
                h'(O).
must be that, in equilibrium, such a tax increase would lead future governments

to lower taxes.       This expected fall in taxes at, say, time t+j raises welfare by

               This appendix derives a dynamic relationship for taxes by developing

this indifference between current and future taxes.

       We consider an equilibrium in which the contingent path for tax rates and

inflation is                      For simplicity, we focus on the case in which income
                19r'r-lt
is always unity    (therefore             — 0) and   lc'(    )   is a constant.   We starr by analyz-

ing what happens if the government at t raises its taxes slightly.                       Individuals

and firms will rationally anticipate rhar taxes and inflation will be lower in

the future.    Current real money balances therefore rise while current nominal

interest rates fall; if the Fisher effect holds, the real rate is unsffected.                          In

the next period, there is an as yet unspecified equilibrium change in taxes

          and inflation                       These changes causs the end of period debt at

       The government at t+l must also be indifferent with respect to small changes

in tax rates.     This means that the present discounted value of the welfare costs

from period r+l forward must be the same whether the government at t÷l levies

taxes    equal to 9t÷l +    d9+i     (as would actually happen if the government at t

deviates in the ptesctibed manner) or equal to      +                                 where
                                               9t+l                            d91

The tax rate given by (A2) hss the festure that real debt at the end of period

t+l is the same as it would hsve been had the government at t not deviated from

the equilibrium path.         If the government at t+l imposed this tax, then govern-

ments after t+l would abide by the original equilibrium path.

       The indifference of the government at                    ti-i   enables us to compute the welfare

consequences of tax changes at t by pretending that taxes at t+l will be used to

offset the period t tax increaee,                   This computation yields the total welfare

effect of a tax increase at t:

                                                                                  -




                                                                         +

The three tecra in this expression represent the cost of the extra period t

taxee, the cost of the extra t+l taxes under the counterfactual assumption that

taxes are given by (Al)       ,   and the cost of the increased inflation between t and

t+i respectively.

       Using equation (10) and the requirement that government at t must be

indifferent with respect to smaii changes in taxes (setting dW — 0 in (A3)) we

obtain:

(A4)                  — pE[P. + (R
                                              Pc/Pt+i)(dmt/detnh'(ot+i).

Thia expresaron is similar to the random walk expression (12) which obtains with

conssitment,   but differa by inclusion of the term (kPt/Pt+i)(dmr/d9t).                         This   tern

is present because when the government at t raises tsxes. agents expect lower

inflation and real money balances rise.                     This increases government revenue, so

taxes can fall tomorrow by more than R times the current tax increase.                           Since tax
                                            -   30   -




increases are   associated with relatively large tax reduction tomorrow the

deadweight burden of taxes tomorrow must be low relative to that given in (5); in

other words                  must be below h'(9).        Still, for the special but not

rste of inflation (A4) implies thet taxes follow a martingale.

     Equation (A4) requires that the expected change in tax rates be associated

with expected inflation.        High rates of inflation tend to be inefficient so a low

value for              means that the benefits from raising real money balances by
            ttt+l
reducing expected inflation are high.           On the other hand, for plausible demand

functions for money, the actual increase in real money balances from an increase

in taxes is smaller with higher inflation.LO             Stated differently, whereas the

first term of   (P.   -
                          P/F÷1)(d.m/dO )   always rises with expected inflation, the

aecond term may fall, making the effect of inflation on the difference between

the left and right hand sides of (P4) ambiguous.            Nonetheless it is worth

studying whether the expected rate of change of taxes depends on the current

expecetd rate of inflation, as we do in Table 6.




     20This is for instance the case if the demand for money is an
exponential function of           while hQ end v(.) are also exponential
functions.
