   INVESTORS' PORTFOLIO BEHAVIOR UNDER ALTERNATIVE
    MODELS OF LONG-TERM INTEREST RATE EXPECTATIONS:
         UNITARY, RATIONAL, OR AUTOREGRESSIVE
               B BENJAMIN M. FRIEDMAN AND V. VANCE ROLEY1

          This paper develops behavioral relationships explaining investors' demands for long-
       term bonds, using three alternative hypotheses about investors' expectations of future
       bond prices (yields). The results, based on U.S. 'data for six major categories of bond
       market investors, consistently support an autoregressive expectations model. The results
       also have implications for further aspects of investors' portfolio behavior, including
       expectations formation, response to inflation, and speed of adjustment.


THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC of a long-term asset, in contrast to a
short-term asset, is the possibility of future movements of the asset's price. In the
simplified but familiar context of nominally denominated fixed-income financial
assets, for example, wealth or rate-of-return maximizing investors cannot choose
between one-period securities and multi-period securities without at least impli-
citly relying on some expectation of the multi-period security's future price.2 Both
economists and financial market participants well appreciate the crucial role
which such expectations play in portfolio allocation decisions.3 Nevertheless, the
nature of the process which determines these all-important expectations remains
largely unknown. Many economists who have done empirical research on the term
structure of interest rates have based their models on a maintained hypothesis
involving some form of adaptive expectations assumption, but have not explicitly
tested this hypothesis against plausible alternatives.4 Furthermore, empirical
research on this question has at best been vague about the way in which investors'
portfolio behavior presumably responds to their interest rate expectations.
  The object of this paper is to investigate more explicitly, within the limited
context of investment in long-term bonds, the formation of investors' expec-
tations. Specifically, this paper tests, using U.S. data, three alternative hypotheses
about investors' expectations of future long-term bond prices (yields): (i) Expec-
tations are unitary if the expected future price is identical to the currently
prevailing price. (ii) Expectations are rational if the actual future price is dis-
tributed about the expected future price with zero bias. (iii) Expectations are
autoregressive if the expected future price is a function of currently and previously
prevailing prices.

     Alternatively, an investor would need to have an expectation of the yield on one-period securities
in each time period until the multi-period security's maturity. If the two securities were perfect
substitutes, so that investors' arbitrage trading enforced at all times the term-structure equilibrium
condition of Hicks [20] and Lutz [27], expectations about future prices of multi-period securities and
exectations about future yields on short-term securities would be equivalent.

    Since the expectations in question are unobservable, in order to investigate
 their properties it is necessary to construct tests involving observable magnitudes
 upon which it is plausible to postulate that these expectations exert some
influence. This paper follows previous researchers in choosing financial market
behavior as the realm in which unobservable interest rate expectations may most
plausibly have an observable effect.5 Instead of using the familiar "term-struc-
ture" approach of testing these three expectations hypotheses by imbedding them
in unrestricted reduced-form equations relating the yields on different securities,
however, this paper examines them in the context of behavioral relationships
directly explaining investors' demands for bonds. In assessing the results of these
tests, therefore, it is interesting to consider the implications not just for expec-
tations formation but for more general aspects of portfolio behavior as well.
  Section 1 explains the three alternative hypotheses about the formation of
expectations, motivating each by an intuitive statement of its basic rationale
together with references to its rigorous development in the theoretical literature
(as well as previous empirical applications). Section 2, which draws on the authors'
previous work on portfolio behavior, briefly develops the bond demand relation-
ship to be used to test the competing expectations hypotheses. After a short
summary of estimation issues in Section 3, Section 4 summarizes the results of
estimating the bond demand relationship under each of the three expectations
hypotheses and also presents the results of specific pairwise comparisons, using
disaggregated data for the six principal categories of investors in the U.S. bond
market. To anticipate, these results consistently support the autoregressive
expectations hypothesis. Section 5 goes on to examine the implications of the
estimated bond demand equations for further aspects of expectations formation
and portfolio behavior. Here the results strongly imply either that investors are
highly risk averse in a specific way, or that investors expect bond yields to return
quickly to their long-run level after observed departures from that level. Addi-
tional results provide information about the way in which price inflation affects
nominal interest rates, and about the speed of investors' portfolio adjustment out
of equilibrium. Section 6 briefly summarizes the paper's conclusions.

                     1. THREE HYPOTHESES ABOUT EXPECTATIONS
  The focus of attention in this paper is investors' expectations about uncertain
asset returns—in particular, about the returns to long-term bonds—and the way in
which such expectations influence investors' portfolio behavior. In the absence of
default, the holding-period yield on a pure discount instrument with term to
maturity equal to the investor's holding period is known exactly. By contrast, in a
world of uncertainty all other instruments have unknown holding-period yields,
even in the absence of default risk. In the case of an instrument with term to
maturity longer than the investor's holding period, the uncertainty (sometimes
    In addition to the researchers cited in footnote 4, who used either adaptive or generalized
autoregressive expectations in this way, see, for example, Nelson [40], Hamburger and Platt [19], and
Phillips and Pippinger [42, 43].
                               INVESTORS' PORTFOLIO BEHAVIOR                                     1477

 called "capital" uncertainty6) arises from the need to sell the instrument at a price
 which may differ from its par value. In the case of an instrument with term to
 maturity shorter than the investor's holding period, the uncertainty (sometimes
 called "income" uncertainty) arises from the need to re-invest the proceeds of the
 instrument's repayment at a yield which may differ from that currently pre-
 vailing.7
   An analytical device which many researchers have used to simplify the analysis
of investors' portfolio behavior is the assumption that, at the margin of their
investment allocation decisions, investors act as if they have a one-period holding
period. The convenience of this assumption is that it telescopes a multi-period
problem, involving expectations of prices and yields many periods ahead, into a
semi-myopic problem seemingly involving expectations only one period ahead.8
For any long-term asset like bonds, the relevant (stochastic) holding-period yield
at time t is simply

(1)

where c, is the asset's coupon, dividend or discount yield (which is known at time t,
in the absence of default risk), and j± is the capital gain or loss component of the
yield defined as9
              - _nt±i—pt
                         Pt

for p the price of the asset. Since investors cannot act on the basis of information
that they do not have, what matters in the first instance is their corresponding
expectation
(3)           r7=c+g±1
where the e superscript indicates an expectation as of time t.
  The issue, then, is investors' expectations of the one-period capital gain (or loss)
associated with assets of more than one-period maturity. How do investors form
these expectations? In the context of long-term bonds, at least three distinct—but
   6
    See, for example, Leijonhufvud [22]. The distinction drawn in this paragraph is again that which
Stiglitz [54], for example, has analyzed.
    In addition, as Nelson [40] has emphasized, in the case of coupon-bearing (or dividend-paying)
instruments an additional source of uncertainty arises from the need to re-invest proceeds received
before the instrument's maturity.
   8
       A large literature has investigated the conditions (such as constant relative risk aversion, as
as'imed in Section 2) which, within the more general framework of expected utility maximization ,are
su--ient to render multi-period behavior myopic and hence analytically equivalent to single-period
behavior; see, for example, Mossjn [37] and Fama [7], and the useful review provided by Melton [32].
Examples of the myopic-allocation assumption in empirical work include the references cited in
footnote 4, portfolio models in the tradition of Brainard and Tobin [3], as well as many others in the
monetary economics and finance literatures.
     If the is measured in a time unit different from the time period indicated by subscript 1, it is
necessary to adjust the right-hand side of (2) by some constant. In Section 2, for example, multi-
                                                                                 -

 not necessarily mutually exclusive—hypotheses describing expectations forma-
 tion have sufficient a priori plausibility to warrant empirical testing:
    Unitary Expectations: The simplest hypothesis to implement follows from the
 typical (but not necessarily implied) interpretation of the large body of work
 associated with the "efficient markets" literature.'0 To an approximation that is
 often treated as exact, a standard interpretation of this research implies that the
 prior expectation of the price change for a long-term asset (with a current income
 yield) is just zero, i.e.,

 (4—U) g+, =0,
because all available information about the asset's expected future price is already
incorporated into the asset's current price; in Samuelson's [47] words,
   • . properly anticipated prices fluctuate randomly." Hence any change in real-

ized prices generates a one-for-one change in expected future prices. Hicks [20],
writing years before the development of the modern efficient markets literature,
labeled such expectations "unitary."
   Rational Expectations: A second hypothesis, due to Muth [39], is that economic
agents in general form subjective expectations identical to the objective expec-
tations of the true process generating the outcomes in question, conditional on all
information available at the time. Hence the actual outcome for the stochastic
asset yield is distributed around investors' prior expectation of it, just as any
outcome is distributed around its mathematical expectation, i.e.,

(4-R)       I,+i = g+i +      j÷
where      is a zero-mean finite-variance random disturbance which is serially
uncorrelated as well as uncorrelated with g±,. The motivation adduced by Muth
in support of this hypothesis is that "rational" (i.e., optimizing) economic agents
will efficiently exploit all available information and will therefore form unbiased
predictions.11 Recent researchers have broadly applied the rational expectations
hypothesis, especially in the context of macroeconomic policy.'2
  Autoregressive Expectations: Nerlove [41], Mincer [33], Box and Jenkins [2],
and others have extensively investigated the problem of the optimal linear
prediction of a stochastic time series from its own past history. For stationary time
series, such predictions are in general expressible as autoregressive distributed
   '° See, for example. Samuelson [47], Mandelbrot [29], Roll [45], and Fama [8], as well as the
references cited in footnote 5. It is important to note that unitary expectations, as defined here, do not
necessarily follow from "efficient markets" assumptions.
      It is worth pointing out, however, that under Muth's hypothesis the available information must
include, to within a set of additive white noise disturbances, knowledge of the model generating the
actual outcomes in question, so that this hypothesis is stronger than the simple notion that agents use
efficiently whatever information is available; see Friedman [12]. See also Feige and Pearce [9], whose
concept of "economically rational" expectations emphasizes that optimizing agents will not fully
exploit
   12
         information if the cost of doing so exceeds the expected benefits.
      See, for example, Lucas [26] and Sargent and Wallace [SO].

lags, i.e.,
(4-A)         g+1 =constant+
where the S are fixed coefficients.13 Prediction of a iuture outcome of some
process on the basis of observations of the behavior of the process in the past is a
familiar notion,- and previous empirical researchers have often turned to it in the
context of macroeconomic series in general and interest rates in particular.
Several well known simple expectations mechanisms are special cases of autore-
gressive expectations; examples include the "naive" prediction that next period
will be like last period (which requires 8 = 1 and S = 0 for r> 0), and Cagan's [5]
adaptive expectation of prices and Friedman's [17] representation of expected
permanent income (which both require that the & decline geometrically). With
respect to interest rates, Keynes' [21] regressive expectations, Duesenberry's [6]
extrapolative expectations, and Modigliani and Shiller's [34] short-run-
extrapolative/long-run-regressive combination are all examples of general
autoregressive expectations.
  As already noted, these three expectations hypotheses are not mutually
exclusive. Given the assumptions of the efficient markets model, for example, the
unitary expectation (4-U) is also the rational expectation (4-R). Similarly ,as
Frenkel [10] and Mussa [38] among others have noted in the context of general
price inflation, if the nature of a process is such that all relevant information about
it is contained in its own past realizations, then the autoregressive expectation
(4-A) is also the rational expectation (4-R); for this reason some writers have
referred to such general autoregressive expectations mechanisms as "partly
rational" or "weak-form rational."14 Nevertheless, by construction the unitary
and autoregressive expectations cannot be identical (except for the trivial case in
which ST =0 for all r), and even in simple models the necessary conditions for
rational and autoregressive expectations to be identical are typically most restric-
tive.
  Hence these three hypotheses—unitary, rational, and autoregressive—do
constitute different perspectives on expectations formation, each with its 4)wn
motivation and literature of applications. Moreover, it follows directly frc (3)
that unitary/rational/autoregressive asset capital gain (holding-period yield)
expectations imply corresponding unitary/rational/autoregressive asset price
expectations. Hence for finite-maturity bonds purchased at par value (or for
perpetuities at any price) they also imply approximately unitary/rational!
autoregressive expectations for long-term interest rates.15
   13
      Any finite-order moving-average process can also be expressed as an equivalent infiniteorder
autoregression.
   14
      See, for example, Sargent [49], Rutledge [46], and McCallum [30]. See also Shiller [51] on the
distinction between rational expectations and multivariate autoregressive expectations.
      Extension of the correspondence to interest rate expectations is only approximate because, given
the inverse relationship between bond prices and bond yields, Jensen's Inequality implies that the two
corresponding expectations cannot both be unbiased. The magnitude of this difference is usually small,
however. In addition, as Lintner [23] has shown in another context, useful theoretical results can hold
regardless of which side of the inverse relationship investors expect without bias.

                                    2. THE PORTFOLIO MODEL16

      The model of investors' demand for long-term bonds, used in Section 4 to
 evaluate the three competing hypotheses about expectations of long-term interest
 rates, follows from the assumptions (a) that the investor's single-period objective
 is to maximize the expected utility of end-of-period wealth, given both anexisting
 stock of savings and a new saving flow, and (b) that the investor's utility function is
 of a form, such as power or logarithmic function (so that there is constant relative
 risk aversion), which reduces to a preference ordering in terms of the means and
 variance-covariance structure of the perceived distributions of the several assets'
 uncertain returns. The first of these assumptions is especially appropriate for
 institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies, which
 dominate investment in the U.S. bond markets. The second has become standard
 since the early work of Markowitz [28] and Tobin [55].
    Utility functions exhibiting constant relative risk aversion, together with joint
 normal (or lognormal) asset return distributions, generate optimal portfolio
 allocations that are linear homogeneous in wealth. Further linearization, to
 separate the effects of asset return means and variances, yields the investor's
 equilibrium portfolio allocation in the form

                             h
                                 +,                                                      (i = 1, . . ,N),
 where A' is the investor's desired holding of the ith asset, W is the investor's total
 portfolio size (wealth), r is the expected return on the kth asset, the Xh are any
 additional variables (like nonstationary variances and covariances) that are part of
 asset return assessments, and the /31k, VIh, and ir are fixed coefficients which satisfy
    I3k = 0 for all k, , yih = 0 for all h, and ., ir = 1. On the assumption of
universal substitutability, the $jk also satisfy f3,k >0, i = k, and 13k <0, i k.
  To translate this model of desired portfolio allocation into an operational model
of investors' short-run behavior in the presence of transactions costs, some model
of portfolio adjustment is necessary. Moreover, it is useful to distinguish the less
costly (and hence more sensitive to asset yield expectations) allocation of the
current investable cash flow 4 W from the re-allocation of the existing holdings
W_1. An adjustment model which in the long run converges to the equilibrium
given by (5), but in the short run incorporates this distinction in a tractable way, is
the optimal marginal adjustment model
                      N
(6)                 = kO(aW_1 —Ak,(_1) + a 4 W                                          (i = 1,. . . , N),

where the 9k are fixed coefficients of adjustment satisfying                          = Ofor all k, with
o arbitrary.


   '6Since the authors have developed this portfolio model in some detail in previous work, the
discussion in this section is brief. For a full development including references to the literature, see, for
example, Friedman [11, 15] and Roley [44].

  Substituting from (5) into (6) for the specific case of long-term bonds, and
successively using each of the three representations (4) for the unobservable

Comparative evaluation of the empirical performance of (7-U), (7-R), and (7-A)
is the principal objective of the following sections.

                         3. DATA AND ESTIMATION PROCEDURES
   Before turning to the empirical evidence, it is useful to comment briefly on
several aspects of the exact specification and estimation of bond demand equa-
tions (7-U), (7-R), and (7-A).
  Data: The primary data source for the stock and flow quantities used to
estimate these equations is the Federal Reserve System's flow-of-funds accounts
[1, and subsequent issues];18 these data are seasonally adjusted and are
denominated in millions of dollars. The particular long-term interest rate CB used
is the observed new-issue yield on long-term bonds issued by utility companies

      The expressions shown here are simplified in that they omit terms, which appear in the expansion
of (5) and(6), involving products with W,_1; the coefficients of such terms—like the coefficients shown
here for the linear terms 4W,, W,,. and A5, , k B—are sums of products of the underlying
behavioral parameters and are of unknown sign a priori. By contrast, each product of a mean or
(co-)variance with 4W, bears a coefficient, identical to a single parameter from (5).
   18 See Friedman [11] for further details on precise definitions of variables, in particular the cash
flows of life insurance companies and households.

rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Aa-rated utility bonds provide the
greatest continuity, in terms of the frequency of new issues, and they are most
representative of new-issue activity in the U.S. market. Previous studies of
long-term interest rate determination using the term-structure approach have
relied on indices of yields on either new issues or seasoned issues, but the
new-issue yield is likely to be superior for several reasons including greater
trading volume, fewer measurement problems, and absence of any term-coupon
bias. The sample period consists of 56 quarterly observations spanning 1960:1—
1973:IV.
  The capital gain gp on bonds of finite maturity correctly depends on the
movement from one time period to another of the bonds' price as in (2). For
long-term bonds priced at or near par, however, the annualized consol formula
                          CBtCB,f±1
(8)           g2,,÷1=                       .4
                              CB,1+1

provides a close approximation. Both the rational expectations (7-R) and the
autoregressive expectations (7-A) specifications of bond demand rely on this
approximation.
  Disaggregarion: The disaggregated equations described below represent the
demand for (i.e., net purchases of) long-term corporate bonds by six distinct
categories of investors that together hold approximately 95 per cent of all
outstanding long-term corporate bonds issued in the United States (see Table I).
Most of these investors hold at least some amounts of a large number of different
types of assets. Since W1_1 = Lk Ak._1 in each case, (7) is not identifiable in the
form which includes not only W1 and B,_1 but also Ak1 for all k B.19 The
procedure used to deal with this problem was to experiment, on an individual

then including B1_1 and all major asset groupings Ak.,_1, k B, but excluding
W,_1; and finally including W.1, B1, and Ak,,_l for only some subset of k B.
Selection among these alternative constrained subspecifications depended on
goodness of fit and statistical properties. With respect to the yields, the analogous
procedure used was to include only some subset of yields r on alternative assets

  Other than long-term bonds, the major asset holdings of these six categories of
investors fall into three classes: (i) short-term liquid assets such as Treasury bills
or commercial paper, (ii) mortgages, and (iii) equities. In addition to a represen-
tation of the expected holding-period yields on bonds, r, to estimate (7) it is
necessary to have a representation of the expected holding-period yields on these
other assets as well. The equations presented below assume that this yield is, for
short-term assets simply the observed market yield, for mortgages the observed
new-issue yield (because of the instrument's illiquidity20), and for equities the
current dividend/price ratio together with a simple distributed lag (motivated by
autoregressive expectations) on recent equity capital gains.2' In addition to the
nominal asset yields per Se, these equations also include a distributed lag (again
motivated by autoregressive expectations) on annualized percentage changes in
consumer prices, to permit investors' demand for bonds to respond to inflation
expectations in such a way (negatively, all other things equal) as to enforce the
familiar Fisher effect.
  Instrumental Variables: Since the own-yield on bonds is jointly determined
with investors' bond demands (and with issuers' bond supplies, which would
complete the structural model of the bond market22), it is necessary to use an
estimation procedure that avoids the inconsistency of ordinary least-squares
estimates. The set of instruments used here for deriving consistent estimators
includes not only the predetermined variables in the six disaggregated bond
demand equations but also those in the two disaggregated bond supply equations
developed in Friedman [13]. As is often the case in multi-equation models, it is
impossible to apply two-stage least squares because there are too many pre-
determined variables to permit ordinary least-squares estimation of the system's
reduced form. The Brundy-Jorgenson [4] procedure, applied here, derives
consistent estimators by using as instrumental variables the leading principal
components of the full-system set of predetermined variables as well as, on an
equation-by-equation basis, the single-equation sets of predetermined variables
themselves.
   In addition to using an instrumental variables procedure for the coupon
component CB1 of the own-yield in all three bond demand equations (7-U), (7-R),
   20This assumption is equivalent to assuming that the holding period for mortgages, in contrast to
other assets, is actually the mortgage's average life.
   21 In the empirical results either the dividend/price ratio or the capital gain lag had a coefficient
significantly different from zero, but never both in the same equation.
   22 The structural approach to modeling interest rate behavior is implemented in Friedman [11, 13]
and Roley [44].
1484                             B. M. FRIEDMAN AND V. V. ROLEY

and (7-A), and for the current-period capital gain component g, in (7-A), it is
also necessary to use this procedure for the expected future capital gain variable
(jB.,+1—Ü,+I) in (7-R). As McCallum [30] and others have emphasized, in the
absence of perfect foresight the rational expectations hypothesis (4-R) renders the
realization B.t+1 distributed around, rather than equal to, the prior expectation
g,,÷1, thereby leading to a classical errors-in-variables problem for estimation if
the actual gB.±1 were simply used in place of its expectation. The procedure used
to estimate (7-R) therefore replaces gB,+1 with its Jorgenson-Brundy instru-
mented value. While any valid instrument will give a consistent estimate of the
coefficient of       this instrument will give a more efficient estimate than the
commonly suggested simpler instrument based only on past realizations of g to
the extent that investors, in forming their expectations, actually take account of
the additional information on which the instrument is based.
  Distributed Lags: The estimation of the distributed lags in (7-A) presents an
interesting identification problem due to the potential appearance of the same
distributed lag S g.1- in two separate nonlinear terms on the right-hand side
of a single equation.23 The procedure used to identify all of the coefficients in this
equation, and to ensure that the two appearances of the same distributed lag are in
fact identical, is developed in Friedman and Roley [16]. In addition, the individual
ô cäefficients are (with one exception) constrained to follow a third-degree
polynomial pattern with the right-hand tail of the lag constrained to pass through
zero. Following Sims [52], the lead coefficient of the lag structure is free of the
polynomial constraint.

 NOTE: Numbers in parentheses are estimated standard errors.

   Table H shows each estimated equation's coefficient of determination (R2) and
root-mean-square error of simulation (RMSE), both adjusted for degrees of
freedom. These fit statistics are important in cross-hypothesis comparisons
because, unlike the t statistics for the estimates in Table III, they are analogous to
F statistics, and hence admit valid inferences even in the presence of multi-
collinearity among asset yields. For equations estimated by an instrumental
variables procedure, the root-mean-square simulation error (which relies on the
actual values of all right-hand-side variables) is a better measure of statistical
performance than is the estimated standard error (which relies on instrumented
values of right-hand-side variables) 24
  Consistently for all six investor categories, the autoregressive expectations
hypothesis (7-A) provides the best explanation of the data. Of the other two
hypotheses, unitary expectations (7-U) ranks second for four investor categories,
and rational expectations (7-R) for two.
  Table III shows the estimated values and standard errors of the coefficient /'3BB,
which indicates the responsiveness of bond demand to the expected own-yield r,
for the three alternative expectations hypotheses, for each category of investors.25
   24
       In (7-R) the probability limits of the root-mean-square errors include an additional term, in
comparison to the other specifications, due to the errors-in-variables properties associated with using
the observed cx post         value in place of the true rational expectation g,+1. Following Griliches
and Ringstad [18], it is possible to obtain a consistent estimate of the resulting bias and to adjust each
RMSE value for (7-R) so as to render it comparable to the RMSE values for other specifications.
The resulting adjustments turned out to be extremely small, however; the largest change occurred for
private pension funds, for which the adjusted RMSE value was 246. As a further check, It IS possible to
compute for each estimated equation (7-R) the magnitude of variance of the rational expectation—
i.e., the variance of      in (4-R)—which would be necessary for any RMSE value for (7-R) when
adjusted by the Griliches-Ringstad procedure, to eqial the corresponding RMSE value for (7-A). The
required var (u,÷1) turned out to be no less than 10 for any of the six estimated (7-R) equations and
was in some cases greater than lOll.
   25 Because of the instrumental variables estimation procedure, the standard error ratios are
asymptotically distributed as t statistics but are not necessarily distributed as I statistics in small
samples.

 Since these response coefficients provide the crucial link between the different
 expectations hypotheses and investors' demand for bonds, they merit close
inspection.
   Once again, the evidence favors the autoregressive expectations hypothesis.
Consistently for all six investor categories, autoregressive expectations (7-A)
yields BB estimates significantly different from zero at high confidence levels,
with the anticipated positive sign. Moreover, with the exception of mutual savings
banks (for which the I3B value is surprisingly large), these estimates are all of
plausible magnitude. The I32B value for non-life insurance companies, for exam-
ple, indicates that a one percentage point increase in the expected holding-period
own-yield on bonds, with all other things equal, would lead these investors to
increase by an absolute six per cent (for example, from 40 per cent to46 per cent)
the desired fraction of their portfolios to be held in bonds, while the f3p value for
state and local government retirement funds indicates a 21 per cent response. The
I3BB estimates for the other three investor categories lie between these two values.
   Unitary expectations (7-U) performs almost as well as autoregressive expec-
tations on this count, yielding I3BB estimates that differ from zero at high
confidence levels, with the anticipated positive sign, for four investor categories;
one more is marginal. (The missing category is mutual savings banks, for which the
estimate under the autoregressive hypothesis is also somewhat suspect.) By
contrast, rational expectations (7-R) yields a I3BB estimate significantly different
from zero at high confidence levels for only one investor category and with
marginal significance for only one more; and the values of these two estimates
seem implausibly small.
  It is also interesting to contrast the results shown in Tables II and III, which
compare the three expectations proxies' respective relation to bond demands,
with their respective relation to the actual holding-period own-yield on bonds ob-
served ex post. Over the sample period the simple correlation between the actual
own-yield and the unitary expectation (that is, just the coupon rate) was .13. The
simple correlations between the actual own-yield and the respective rational
expectations (that is, the coupon rate plus the fitted values from the first-stage
regression of the actual capital gain on the full instrument set) varied from a low of
.64 for mutual savings banks to a high of .83 for households. The simple
correlations between the actual own-yield and the respective autoregressive
expectations (that is, the coupon rate plus the value implied by solving out the
capital gain distributed lags) were clustered between .15 and .16 except for private
pension funds (.12) and state-local retirement funds (only .06). Hence the sharply
different relative performance of the three expectations proxies in explaining
movements in bond demands does not simply reflect a difference in the proxies'
respective ability to reproduce the actual own-yield on bonds. Instead, the
comparison goes strongly the other way.
  Table IV focuses more rigorously on the evaluation of the three competing
expectations hypotheses by providing F statistics for two pairwise comparisons.
First, since unitary expectations is a nested hypothesis within autoregressive
expectations, it is straightforward to test the null hypothesis (7-U) against the

 alternative (7-A). As the F statistics in the first column of Table IV show, the
 evidence warrants rejecting (7-U) in favor of (7-A) for each of the six investor
 categories. Next, since unitary expectations is not strictly nested within rational
 expectations, the second column of the table shows F statistics for a test of the null
 hypothesis (7-U) against the weaker alternative
 (7-R') 4B, =.. I3BB C 1W+f3 . (IB.,+1—üf+I)
which posits a response of bond demand to the rational expectation g,,+1
according to coefficient I3B, which need not equal I3BB as in (7-R). Here the
evidence does not warrant rejecting (7-U) in favor of (7-R') for any of the six
investor categories; presumably the data would not warrant rejecting (7-U) in
favor of the even stronger (7-R) either.
   Unfortunately, no direct pairwise comparison is possible between autoregres-
sive expectations and rational expectations, since neither is in any sense nested
within the other. Hence the results of the two pairwise comparisons of each
against unitary expectations constitute evidence favoring autoregressive expec-
tations over rational expectations only on the (not rigorously defendable)
assumption of strict transitivity.
  In sum, on the basis of the fit results in Table II, the results in Table III for the
coefficient of the variable which differentiates the three expectationshypotheses,
and the results in Table IV for two direct pairwise comparisons, the bond demand
equation subject to the autoregressive expectations hypothesis (7-A) clearly
dominates. The Appendix reports the complete estimation results for bond
demand equation (7-A) for the six principal categories of investors.

   5. FURTHER EVIDENCE ON EXPECTATIONS AND PORTFOLIO BEHAVIOR
   Several further aspects of the estimated bond demand equations, beyond those
already discussed in Section 4, provide interesting evidence on additional ques-
tions about expectations and portfolio behavior.

  Interpreting Autoregressive Expectations: As the Appendix Table A-IT shows,
the estimated value of the distributed lag weight sum 8 in the bond demand
equations based on autoregressive expectations is quite small, ranging from only
0.0349 for mutual savings banks to 0.1085 for households. It is possible to
interpret this result in at least three ways.
   First, in the context of the time-series motivation for (4-A), 8 < 1 indicates
that investors form their expectations on the belief that long-term interest rates
(actually the capital gains gB) are stationary time series. Indeed, F statistics for a
test of the null hypothesis L = 1, reported in the first column of Table V,
warrant rejecting that hypothesis at high confidence levels for all six investor
categories. In this light the only surprising aspect of the estimated r values is
that they are so small, indicating that investors expect to return very rapidly to
its mean value, even after a series of persistent deviations from that mean.

  Secondly, under the autoregressive expectations hypothesis the coefficient of
g,1±i in the underlying equation—i.e., what is labelled I38B in (7-R')—and the
weight sum ,.8,. within g,1±i are not both identifiable in the absence of some
further constraint.26 What is estimated is the product (/3'Bp .  5w). The inter-
pretation above identifies L ôT by imposing the constraint I3i = I3BB• Con-
versely, given a constraint on Si. it is possible to identify I3BB independently of
I3BB' The
            most common such restriction found in the literature is the unit sum
constraint        = 1, which implies that investors believe that the stochastic
process generating the series in question is borderline stationary/nonstationary—
i.e., that any level which has persisted for a long time will continue to persist.
Under this assumption a second possible interpretation of the strong inequality
(I3B Ii. 8) <f3BR is simply that f39B <I3BB—i.e., that investors apply some
discount factor to the (uncertain) capital gain component in comparison to the
(known) coupon component of the return to holding bonds. Even under risk
averse portfolio behavior, however, it is not clear what kind of utility function and
asset return assessments would give rise to this kind of multiplicative "uncertainty
   26
        Lucas [25] and Sargent [48], for example, have emphasized this point.

discounting" of what is after all the mean of a distribution (unless the mean bore a
systematic positive relation to a nonstationary variance).
  Yet a third possible interpretation of the surprisingly strong ö < 1 result,
again on the original assumption that bond demand responds equally to the
coupon and expected capital gain components of the holding-period own-yield on
bonds, is that investors behave as if the relevant holding period were more than a
calendar quarter. The application of the chain rule of forecasting, to derive
predictions of a stochastic process for more than one time period into the future,
involves a convolution of the weights ö on themselves. If the series is stationary,
so that L 8 < 1, the value of such a convolution converges asymptotically from
  & one period in the future to zero an infinite number of periods later. In
addition, even identical capital gains or losses achieved over longer real time
horizons are smaller in terms of per cent per annum, the relevant unit for
comparability to the coupon component of the bond return. Hence the surpris-
ingly low k.,. & estimates may be evidence that one of the assumptions of the
underlying portfolio model—i.e., that investors behave as if their holding-period
were a calendar quarter—is in fact incorrect. Further indirect evidence for this
viewpoint comes from the disparity among the distributed lag structures reported
in the Appendix for the six categories of investors.27 Instead of using different
autoregressive representations to predict the value of the same process in the
same future time period, the several categories of investors may actually have
been using different convolutions of the same autoregressive representation to
predict the values of the same process over different time horizons.
   Interpreting Rational Expectations: Since the possibility of different portfolio
responses to the coupon and expected capital gain components of the return to
bonds is an interesting issue, it is useful to see whether a similar result emerges in
the bond demand equations estimated under the rational expectations hypothesis
(to which the identification problem discussed above does not apply). Since (7-R)
is nested within (7-R'), it is straightforward to test the null hypothesis f3BB = 13BB
against the more general alternative of unequal responses. As the F statistics
shown in the second column of Table V indicate, the evidence warrants rejecting
(7-R) in favor of (7-R') for four of the six investor categories. Nevertheless, since
the I3BB estimates for three of these four categories turn out on inspection to be
negative, this result hardly constitutes evidence for the "uncertainty discounting"
hypothesis lukewarmly suggested above.
   A further useful test of the rational expectations hypothesis, in the context of
the above discussion, arises from the possibility that the implicit one-quarter
holding period is incorrect. If investors in fact focus on longer time horizons, the
tests of the rational expectations hypothesis reported in Section 4 are invalid. Lest
this hypothesis be rejected too quickly, it is necessary to perform analogous tests

   27 The relevant F test comparing the results shown in the Appendix with analogous results based on
a stacked estimation of all six equations together, so as to enforce cross-equation restrictions, rejected
at high levels of confidence the hypothesis that all six lag structures are identical. While the relatively
short (six quarter) lag structure found for life insurance companies may appear surprising, the more
detailed work of Lintner Ct al. [24] apparently bore Out a fifteen month lag.

 for rational expectations over longer holding periods. Doing so, however,
produces results that are just as unfavorable to the rational expectations hypo-
thesis as those reported in Section 4. For a one-year holding period, for example,
F statistics analogous to those shown in Table IV warrant rejecting the null
hypothesis (7-U) in favor of (7-R') for no investor category at the 1 per cent level,
and for only two at the 5 per cent level. For a two-year holding period, analogous F
tests again warrant rejecting (7-U) in favor of (7-R') for no investor category even
at the 5 per cent level.
   Response to Inflation :28 In the bond demand equations estimated under the
autoregressive expectations hypothesis, reported in full in the Appendix, the
coefficient estimates for the price inflation distributed lags provide evidence of
behavior on the part of investors which would account for the incorporation of an
"inflation premium" into nominal interest rates. In particular, the estimated sum
    ,.from the distributed lag             . 4 W representing the inflation expec-
tation term P . 4 W, are significantly different from zero, with the expected
negative sign, for four of the six investor groups.29 Hence the greater the expected
price inflation as inferred from recent observed price inflation, all other things—
including the nominal bond yield—equal, the smaller are these investors'
demands for bonds. This response may represent an explicit maximization of real
rather than nominal wealth; or, following Modigliani and Shiller [34], it may
indicate that investors draw inferences about future interest rate movements (i.e.,
about future capital gains) from observations of price inflation as well as interest
rates themselves.
   As is the case for the autoregressive representation of the capital gain expec-
tation, however, it is impossible to identify both the lag weight sum         and the
coefficient y from (5), which indicates the portfolio response to pe It is interesting
to note, however, that under the unit sum constraint for . the resulting 9
estimates in these four equations provide some support for the precise Fisher
relationship of a one-for-one increase in bond yields following an increase in the
expected inflation rate. In particular, for each of the four bond demand equations
including the P . 4W, term, it is impossible to reject at the 10 per cent confidence
level the hypothesis 'y = I3BB• Nevertheless, given both the partial equilibrium
nature of these equations and the need for the identifying restriction, it is best to
accept this evidence in support of Fisher only with substantial caution.
   Speed of Adjustment: Although the overall "speed of adjustment" in a multi-
asset portfolio model like (6) properly depends on the roots of the square matrix
consisting of elements 0,k, in the absence of estimates for the entire matrix it is
interesting to examine the on-diagonal (i.e., own-stock) coefficients O,. In the
bond demand equations estimated under the autoregressive expectations hypo-
thesis, the estimates of the own-stock adjustment parameter 0BB are of plausible

          term was insignificant in the equations for non-life insurance companies and private pension
funds, and so it is omitted from the final specifications of these two equations. The equations both
include price expectations in the term P . W,_1, but the coefficient of this term is a sum of products of
parameters in the underlying model of (5) and (6); see again footnote 17.

magnitude for all investor categories other than mutual savings banks. Further-
more, the different 0BB estimates for the different groups of investors roughly
correspond to intuitive judgments of the various investors' respective speeds of
portfolio adjustment based on institutional considerations. In particular, these
estimates indicate that private pension funds (which are typically managed very
actively) undertake the most rapid re-allocation of their existing assets, followed
next by state and local government retirement funds (which are also typically
managed by market professionals). By contrast, life insurance companies (whose
bond portfolios are heavily concentrated in private placement loans of limited
marketability) have a small 9BB estimate, indicating a much slower re-allocation
process.
   It is also interesting to note that, with the exception of life insurance companies
and mutual savings banks, the indicated adjustment speeds are noticeably more
rapid than those typically found by previous researchers.3° A plausible inference
from this finding is that the familiar very slow adjustment speeds often reported
confound genuine portfolio adjustment lags with slowly adjusting expectations of
holding-period yields, so that explicitly separating out the expectations
mechanism produces better estimates of the true speed of portfolio adjustment
out of equilibrium.

                               6. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

   The principal conclusion to emerge from the empirical work presented in this
paper, on the demand for bonds by six major categories of U.S. investors, is that
the evidence favors an autoregressive representation of investors' expectations of
future bond prices—i.e., of future long-term interest rates. Both the unitary and
the rational representations of investors' expectations lead to inferior results in
comparison with the autoregressive model. The model based on the autoregres-
sive expectations hypothesis does a good overall job of explaining the demand for
bonds by each of the six categories of investors, and (except for mutual savings
banks)3 1the key individual parameter estimates are highly plausible. Moreover, in
direct pairwise comparisons of nested hypotheses, the evidence consistently
rejects unitary expectations in favor of autoregressive expectations, but does not
reject unitary expectations in comparison to even a weakened statement of
rational expectations.
  The empirical work presented in this paper also leads to three further obser-
vations about the nature of investors' expectations formation and portfolio
behavior:
  (i) The results relying on the autoregressive representation of expectations
   30
        In the bond demand equations presented in Friedman [IlJ, for example—which include no
expectational lags—8BB estimates corresponding to those shown in the Appendix are (in the order of
the31respective appearance in the Appendix) .149, .139, .373, .145, .122, and .117.
     Given the highly specific character of mutual savings banks' deposit and mortgage lending
business—including, for example, the effects of Regulation Q interest ceilings—it is not surprising that
a general model of portfolio behavior derived largely from theoretical underpinnings suffers from
serious shortcomings when applied to their bond demand.

imply either (a) that investors' expectations of future bond prices (yields) are such
as to anticipate a rapid return to the long-run trend even after persistent
deviations from that trend, or (b) that investors' demands for bonds respond less
fully to movements in the uncertain capital gain component of the holding-period
yield on bonds than to the certain coupon component, or (c) that different
categories of investors respond to expectations of future bond prices over
different multi-period time horizons. Because the relevant part of the bond
demand model is under-identified, it is not possible to determine which (or
whether perhaps all) of these phenomena is responsible for the observed behavior
of investors.
   (ii) For four of the six investor categories examined, the evidence supports a
response of bond demand to (autoregressive) price expectations in such a way
(i.e., negatively) as to explain the development of a Fisherian "inflation premium"
in long-term interest rates. Furthermore, the magnitude of this inflation effect is
consistent with a one-for-one relationship between the expected inflation and the
inflation premium.
   (iii) With the exception of life insurance companies (and mutual savings banks),
the evidence points to more rapid portfolio adjustments than previous researchers
investigating portfolio behavior have typically found. For those investors with
actively managed portfolios, the implied speed of adjustment out of equilibrium is
extremely rapid.

      Because of the nonlinear way in which both yield and non-yield variables enter the model, all
such terms are products. The correct instrument to use in each such case, for purposes of deriving
consistent estimators, is the first-stage fitted value of the entire product; this procedure is used here.
      For private pension funds and state-local retirement funds, the two polynomial variables do not
differ significantly from zero individually but do differ significantly from zero jointly. The F statistic
values are 2.79 (with 3 and 45 degrees of freedom) and 8.30 (with 3 and 44 degrees of freedom),
respectively.
    35For other insurance companies and private pension funds, the two polynomial variables do not
differ significantly from zero individually but do differ significantly from zero jointly. The F statistic
values are 42.5 (with 3 and 41 degrees of freedom) and 23.0 (with 3 and 45 degrees of freedom),
respectively. Preliminary experimentation with the equation for state and local government retirement
funds failed to indicate a value of for which the polynomial variables were significantly different from
zero, given the other constraints imposed. Instead of searching extensively either over many values of
or over alternative (weaker) constraints on the lag, the procedure used was simply to replace the
polynomial distributed lag by a rectangular lag for this one equation.
