1           Introduction
        Over the past twenty years, macroeconomic performance has improved markedly
in industrialized and developing countries alike. Both inÂ°ation and real growth are
more stable now than they were in the 1980s. Looking at a sample of 23 countries we
see that during 1990s, in 21 of them inÂ°ation variability fell and in 14 of them output
volatility was lower than it had been during the previous decade.1 This stability
has been accompanied by dramatic changes in Â¯nancial structure. Not only have
central banks become more independent2 , but the nature of government intervention
in banking systems has changed dramatically. The purpose of this paper is to examine
the connection between these two concurrent events.
        There are a number of possible explanations for the widespread improvement in
economic outcomes over the past two decades. There is the very real possibility that
the world has become a more stable place. If there are no shocks hitting the economy,
it will surely appear stable. Alternatively, monetary policymakers may have become
more skillful in carry out their stabilization objectives. That is, the monetary policy of
the 1990s may have been more eÂ±cient than it was in the 1980s. We provide evidence
that policy has in fact improved, suggesting that there has been an improvement in
the competence of central bankers.
        The ability of policymakers to carry out their job depends crucially on their hav-
ing the tools necessary to reduce inÂ°ation and output volatility. In the majority of
the countries in the world, day-to-day monetary policy means controlling short-term
interest rates. The transmission of interest rate movements to domestic output and
prices depends on the structure of the country's banking system, and Â¯nancial mar-
kets more generally. Policy shifts, as embodied in interest rate changes, are eÂ®ective
only in so far as they inÂ°uence the level of Â¯nancing available to Â¯rms and individuals
wishing to either undertake investment projects or shift consumption intertemporally.
        In many countries the banking system is shielded from the impact of monetary
policy through barriers created by the government. SpeciÂ¯cally, if the government

owns bank assets directly, as it does in much of the world, then the decisions of the
managers of the banks may not be as sensitive to normal market forces. Monetary
policy that is transmitted to the real economy through its impact on bank lending
will be shut down in an country in which banks are owned by the government. If
policy is ineÂ®ective, the skill of the policymakers is essentially irrelevant. But when
governments shed their bank assets, they increase the scope for central banks to
stabilize output and inÂ°ation. As we show, declines in the level of bank assets owned
by the government are related to improvements in both the eÂ±ciency of monetary
policy and macroeconomic performance.
      A second important component of the Â¯nancial regulatory structure is the nature
of the deposit insurance system. The presence or absence of explicit deposit insurance
aÂ®ects both the willingness of bank managers to take risks, and the extent to which
Â¯rms will be able to access Â¯nancing directly through equity or bond issuance. We
provide evidence elsewhere3 that the presence of explicit insurance reduces the extent
to which Â¯rms go directly to capital markets for Â¯nancing, increasing their dependence
on banks. Since an important channel for monetary policy transmission is through
bank loans, the more dependent Â¯rms are on banks, the more eÂ®ective is monetary
policy. Again, we Â¯nd that macroeconomic outcomes can be tied to changes in the
deposit insurance system.
      Overall, our argument proceeds in a series of steps. First, we establish in Section 2
that macroeconomic outcomes have improved. Both output and inÂ°ation are more
stable in a broad sample of countries around the world. Next, in Section 3 we discuss
how it is that banks are crucial for the transmission of monetary policy to the real
economy and why it is that both government bank ownership and deposit insurance
systems are likely to inÂ°uence policy's eÂ®ectiveness. Section 4 provides data on the
relationship between the loans extended by banks to the private sector and both the
degree of state-bank ownership and whether or not there is explicit deposit insurance.
Next we develop a measure of the improvement in monetary policy eÂ±ciency. This
is the subject of Section 5. As we discuss in some detail, eÂ±cient policy results in

macroeconomic outcomes that are on the inÂ°ation-output variability frontier. Policy
cannot be eÂ±cient if it is ineÂ®ective, and so we expect that the ability of policymak-
ers to do their jobs depends on the whether the banking and Â¯nancial systems are
structured so that they can. This brings us to our conclusion in Section 6 where we
show that improvements in macroeconomic outcomes can be tied to changes in regu-
latory structure. Section 7 an overview of the results and a discussion of alternative
interpretations.



2         Improved Macroeconomic Outcomes
        We study a sample of 23 countries, ranging from large industrial countries to
small developing ones.4 Figure 1 presents a scattered plot of inÂ°ation and output
variability for 21 of the 23 countries (Israel and Mexico excluded) in the sample, for
two periods, 1982 to 1989 and 1990 to 1997. InÂ°ation variability is measured as the
squared deviation from 2%, while output variability is the deviation from a log-linear
trend. All of our results are robust to measuring inÂ°ation variability as deviation
from the period average.5 We have Â¯tted a hyperbolic curve through the points for
each sub-period in order to show more clearly how things have changed.
        We draw two conclusions from these data. First, there is the fact that the world is a
more stable place. The average country has experienced a decline in both inÂ°ation and
output variability | an unambiguous improvement in macroeconomic performance.
Second, the shape of the curves clearly suggest the existence of a trade-oÂ® between
inÂ°ation and output variability. We will not focus on that aspect of the data, but it
is clearly evident in the picture.
        Figure 2 presents the same information country by country. We see that for 21
of the 23 countries, including all of the members of the EU, inÂ°ation variability fell

many, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain,
Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

     For France and Portugal the Â¯rst subperiod consisted of data from 1983:I-1989:IV, while for
Korea and New Zealand we divided the sample into the subperiods 1984:I-1990:IV and 1991:I-
1997:IV, as a result of data restrictions.

between the 1980s and the 1990s. This surely reÂ°ects the increasing importance cen-
tral banks now place on targeting inÂ°ation, either explicitly or implicitly.6 InÂ°ation
variability rose in only two countries in the sample, Germany and Korea. Further-
more, output variability rose in 9 countries, 7 of which are in the EU. All of this is
consistent with the conclusions in Cecchetti and Ehrmann (1999) that the shift to
inÂ°ation targeting can move countries along an output-inÂ°ation variability frontier.
       While we could proceed with the two-dimensional measure of macroeconomic per-
formance, it is useful to combine them together to construct a single measure of
increased stability. To do this, we begin by assuming that each country's central
banker seeks to minimize the weighted sum of output and inÂ°ation variability. This
social loss from unstable growth and inÂ°ation is given by:


                                L = Â¸V ar(Â¼) + (1 Â¡ Â¸)V ar(y)                                    (1)


where Â¼ and y are inÂ°ation and output, and the weight Â¸ is a measure of the policy-
maker's inÂ°ation variability aversion.7
       In order to make this summary measure of performance operational, we require
a measure of Â¸. For this, we appeal to the work of Cecchetti, Flores-Lagunes and
Krause (2001), who derive the degree of inÂ°ation variability aversion in 23 countries
from estimates of each country's volatility frontier. SpeciÂ¯cally, for each subperiod
they estimate the frontier and perform a parallel shift such that the frontier will pass
through the data. The estimate of Â¸ follows from the slope of the (shifted) volatility
frontier at this point. Unlike the procedure in Cecchetti and Ehrmann (1999), this
technique does not assume policymakers are always operating on the inÂ°ation-output
variability frontier.
       Table 1 reports these estimates of the inÂ°ation variability aversion coeÂ±cients

   6
      See Fry, Julius, Mahadeva, Roger, and Sterne (1999) for a discussion of the changes in central
bank targeting procedures.
    7
      In most circumstances, one assumes that the relative weight on inÂ°ation and output variability
in the loss is given to the central banker by elected members of the government. In an inÂ°ation-
targeting framework, the value of Â¸ will be lower, the longer the horizon over which the central bank
is instructed to bring inÂ°ation back to its target path.

Value of the loss in each subperiod is the weighted average of inÂ°ation and output variability, with weight Â¸, times 100.
Variability is measured as the squared deviation of the change in the log of output from the full-sample trend and the
squared deviation of the change in the log of prices from two percent. The performance gain is the percentage change
in the loss from the Â¯rst to the second subperiod. A decline in the loss is improved performance, and is reported as a
positive number.

and the value of the loss function (scaled up by a factor of 100) for the 23 countries
in our sample. Using this comprehensive measure of performance, only one of the
23 countries -namely Germany- exhibits a decline. This can be explained by the
need to adopt policies consistent with the Maastricht treaty's criteria for entry in
the monetary union. For 15 countries, performance improved by between 45 and 95
percent. On average, the loss fell from 1.44 to 0.24. Excluding Israel, the improvement
was nearly 70%, from 0.64 to 0.19. Furthermore, for Austria, Japan, Sweden and the
U.K., performance improves by less than 10%.
        What can explain these improvements in performance? In particular, how can
we explain the diÂ®erences across countries? Our main contention is that the cross-
country variation is a consequence of changes in Â¯nancial structure which provided the
opportunity for improvements in monetary policy making. To explore this possibility,
we now turn to a brief discussion of how it is that monetary policy aÂ®ects inÂ°ation
and real economic activity.



3         Financial Structure and the
                  Transmission Mechanism
        Central bankers all agree that their actions have aÂ®ects on both inÂ°ation and
the real economy. Most researchers accept this, but disagreement over the reasons
continue today.8 While traditional theories focus on the direct impact of interest rates
or exchange rates, the more recent lending view concentrates on the importance of
banks in transmitting monetary impulses to the real economy.
        The lending view has two parts, one that focuses on the impact of policy changes
on borrower balance sheets and a second that focuses on bank loans. In both, the
eÂ®ectiveness of policy depends on capital market imperfections that make it easier
for some Â¯rms to obtain Â¯nancing than others. Information asymmetries and moral

    8
    A number of excellent and comprehensive surveys of the theories of the monetary transmis-
sion mechanism have appeared in recent years. These include Bernanke (1993), Gertler and
Gilchrist (1993), Kashyap and Stein (1994, 1997), Hubbard (1995), and Cecchetti (1995).


                                             8
hazard problems, together with bankruptcy laws, mean that the state of a Â¯rm's
balance sheet has implications for its ability to obtain external Â¯nance.9 By reducing
expected future sales and by increasing the cost of rolling over a given level of nominal
debt, policy-induced increases in interest rates (which are both real and nominal)
cause a deterioration in the Â¯rm's net worth. Furthermore, there is an asymmetry
of information in that borrowers (Â¯rms) have better information about the potential
proÂ¯tability of investment projects than creditors (banks). As a result, as the Â¯rm's
net worth declines, the Â¯rm becomes less creditworthy because it has an increased
incentive to misrepresent the riskiness of potential projects | an outcome that will
lead potential lenders to increase the risk premium they require when making a loan.
The asymmetry of information makes internal Â¯nance of new investment projects
cheaper than external Â¯nance.
       More important for the transmission mechanism per se is that some Â¯rms are
dependent on banks for Â¯nance, and that monetary policy aÂ®ects bank loan supply.
A reduction in the quantity of reserves forces a reduction in the level of deposits,
which must be matched by a fall in loans. Nevertheless, lower levels of bank loans
will have an impact on the real economy only insofar as there are Â¯rms without an
alternative source of investment funds.
       Substantial empirical evidence supports the importance of both capital market
imperfections and Â¯rm dependence on bank Â¯nancing. Kashyap and Stein (1997)
provide a summary of two types of studies. The Â¯rst type suggests that banks rely
to a substantial extent on reservable-deposit Â¯nancing and that, for this reason, a
contraction in reserves will prompt banks to contract their balance sheets, reducing
the supply of loans. The second type establishes that there are a signiÂ¯cant number
of bank-dependent Â¯rms that are unable to mitigate the shortfall in bank lending
with other sources of Â¯nance. Overall, recent research does imply the existence of a
lending channel.10

   9
     As emphasized by Kashyap and Stein (1994), this is true for both Â¯nancial and nonÂ¯nancial
Â¯rms.
  10
     This is not to say that the traditional mechanisms, through interest rates and exchange rates,
are not present as well. Unfortunately, it has proved to be very diÂ±cult to disentangle the individual


                                                  9
    Cecchetti (1999) elaborates further on the importance of Â¯rms' dependence of bank
loans for the eÂ®ectiveness of policy changes. He looks at how diÂ®erences in the size,
concentration, and health of the banking systems, across a sample of 16 countries,
are likely to aÂ®ect the impact of monetary policy and concludes that \countries with
many small banks, less healthy bank systems, and poorer direct capital access display
a greater sensitivity to policy changes than do countries with big healthy banks and
deep, well-developed capital markets."11
    For our purposes here, the important conclusion is that the nature of the transmis-
sion mechanism is clearly inÂ°uenced by the structure of a country's Â¯nancial system.
Furthermore, only in places where the banking system is free to react to market forces
will it even be possible for policy to be transmitted through intermediaries. This im-
mediately suggests that the ability of monetary policy to engage in stabilization will
depend on the regulatory environment in which the banks function. It is to this issue
that we now turn.



4     Regulation and Intermediation
    The nature of Â¯nancial regulation has a profound inÂ°uence on the intermediation
process. The overarching goal of such regulation is to insure the stability of the
Â¯nancial system. In doing so, governmental oversight has an aÂ®ect both on the
structure of the Â¯nancial system and on the behavior of individual intermediaries.
    Many regulations are subtle in both their intent and their eÂ®ect. Others are not.
For example, La Porta, LÂ¶opez-de-Silanes, Vishny and Shleifer (1997, 1998) examine
how a country's legal system is related to its Â¯nancial structure. Investors provide
capital to Â¯rms only if they believe they will get their money back. For equity holders,
this means that they must be able to vote out directors and managers who do not pay
them. For creditors and holders of bonds, this means that they must have authority
to repossess collateral. Furthermore, these nominal legal rights must be accompanied

                                               10
by conÂ¯dence that the laws will be enforced. In countries where these protections are
strong, equity and bond markets are broad and deep and primary capital markets
will be important. By contrast, in those places were investor protections are weak,
Â¯nance will come primarily through the banking system.12
       The decision by governments to insure banking system liabilities either through
direct ownership of banks or through deposit insurance is an pathway for regulation to
aÂ®ect intermediation. Cross-country diÂ®erences in the extent to which governments
guarantee deposits, implicitly or explicitly, have a clear impact on the nature of bank
dependence and the extension of credit in an economy.
       By insuring deposits, banks' liability holders are signiÂ¯cantly less likely to request
the return of callable deposits, reducing the chances of bank runs. But at the same
time, deposit insurance subsidizes bank risk-taking activities and allows the payment
of lower interest rates to depositors.13 This channels money through banks, and away
from Â¯nancial markets. Direct state bank ownership has a similar impact.
       The perverse eÂ®ect of state-ownership of banks on the size and development of
Â¯nancial markets has been extensively discussed in the literature. Barth, Caprio
and Levine (1999) look, among other aspects, at the relationship between ownership
practices and the performance of the Â¯nancial sector. The evidence presented in their
paper points to a detrimental eÂ®ect of state ownership of banks on Â¯nancial develop-
ment and the securities markets. La Porta, LÂ¶opez-de-Silanes and Shleifer (2000) also
discover an unfavorable eÂ®ect of government ownership of banks on several Â¯nancial
development variables, consistent with the political view of government ownership of
banks leading to a decrease in eÂ±ciency.
       Consistent with this, in Cecchetti and Krause (2000) we observe that countries
with an explicit insurance scheme in place have smaller external capital markets and,
possibly, a lower number of publicly traded Â¯rms, once diÂ®erences in production and

  12

  13
     See DemirgÃuÂ»c-Kunt and Huizinga (1999) who use a cross-country sample to show that deposit
insurance decreases rates of return paid by banks, reduces market discipline faced by banks and
their managers, and increases banks' risk taking. DemirgÃ    uÂ»c-Kunt and Detragiache (1999) extend
this analysis, Â¯nding that deposit insurance increases the probability of banking crises.



                                                11
growth are controlled. Our model and empirical Â¯ndings suggest that an increase
in deposit insurance, either implicit or explicit, reduces equity issuance and may
reduce the number of Â¯rms issuing equity. The reason for this is that increasing
depositor's protection makes bank deposits more attractive than the (riskier) equity
shares, requiring higher rates for the latter and resulting in a lower issuance of stocks.
       The importance of state bank ownership on the size of the private loan market
is easy to establish. To do this, using our sample of 23 countries, we look at the
relationship between the share of banking system assets owned by the government
and the size of bank loans (as a percentage of GDP).14 Figure 3 presents a scatter
diagram of data on these two quantities, for the year 1995, together with a simple
regression line.
       Consistent with the Â¯ndings of Barth, Caprio and Levine (1999) and La Porta,
LÂ¶opez-de-Silanes and Shleifer (2000), we Â¯nd a negative correlation. That is, countries
in with higher government bank ownership have a lower level of overall credit extended
to the private sector.
       Taking this one step further, we look at the change from 1985 to 1995 in state
bank ownership and its relationship with changes in outstanding bank credit. The
result in Table 2 is fairly clear. Those countries in which the government has shed
direct control of bank assets, and so the banking system has become less centralized,
have experienced an increase of bank loans to the private sector.
       Clearly, the regulatory system shapes the Â¯nancial intermediation system in im-
portant ways. Given the importance of banks in the monetary transmission process,
this leads us to conclude that regulation is important for monetary policy eÂ®ective-
ness. In particular, we expect that in countries where state-owned banks are impor-
tant monetary policy will be weaker since the size and terms of government-controlled
bank loans are commonly not market oriented.
       When loans rates are not market determined, monetary policy's impact is clearly
blunted. The consequences for private sector activity of a change in the short-term
interest rate controlled by the central bank will have a lower impact on the lending of

state-owned banks that it would on privately owned banks operating in a competitive
environment. If the behavior of banks is unaÂ®ected by policy actions, there will be
no lending channel to transmit monetary policy to the economy, leaving much less
scope for policymakers to achieve their objectives.
      Turning to deposit insurance, we expect bank loan Â¯nancing to be relatively more
important than equity Â¯nancing in the presence of deposit insurance. This implies
that countries which have adopted an explicit insurance system should exhibit Â¯rms
with a higher dependence on bank loans as a means of Â¯nancing. To study this
possibility, using data from Table I of DemirgÃ
                                              uÂ»c-Kunt and Detragiache (1999) we
construct a measure of the evolution of each country's deposit insurance regime from
1985 to 1995. Our data is normalized so that `1' represents instituting an insurance
system between 1985 and 1995, `0' represents no change, and `-1' the elimination of
the explicit insurance system between 1985 and 1995.
      Our expectation is that a shift toward an explicit insurance, for a given level of
state bank ownership, will drive Â¯rms into the banking system, decreasing equity
issuance and increasing bank dependence. The impact on the actual level of credit
extended by banks to private Â¯rms is ambiguous. The results in Table 2 show that,
between 1985 and 1995, the level of state bank ownership declined on average while
the proportion of countries with explicit deposit insurance increased. Overall, the
amount of private credit extended (relative to GDP) also rose. The results presented
in the right-most column of the table suggest that the change in from banks to the
private sector is negatively correlated with the change in state-owned bank assets,
but is uncorrelated with the change in the deposit insurance system.
      As we discuss in our earlier work, Cecchetti and Krause (2000), this does not
mean that deposit insurance is irrelevant for Â¯nancial structure. There we report
evidence that the presence of deposit insurance aÂ®ects the intermediation mechanism
primarily through its impact on the size of equity markets. Countries with explicit
deposit insurance have a external capital markets to GDP ratio to that is roughly
ten percentage points lower than those that do not.15 If deposit insurance reduces

the reliance of Â¯rms on equity Â¯nancing, dependence on bank loans will rise. This
strengthens the lending channel, broadening the eÂ®ectiveness of monetary policy.
    Overall, it is clear that changes in government involvement in the Â¯nancial sector
have precipitated important changes in the intermediation. The degree to which bank-
ing activity is driven by market mechanisms has changed in a number of countries,
with potentially important consequences for the monetary transmission mechanism.
In particular, we see that in a number of countries the state has shed its banking as-
sets and restructured its deposit insurance system in ways that are likely to make for
increased eÂ®ectiveness of monetary policy. We now proceed to study whether these
changes can be tied to both measured improvements in macroeconomic outcomes and
changes in the eÂ±ciency of monetary policy.



5     Measuring the EÂ±ciency Monetary Policy
    In looking at the improvement in macroeconomic outcomes documented in Sec-
tion 2 we noted several possible explanations. One alternative is that the combined
reduction in output and inÂ°ation volatility is a consequence of improved monetary
policy. That is, central banks may have become more competent and moved their
economies closer to the output-inÂ°ation variability frontier. To study this possibility,
we need to estimate the change in policy eÂ±ciency between 1980s and the 1990s.
    To construct a simple measure of the change in central bank eÂ±ciency, we begin
by assuming that central bankers move their interest rate instrument in a manner
designed to minimize the simple weighted sum of output and inÂ°ation variability that
is the loss L in equation (1). In carrying out their stabilization objective, the poli-
cymakers must take account of various types of unexpected events. For convenience,
we divide these shocks into two groups: (1) those that move output and inÂ°ation in
the same direction and we label demand shocks; and (2) those that move output and
inÂ°ation in opposite direction and we label supply shocks. The policymaker's interest
rate instrument is like a demand shock, as it moves output and inÂ°ation up and down




                                          15
together.16
       The best possible monetary policy will completely neutralize demand shocks, but
faces a trade-oÂ® when confronted with supply shocks. Since supply shocks move
output and inÂ°ation in opposite directions, a policymaker must decide whether to
stabilize inÂ°ation, thereby destabilizing output even further, or the reverse. The de-
cision depends on the tastes as embodied in the weight Â¸ from the objective function.
       Returning to the problem, we see that if policy is optimal, then the correlation
between inÂ°ation and output (measured as deviations from the desired paths) will
be minus one. This immediately implies that the product of the variances minus
the squared covariance has a lower limit of zero.17 Writing this as h, we study the
properties of:
                                 h(i) Â´ Â¾y2 (i)Â¾Â¼2 (i) Â¡ (Â¾Â¼y (i))2                               (2)

where i is the time period over which h(i) is computed. As h(i) falls, monetary policy
improves. We go on to examine the change in policy eÂ±ciency from the 1980s to the
1990s using:                                     "      #
                                                h(1)
                                         e Â´ ln             :                                     (3)
                                                h(2)
When policy eÂ±ciency increases, the measure e rises. Furthermore, and as we show
in the appendix, this measure is robust to changes in the variance of demand and/or
supply shocks that are common to all countries.18
       Figure 4 presents our estimates for the policy eÂ±ciency gain in the 23 countries.19
Using this measure, the monetary authorities of 19 countries have become more ef-

  16
     See Cecchetti (2001) for an extended discussion of monetary policy viewed as a control problem.
  17
     This is also true for the case in which the correlation is positive one, but as the derivation in
the appendix shows, the measure that we actually use is unambiguous in that it declines only as
eÂ±ciency improves.
  18
     As we discuss in the appendix, the measure e robust to whether or not policy is credible. In
fact, an increase in credibility is likely to be measured as an increase in eÂ±ciency.
  19
     As we discuss in the appendix, can be interpreted in two ways. It is either the improvement
in eÂ±ciency assuming that the variance of both demand and supply shocks is unchanged between
the two subperiods, or it is a measure of the relative change in eÂ±ciency assuming that the change
in the shock variances are the same across countries. Following the methods used to compute the
performance gain in Section 2, we measure the eÂ±ciency gain using variance and covariance estimates
computed as deviations from inÂ°ation of 2% and the full-sample log-trend of output.

Â¯cient in neutralizing shocks comparing the 1980s to the 1990s. The changes in
Australia, Israel and New Zealand can be linked the adoption of explicit inÂ°ation
targets. Improvements in the non-inÂ°ation-targeting European countries are likely
linked to the desire to meet the qualiÂ¯cation requirements for monetary union, while
the decline in performance in Germany is almost surely the consequence of both
uniÂ¯cation and the necessary adjustment prior to EMU.
    Our primary interest is in whether the distribution of changes in policy eÂ±ciency
across countries can be explained by diÂ®erences in the evolution of Â¯nancial regulatory
structures. To examine this, we simply regress the measure of improved monetary
policy, e, on the change in the extent of state bank ownership and the change in
explicit deposit insurance. Because it is such an outlier, we examine the case both
with and without Israel. The results, reported in Table 3 show that point estimates
are as we expect. That is, a decline in state bank ownership and switch to explicit
deposit insurance are both associated with improvements in monetary policy.
    We have now established the main links in our argument. The regulatory struc-
ture, especially direct state ownership of banking system assets and the character of

                                                        18
the deposit insurance system, aÂ®ect the structure of Â¯nance. The lower the level of
direct governmental ownership of banks, the more loans are extended to the private
sector. Second, we have established that changes in Â¯nancial structure have an im-
pact on the scope of monetary policy to stabilize the economy. In this section we
showed how improved eÂ±ciency of monetary policy, as measured by the extent to
which policy neutralizes demand shocks, is linked to the certain key changes in the
regulatory structure. We are now ready to return to the primary question raised ear-
lier: Can changes in Â¯nancial regulation, by allowing for more eÂ±cient central bank
policy, explain the improved overall economic performance we have witnessed over
the past two decades in a large major of countries? This is the subject of the next
section.



6     Explaining the Performance Improvements
    Do changes in the Â¯nancial regulatory environment provide a partial explanation
for the measured improvement in macroeconomic outcomes? We address this question
in two diÂ®erent ways. First, we show that improved policy eÂ±ciency has led to
stability. And second, we examine the relationship between the performance gain
and the our measures of Â¯nancial structure. Our expectation is that a reduction in
direct governmental ownership of banks and introduction of explicit deposit insurance
should enhance the stability of both inÂ°ation and output.
    Figure 5 plots the performance gain (from Table 2) against the change in monetary
policy eÂ®ectiveness (from Figure 4). All observations yield values which are located
within a range of [-0.50,1.69] for policy eÂ®ectiveness and [-0.01,5.32] for improvement
in macroeconomic performance, except for Israel, which is a clear outlier.20 As has
been the case all along, this suggests that Israel is suÂ±ciently diÂ®erent from the other
22 countries in our sample that we should exclude it.

  20
     The performance gain for Israel is 17.85 when the monetary authority's goal is to minimize the
weighted sum industrial production variance around its average and inÂ°ation variance around a 2%
target, while the measure of eÂ±ciency improvement yields a value of 2.07.

Results are for simple regressions of the performance gain from Table 1 on the change in the percentage of bank
assets owned by the state and the change in the deposit insurance system. P-values use standard errors robust to
heteroskedasticity.




    The solid line plotted in Figure 5 is the bivariate regression line, excluding Israel.
There is a clear positive slope, implying that countries with improvements in policy
eÂ±ciency also experienced macroeconomic performance gains.
    Turning to the direct relationship of changes in Â¯nancial structure on changes
in performance, we take the measures of performance gain reported in Table 1 and
regress them on the changes in state-owned bank assets and deposit insurance system.
Focusing on the second column, the results excluding Israel, we obtain the results we
had hoped for. Countries that either reduced the level of direct state-bank ownership
or instituted explicit deposit insurance experienced more profound macroeconomic
improvements. That is, the coeÂ±cient estimates are of the expected sign and the
reduced level of state-bank ownership is statistically signiÂ¯cantly diÂ®erent from zero
at the 5% level of better. Furthermore, these two variables are able to explain 40%
of the variation in the performance data for this sample of 22 countries.
    We note that these results are robust to a number of changes in the exact methods
used to compute them. As we mentioned above, computing inÂ°ation variability as
deviations from the mean of the two subsamples, rather than as deviations from 2%,

                                                      21
has virtually no impact on the results. We also examined the ability of alternative
measures of the Â¯nancial regulatory environment to explain the changes in perfor-
mance. But, with the exception of the deposit insurance and state-bank ownership
variables that we include, we were unable to discern any material changes that could
have generated the results.21
      How important are these eÂ®ects? How can be gauge the importance of state-
bank ownership and deposit insurance for stability? To do this we take the examples
of Mexico and Chile, both of which instituted deposit insurance and reduced the
percentage of bank owned assets between 1985 and 1995. Taking Mexico Â¯rst, we
see from Table 1 that macroeconomic performance improved by 85%, with the loss
measure L falling from 6.23 to 0.90. Our estimates suggest that the implementation
of deposit insurance accounts for 0.53, or 10% of the improvements, while the decline
in government ownership of bank assets (from 100% in 1985 to 36% in 1995) for 1.68,
or slightly over 30% of the decline.
      For Chile, the impact of regulatory changes is equally dramatic. While the level of
state bank ownership changed only modestly, from 26% to 20% of assets, Chile shifted
to an explicit deposit insurance system. This easily accounts for the improvement in
performance, from a loss of 1.74 to one of 1.28.
      Overall, we conclude that these eÂ®ects are large. In the case of Mexico, for exam-
ple, decline in the loss that is related to two changes in the environment is roughly
equivalent to a decline in the standard deviation of inÂ°ation from 62.7% in the 1980s
to 24.3% in the 1990s (both assuming that the inÂ°ation objective is two percent).
That is, we can trace the change in banking-system ownership and the institution of
deposit insurance to a more than Â¯fty percent reduction in inÂ°ation volatility.



7       Conclusions
       Over the past twenty years, macroeconomic performance has improved world-
wide. At the same time, Â¯nancial systems have evolved. In particular, government

                                                22
intervention has changed. Looking across a sample of 23 developed and emerging
markets countries we study the link between changes in governmental involvement in
the Â¯nancial system and more stable economic outcomes. Our Â¯ndings suggest that
reductions inÂ°ation and output volatility can be linked to a combination of reduced
state ownership of commercial bank assets and the introduction of explicit deposit
insurance.
   We postulate that changes in Â¯nancial regulation inÂ°uence volatility through their
impact on ability of central banks to use their policy tools. When the banking system
is largely controlled by the government, there is little scope for monetary policy
to stabilize activity. As the banks become privately owned, their lending practices
respond to market incentives and monetary policy becomes more eÂ®ective. When
banks are private, central bank interest rate changes have the ability to aÂ®ect the
level of private lending. Only then, can policy makers do their job. Using a new
measure of monetary policy eÂ±ciency, we are able to establish this relationship in the
data.
   There are surely many alternative interpretations that could be given to the col-
lection of facts we have assembled here. For example, it could be that there is some
fundamental driving force that is reduced state ownership of commercial bank assets,
introduction of explicit deposit insurance, improved monetary policy eÂ±ciency and
macroeconomic stability all at the same time. A candidate would be the presence of
Â¯nancial crises arising from generally poor Â¯scal and regulatory policies prior during
the 1980s. These crises could have led to all of these changes simultaneously.
   It is diÂ±cult to rule out the possibility that some combination of local and global
phenomena caused the regulatory and policy changes as well as reduced volatility. If
this were so, our interpretation would be incorrect. We do believe, however, that our
results are suggestive that the measure improvements in monetary policy eÂ±ciency
are a result of changes in Â¯nancial structure, and that it is these that produced the
more stable output and inÂ°ation share world-wide.

Appendix I: Measuring Policy EÂ±ciency
In this appendix we derive the measure for policy eÂ®ectiveness h(i) in equation (2),
as well as the change in policy eÂ®ectiveness e in equation (3). To do this, we consider
the policymaking as an optimal control problem in which central bankers set their
interest rate instrument in order to minimize the loss given by equation (1), subject
to the constraints that are imposed by the structure of the economy.
       To begin, we assume that policymakers minimize the loss function


                           L = E[Â¸(Â¼t Â¡ Â¼ Â¤ )2 + (1 Â¡ Â¸)(yt Â¡ y Â¤ )2 ] ;                             (1)


where E denotes the mathematical expectation, Â¼ is inÂ°ation, y is the (log) of ag-
gregate output, Â¼ Â¤ and y Â¤ are the desired levels of inÂ°ation and output, and Â¸ is the
relative weight given to squared deviations of output and inÂ°ation from their desired
levels.22
       Minimization of this loss requires knowledge of the determinates of deviations of
output and inÂ°ation from their desired levels. We assume that two random shocks
push y and Â¼ away from y Â¤ and Â¼ Â¤ . The Â¯rst shock | the aggregate demand shock (d)
| moves output and inÂ°ation in the same direction; the second shock | the aggregate
supply shock (s) | moves output and inÂ°ation in opposite directions. Policy is only
capable of moving output and inÂ°ation in the same direction, and so is analogous to
an aggregate demand shock.
       A simple textbook aggregate demand and aggregate supply is suÂ±cient for the
task at hand.23 The aggregate demand curve is the negative relationship between
(Â¼ Â¡ Â¼ Â¤ ) and (y Â¡ y Â¤ ) that is shifted by the demand shock (d) and interest rate policy
changes (r):

     An alternative speciÂ¯cation of the loss function would include interest rate variability as a policy
concern. This would imply that interest rate volatility should have fallen in countries with improved
performance. However, this is not the case in the data.

     Romer (2000) provides a very description of how to derive this simple model.




                                                   24
where ! is the slope coeÂ±cient.
   Analogously, aggregate supply is the positive relationship between inÂ°ation devi-
ations and output deviations that is shifted by the supply shock (s). We can write
this as
                                       1
                            Â¼ Â¡ Â¼ Â¤ = Â¡ (y Â¡ y Â¤ ) Â¡ Â¯s :                         (3)
                                       Â°
Normalizing Â± and Â¯ to be speciÂ¯c functions of Â° and !, we can write the reduced
form of the system (2) and (3) as


                              y Â¡ y Â¤ = Â¡Â°(r Â¡ d) + s;                            (4)


                             Â¼ Â¡ Â¼ Â¤ = Â¡(r Â¡ d) Â¡ !s ;                            (5)

where Â± and Â¯ have been chosen to yield this simple form.
   The quadratic objective and linear economic structure means that the optimal
policy response to demand and supply shocks is a simple linear rule. That is, the
instrument response is of the form


                                     r = ad + bs;                                 (6)


where a and b are the degree to which policy reacts to the two shocks. Minimizing the
loss, subject to the constraint imposed by the structure of economy, yields optimal
values for the reaction parameters a and b, which we label aÂ¤ and bÂ¤ . These are
simply


                             aÂ¤ = 1                                               (7)
                                  Â¡Â¸! + (1 Â¡ Â¸)Â°
                             bÂ¤ =                  :                              (8)
                                    Â¸ + (1 Â¡ Â®)Â° 2

An optimal policy has two parts, Â¯rst the authorities completely neutralize all de-
mand shocks, and second they accommodate supply shock depending on structural
parameters (!; Â°) and their preferences (Â¸).
   We measure eÂ±ciency by estimating how close outcomes are to those that would


                                         25
be implied by this optimal policy. To derive a measure, Â¯rst note that for any policy
the variances of output and inÂ°ation, as well as their covariance are given by


          Â¾y2 = E(y Â¡ y Â¤ )2 = (1 Â¡ Â°b)2 Â¾s2 + Â° 2 (a Â¡ 1)2 Â¾d2                           (9)
          Â¾Â¼2 = E(Â¼ Â¡ Â¼ Â¤ )2 = (! + b)2 Â¾s2 + (a Â¡ 1)2 Â¾d2                               (10)
         Â¾yÂ¼ = E(y Â¡ y Â¤ )(Â¼ Â¡ Â¼ Â¤ ) = Â¡(1 Â¡ Â°b)(! + b)Â¾s2 + Â°(a Â¡ 1)2 Â¾d2 ;             (11)


where Â¾s2 and Â¾d2 are the variances of aggregate supply and aggregate demand shocks
respectively.
   Our measure of eÂ±ciency is based on the quantity


                                     h = Â¾y2 Â¾Â¼2 Â¡ [Â¾yÂ¼ ]2 :                             (12)


If policymakers adopt the optimal policy, this is zero. That is hÂ¤ = 0, as policymakers
will eliminate all aggregate demand shocks, leaving only aggregate supply shocks
which generate a correlation of minus one between output and inÂ°ation. The measure
h is based on the coeÂ±cient of variation of inÂ°ation and output, and will be zero when
they are perfectly correlated.
   In general,
                       h = Â° 2 (a Â¡ 1)2 [(1 Â¡ Â°b)2 + (! + b)2 )]Â¾s2 Â¾d2 :                (13)

Looking at (13) we see that closer a is to aÂ¤ = 1, the closer h is to zero. It is also
true that h declines with both Â¾s2 and Â¾d2 . As the world becomes calmer overall this
measure of the level of eÂ±ciency appears to decline. We discuss how we handle this
issue below.
   We study the change in h by taking the log of the ratio of its level in the Â¯rst
period to that in the second. That is, we look at
            "      #
            h(1)
     e Â´ ln            =   lnfÂ°(1)2 (a(1) Â¡ 1)2 [(1 + Â°(1)b(1))2 + (!(1) + b(1))2 ]g     (14)
            h(2)
                           Â¡ lnfÂ°(2)2 (a(2) Â¡ 1)2 [(1 + Â°(2)b(2))2 + (!(2) + b(2))2 ]g
                           + lnfÂ¾s2 (1)Â¾d2 (1)g Â¡ lnfÂ¾s2 (2)Â¾d2 (2)g


                                               26
where h(i) is the value of h is period i. As is clear from (14), e can change for several
reasons. First, rises as a moves closer to aÂ¤ . This is the eÂ®ect that we wish to isolate.
Unfortunately, a change in the variance of demand and supply shocks, in particular
a decline in Â¾s2 Â¾d2 , will also cause e to increase. But if we assume that the change in
Â¾s2 Â¾d2 is common to all of the countries in our sample, then the cross-country variation
in e gives us a measure of the relative improvement in policy eÂ±ciency allowing us to
focus on the cross-sectional determinates of e.
   It is worth making two observations about our measure e. First, if either shocks
are not perfectly observable or if policy can only react with a lag, then it will be
impossible to completely neutralize demand shocks. In this more realistic case, it will
be impossible for policy makers to adjust their instrument to insure that (Â¼ Â¡ Â¼ Â¤ )
and (y Â¡ y Â¤ ) are perfectly negatively correlated, and so hÂ¤ will deviate from zero.
Fortunately, this does not aÂ®ect our measure of the change in policy eÂ±ciency.
   Finally, we note that our measure of eÂ±ciency is will be related to changes in the
credibility of policymakers but not its level. If a policymakers becomes more credible,
then this will reduce the inÂ°ation bias and generate a movement toward the eÂ±ciency
frontier. Lack of credibility itself, however, should not have an impact on the ability
of a skillful central banker to neutralize demand shocks.

 1. InÂ°ation and Output data for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
   Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United
   Kingdom are from Datastream; those for Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico,
   New Zealand, Switzerland and the United States are taken from the OECD
   Main Economic Indicators. Data for Chile are from the Central Bank of Chile's
   WWW-homepage (inÂ°ation), and from DRI (industrial production); Israeli data
   are taken from DRI (industrial production, and inÂ°ation). Korea's data are
   taken from IFS (industrial production) and DRI (inÂ°ation). For France and
   Portugal the Â¯rst subperiod consisted of data from 1983:I-1989:IV, while for
   Korea and New Zealand we divided the sample into the subperiods 1984:I-
   1990:IV and 1991:I-1997:IV, as a result of data restrictions.

 2. Loans/GDP data was obtained from the International Financial Statistics Year-
   book, edited by the IMF, by dividing the sum of entries 32d-g by entry 99b.

 3. Data on Bank Assets Owned by the State are from Table 2 of La Porta, LÂ¶opez-
   de-Silanes and Shleifer (2000), which measures the percentage share of the assets
   of the top 10 banks in a given country owned by the government of that country.
