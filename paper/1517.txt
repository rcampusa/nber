                   Trade and Financial Interdependence
            Under Flexible Exchange Rates: The Pacific Area

                                ABSTRACT



     This paper analyses policy interdependence under flexible exchange

rates and its implications for middle-income countries in the Pacific

area. In the first part of the paper, the consequences of strategic

behavior among industrial countries are illustrated by means of a simple

diagram. It is argued that in the absence of incentives to coordinate

macroeconomic policies among major countries, exchange rates will tend

to be volatile. Evidence on the world value of the dollar in the

flexible rate period is then presented and interpreted.

     The second part describes exchange.rate policies in the Pacific

area. It is found that the widespread policy of pegging to the U.S.

dollar has implied occasional large devaluations against the numeraire

(Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia). An alternative,

which requires higher Pacific trade and financial interdependence than

the one prevailing during the last decade, would be a joint float along

the lines of the policies seemingly pursued by Malaysia and Singapore.

     The two-country macroeconomic model presented in the Appendix

can be used to assess the costs and benefits of policy coordination both

at the world and at the regional level.

     INTRODUCTION



     The performance of the world economy in the last ten years has been

very uneven. In industrial countries, growth was much slower than

expected: it fell from 5% per annum in 1960—73 to about 2% in 1973-82.

The slowdown was less brutal in developing countries, where the rate fell

from 6% to 4½% between the two periods. Among those, the ones in the

Pacific area managed to sustain an annual rate of growth of 7½%, close to

the high rate of 8% they recorded in the previous period. Nevertheless,

if policies in industrial countries continue to be contractionary, or if

major exchange rates continue to be volatile, it will be harder to

sustain Pacific growth without a substantial increase in trade and

financial interdependence among the middle-income countries of the
          1
region.

     Expectations of self-sustained fast and stable growth in the OECD

area had been formed during the so-called the post-war "belle epoque".

For twenty-five years, macroeconomic policies preserved full employment

and reasonable price inflation at home while allowing for a rapid

expansion of international trade and capital movements. Judged by this

standard, the performance of the last decade has generated the belief

that Atlantic prosperity is over. In the process, skepticism about the

effectiveness of national macroeconomic policies in restoring full

employment without inflation, or in reducing inflation without unemploy-

ment, became widespread.

     The volatile policy environment of recent years reflects this

skepticism: high trade and financial interdependence implies conflicts
                                   -4-




between national policy objectives and gives rise to strategic behavior

by national actors, whose outcome may be inefficient. In the seventies,

these conflicts were exacerbated by the oil shocks. In the early

eighties, the rise of the dollar also had the effect of a global shock.

Moreover, when there are shared instruments, such as the exchange rate,

which are very sensitive to expectations about the future, signals of the

lack of credibility of a particular macroeconomic policy package become

evident in the foreign exchange market. To offset these signals requires

a high degree of international policy coordination.

     In the absence of conflicts among national policy objectives,

expectations about the future would be lessvolatile. Intentions of

international policy coordination would then become credible and, as a

consequence, a fixed exchange rate regime, such as the one which

prevailed during the post-war "belle epoque", could be enforced. If the

exchange rate between major currencies were fixed, on the other hand,

macroeconomic policy in smaller countries might be facilitated.

     Even though international policy coordination would support a fixed

exchange rate system, there is no incentive to coordinate. Because each

one of the countries would be better-off if the other country initiated

monetary expansion, an explicit agreement, monitored by an international

organization, would be required toenfórce the coordinated expansion in

the two countries. The task would clearly be more difficult if the

coordination was to be achieved among a large number of countries, or if

the two countries were not similar.

     The design and implementation of a comprehensive recovery program

among industrial countries would also have to imply that expectations of

future changes in exchange rates settle at some "equilibrium" value.
                                   -5-




Otherwise expectations would remain volatile and so would exchange rates

and competitiveness. Credible government intervention in the foreign

exchange market to limit exchange rate volatility would surely be

desirable. However, it would involve operations of a scale which does

not seem viable under the present international order. The degree of

international monitoring required may even raise fundamental value

judgements about the sovereignty of nation-states.

     The slowdown of inflation cannot induce a worldwide recovery of

private economic activity which is expected to last, as it did during the

post—war "belle epoque", until macroeconomic policies of major countries

are not better coordinated, both internally and internationally.2

Furthermore, the substantial fiscal inbalance between the United States

and other OECD countries is likely to call for a serious macroeconomic

adjustment in the years to come, and this will be reflected in the world

value of the dollar.

     In the meantime, the skepticism about the effectiveness of central

bank intervention policies need not be a reason for undue pessimism about

the sustainability of world economic recovery. Indeed, the rise of stock

market prices in major industrial countries in early 1983, the concerted

steps to deal with the "external debt problem" without a major financial

crisis, and the strong recovery of the United States allow for some

optimism.

     The paper is organized into two Sections. First, a theoretical

assessment of the different outcomes of a policy interdependence game

between two similar (industrial) countries linked by international trade

and high capital mobility is presented. The results are expressed as

deviations from a long run equilibrium where expectations are fully
                                   -6-




realized. They are followed by a quantitative explanation of the world

value of the U.S. dollar in the last ten years, which, instead, gives a

large weight to the volatility of expectations about the long run

fundamental determinants of the international competitiveness of U.S.

products.

     The implications of the contractionary bias implied by strategic

behavior in industrial countries and of the volatility in major exchange

rates for the middle-income countries in the Pacific area are assessed in

Section II. Exchange rate policies in several of these countries reveal

a benign pegging to the U.S. dollar, which contrasts both with the

fervent experimentation prevailing in the Southern Cone of America and

with the tradition of currency unions encountered in West Africa. This

neglect of the volatility of the dollar explains why, in the last few

years, some countries changed the peg by means of sharp devaluations.

These have hindered regional trade and financial interdependence, thereby

increasing the vulnerability of the Pacific area to policy games played

elsewhere. The consequences of policy coordination in the area along the

lines of a "joint float" are taken up in the conclusion.

I.   POLICY INTERDEPENDENCE UNDER FLEXIBLE RATES



     The idea   that macroeconomic policies would become increasingly

ineffective if they did not recognize the increased interdependence among

nation-states was put forth in the late sixties, in the context of the

North Atlantic area. It has been widely discussed among economists and

political scientists since then, and the world teinterdependence? has also

been prominent in national and international policy debates.3

Furthermore, historians have used the notion of a "world-system" in

discussions not only of the 19th century but also of earlier periods. A

?tworld_systemt? is based on a network of channels of trade and financial

interdependence among countries and implies reciprocal constraints on the

attainment of their domestic macroeconomic policy objectives. These

constraints, which might be codified into explicit international rules or

agreements, also apply to the periphery of the system where the

reciprocity of interdependence is absent.

     The very popularity of the term interdependence suggests several

meanings. The most relevant for macroeconomic policy pertains to the

leakage abroad of a particular measure. One countryt s policy has effects

on another country which in turn have repercussions on the first country

and vice-versa. If interdependence increases, the effect of the policy

on the output of the initiating country tends to be smaller and the
                                           4
output effect abroad tends to be larger.

     When prices are allowed to vary, macroeconomic disturbances will

change not only output but also the terms of trade. Since these refer

both to the competitiveness of domestic versus foreign goods - measured
                                    —8—



 by the real exchange rate - and to the relative price of consumption and

 saving - measured by the real interest rate -   , trade   and financial

 interdependence crucially affect the transmission mechanism. Capital

 flows ensure that the return on foreign assets (in domestic currency)

 equals the return on domestic assets, at least in the absence of exchange

 controls as well as of risk-aversion on the part of international

 investors. By assuming that this arbitrage condition holds, we overstate

 the constraints implied by financial interdependence. This is

appropriate for a discussion of Atlantic policy interdependence, where

financial flows are hardly controled, but should be qualified in

discussing Pacific issues. In any event, the relative strength of the

effects of monetary policy on exchange rates and interest rates is

crucial for the outcome of the policy game analyzed below.

     In the late sixties, international economists were virtually

unanimous in claiming that exchange rate flexibility would insulate

national economies from each other, thus allowing greater macroeconomic

control of interdependence. With volatility of major exchange rates

becoming a central feature of world financial markets in the last ten

years, unanImity disappeared. Certainly, volatility has not been as

detrimental to international trade and payments as some feared but,        -




because of slower adjustment in goods markets, it has generated far more

variation in the relative price of national outputs than would be called

for by underlying demand and supply disturbances.

    The prevailing skepticism about the effectiveness of central bank

intervention in large, well organized foreign exchange markets suggests

that exchange rate volatility in the lastten years has derived from

problems of credibility of national government policy.5 The stance of
                                      -9-




the U.S. administration, on the other hand, may be related to the special

role of the U.S. dollar in the international monetary system.



1. Strategic Behavior in Industrial Countries



    Even in a theoretical world of two symmetric interdependent

economies, conflicts of national policy objectives imply a flexible

exchange rate system. The reason is that these conflicts tend to be

solved by non-cooperative methods.6 If the monetary authorities were to

cooperate, they would jointly try to reduce inflation and unemployment

and the solution would be efficient for both countries. Because there is

no reason for either country to believe that the other country will

cooperate, this solution will not arise spontaneously. A credible rule

or agreement monitored by an international agency, will be necessary to

enforce cooperation. If the two countries are identical, this

cooperative solution will support a fixed exchange rate.

     In the absence of an international monitoring agency, the two

monetary authorities will not behave cooperatively. Instead, they each

will try to attain the domestic objective, based on an anticipation of

the other country's policy response. This outcome will be inferior to

the cooperative outcome, as it involves a social loss arising from the

inefficient allocation of resources.

     If only one country -   the   leader -   correctly   anticipates the other

country's response, however, the outcome will be asymmetric. Even if the

two countries gain, the leader gains proportionately less than the

follower. Furthermore, if the two countries are identical, there is no

economic reason for either one to act as leader and therefore the
                                   -10-



 spontaneous outcome will be the symmetric non-cooperative solution, which

 is the one where both countries are worse-off. These theoretical

 possibilities are consistent with the observed reluctance of major

 industrial countries to act as leaders, or "locomotives", even though

 they advocate cooperation.

     To illustrate the framework, consider the case where the price of

 domes-tic output is rigid in both countries. Then the cooperative

solution succeeds in eliminating unemployment, while monetary expansion

sustains a fixed exchange rate and the same inflation in both countries.

If each country tries to lower inflation by appreciating the currency,

neither one succeeds in eliminating unemployment. This outcome hinges on

the dominance of interest rate effects on money demand rather than on

investment as well as on large trade elasticities. It is therefore the

appropriate one to focus on when the consequences of trade and financial

interdependence must be assessed. Furthermore, in this setup, the leader

will overexpand knowing that the follower will appreciate the currency.

This appreciation lowers inflation while the leader's expansion reduces

unemployment, so that the gains of the follower are greater than the

gains of the leader. Therefore, both will be reluctant to take

initiative and remain at the relatively less desirable symmetric

non-cooperative point.

     This example is illustrated in Figure 1. Taking the log-linear

two-country macromodel described in the Appendix and assuming that the

authorities are minimizing the deviations of output and the price level

from their steady-state values, we can define the loss contours in the

space of the single instrument available in each country, the money

stock, m and m*. By normalization, we choose as the origin the

 cooperative solution where the monetary expansion accomodates the price

 rigidity (point C in Figure 1). This yields a common loss cL     cL*

Since all other solutions shown involve lower money stock, the direction

of the axis is reversed. The straight lines RR and R*R* are the loci of

the reactiàn functions of the domestic and foreign country, respectively.

Their intersection denotes the non-cooperative outcome, labelled N, where

loss is greatest NL = NL*     At that point, though, the money stocks

remain equal so that the exchange rate does not move. If the home

country acts as a leader, the outcome is preferable for both SL > NL and

SL* > NL*     However, the home country would prefer to be a follower since

SL >
       SL*   and similarly for the foreign country SL* >   Sr
       A fixed exchange rate agreement, forcing the solution to be on the

450 line, would prevent the two countries from reaching N or, for that

matter, S or S*, since at those points the exchange rate will have to

change. The problem is how to make a commitment to fix the exchange rate

credible, since there would be incentives for each country to wait for

the other country to expand and be the "locomotive". An international

agreement such as the one underlying the Bretton-Woods system, monitored

by an international organization, would be needed to solve the problem,

even in a two-country world. Even if such agreement existed, though, the

mere expectation of exchange rate changes would generate incentives to

depreciate or appreciate the currency and undermine the credibility of

the system.

       Note finally that the unemployment which is associated with the

non-cooperative solution would, in the absence of other shocks, imply

over time a lower rate of inflation so that, in the long run, it might be

preferable to the more inflationary cooperative solution.7 This is
                                        -12-




related to the neglect of internal cooperation, and requires a dynamic

analysis where expectations adjust, like the one underlying the

discussion o follow.

      Nevertheless, it can be said that the qualitative analysis of the

prospects for world recovery based on the strategic interaction of two

symmetric economies is consistent with the protracted stagflation in the

OECD area, to the extent that the interest rate effects of monetary

policy have dominated. This has constrained recovery in industrial

countries and, as mentioned, a sustainable OECD recovery is necessary -

but   perhaps not sufficient -   for   sustainable growth in the Pacific as

well as for economic recovery in the world at large.



2.     The volatility of expectations and the world value of the dollar



       As shown in Table 1 below, the dollar exchange rates of major

currencies have been quite volatile. To obtain an indicator of the world

value of the dollar, we average major bilateral exchange rates in

proportion to the country's gross domestic product in dollars

(multilateral weights).8 In the last ten years, this indicator shows a

phase of relative stability prevailing from 1973 to early 1976; a phase

of devaluation extending until mid-1980; and a phase of steep

appreciation continuing until the present.

       Due to the stability of relative inflation rates, the variations in

the nominal effective exchange rate of the U.S. dollar have been matched

almost exactly by variations in its real exchange rate. Goods price

arbitrage was therefore very weak.
                                      -13-




     In a large well-organized speculative market, asset price or

intertemporal arbitrage ensures that actual exchange rates equal their

discounted expected equilibrium values. For example, in the presence of

inflationary expectations, a positive real differential of 5 per cent

per annum   in   the U.S. will be associated with an equal expected real

appreciation of the dollar. Unlike relative goods prices, real interest

differentials do seem to be correlated with the exchange rate.

Nevertheless, only one fourth of the quarterly volatility of the nominal

exchange rate of the dollar from 1973 to 1982 can be explained by

intertemporal arbitrage.

     In sum, the real exchange rate today will differ from the real

exchange rate yesterday due to the change in the real interest differen-

tial and to the change in expectations about the equilibrium real

exchange rate. If these are taken as given, exchange rate movements can

be captured by arbitrage conditions.9

     But expectations about the equilibrium real exchange rate cannot be

taken as given. Information on which they are based varies, sometimes

dramatically, from day to day. These changes are not only due to changes

in the fundamental determinants, but also to the existence, recognized by

market participants, of some probability of a sudden return to the

equilibrium value. SImilarly, the belief in a change in policy regime,

even if it is erroneous, can be a source of changes in expectations,

which will be all the more important in an unstable environment.10 A

rough way of embodying the influences of changes in expectations, or

"news", about the long-run equilibrium real exchange rate is to take the

residuals from an equilibrium model of the real exchange rate. This is

conditional upon specifying the correct equilibrium model.
                                  -14-




     With financial markets of major industrial countries highly inte-

grated, capital is free to move across different currencies. If

international investors compare risk and return characteristics of

assets, so that they exhibit risk-aversion, equilibrium exchange rates

will be influenced by portfolio considerations.11 Take a simplified

setting in which the change in the equilibrium real exchange rate can be

expressed as a function of the accumulation of foreign currency deposits

by the U.S. residents (current account) and of the relative monetary and

growth conditions in the U.S. and abroad (velocity). An empirical

application of this equilibrium model over the floating period shows

that, on average, a unit fall in the normalized relative current account

surplus of the U.S. induces a depreciation of real effective exchange

rate of the dollar by one fourth whereas the average effect of a fall in

velocity is a one-to-one real depreciation.12 Changes in fundamentals

explain 40 per cent of the actual volatility of the real exchange rate.

     The difference between actual changes and equilibrium changes is

then used as a proxy for "news". The explanation of the changes in the

nominal exchange rate also includes the arbitrage variables: relative

inflation rates and changes in real interest differentials. A special

effect due to the change in the U.S. Administration is allowed for. All

variables except the "news" become insignificant and the regression
                                                                         13
explains over 60 per cent of the variance of the nominal exchange rate.

     The importance of "news" shows the difficulty in anticipating

exchange rates changes. This also reduces the ability of central banks

to dampen volatility by intervention. Bearing in mind the simplicity of

the estimation methods used, the results confirm the advantage of relying

on a portfolio equilibrium framework rather than exclusively on arbitrage
                                  —15—



conditions. Since it only allows for currency diversification, this

simplified equilibrium model cannot capture the U.S. fiscal-monetary mix

after 1982. Renewed expectations of a fiscal deficit raising U.S. real

interest rates are required.for the equilibrium real exchange rate to

continue appreciating in spite of a widening current account deficit.

II. PACIFIC TRADE AND FINANCIAL INTERDEPENDENCE



    Rather than attempting to estimate the measures of trade and

financial interdependence emphasized earlier, we assess interdependence

among the middle-income countries of the Pacific area by an investigation

of their exchange rate regime, an analysis of regional trade patterns,

and an overview of trade in relative prices - as measured by

trade—weighted effective exchange rates deflated by relative consumer

prices (subsection 1). It will become apparent that trade and financial

interdependence is channeled through the two entrepots of the region,

Singapore and Hong-Kong. Furthermore, the analysis of Section 1.1 is

relevant to Singapore and Malaysia, where most of the ingredients of

trade and financial interdependence can be found (subsection 2).

     Nevertheless, as stated in the conclusion, trade and financial

interdependence in the middle-income countries of the Pacific as a group

is still quite low by North Atlantic standards.



1. Exchange rate regimes in Pacific middle-income countries



     As mentioned, both the nominal and the real effective exchange rates

of the U.S. dollar depreciated from 1977 to 1980 and appreciated since

then. This remarkable medium-term swing followed a period of relative

stability with a mild depreciation in 1975. As a rule, the Pacific

middle-income countries followed this pattern closely. Except for 1983,

when they let the dollar appreciate in nominal and real terms, the

trade-weighted exchange rates of most Pacific middle-income countries

have depreciated and appreciated with the dollar, in what may be called
                                    —17—



  an exchange rate policy of "benign neglect". While a distinction can be

  made between "peggers" and "floaters", it does not necessarily coincide

  with the official exchange rate regime, as described, say, in the Fund's

 Annual Report on Exchange Restrictions.

      Indeed, no country is explicitly pegged to the U.S. dollar.     Rather
 the peg is an undisclosed basket of trading partners' currencies. On the

 other side, the two floaters, Malaysia and Singapore, are to a large

 extent bilaterally pegged despite the absence of a formal commitment to
 that effect.

      Consider the five (unofficial) dollar
                                               peggers. During 1975-82,
 their effective exchange rates followed the dollar's, with some

 anticipating it. Thus Philippines and Korea deprecitaed in 1976 and

 1982, while Indonesia and Thailand appreciated in 1979 and the

 Philippines in 1980. Changes in effective exchange rates were also

 brought about by discrete devaluations against the dollar.   This was the
 case in 1983 for Indonesia and Philippines (both
                                                    by about 150%), in 1982
for Taiwan (13%), in 1981 for Thailand and Taiwan (38% and 17%

respectively), in 1980 for Korea (about 120%), in 1978 for Indonesia

(200%), in 1975 for the Philippines (30%) and in 1974 for Korea (85%).

Singapore and Malaysia also let their currencies depreciate against the

dollar in 1975, by 50% and 30% respectively.

     Since these devaluations are not synchronized, the correlation

between the (end-of-period) dollar rates of the peggers is very weak over

the period from the second quarter of 1973 to the second quarter of 1984.

Indeed, the only value higher than .5 is between Thailand and Taiwan. In

contrast, among the main industrial partners of the United States except

Canada the correlation among dollar rates is generally higher than .5
                                   -18—



 (the only lower values are .4, between Japan and the United Kingdom and

 Italy). The correlation of the dollar rates of the Pacific peggers with

the yen-dollar rate is also quite weak, the highest being Taiwan (.32).

     The two joint floaters, however, exhibit a correlation of about .9

between themselves and also with the mark-dollar rate. The correlation

with the yen-dollar rate is about .5, slightly lower than the one between

the yen-dollar and the mark-dollar rates. Table 1 shows the variability

of the Pacific peggers relative to the floaters and to the currencies

used in the computation of the effective rate of the dollar described

above. Despite the crude measures used, it is clear that variability is

lowest for the dollar peggers.

     To analyse the trends in trade-weighted exchange rates, some

indication of trade shares and elasticities is needed. Since trade

elasticity estimates discriminating between the imports of various

origins are not easily available, the network of trade interdependence

has to rely on measures of average openness.14 But, in the model of

Section 1.1, a large multiplier or a high elasticity substantially

increases the degree of trade interdependence and leads to a strong

negative feedback of monetary policy. A merchandise trade matrix, while

it neglects invisibles and smuggling, provides a rough approximation to

the trade channel of structural interdependence. In Table 2, the Pacific

middle-income countries are arranged as the four NICs and the so-called

New NICs which include ASEAN countries less Singapore. To make the role

of the overlapping country more apparent, shares less than 1.5% were set

to zero. As a consequence, rows and columns do not add up to the numbers

reported under total. The last row and column refer to the share of the

country's trade accounted for by other Pacific middle-income countries.

The largest values are for Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, even though

Thailand on the export side and Hong Kong on the import side are also

above the average of 19%.

     Using the set of trade weights reported in Appendix Tables 1 and 2,

nominal and effective exchange rates for our seven Pacific countries were

computed (see Appendix Tables 3-9). The real rates presented are very

crude proxies for relative traded goods prices due to the existence of

several export incentives, but they give an idea of the evolution of the

purchasing power of the domestic currency over a foreign basket of goods

in relation to a domestic one. 15   We will focus on their annual average

value using import weights. These tend to overstate the weight of the

United States and Japan because the European Community is not aggregated.

Better estimates of the weights of the EC are thus reported in the last

row. Similarly, trade of Singapore and Indonesia is not reflected in the

table. Using the Indonesia export shares from Table 2, the ttothertt

category is as reported in parentheses in Appendix Table 1. This figure

was used to compute a set of import weights for Singapore which may be a

better approximation to reality.

     According to Table 3, the nominal effective exchange rate of the

dollar peggers did not on average change by more under floating than it

had during most of the Bretton-Woods period. The opposite is true of the

floaters. Again, a decline in the absolute value of the mean rate of

change from the fixed to the flexible rate period is evident in virtually

all countries. The exception is the rate of Singapore when some imports

from Indonesia are allowed for. There is a real appreciation instead of

a depreciation and its magnitude increases with the sharp devaluations of

the Indonesian currency since 1978. The coefficients of variation

(standard deviation over mean) convey the same message.

     We observed in Section 1.2 that the nominal and real effective

exchange rates of the US dollar (using multilateral weights) were almost

perfectly correlated during the floating rate period. This is not the

case in the Pacific middle-income countries, as seen in Table 4: the

higher correlation, .9, is for Indonesia, where the policy was one of

sharp nominaldevaluations. Interestingly, over the longer period,

Philippines and Korea are the ones closer to relative purchasing power

parity (1 and .9 respectively from 1958 to 1983). Relative inflation

rates are very weakly correlated with nominal exchange rate changes. The

correlation is higher with real exchange rates precisely because of the

lower variability of nominal exchange rates: the lowest values are for

devaluation-prone Indonesia and Korea)6

     The cross-country correlations shown in Table 5 confirm the pattern

of dollar rates discussed above: low correlations of nominal and real

effective rates for most pairs of countries. Taiwan does display high

real correlation with Philippines and Thailand, and the same is true

between the two joint floaters, to which we now turn.



2. The Malayan joint float



     The development of Singapore as an entrepot for international trade

and finance has been a major factor in the trade and financial

interdependence of the middle income countries of the Pacific. The

economic proximity to Malaysia --   with   which it once was federated -- has

also been noted. It is possible to recast the policy games of Section

1.1 in a broader set-up which allows two small countries to act on their

money stocks given domestic shocks and the outcome of the policy game of

large countries, as captured by their bilateral exchange rate.17 If

there are no differences in the trade pattern of the small countries with

the large ones, the bilateral rate of the small countries will be fixed

unless one of them acts as a leader. Otherwise, the bilateral rate of

the small countries may move in the cooperative solution.

     If the most relevant policy game of industrial countries is between

the United States and Japan, trade patterns of Malaysia and Singapore are

roughly symmetric. If, instead, the game is between the United States

and Europe, Malaysia would be more sensitive to European shocks, given

the weights in Appendix Tables 1 and 2.

     Even in the case of a symmetric sensitivity the bilateral rate

between Malaysia and Singapore could move if one of the countries acted

as a leader. Due to its role as a financial center, Singapore may have

performed that role in the early eighties, thereby allowing Malaysia to

be less contractionary. Needless to say, a Malayan cooperative agreement

would be less contractionary still.'8

     Recalling that interest rate movements are an important channel of

policy interdependence, we report some evidence on the deposit rate

differentials between Singapore and Malaysia in Table 6.' While annual

averages hide a lot of information and should be used with caution, the

volatility of expectations about the world value of the U.S. dollar can

certainly account for the observed variations in the realized real

interest, differential. It seems therefore consistent with the

expectation of a Malayan joint float.20

CONCLUSION



        Over the last ten years, flexible exchange rates among industrial

countries generated an erratic pattern, in relative prices and made basic

signals of resource allocation very noisy. Growth declined worldwide,

but mostly in industrial countries. In the Pacific area, exchange rates

were not as volatile and growth continued. Policy interdependence under

flexible exchange rates may thus be partly responsible for the slowdown

of growth.

        Due to the erratic pattern of real exchange rates, it is very

difficult to assess, let alone correct, the misalignment of the major

world currencies. The preferred explanation of exchange rate volatility

stressed changes in the fundamental determinants of the real exchange

rate, identified as monetary velocities and current accounts. National

governments can stabilize expectations about fundamentals by designing

credible macroeconomic policies. The overwhelming influence of "news"

and the size of world financial markets relative to central bank reserves

strains the credibility of uncoordinated intervention in the foreign

exchange market.

        The realization that, even when the analysis is restricted to major

industrial countries, intervention in foreign exchange markets cannot

reduce volatility, has generated proposals designed to lessen trade and

financial interdependence among the major industrial countries. The

large size and efficient organization of the foreign exchange market

makes the effectiveness of trade and exchange restrictions temporary at

best.

     An international monetary system where greater stability in exchange

rates could again be expected requires a credible commitment to

coordinated macroeconomic policies, and therefore the existence of

incentives for policy coordination. Given the contractionary bias of the

flexible exchange rate system, additional monetary expansion in the U.S.

and other industrial countries could rekindle inflationary expectations

and hurt the ongoing recovery.

     In the absence of incentives for coordination among industrial

countries, higher trade and financial interdependence among the

middle-income countries of the Pacific could help preserve the growth

potential of the region. The widespread policy of pegging to the U.S.

dollar, while making exchange rates less volatile, has often been

accompanied by sharp devaluation against the nuineraire. An alternative,

which requires higher Pacific interdependence than the one prevailing

during the last decade, would be a joint float along the lines of the

policies seemingly pursued by Malaysia and Singapore. To manage this

float, monetary policy would adjust to accomodate changes in

import-weighted exchange rates such as the ones presented in this paper.

As financial interdependence increases, the indicators for the change in

this basket peg become the fundamental determinants of the equilibrium

real exchange rate, as discussed in connection with the world value of

the dollar.

                                   NOTES

 1.    Branson (1984) classifies the Pacific middle-income countries into

      Asian NICs (Hong-Kong, Korea and Singapore) and new NICs (Indonesia,

      Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand). He includes India as a low-

       income NIC, and so does Aghevli (1981). We exclude India,

      include Taiwan (the fourth Asian NIC) and make passing reference to

      Hong-Kong.

2.    The interaction of internal and external coordination weakens

      the case for cooperation among central banks, as recently shown

      by Rogoff (1983). We do not incorporate these issues in the

      analysis, even though they are important ingredients of the

      skepticism about the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies

      mentioned at the outset. In fact, when the incentive of central

      banks to inflate is somehow ruled out, the presumption for

      cooperation re-emerges. We thus come back to the direct link

      between the lack of credibility of macroeconomic policies and

      the volatility of expectations.

3.    The debate between economists and political scientists is discussed

      in Cooper (1984). Bressand (1982) claims that "economic security"

      has been declining, an idea close to the vulnerability -

      interdependence put forth by political scientists but also

      consistent with the volatility of expectations stressed below in the

      text.

4.    For example, consider a world economy composed of two identical

      countries where prices are fixed. If the (common) marginal

      propensity to save is 10%, we know that a unit increase in world

      autonomous expenditure will increase world output by ten. Assume
                                   -25-



     now a marginal propensity to import of one half in both countries. A

     unit increase in expenditure in one of them will increase domestic

     output by a multiplier of 5.5 and foreign output by a multiplier of

     4.5. If the marginal propensities to import increase to 75%,

     however, the domestic effect will decrease to 53% of the world

     output increase of ten units and the foreign effect will increase to

     47%. Higher propensities would of course reduce the multiplier.

5.   See Feldstein (1983).

6.   Simple game-theoretic macro models are in Hamada (1979) and

     Canzoneri and Gray (1983). Also Macedo (1984b) and references

     therein.

7.   The point is made by Cooper (1984).

8.   A trade-weighted index, such as the one used in Section II for Asian

     countries, would tend to be more stable in the case of the U.S.

     because it assigns a large weight to a low-variance currency, the

     Canadian dollar. From 1973 to 1979, for example, the bilateral

     index depreciated by slightly over one half of the multilateral

     index (5.4% vs. 8.6% p.a.).

9.   See Frenkel (1984).

10. Then a positive interest rate differential in favor of the home

     country can sustain an overvaluation which will be larger the higher

     the probability of the crash. For example, if this probability is

     as high as , an annualized interest differential of 5% will support

     an overevaluation of 10% per annum. A similar problem (which has

     received more attention in the exchange rate literature) is called

     "peso problem't and refers to the effect of an expected change in

     policy on the current exchange rate, thus increasing its volaitlity
                                  -26-



     as well as the volatility of the real exchange rate. Finally, the

     exchange rate might move "too much" because of fads or extraneous

     beliefs. To the extent that these are autocorrelated, the forecast

     error will be difficult to detect empirically. See further

     discussion in Dornbusch (1982) and references therein.

11. For an exposition of the so-called "portfolio view" see Tobin

     and Macedo (1981). Tobin (1982) notes, however, that the

     question of whether the volatility of asset prices leads to

     increasing divergence from the path of their fundamental

     determinants has not been as actively researched in the context of

     exchange rates as in the context of stock market prices.

12. The normalized relative current account goes from a U.S. surplus

     until end-1976 to a substantial relative U.S. deficit in 1977-79,

     a surplus in 1980-81 and a deficit in 1982. Thus, before 1982,

     relative deficits in the U.S. coincided with the depreciating

     dollar. We can also identify a period of increasing U.S. velocity

     through 1978 (even though velocity had decreased in 1977),

     followed by a steep ascent in 1979 and again following the second

    quarter of 1981. See Macedo (1983a).

13. See Macedo (1983a) for a description of the theoretical model used

    in the estimation and for econometric results.

14. This is also true of the measure of trade interdependence used by

    Lin (1984).

15. See Macedo (1981) for an interpretation of the real exchange rate

    along these lines.

16. This point was noted by Aghevli (1981) for the period of the weak
                                  -27-




     dollar, 1973-78.

17. The model is in Macedo (1984a).

18. Essential differences with the Currency Board experience are of

     course monetary sovereignty and "generalized floating". See Bank

     Negara (1984, p. 31). Nevertheless, the tradition of the Straits

     dollar or the Malayan dollar cannot be altogether ignored. Lin

     (1984, p. 30) mentions a "striking" "close relationship

     throughout the period 1965-82".

19. Khan (1980) warns of the possibly important role of interest rates

     in the money demand functions of Southeast Asian countries. Lin

     (1984, p. 27) gives lending rates in these countries for selected

    years and notes their lack of simultaneity.

20. Whether it is joint or not, the float of the Singapore currency

    will certainly be managed, to an extent that makes it difficult to

    distinguish from a (passive) crawling peg. Branson (1981) proposed

    an import-weighted basket adjusted with roughly equal weights to

    current account and reserve targets. As in the model of Section

    1.1, monetary policy adjusts to accomodate that exchange rate.

    Higher financial interdependence would make the indicators close to

    the fundamental determinants in the model of Section 1.2.

                                 APPENDIX



               A TWO-COUNTRY MODEL OF POLICY INTERDEPENDENCE




1.   The analysis of policy interdependence described in the text is based

on a conventional two-country macro model, with several features borrowed

from Kouri and Macedo (1978). We use a log-linear formulation, where

variables are measured relative to their steady-state values. The two IS

curves are given by:



      (1) yaO_btr_b"r*
      (2) y*_aO_bf'r_btr*


     where y (y*) is (the log of) domestic (foreign) real output

           r (r*) is the domestic (foreign) real interest rate

           0 = e + w* - w is the (log of the) real exchange rate

           e is the (log of the) domestic currency price of foreign

               currency

           w (w*) is (the log of) the price of domestic (foreign) goods

           a is the elasticity of oulput relative to the real exchange

               rate

           b' (b") is the intertemporal substitution semi—elasticity

               relative to the domestic (foreign) real interest rate
                                  —29—




       As shown in Macedo (1983), equations (1) and (2) are derived from

 the open-economy income identity in the two countries, where domestic

 absorption is a function of domestic output and (through investment) of

the domestic real interest rate and the current account is a function of

domestic and foreign outputs and the terms of trade (inverse of the real

exchange rate). Thus the parameter a is given by the average propensity

to import evaluated at the steady-state, the open-economy multiplier with

repercussion and the sum of the trade elasticities subtracted from one.

Similarly, the parameter b' is given by the investment share in output

evaluated at the steady-state, the multiplier and the real interest

elasticity of domestic investment divided by the real domestic interest

rate. The parameter b" is given by the share of the domestic currency

value of investment abroad in domestic output times the multiplier times

the foreign elasticity divided by the foreign real rate. To illustrate,

suppose the values for the savings and import propensities are,

respectively, .1 and .5, so that the multipliers of domestic and foreign

expenditure are like in note 3 in the text. They are now to be applied

to changes in domestic investment induced by changes in the domestic and

foreign real interest rates, Domestic and foreign investment as shares

of domestic output are 20% and interest elasticities are .1 at home and

abroad. Then, at interest-rates of 10%, the semi-elasticities of

aggregate demand will be b' = 1.1 and b" =   .9.   Under these conditions,

the foreign trade multiplier will be .9. If the average propensity tQ

import is also 20% and the trade elasticities are unity, we will get a

.18.
                                          —30—




     The two LN curves are given by:



     (3)        m-p=(y+w-p)-ci
     (4)        m* - p* = (y* + w - p*) -                 c i*



     where       m (m*) is the (log of the) domestic (foreign) money

                 stock;
                 4   (4*'
                     '.- / 4 -l-. mi4t           '."b'/ .rm4r,l 4ntv.F
                p (p*) is the domestic (foreign) price levels;
                     is the income elasticity of money demand

     and         c is the interest semi-elasticity of money demand.



     Equations (3) and (4) are obtained from a variable-velocity money

demand function, where the level of the exchange rate enters through the

price index used to deflate money balances and transactions demand is a

function of national income rather than output. Also, exchange rate

depreciation raises money demand by less, unlike the one-to-one effect

implied by purchasing power parity, but the size is given by the share of

the foreign good in consumption rather than by the share of foreign

assets in wealth. This is clear from the definition of the price

indices.

     (4')       p* =      (1   -
                                   *)w*   +   * (w   -   e) = w*   -




     Price   and exchange rate expectations are introduced by three crucial

arbitrage conditions, which, under perfect foresight, are written as:
                                          —31—




      (5)



      (6)       ri-i
      (7)       r=i*_I1*


     While there is substantial evidence against the risk-neutral

 behavior underlying (5), we use it to keep the model tractable. On the

 other hand, nominal interest rates are deflated by the price index used

 to deflate nominal money balances, so that terms of trade changes also

have a less than one-to-one effect on the real interest differential.

Taking as a benchmark the case where                      we see that, if consumption is

biased toward the domestic good (13<½), a faster real depreciation will

raise the real interest rate differential:



     (8)       r =   r*   + (1 -2)O


     This is the channel through which changes in the real exchange rate

have an effect on relative outputs, with sign depending on the

consumption bias. Subtracting (2) from (1) and using (8), we can express

the cyclical position of the two countries in terms of the real exchange

rate and its rate of change:

     (9)       y -   y*   = 2a0 -   (b'   -
                                              b")(l   -
                                                          2)O

     On the other hand, subtracting (4) from (3) and using (5), we see

that the nominal exchange rate will change so as to offset changes in the

relative velocities Df money. These can be expressed in terms of

relative real money balances (deflated by domestic prices), the real

exchange rate and the cyclical position of the two countries:
                                            —32—




        (10)        =    -         -       - 2(1   -   - (y - y*)J;
        where     m m-w
        and       rn*m*_w*

        Suppose that the prices of domestic output are exogenously fixed at
 w =   w = . Then      0 = e and the dynamics of the system reduce to:


        (11)      [c +   (b'   -
                                   b")(i    -
                                                2)} = 2[a + (1-)]e    - (m -
                                                                               m*)

       In steady-state, the exchange rate is proportional to relative money

balances:




                 e = 1         m_m*
       (12)
                             a + (1    -



       The role of the parameter hinges on the existence of a terms of

trade effect on money demand and it vanishes when C          = 1.
       Substituting for the interest rate in (3) from (1), we get another

steady-state relationship:

       (13)



       where     p =   c/(b'   +b")



       and             (1 -

       A similar expression holds for foreign output. While the effect of

own expansionary monetary policy is always positive, the effect of
depreciation -   and, via (12), of contractionary monetary policy abroad -
on domestic output will hinge on the relative size of                    A low
                                                      p and .
interest rate elasticity of aggregate demand, or an income elasticity of
                                            —33...




 money demand equal to or larger than unity imply p > , and the effect

 will be positive.

          For concreteness, suppose that the nominal interest-elasticity of

money demand is .1. Then, at nominal interest rates of 10%, the

 semi-elasticity of money demand will be one. Using the values indicated

earlier, we get b' + b" =           2,   so that the ratio will be p =    .5.   Note

that, as long as there is no expected inflation, the level of interest

rates cancels, so that p would not decrease at higher interest rates. On

the other hand, a nominal elasticity of .4 will make p =             2.
         Suppose now that the share of foreign goods in the consumer price

index and the income elasticity are both one half. Then we will have
     =   1.4 so that it will be less than p. If the trade elasticities

double, we get         =   .46,   less than the first value of p. With Unit trade

elasticities and = .82, we get                   .5, so that it exactly equals p.




2.       To analyze strategic behavior in response to the fixed price w,

it is convenient to work with the real money stocks in both countries,

e.g., in    =m   -   . We   will henceforth drop the bar from the real money

stocks, to avoid cluttering. Substituting (12) into (13) and (3'), we

express the two targets in the home country as:

         (14)        y = pm -


         (15)        pw+v(m_m*)

         where p =         2+p+
                      2(C +          +
                                         —34—




                       2(C +      + p)


     and       V =        Ja
                       2( +

     Note that 1 > i > i* and that p > v > 0 while the sign of p' hinges

on the relative size of p and .           When p* > 0, we will have p* > V

as long as       <    a, since the condition p >   (/a)/(1   -
                                                                 n/a)   is then weaker

than p >    . The      expressions for foreign output and the foreign price

level are like (14) and (15), with the instruments reversed.

     Suppose now the monetary authorities in both countries wish to

minimize a quadratic loss function expressed in terms of y and p, the

deviation of output and the consumer price index from their steady-state

values:



     (16)             Ly2+qp2
     where q is the weight attached to the price objective.



     We will focus here on the case where p* >        0,   so that an expansionary

monetary policy abroad creates unemployment at home. We can see from

equations (14) and (15) that, if both countries jointly set m =                   0,
that is, if they increase their money stock in proportion to the given

change in the price of their domestic output, then y =            y'    = 0

and p =   p*   = w.    This cooperative solution yields a loss given by:


     (17)         CL     CL* =


    Each country may try to increase the money stock by less, however,

in order to appreciate its currency and reduce inflation. If both try to
                                             —35—




do so, in the mistaken belief that the other country does not react

against the correpsonding depreciation, we will have a non-cooperative

solution. To characterize it, substitute from (14) and (15) into (16),

to obtain the loss function in terms of the instruments. It defines the

loss contours as the ellipses shown by broken lines in Figure 1 in the

text. Then differentiate totally and set to zero, to yield:

     (18)           gm - g*m* + flvw +       (m*        -
                                                             g*m - rlvw)      0
     (18')          gm*_ g*m + IJvT + (m            -
                                                            g*m* - rvw) dm*   0

     whereg         1J2+rlv2

             g =      .2
                           + nv2
     and     g* =          + fly2
     To find the Cournot-Nash solution, set both conjectural variations

to zero, to yield:

     (19)        gm - g*m* = -rvw


     (19')       gm* - g*m =        -nv;

     Solving,   the Cournot-Nash solution is again given by equal money

stocks but a lower level of output and less inflation than at the

cooperative point:



     (20)       Nm N =               -q   (v/ti)
                                          Ii -


    Substituting      from (19) into (14) and (15), and then into (16), we

get the (common) loss as. Using (17), we express it as a proportion of

the ooperative solution:

     (21)       NL =       [i   + q (v/p)2]CL
                                         —36—




      If the home country assumes that the foreign country will play the

 non-cooperative solution just described and minimizes loss subject to the

 other country's Cournot reaction function, then, if this assumption is

 correct, we will have a Stackelberger solution, where the conjectural

 variations will be dm*/dm* =      g*/g      and dm/dm* =       0.
     Using these results in (18) and (18'), we get a real money stock

that is higher than at N, even though it is still negative:

      (22)
               S
                m      m= NmA
                     S*.,.

                   S*m        N
                               mA"

               where A = (g2       -    •
                                       gg)/
                     A" (g2 - 2g"             +   gg")/
                        =    g(g   +   g")   -
               and                               g"    [(g -   g)/(g   -
                                                                           gn)J

     It can be shown that 1 > A* > A, so that the Stackelberger solution

is less contractionary than the Nash, and less contractionary for the

follower than for the leader.

     Finally, the locus of efficient points is given by the tangency of

the loss contours. Equating the slopes from (18) and (18'), we get:

     (23)      g*(m2 + m*2)        (g +      ) rpm*     -
                                                            qv(m     + m*) = 0


     This is an hyperbola going through the origin and through the

intersection of the axes and the Cournot reaction functions, as shown by

the dotted line in Figure 1 in the text.

     Consider now the case where p* <             0.    As shown in the second

numerical example given earlier, it requires a low elasticity of money

demand. It is clear from (20) that the size of the contractionary bias
                                    —37—




is smaller in that case but, as seen in (21), this does not affect loss

in the Cournot-Nash solution.



     From the definition of g* after (18), we see that, in order for g* <

0, given that p* < 0, it is also necessary that the weight on the price
level target be low:

                                ÷ p +
     (24)     I


                  (n/a)
                          2(2
                            (
                            ÷ p)
     Note that the bias in the Stackelberger solution becomes smaller for

the leader if condition (24) is satisfied because in that case A >   A*.
Also, the numerical example would give g* < 0 if r   < 1.   This case can be

illustrated in Figure 1, with downward sloping reaction functions.
