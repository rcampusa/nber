                                        ABSTRACT

We study trends in income inequality across U.S. states and counties 1960-2019 using a mix of
administrative and survey data sources. Both states and counties have diverged in terms of per-
capita pre-tax incomes since the late 1990s, with transfers serving to dampen this divergence.
County incomes have been diverging since the late 1970s. These trends in mean income mask
opposing patterns among top and bottom income quantiles. Top incomes have diverged markedly
across states since the late 1970s. In contrast, bottom income quantiles and poverty rates have
converged across areas in recent decades.

1    Introduction
The gap between rich and poor places in America is often cited as a failure of modern
capitalism to provide widely shared economic growth. Have U.S. spatial income disparities
grown more or less pronounced in recent decades? While much has been made of the Great
Divergence between highly skilled metropolitan areas and the rest of the United States
(Moretti, 2012), a central tenet of the regional growth literature remains the "iron law of
convergence" that per-capita incomes tend to grow more rapidly in poorer areas (Barro and
Sala-i-Martin, 1991; Berry and Glaeser, 2005; Barro, 2015; Ganong and Shoag, 2017). In this
paper, we study trends in income inequality across U.S. states and counties over the period
1960-2019, with particular attention to how these trends depend on the notion of income
considered and the feature of the income distribution used to rank communities.
    We begin by establishing that both states and counties have been diverging in terms of
per-capita pre-tax incomes since the late 1990s, with counties exhibiting a steady rise in
income inequality since the 1970s. The pace of this increase in regional income dispersion
exceeds that of the well-documented growth in aggregate inequality across people (Autor,
2014; Piketty, Saez and Zucman, 2018). While in the 1970s the variance across counties of log
per-capita incomes explained as little as 5% of the variance of log incomes across individuals,
today county income dispersion accounts for 10% of the variance across individuals. Including
taxes and transfers in the income measure reduces the level of inequality, as does accounting
for local price variation. However, these adjustments yield only a modest dampening of the
rise in county level inequality in recent decades.
    Next, we show that these trends in average per-capita incomes mask substantial heterogeneity
across the income distribution. Two broad patterns emerge. First, there has been a
"democratization of poverty" across U.S. counties, with both adult and youth poverty rates
converging across counties in recent decades. This pattern is also reflected in a substantial
deconcentration of means-tested transfers across counties. Likewise, in survey data, the
bottom quantiles of post-transfer household income have been converging across states since
the early 1990s. While this trend has not, to our knowledge, been directly remarked upon
in the past, it is broadly consistent with Autor (2019)'s observation that the urban wage
premium appears to have declined for less skilled workers and with work in progress by
Rinz and Voorheis (2021). Second, in line with Moretti (2012) and Manduca (2019), we
find that spatial trends in per capita income inequality reflect an increasing "concentration
of affluence." While median household incomes have exhibited a gradual rise in dispersion
across counties since 1990, top income quantiles, measured either in survey or administrative
data, have diverged markedly across states since the late 1970s.



                                             1
    Our findings indicate that trends in spatial income disparities are more complex than is
commonly appreciated. While mean incomes have been diverging across counties for decades,
spatial disparities in bottom incomes and poverty rates have been receding. Understanding
the causes and consequences of these opposing trends is an important challenge for future
research.


2       Measuring spatial income inequality
Let i index geographic areas such as states or counties and Fi the distribution of income
                                                                     1
in that area, which we assume is continuous. The quantity vi = 0  Fi-1 ( ) Fi-1 ( ) d
measures the welfare of area i, where Fi-1 (·) is the quantile function of income in area i
and  (·) is a weighting function that depends on income levels. When  (·) = 1, vi simply
measures the per-capita income in community i.1 We begin our analysis by proxying vi
with per-capita income and then examine other measures that reflect different weightings of
income quantiles.
    Bourguignon (1979) proposed the following welfare-theoretic measure of between group
inequality

                                              v) -
                                      B = ln (¯           si ln vi ,
                                                      i


where v ¯ = i si vi and si is the population share of area i. The B index is scale invariant
and reflects logarithmic inequality aversion: a utilitarian planner who seeks to maximize
ln v = i si ln vi would be willing to trade a 1% loss in v¯ for a reduction in B of 0.01.
                                          1                  2
    In the Appendix we show that B  2 i si ln vi - ln v . Hence, the Bourguignon index
is a close cousin of the familiar variance of logarithm measure of dispersion. In what follows,
we rely on population weighted versions of this more transparent measure of dispersion
to summarize spatial income disparities. Equally weighted estimates are provided in the
Appendix.


3       Diverging mean incomes

capita personal income drawn from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), definitions of
which are provided in the figure note. All four measures exhibit a W-shaped pattern, with

    Ranking communities by per-capita income is easily accommodated within a utilitarian framework. For
example, with Cobb-Douglas preferences, indirect utility is proportional to after-tax income.

sharp declines during the 1960s and 1970s, a short-lived increase in dispersion during the
1980s, a decline in the early 1990s, and a sustained growth in dispersion from the mid 1990s
to the present. Accounting for transfers slightly lowers the level of geographical dispersion
in early years but has a more substantial effect in later years. Most of this impact is driven
by Social Security and Medicare. Accounting for taxes further dampens the recent rise of
inequality: cross-state dispersion in per-capita post-tax incomes in 2019 roughly equals its
1970 level. If society exhibited logarithmic inequality aversion over per capita incomes after
taxes and transfers, a planner would be willing to reduce the average income of U.S. states
by 12
      (.14)2 × 100 = 1.0% in order to eliminate the state dispersion in incomes found in 2019.
    Much of the seminal empirical work on regional income convergence (e.g., Barro and Sala-
i-Martin, 1991) relied on data from decades when cross-state dispersion was falling. Using
more recent data, Ganong and Shoag (2017) find that poorer states continue to exhibit
slightly faster income growth rates, oft referred to as " -convergence." As Young, Higgins
and Levy (2008) note, however,  -convergence need not yield " -convergence" ­ a reduction
in cross-sectional dispersion across areas. In fact, all four of our measures exhibit strong
 -divergence over the past 20 years. The increase in the standard deviation of log per-capita
pre-tax incomes across states between 1995 and 2019 is roughly four times as large as the

1970-1998 increase studied by Young, Higgins and Levy (2008).
    Figure 2 plots the standard deviation across counties of two measures of log per capita
income. The baseline level of dispersion across counties is nearly twice as high as that across
states. In 1975, for example, a standard deviation increase in county log per-capita income
entailed a roughly 25% increase, while a standard deviation increase in state log per-capita
income entailed only a 14% increase. In contrast to the W shaped pattern found for states
in Figure 1, cross-county dispersion increased steadily from 1975 to 2019.
    A large literature, summarized in Autor (2014), documents that inequality also increased
across individuals over this period. However, the variance across counties has also risen as
a share of the total variance of log pre-tax income across U.S. individuals, as measured in
the Distributional National Accounts (DINA) of Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2018).2 While
in 1975 log-income dispersion across counties accounted for only 5% of dispersion across
individuals, by 2019, county dispersion contributed roughly 10% of the total income variance
across individuals. Accounting for transfers (county-level taxes are not available) again
dampens the rise in geographic dispersion, particularly in the wake of the Great Recession,
but still yields a rise in the share of individual inequality explained by counties from 5%
   2
     To deal with small and negative incomes in the DINA, we winsorize incomes from below at $5,000
(deflated to 2018 dollars) before taking the log. Varying this cutpoint changes the share of total inequality
explained by counties but has little effect on trends.

to 8%.3 This pattern is in keeping with the work of Manduca (2019), who concludes that
only about half of the  -divergence in mean family incomes across commuting zones between
1980 and 2013 is attributable to increasing national inequality across individuals.
    An important difficulty with spatial income comparisons is that prices differ across
locations (Moretti, 2013). Deflating our income measures using state by metropolitan area
level price indices from BEA, in the years for which they are available, lowers the standard

     DINA pre-tax income includes Social Security and unemployment benefits, private pension distributions,
and imputed corporate retained earnings and excludes Social Security and unemployment taxes and private
pension contributions. DINA transfers and taxes are imputed when not directly observed in federal tax data.
While DINA pre-tax income aggregates to national income, our DINA post-tax income measure does not,
as we do not allocate collective consumption expenditures such as national defense to individuals.

deviations as expected. However, deflating does little to the measured rise in cross-county
dispersion.
    The upper panels of Figure 3 display estimates of dispersion within Census regions along
with the between region component of variance. Between region income inequality has
remained remarkably stable over the past 40 years. In contrast, dispersion across counties in
the West and Northeast has risen dramatically. The lower panels of Figure 3 reveal that much
of this increase took place in the Middle Atlantic, Pacific, and New England Census divisions.
Cross-division inequality has remained remarkably stable, indicating that inequality patterns
are not driven by coastal states drifting apart from inland communities. Rather, dispersion
in the fortunes of counties within these states is driving the steady increase in county level
inequality.

A recurrent finding in Figures 1 and 2 has been the increasing divergence between pre- and
post-transfer measures of income dispersion. Figure 4 plots the standard deviation across
counties of log per-capita transfers. The sustained decrease in geographic transfer dispersion

over our sample period indicates that government payments are becoming more evenly spread
across U.S. communities. The geographic concentration of income maintenance programs
such as the EITC, food stamps, and SSI has fallen especially sharply.
    Figure 5 plots Census estimates of county poverty rates and median household incomes.
County dispersion in median incomes has grown more slowly than the corresponding dispersion
in per-capita post-transfer incomes depicted in Figure 2. Between 1990 and 2018, for
example, dispersion in per-capita post-transfer incomes grew by 4 log points, while dispersion
of median household incomes grew by only 2 log points. This divergence hints that trends
in per-capita dispersion may be driven by households with very high incomes.
    To measure the dispersion of poverty, we report the dissimilarity index of poverty rates,
which gives the share of people that would need to move for all counties to have the same
poverty rate.4 Poverty rates have converged rather dramatically across counties since the
1990s, with the dissimilarity index plummeting by roughly a quarter by 2018. Youth poverty
rates exhibit a similar pattern, indicating this phenomenon is not driven exclusively by trends
among the elderly.5

      The dissimilarity index can be written 12  i |Pi - N Pi |, where Pi denotes the share of all poor people
located in county i and N Pi the share of all non-poor people in county i.

   In the Appendix, we document three additional facts. First, poverty rates have equalized
both within and between Census regions (Figure A.2). The between region component has
played a dominant role in this equalization post-2000 as poverty rates rose in the Northeast
and Midwest relative to the South and West (Figure A.3). Second, counties that were very
poor in 1990 had large reductions in poverty by 2018, while those that were less poor had
substantial poverty increases (Figure A.4). Finally, the poverty dissimilarity index also fell
dramatically between the 1960 and 1980 Censuses (Figure A.5).
   Figure 6 provides a deeper dive into recent changes in the spatial distribution of poverty
rates. While national poverty rates changed little between 1989 and 2018, the tails of
the county poverty rate distribution contracted. In the Appendix we show that a similar
pattern emerges when grouping counties by decile or when examining youth poverty rates.
Though the variability of poverty rates across counties has declined, it is worth noting that
poverty remains highly concentrated. Gaubert, Kline and Yagan (2020) document even more
pronounced concentration of poverty among Census tracts, which they show can provide a
motive for place based subsidies to poor areas.

logarithm of household income. The data have been pooled into 5 year intervals and PCE-deflated to 2012
dollars. Each quantile's bias corrected variance is computed by subtracting its average squared standard
error from its sample variance across states. Standard errors are computed via bootstrap resampling with
300 draws. All computations use household weights. Source: IPUMS CPS ASEC files 1976-2019.


5       Concentration of affluence
The finding that poverty rates have become more equal across counties, while per-capita
incomes have grown more dispersed, strongly suggests that high income households have
increasingly segregated themselves to particular counties. Consistent with this hypothesis,
Manduca (2019) finds that the growth between 1980 and 2013 in the coefficient of variation
of mean family income across commuting zones is highly sensitive to the exclusion of top
earners. To generate a more complete picture of this pattern, Figure 7 reports the dispersion
across states of various percentiles of log household income measured in the March Supplement
of the Current Population Survey (CPS).
    Although CPS income definitions differ somewhat from those of the BEA, we have
attempted to approximate the post-transfer income concepts reported in Figures 1 and 2.6
To account for sampling error in the quantile estimates, we pool the data across 5-year
intervals and bias correct the standard deviation of each quantile using the standard error

    To measure income we use the IPUMS-CPS variable INCTOT, which includes labor earnings, business
income, welfare, social security, unemployment insurance, worker's compensation, and pensions.

estimates in each state.7
    Consistent with the previously documented decline in poverty concentration, Figure
7 reveals that the dispersion of the bottom quantiles of state income has declined since
1990. Prior to 2000, geographic dispersion in the lower quantiles exceeds that found in the
upper quantiles. By the 2015-2019 interval, cross-state dispersion was roughly equal across
quantiles at roughly 13 log points. This convergence is driven both by an increase in the
dispersion of top incomes across counties and a reduction in the dispersion of bottom incomes
across counties.
    A limitation of the CPS is that incomes are top coded. Figure 8 provides a closer look
at the dispersion of top income quantiles by state using estimates derived from tax data by
Sommeiller and Price (2018). The dispersion of the 99.9th percentile exhibits a W-shaped
pattern similar to that of per-capita incomes displayed in Figure 1. Evidently, an important
force driving the post-1995 rise in cross-sectional dispersion ( -divergence) in per-capita
state incomes is the growing dispersion across states in the amounts of income their highest
income residents receive.

     Standard deviations for each quantile  are computed as S - V     ¯ where S is the sample variance of
                           ¯
the quantile estimates and V is the average across states of their squared bootstrap standard errors.

6    Taking stock
Our findings paint a more nuanced story than the common refrain that American communities
are growing apart. Mean incomes are diverging across areas but those means give outsize
influence to individuals with especially high incomes. In contrast, median incomes, which
arguably provide a better measure of the well-being of a typical household, exhibit more
muted divergence over the past thirty years.
    The equalization of poverty rates across space we document aligns closely with independent
evidence that bottom income percentiles and means-tested transfers are converging across
locations. Given that the migration flows of less educated workers are only weakly related
to area income (Ganong and Shoag, 2017), we suspect this democratization of poverty is not
driven primarily by a reshuffling of households. An interesting question for future research
is the extent to which changes in labor market institutions such as the minimum wage or
transfer programs such as disability insurance are driving these trends.
    The increasing geographic concentration of high income households we document is
broadly consistent with the well known rise in top incomes across individuals. Perhaps
influenced by these trends, coastal states including New York and California have recently
enacted or increased "millionaire taxes" on households with high incomes. Assessing whether
place based millionaire taxes will be subverted by income shifting or real migration responses
is a priority for future research.

Appendix
Approximating the Bourguignon Index
The first term of B can be written:


                           ln           si vi    = ln                si exp (ln vi ) .
                                   i                         i


A second order Taylor approximation of exp (·) around the point ln v yields

                                                                                   1                 2
              exp (ln vi )  exp ln v             1 + ln vi - ln v +                  ln vi - ln v        .
                                                                                   2

Employing this approximation yields

                                                                 1                               2
                  ln       si vi     ln v + ln 1 +                             si ln vi - ln v       .
                       i
                                                                 2     i


Hence, we can write

                                                  1                                  2
                             B  ln 1 +                    si ln vi - ln v
                                                  2   i
                                    1                                  2
                                                si ln vi - ln v            ,
                                    2     i


where the second line uses the approximation ln(1 + x)  x. This second approximation is
extremely accurate in our setting because the variances we study lie far below one.
