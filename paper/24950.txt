                                          ABSTRACT

The rise of the “gig economy” has attracted wide attention from both scholars and the popular
media. Much of this attention has been devoted to jobs mediated through various online
platforms. While non-traditional work arrangements have been a perennial subject of debate and
study, the perception that new technology is producing an accelerated pace of change in the
organization of work has fueled a resurgence of interest in how such changes may be affecting
both workers and firms. This paper provides a typology of work arrangements and reviews how
different arrangements, and especially gig activity, are captured in existing data. A challenge for
understanding recent trends is that household survey and administrative data paint a different
picture, with the former showing little evidence of the growth in self-employment that would be
implied by a surge in gig activity and the latter providing evidence of considerable recent growth.
An examination of matched individual-level survey and administrative records shows that a large
and growing fraction of those with self-employment activity in administrative data have no such
activity recorded in household survey data. The share of those with self-employment activity in
household survey data but not administrative data is smaller and has not grown. Promising
avenues for improving the measurement of self-employment activity include the addition of more
probing questions to household survey questionnaires and the development of integrated data sets
that combine survey, administrative and, potentially, private data.

I.      Introduction

        In recent years, the popular press has been full of stories premised on the idea that the share of

U.S. jobs that do not involve a formal employer-employee relationship is large and growing. Both media

sources and scholars have adopted the term “gig economy” to refer broadly to these less structured work

arrangements as well as more narrowly to the subset of flexible jobs mediated through various online

platforms. The latter have been viewed as yielding an increasingly “on demand” economy where goods

and services can be acquired through apps on smartphones and other web based applications. The current

discussion regarding alternative work arrangements echoes an earlier discussion that arose in the late

1980s and 1990s (e.g., Abraham 1988, 1990; Barker and Christensen 1998). Then as now, there was talk

of dramatic growth in the number of people working in contingent or precarious jobs – positions in

which workers had no long-term connection to a particular business, but were employed to complete a

specific task or for a defined period of time – or under other non-standard employment arrangements.

The recent resurgence of interest in non-traditional work arrangements reflects the perception that new

technology, along with the restructuring of business enterprises made possibly by this technology, is

producing an accelerated pace of change in the organization of work that is having important effects on

both workers and firms.

      Much of the discussion of the gig economy, as well as the broader discussion of non-employee

work arrangements, has focused on the implications of growth in these arrangements for workers and

their families. On the one hand, gig work may appeal to individuals for whom it provides the flexibility

to better match their skills to work projects. Making a similar point, Hurst and Pugsley (2011), for

example, argue that self-employed workers enjoy substantial non-pecuniary benefits in the form of

being their own boss, being able to set their own schedule and so on. On the other hand, some of those

performing gig work are not doing so by choice. Similar to others who are not employees of the firms

for which they are providing labor services, gig workers do not enjoy the legal rights and protections

afforded under the unemployment insurance system, the workers compensation system, the Fair Labor

Standards Act and other laws and regulations written with more traditional employment arrangements

                                                                                                 1|Page
in mind (Harris and Krueger 2015). Further, those who rely primarily or exclusively on self-

employment are markedly less likely to have health insurance or to have a retirement plan (Jackson,

Looney and Romnath 2017) and may have hours and earnings that are substantially more variable and

less predictable.

        Advances in technology resting on digitization and the inter-connectivity of the internet have

made it increasingly attractive for firms to re-organize their activities so that a greater share of work is

performed by individuals who are not employees of the firm. These new technologies make it more

feasible to organize work on a project-specific basis, utilizing a changing cast of workers with the mix of

skills that is appropriate for each project (National Academies Press 2017). Similar to the motivations that

have been posited for other sorts of contracting out (Abraham and Taylor 1996; Dube and Kaplan 2010;

Goldschmidt and Schmieder 2017), a shift from hiring workers into traditional employment relationships

to utilizing non-employees as they are needed may be a means of reducing wage and benefit costs in

addition to positioning the firm to respond quickly to shifts in demand. These same technological

advances have facilitated the segmentation of the various aspects of firms’ production processes more

generally (see, e.g., Fort 2017). On the other hand, while offering some clear advantages to firms,

increased reliance on outsourcing generally and non-employees specifically also implies less

accumulation of firm-specific human capital. Even within narrowly defined sectors, there is enormous

heterogeneity in the productivity and profitability of individual firms (see, e.g., Foster, Haltiwanger and

Krizan 2001). Differences in the ability to attract, train and retain high quality workers, especially those

performing functions that are core to the firm, seem likely to be an important contributor to this

heterogeneity in firm-level outcomes.

         Growth in non-employee work also matters for the measurement of economic activity. The

current system of economic measurement is designed for a world in which workers have a traditional

employment relationship or operate a formal business. Non-employee work may not be fully captured in

existing data sources. Each month, for example, the Current Population Survey (CPS) collects

information from households about work that household members have done for pay or profit. Similar to

                                                                                                   2|Page
the questions asked on other household surveys, the CPS employment questions may not always cue

respondents to report work outside of a conventional job or business and are not designed to probe

regarding the nature of the arrangements under which work occurs. Further, they focus primarily on the

main job a person holds, with a more limited set of questions asked about additional work activity. Other

surveys collect information from businesses on the number of people they employ and the hours those

employees work, but do not attempt to measure the labor input of people who are not on those

businesses’ payrolls.

         To the extent that an increasing share of the work embodied in firms’ products is supplied by

non-employees whose hours are not well captured by existing data collections, measures of labor

productivity growth may be distorted. Labor productivity is defined as output per hour worked. The

Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) major sector productivity program uses CPS data to measure the hours

of the self-employed. If there have been increases in non-employee work that are not well captured by

the CPS, the growth in labor hours may have been understated and the growth in labor productivity

correspondingly overstated. Further, if different sectors have made more or less intensive use of non-

employee labor input, the pattern of growth in productivity may have been distorted as well.

      In principle, measures of multifactor productivity should take into account firms’ use of purchased

services. Multifactor productivity is defined as output relative to an index of inputs to production,

weighted according to their shares of production costs. So long as purchased services are well measured,

changes in the amount of non-employee labor embedded in those services will be reflected in measured

multifactor productivity. In practice, limited data on purchased services are collected and estimates of

how the use of these services is allocated across industries may not be especially accurate. Houseman

(2007), for example, cites evidence suggesting that estimates from the input-output tables used in the

construction of industry productivity statistics significantly understated the growth in the use of staffing

services in manufacturing during the 1990s. Similar problems may exist with respect to the measurement

and allocation of labor services provided by non-employee workers.



                                                                                                 3|Page
      A somewhat different measurement problem may arise if non-employee workers sell services

directly to consumers or produce tangible or intangible capital. In principle, one would like this output to

be included in gross domestic product and incorporated into the measurement of productivity.

Information on output is collected primarily through surveys and censuses of the employer businesses

that account for the lion’s share of production. In constructing its estimates of total output, the Bureau of

Economic Analysis adjusts the figures for employer businesses using information on the revenues of

non-employer businesses (Bureau of Economic Analysis 2017). Still, any failure of the existing

measurement system to fully capture output for final demand that is produced by non-employee workers

could be an additional source of distortion in measured trends in output and productivity.

      While there has been considerable discussion about the changing nature of work and its broader

implications for workers and firms, different sources of data send conflicting messages regarding the

prevalence of non-employee work generally and gig employment specifically. Individuals performing

non-employee work should be classified as self-employed. In the CPS and other household surveys,

however, the percentage of the workforce that is self-employed has shown no upward trend and in fact

has been drifting downwards since at least the mid-1990s. In contrast, administrative data derived from

tax filings provide stronger support for the popular perception that non-employee work arrangements are

a growing phenomenon (Katz and Krueger 2016).

        Further, relatively little is known about the answers to other important questions about the gig

economy. Who are the people engaged in gig work? Where are they working and what type of work are

they doing? To what extent is gig work a primary source of earnings for those who do it as opposed to a

source of supplementary income that complements earnings from a wage and salary job? Do those

engaged in gig work tend to be low-earning or high-earning individuals? Where does such work fit into

the life cycle career path of individuals? Do individuals engage in such work because they are pushed

into doing it or do they do it by choice? Has any or all of this changed over time? What are the

implications of any changes that have occurred for the measurement of output and productivity?



                                                                                                 4|Page
         In this paper, we seek to clarify what different sources of data can tell us about changes in the

 prevalence and nature of both gig employment and non-employee work arrangements more generally

 over time. We begin with a discussion in Section II of the heterogeneity of non-employee work and the

 challenges this heterogeneity poses to its measurement and assessment. Section III considers the two

 main types of data that have been used to study past trends in non-employee work – surveys of households

 and administrative data. The discrepancy between the flat or declining trend in self-employment shown

 by measures based on household surveys and the long term growth in similar measures based on

 administrative data is a significant puzzle. To reconcile these conflicting trends, we turn to analysis of a

 newly-created linked data file that contains household survey and administrative information based on tax

 records for the same individuals. Preliminary findings based on this linked file are reported in Section IV.

 Although there is some CPS self-employment for which we can find no corresponding tax records, the

 amount of such undocumented self-employment has been relatively stable; in contrast, there has been a

 notable increase in the volume of self-employment activity reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

 that is not reported on the CPS. Looking to the future, Section V considers ways in which household

 survey data on non-traditional employment might be improved and Section VI evaluates how employer

 survey data, tax data and naturally occurring private sector data might be used more effectively to

 improve our understanding of gig employment specifically and non-employee work more generally.

 Finally, Section VII offers some initial thoughts about a path forward. Recognizing the limitations of each

 of the individual available sources of data, efforts to develop linked data sets that combine household

 survey data, tax data, employer survey data and, potentially, naturally occurring private sector data are

 likely to have a high payoff, permitting greater insight into the changing nature of work than is possible

 using any single data source.



 II.     Typology of Work Arrangements

        Although there has been a great deal of interest in the growth in non-traditional work arrangements

in the U.S. labor market, discussion of these arrangements has not always fully recognized their considerable

                                                                                                  5|Page
heterogeneity. Combining arrangements with very different characteristics and then attempting to generalize

about them runs the risk of being quite misleading. Table 1 lays out a typology that attempts to clarify

similarities and differences across a variety of ways of organizing work, separated broadly into employee and

self-employment arrangements. The table also identifies where these arrangements might be captured in

household survey and administrative data, as well as where gig employment specifically might be counted.



Work Arrangements and Their Characteristics

             One challenge in characterizing the evolution of work arrangements is that there are many

    different ways to organize work. The first column of Table 1 lists a number of work arrangements that

    have been discussed in the literature. The categories listed in the table are not necessarily mutually

    exclusive and, in some cases, a job might fall into more than one category. In addition, any given

    person may have multiple jobs and work under multiple arrangements. The next five columns of the

    table identify some key dimensions along which the listed work arrangements may differ.

             Despite ongoing changes in the labor market, traditional employment still accounts for the largest

    share of work in the U.S. labor market. These are jobs on which a worker is paid a wage or salary; has

    some expectation of job security; may be full-time or part-time, but has hours and earnings that are

    reasonably predictable; and is supervised by the same firm that pays her wage or salary. On-call workers

    and other direct-hire workers with varying schedules also appear on the payroll of the firm where they are

    employed, but their hours change depending on the needs of the firm and there may be periods when they

    do not work at all. A direct-hire temporary worker is someone who is employed for a limited term. Direct

    hire temporaries include seasonal employees such as lifeguards hired for the summer or sales clerks hired

    for the busy winter holiday season. 1

             An alternative to using workers hired directly onto a firm’s own payroll is to use contract

    company workers on either a short-term or long-term basis. Temporary help agencies supply labor to

    businesses with intermittent, seasonal or other temporary demands for labor; professional employer


1
    Interestingly, the share of jobs that are seasonal has dropped significantly in recent decades (Hyatt and Spletzer 2017).
                                                                                                             6|Page
    organizations (PEOs) provide workers or services on a more permanent basis; and other contract firms

    may provide specific services on either a short-term or a long-term basis. Individuals in these

    arrangements are employees, but the firm on whose behalf work is being performed (the client) is a

    different entity than the firm writing the worker’s paycheck (the agency, PEO or other contract firm).

            As among employee arrangements, there is considerable diversity among the various categories

    of self-employment. The self-employed include business owners who may have a well-established

    clientele and a relatively predictable flow of work. Such businesses may be incorporated, organized as

    partnerships or operated as unincorporated sole proprietorships. The self-employed also include

    independent contractors or freelancers who earn money by performing one-off tasks for which they are

    paid an agreed sum. Such workers may not be able to count on steady work and their hours and earnings

    may be volatile. 2 A day laborer is a person who gets work by waiting at a place where employers pick up

    people to help with short-term tasks. In some communities, for example, individuals seeking work may

    be known to wait in a convenience store parking lot or similar location. On-demand or platform workers

    can be thought of as the modern version of a day laborer, but with work obtained by claiming tasks listed

    through an online intermediary rather than by waiting for work at a physical location. Examples of the

    increasing number of on-line platforms that facilitate the matching of workers to those requiring services

    include Uber, TaskRabbit, Mechanical Turk and Upwork.

            The first characteristic we have identified as relevant to distinguishing among the various work

    arrangements is simply whether the person is paid a wage or salary. This can be thought of as a shorthand

    for whether those working under the arrangement are likely to be covered by unemployment insurance,

    workers compensation, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and other labor market laws and regulations that are

    applicable to employees but generally not to those who are self-employed. 3




2
  Independent contractors and freelancers could be folded into the unincorporated sole proprietor category, but some of
those who would describe themselves as an independent contractor or freelancer may not think of themselves as
operating a business.
3
  The application of these laws and regulations to the owners of incorporated businesses who pay themselves a wage or
salary is complicated, but in many states business owners are permitted to opt in to coverage under the unemployment
insurance and workers compensation systems.
                                                                                                        7|Page
        A second important characteristic of a work arrangement is whether the work relationship can be

expected to continue. This construct has been used by the BLS as the basis of its definition of contingent

work (Polivka 1996a). In published BLS statistics from the Contingent Worker Supplement to the CPS,

a contingent worker is anyone for whom no implicit or explicit contract for a continuing work

relationship exists. Most traditional employees would not view their employment as contingent, but for

consistency with how the BLS has applied this concept, we have allowed for the possibility that

someone in such a position might consider their job to be time-limited because they expect the business

where they work to close or their position to be eliminated. Accordingly, we have entered “some” rather

than “yes” for traditional employees in the column summarizing whether a continuing work arrangement

exists. Someone who works only when called in or who has a varying schedule may nonetheless have an

ongoing relationship with the firm at which they work. Workers supplied by a temporary help agency or

other contract firm may have only a short-term relationship with the different firms that make use of

their services, but a continuing relationship with the temporary help agency or contract firm. In contrast,

we would not expect direct-hire temporary workers to have an expectation of continuity in their work

relationship. Among the self-employed, business owners seem likely to expect that their work

arrangement will continue. Some independent contractors and freelancers also may have an expectation

of continuity, but to the extent that they work on a task basis this is less likely to be the case and we have

entered “no” for them in the column capturing this characteristic. Day laborers and on-demand or

platform workers are unlikely to anticipate a continuing work relationship.

        The third and fourth work characteristic columns pertain to whether the person in the listed work

arrangement has a predictable work schedule and whether their earnings when working are predictable.

Predictable hours and earnings are part of what defines a traditional employee arrangement. During the

term of her employment, a direct hire temporary is likely to have relatively predictable hours and

earnings, and the same is likely to be true of most contract company workers. An on-call worker will

have unpredictable hours, but her pay while working is likely to be relatively predictable. Among the

self-employed, a business owner’s schedule may not be entirely predictable, but we would expect there

                                                                                                  8|Page
to be a fair amount of regularity in her work hours and have entered “yes” in the relevant rows of the

column capturing the predictability of hours; the earnings from time devoted to a business, however, may

be less predictable. Both hours and earnings are apt to be unpredictable for independent contractors or

freelancers, day laborers and on-demand or platform workers.

         A final work characteristic identified in the table, applicable only to those who are paid a wage or

salary, captures whether on-the-job supervision is provided by the same firm that pays the worker’s

salary. This would be the case for traditional employees, on-call workers, and direct hire temporary

workers, all of whom are hired onto the payroll of the firm requiring their services. It would not be the

case, however, for the employees of temporary help agencies or other contract firms who perform tasks

under the supervision of the client firm but are paid by a different firm. This characteristic is associated

with the so-called fissuring in the labor market that has been identified by some scholars as having

weakened the opportunities and protections for workers who previously would have been employed

directly by the firm for which they provide services but now are employed by a different company (Weil

2014).



Capturing Different Work Arrangements in Household Survey and Administrative Data

         The next three columns of Table 1 indicate where the different work arrangements might appear

in household survey or tax data. Household surveys such as the CPS, the American Community Survey

(ACS) and others commonly distinguish among wage and salary workers, the incorporated self-employed

and the unincorporated self-employed. In addition to traditional employees, on-call workers, direct hire

temporaries, temporary help agency workers, PEO workers and other contract company workers

generally should be categorized as wage and salary in these data. The incorporated self-employed also

typically are treated as wage and salary workers in published household survey statistics, though if a

different breakout is desired, it often is possible to identify them separately. Work arrangements for

which the table’s first column indicated not being paid a wage or salary generally should be categorized

as unincorporated self-employment in the household survey data; this includes partnerships, sole


                                                                                                  9|Page
proprietorships, most independent contractors and freelancers, day laborers, and on-demand or platform

workers.

        Turning to tax data, wage and salary earnings produce information returns that are provided to the

employee and submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. A Form W-2 is required for any job on which

an individual earns $600 or more in wages or salary during a year. The same form is used by owners of

incorporated businesses to report wages or salaries they pay themselves. Incorporated business owners

also may receive distributions of business profits reported on a Schedule K-1 or payments of dividends

reported on a Form 1099-DIV. Proceeds flowing from a partnership business to the individual partners are

reported on a Schedule K-1. In contrast, sole proprietors and others doing non-employee work may earn

income for which there is no associated information return. If there is an information return, it is likely to

be a Form 1099-MISC (for payments of non-employee compensation of $600 or more by a business to

any individual during a year) or, since 2011, possibly a Form 1099-K (for settlement of payment card

transactions or of transactions conducted through third-party networks such as PayPal that exceed certain

thresholds).

      Anyone who receives self-employment income for services provided in excess of $433 over the

course of a year is required to file a Schedule SE, the form that is used to calculate self-employed

individuals’ payroll tax liability. This applies to anyone who receives distributions of partnership income

or has other earnings from unincorporated self-employment activity. For the purpose of calculating

personal income tax liability, individual tax filers use Schedule E to report receipt of S-corporation

profits or partnership income and Schedule C to report income from an unincorporated sole

proprietorship or other self-employment activity. The requirement to include a Schedule C with a self-

employed tax filer’s return applies even if the individual received no information returns in connection

with their taxable earnings and even if business expenses fully offset the gross payments received.

        The final column of Table 1 indicates where we should expect gig employment to appear in

household survey and administrative data. We first need to define what we mean by a gig worker. The

term “gig” originated in the music industry, where musicians go into the studio to record one song or play

                                                                                                  10 | P a g e
in a band for one performance. The musicians with such gigs have no expectation of recording at the

same studio the following day or playing with the same band the following night. Borrowing from the

music industry, we define “gig employment” as one-off jobs on which workers are paid for a particular

task or for a defined period of time. In terms of the work arrangement characteristics examined in Table 1,

a gig worker is not paid a wage or salary; does not have an implicit or explicit contract for a continuing

work relationship; and does not have a predictable work schedule or predictable earnings when working.

Applying this definition to the characteristics we have assigned to the various work arrangements,

independent contractors and freelancers, day laborers and on-demand or platform workers should be

considered gig workers.

        In household survey data, gig workers should be included among the unincorporated self-

employed, but that group also includes people who are not gig workers. Because many household surveys

focus on main jobs to the exclusion of supplemental work activities, however, household survey data may

not capture gig work done in addition to a person’s primary employment. In tax data, some gig workers

may receive a Form 1099-MISC, but the same form also may be used to report payments to other self-

employed individuals who are not gig workers. The same is true of payments reported on a Form 1099-

K. We would need to know more about the reason a payment was received – specifically, whether it was

a payment to an unincorporated self-employed worker performing a one-off job – to determine whether

the recipient should be considered a gig worker. Further, not all gig work generates either a Form 1099-

MISC or Form 1099-K. All gig workers who are required to file a tax return should report their gross

earnings and expenses from their gig work on a Schedule C. In addition, so long as their earnings exceed

a minimum threshold, they should report their net earnings from gig work on a Schedule SE. While all gig

workers generally should be filing these schedules, not all Schedule C or Schedule SE filers are gig

workers.

        To the extent that household survey data or tax data allow us to identify everyone with either

primary or secondary employment as an unincorporated self-employed worker, in principle that

information should provide an upper bound on the number of gig workers. Trends in unincorporated self-

                                                                                                11 | P a g e
employment, which can be constructed using publicly available data from multiple sources, thus are a

first place to look for suggestive evidence of whether gig employment has been growing over time.



III.    Historical Data on Non-Employee Work Arrangements

        Several household surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau produce regular information

about the prevalence of self-employment among working Americans. The monthly CPS, conducted by

the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the source of official statistics about the U.S.

labor market. It is an interviewer-administered household survey that includes questions about labor

market activity during a specific reference week. CPS data can be used to identify household members

whose main job during the survey reference week was in self-employment. More limited information is

collected about second jobs. Each spring, the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) supplement to the

CPS collects information about income and employment over the prior calendar year, including

information on the longest job and on calendar year self-employment earnings. Finally, since 2005, the

American Community Survey (ACS), a large mixed-mode survey conducted on a rolling basis throughout

the year, has been another source of published self-employment estimates. These refer to the main job

during the survey’s reference week (described to the respondent as “last week”).

        More recently, analysts have turned to tax records in an effort to learn about the prevalence and

nature of non-employee work. Sole proprietors and general partners who have net earnings at or above a

fairly low threshold (set since 1994 at $433) are required to file a Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax.

The Master Earnings File (MEF) database maintained by the Social Security Administration incorporates

information on self-employment income from the Schedule SE together with information on any wage

earnings reported on a Form W-2 that a person may have received during the year. The Census Bureau

receives an extract (called the Detailed Earnings Record, or DER) that includes MEF records for each

CPS respondent for whom a Protected Identification Key (PIK), an encrypted Social Security Number, is

available. This extract can be used to estimate the number of people filing a Schedule SE each year. In

addition, any tax filer with gross nonfarm self-employment income earned as an unincorporated sole

                                                                                                 12 | P a g e
    proprietor (including income earned as an independent contractor or freelancer, day laborer, or on-

    demand or platform worker) is required to file a Schedule C. Schedule C information is a key ingredient

    in the construction of the master list of nonemployer businesses maintained by the Census Bureau. 4

            Whereas both Schedule SE and Schedule C are filed by the recipients of self-employment

    income, Form 1099-MISC is filed by businesses that make payments of non-employee income of $600 or

    more to any entity or individual during the calendar year. Tracking entities or people who received one or

    more Form 1099-MISC reporting non-employee compensation during a calendar year offers another

    perspective on trends in self-employment, though the use of these data is complicated by the fact that a

    Form 1099-MISC with a checked non-employee compensation box may be reporting a payment to a

    business rather than an individual and a considerable amount of self-employment income has no

    associated Form 1099-MISC. 5 Since 2011, Form 1099-K has been used to report settlement of payment

    card transactions or settlement of third-party network transactions that exceed $20,000 or 200

    transactions per year. Some self-employed individuals may receive a Form 1099-K, but this is relatively

    unusual and most Form 1099-Ks are not issued to unincorporated self-employed individuals.

            Figure 1 shows the trend in a number of different measures of the self-employment rate (the

    number self-employed under different definitions as a percent of the corresponding total employment

    measure). The four series at the bottom of Figure 1 all derive from household survey data. The series

    based on the monthly CPS captures the percent of employed people who are unincorporated self-

    employed on the main job held during the survey reference week, averaged across the twelve months of

    the year. This series has trended steadily downwards, falling from 8.3% in 1996 to 6.3% in 2016. The

    main job series based on ACS data is conceptually comparable to the monthly CPS series and, although

    slightly lower in level, shows a similar downward trend over the years for which it is available. There are

4
  Businesses are included on the list if they report $1,000 or more in gross revenue (or, in construction, $1 or more in
gross revenue). In addition to information about unincorporated sole proprietors derived from Schedule C filings, the
master list of nonemployer businesses also incorporates tax return information about C-Corporations, S-Corporations
and partnership businesses that do not have employees.
5
  The Data Appendix provides additional details about the various household survey and administrative data sources
just described. Although occasional supplements to the monthly CPS have asked more probing questions about the
nature of individuals’ employment arrangements, these questions have not been asked routinely and consideration of the
data generated by these occasional supplements is deferred to later in the paper
                                                                                                        13 | P a g e
    two household survey measures derived from the annual CPS-ASEC. The first shows the percent of

    people with any employment during the year whose longest job was in unincorporated self-employment

    and who had positive self-employment earnings. The second shows the percent of people with

    employment during the year who were reported to be unincorporated self-employed on their longest job

    and to have had positive self-employment earnings or, if the longest job was not unincorporated self-

    employment, to have had positive self-employment income from work outside of their longest job. These

    series have fluctuated somewhat but exhibit no clear trend. By construction, the first three of these series

    do not capture self-employment that is supplemental to a primary job. In principle, however, the CPS-

    ASEC series that makes use of the information on self-employment income during the year should pick

    up both primary and secondary self-employment activity and that measure behaves similarly to the others.

            Five self-employment series based on administrative data series appear in the upper part of Figure

    1. These series are most comparable in concept to the CPS-ASEC series based on earnings during the

    calendar year. The numerator in each case is some measure of the number of people or entities with self-

    employment earnings during the year; the denominator for all of the measures is the number of

    individuals with earnings from any source in the DER. The estimated share of persons with any earnings

    in the DER who have self-employment earnings has trended upwards, rising from 9.5% in 1996 to

    11.3% in 2012 (the last year for which we currently have these data). 6 Census counts of nonemployers

    are available from 1997 through 2016; sole-proprietor nonemployers are identified separately in

    published data beginning in 2004. Both have trended upwards as a percent of the number of earners and,

    over the period from 2004 through 2016 when both are available, the upward trend in the series for sole-

    proprietor nonemployers has tracked the upward trend in the series for nonemployers overall. 7 Finally,

    the number of entities receiving non-employee compensation reported on a Form 1099-MISC, taking

    individuals and businesses together, and the number of individuals for whom such compensation was

  The DER estimates are based on a data file containing linked individual records from the CPS-ASEC and the DER
that is discussed in the next section of the paper.
7
  For 2013, 2014 and 2015, we do not have the DER estimate of the number of people with earnings during the year
needed to construct the self-employment rates based on the Census nonemployer data. We have extrapolated the 2012
DER employment estimate forward using information on the change in employment from the Current Employment
Statistics survey. See the Data Appendix for further details.
                                                                                                    14 | P a g e
reported are currently available for the period 2000-2012. These measures also have grown relative to

the number of people with earnings.

        Figure 1 makes clear that different data sources provide quite different answers to the simple

question of what is the level and trend of self-employment in the U.S. economy. Others have noted

divergences between specific series; Katz and Krueger (2016), for example, show the divergent trends in

estimates of self-employment based on monthly CPS data and IRS Schedule C filings. Figure 1 shows

that this divergence is quite general. Household surveys consistently show lower levels of self-

employment than tax data and a relatively flat or declining long-term trend in self-employment as

contrasted with the upward trend that is evident in tax data.

        It would be nice to be able to say that one or the other type of measure – estimates based on

household survey data or estimates based on tax data – accurately represents the prevalence and evolution

of self-employment over time. In truth, however, measures of both types suffer from potential

weaknesses. On the one hand, constraints on the length of the monthly CPS and ACS questionnaires

mean that neither survey instrument probes deeply about household members’ work arrangements. This

may contribute to a variety of reporting errors. For example, a household survey respondent might fail to

mention informal work that they do not think of as a job, something that further probing might uncover.

To take another example, a household member who is doing work for a business may be reported as an

employee of that business, even in cases where further probing might reveal that the person is in fact an

independent contractor or freelancer. To the extent that non-traditional work arrangements are of growing

importance, these problems could have become more serious over time.

        On the other hand, administrative data capture only the information that is reported to the tax

authorities on tax or information returns. Non-reporting or under-reporting of income to the tax

authorities is an acknowledged issue, especially with regard to self-employment income and other types

of income that do not generate an information return that is submitted to the IRS. As already noted,

anyone who makes payments of wage or salary income of $600 or more to an employee over the course

of the year is required to file a Form W-2 with the IRS to document that payment. Businesses that make

                                                                                                15 | P a g e
payments of $600 or more to a self-employed individual for services rendered are required to report those

payments on a Form 1099-MISC. In 2011, business tax forms were modified so that business owners

now must certify when they file their tax returns that all required Form 1099-MISCs have been completed

and submitted. Also taking effect in 2011 was a requirement that payment settlement entities that process

electronic payments to businesses must report those payments to the IRS on a Form 1099-K if they

exceed certain thresholds. There is no requirement, however, for households that pay for services to file a

1099-MISC. Despite efforts by the Congress to tighten the requirements for information reporting, a great

deal of self-employment income generates no associated information return (Government Accountability

Office 2007, Slemrod et al 2017). Further, information returns capture only gross payments. To determine

self-employment earnings, it is equally important to be able to gauge the expenses incurred in connection

with this gross income, but these expenses generally are not subject to required information reporting

(Government Accountability Office 2007, Slemrod et al 2017). Not surprisingly, tax audit studies have

shown that virtually all wage and salary income is reported on individual tax returns, but that a notably

smaller share of net non-farm proprietor income and net farm income is reported (Slemrod and Bakija

2008).

         One question is whether changes in information reporting requirements, such as those introduced

in 2011, could have affected the reported prevalence and amounts of self-employment income. Research

to date has not identified discontinuities in the administrative self-employment time series associated

with changes in reporting requirements. With respect specifically to the changes introduced in 2011, this

may be because the relatively minor increases in reported gross self-employment income that the changes

appear to have induced were offset by the reporting of increased expenses (Slemrod et al 2017).

         Another potential issue to flag is that, in the household survey data we have examined, our

attention has been focused on the unincorporated self-employed, the group that is conceptually most

comparable to the self-employment for which we have information in the DER. If the self-employed have

become more likely over time to incorporate, the trend in a series that included the incorporated self-

employed might be more meaningful (Hipple and Hammond 2016). We have recomputed both the

                                                                                               16 | P a g e
    monthly CPS and the ACS self-employment series with the incorporated self-employed included.

    Including them in the series does not change the conclusion that self-employment as measured in the

    household survey data has been steady or declining, rather than increasing as in the tax-based

    administrative data.



    IV.     Reconciling Household Survey and Administrative Estimates of Non-employee Work

            The most straightforward approach to understanding the discrepancies between household survey

    and administrative data estimates of self-employment is to compare information from the two sources for

    the same set of people. Using an internal Census Bureau identifier—the Protected Identification Key or

    PIK—we have linked records from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the CPS (the CPS-

    ASEC) to administrative records from the DER for the years 1996 through 2012 (the latest year for

    which we currently have data from the DER). The PIK is missing for approximately 20 to 30% of CPS-

    ASEC records, depending on the year. As described in the Data Appendix, we have reweighted the

    records with a PIK based on their characteristics to represent the population age 16 and older as a whole.

    In both of the data sets incorporated into the linked file, we identify unincorporated self-employment

    based on reports of self-employment earnings during the calendar year. To be more specific, in the CPS-

    ASEC, a person is defined as self-employed if they have a longest job during the year that is

    unincorporated self-employed and positive self-employment earnings or, if the longest job was not

    unincorporated self-employed, if they have positive self-employment income from some other job. 8 In

    the DER, a person is defined as self-employed if they had self-employment earnings reported on a

    Schedule SE.

            We have used these data to ask how well the CPS-ASEC and the DER agree with respect to the

    classification of individuals as self-employed. Table 2 displays a weighted cross-tabulation of self-

    employment status in the CPS-ASEC with self-employment status in the DER, using data that are pooled


8
  In the CPS-ASEC, we do not know whether self-employment earnings other than from the longest job are from
incorporated or unincorporated self-employment, though we expect most self-employment outside of the longest job to
be unincorporated self-employment. See the Data Appendix for some evidence related to this point.
                                                                                                     17 | P a g e
    across the years 1996-2012. Although the two data sources should be measuring essentially the same

    thing, there is substantial disagreement between them regarding individuals’ self-employment status. On

    average over the 17 years for which we have data, 65.4% of those with self-employment income in the

    DER do not report any self-employment income in the CPS. Conversely, 51.1% of those with self-

    employment income in the CPS-ASEC do not report any self-employment income in the DER.

             The fact that there is disagreement between the household survey and administrative data

    employment measures is not surprising. In earlier research, we found that, on average over the period

    1996-2003, about 6% of individuals who had unemployment insurance (UI) earnings during the first

    quarter of the year reported no CPS wage-and-salary employment in a UI-covered sector during the year’s

    first three months; conversely, about 18% of individuals reporting CPS wage-and-salary employment in a

    UI-covered sector during the first three months of the year had no first-quarter UI earnings (Abraham et al

    2013). Similarly, in weighted tabulations using the linked data file that we are using to explore the

    sources of discrepancy in alternative self-employment series, 9.3% of those with DER wage-and- salary

    income had no reported CPS-ASEC wage-and-salary income for the same year; conversely, 12.4% of

    those with reported CPS-ASEC wage-and-salary income for a year had no DER wage-and-salary income

    for that same year.

             What is surprising, however, is the size of the off-diagonal cells in the tabulations shown in Table

    2. Whether taking the DER self-employed or the CPS self-employed as the base, a majority of those who

    are categorized as self-employed in the data set in question are not categorized as such in the other data

    set. At least to some extent, this reflects the complexity of self-employment activity. There are many

    different types of self-employment work and a highly heterogeneous set of arrangements under which

    such work might occur. Neither the household survey data nor the administrative data may be ideally

    suited to pick up all of that activity. 9


9
 Some of the information used to categorize individuals as self-employed in the CPS-ASEC is imputed rather than
directly reported. We chose to retain CPS-ASEC records with imputed information because that makes the data we
analyze more consistent with the data used in the production of published statistics. Usable information on which values
are imputed is available from 1997 forward. In calculations for the 1997-2012 period based on a sample restricted to
cases with directly reported information, we estimate that 63.4% of those with DER self-employment have no CPS-
                                                                                                        18 | P a g e
          We also are interested in how the discrepancy between the CPS-ASEC and the DER measures

 of self-employment has changed over time. Figure 2A displays the number of self-employed people as

 measured in the CPS-ASEC annual earnings data and the corresponding measure based on earnings data

 from the DER. While self-employment based on the DER grew markedly between 1996 and the mid-

 2000s, the corresponding CPS-ASEC measure was lower to start with and has been stagnant. Figure 2B

 shows the off-diagonals associated with cross-tabulating the CPS-ASEC and DER data on a year-by-

 year basis. That is, it plots the number of people who are self-employed in the DER but not the CPS-

 ASEC and, separately, the number who are self-employed in the CPS-ASEC but not the DER. It is

 apparent that virtually all of the growth in DER self-employment relative to CPS-ASEC self-

 employment can be attributed to growth in the number of people who are self-employed in the DER but

 not in the CPS-ASEC.

          To further explore the discrepancy between the two measures of self-employment, we have

 looked a bit more closely at these off-diagonals, grouping those who are self-employed in the DER but

 not the CPS-ASEC into three mutually exclusive categories:

     1) No CPS employment: No wage-and-salary or self-employment income in the CPS-ASEC; self-

          employment income in the DER. 10

     2) Self-employment second job not reported in CPS: Only wage-and-salary income in the CPS-

          ASEC; both wage-and-salary income and self-employment income in the DER.

     3) CPS job wage and salary, classification issue: Only wage-and-salary income in the CPS-ASEC;

          only self-employment income in the DER.


 Those in the first two groups may be people performing self-employment work who do not think to

 report it (or for whom the CPS respondent in their household does not think to report it), whether because

 the activity in question generated only a small amount of earnings or for some other reason. The third

 group may be capturing those who think of themselves as employees and may in fact be employees

ASEC self-employment and 44.3% of those with CPS-ASEC self-employment have no DER self-employment.
10
   Individuals in this category may have only self-employment income or both wage-and-salary and self-employment
income in the DER.
                                                                                                    19 | P a g e
     according to the relevant legal criteria, but are paid as non-employees and classified that way in the tax

     data. Given the growing concerns about worker misclassification (see, e.g., Leberstein 2012), for some

     purposes this group may be the most interesting.

             We also have grouped those who are self-employed in the CPS-ASEC but not in the DER into

     three mutually exclusive categories:

         4) No DER employment: No wage-and-salary or self-employment income in the DER; self-

             employment income in the CPS-ASEC. 11

         5) Self-employment second job not recorded in the DER: Only wage-and-salary income in the DER;

             both wage-and-salary income and self-employment income in the CPS-ASEC.

         6) CPS job self-employed, classification issue: Only wage-and-salary income in the DER; only self-

             employment income in the CPS-ASEC.


     The fourth and fifth categories capture self-employment income that is reported in the CPS but does not

     appear in the tax data, either work generating too little income to trigger tax reporting requirements or

     off-the-books work. Category six may be capturing individuals who are indeed self- employed but

     operate an incorporated business, meaning that they should not have been counted in the CPS measure of

     unincorporated self-employment and would appear in the tax data as having wage and salary income, but

     not self-employment income.

             Figure 3A shows the evolution of the three groups within the DER{SE=1}/CPS-ASEC{SE=0}

     category; Figure 3B shows the evolution of the three groups within the CPS-ASEC{SE=1}/DER{SE=0}

     category. Whereas there has been growth in all three of the DER{SE=1}/CPS-ASEC{SE=0} groups,

     employment in the three CPS-ASEC{SE=1}/DER{SE=0} groups has changed very little.

             One way to summarize the information presented in these figures is to ask what share of the

     growing discrepancy between the number of people with self-employment income according to the DER

     and the number of self-employed people according to the CPS-ASEC is accounted for by each of the


11
  Individuals in this category may have only self-employment income or both wage-and-salary and self-employment
income in the CPS-ASEC.
                                                                                                     20 | P a g e
 groups. For this purpose, we have averaged the numbers for the two starting years and the two ending

 years in our data series, then calculated the overall change in the discrepancy between those averaged

 endpoints. Note that either increases in the size of the DER{SE=1}/CPS-ASEC{SE=0} groups or

 decreases in the size of the CPS-ASEC{SE=1}/DER{SE=0} groups could have added to the overall

 discrepancy.

            The percentages of the growth in the overall discrepancy accounted for by each of the six groups

 described above are shown in Table 3. As was apparent from Figure 2, the growing discrepancy between

 the DER and CPS-ASEC estimates of self-employment is accounted for entirely by the growing number

 of people identified as self-employed in the DER who are not so identified in the CPS-ASEC. This

 growth is split roughly evenly between the three DER{SE=1}/CPS-ASEC{SE=0} groups. The net effect

 of changes in the size of the CPS-ASEC{SE=1}/DER{SE=0} off-diagonals is small and works in the

 direction of slightly offsetting the growing size of the DER{SE=1}/CPS-ASEC{SE=0} off-diagonals. In

 other words, the main issue appears to be that there are an increasing number of people who are earning

 self-employment income and reporting that income to the tax authorities, but for whom that income is

 not being reported in the CPS-ASEC. 12

            A possible explanation for the increasing number of people with self-employment activity that is

 captured in the DER but not reported in the CPS-ASEC might be that more of them are doing self-

 employment work that generates only a small amount of income. We note, however, that the average self-

 employment earnings of those with self-employment captured in the DER but not the CPS-ASEC are

 relatively substantial, averaging roughly $13,700 in 2009 dollars over the years 1996 through 2012

 covered by our sample, and, further, that this average earnings level has not trended downwards over

 time. 13


12
   In the reweighted sample that excludes cases with imputed information, which can be constructed for the period from
1997 through 2012, it is also the case that each of the three groups with DER self-employment but no CPS-ASEC self-
employment accounts for roughly a third of the discrepancy in growth between the DER and CPS-ASEC series.
13
   Among those who have self-employment earnings in the DER but not in the CPS-ASEC, DER earnings are largest for
those with only wage and salary earnings in the CPS-ASEC and only self-employment earnings in the DER, averaging
just over $23,000 in 2009 dollars over the years for which we have data. DER self-employment earnings averaged about
$10,900 for the group with no CPS-ASEC employment and about $7,500 for those who are missing a self-employment

 V.      Improving Household Survey Measures of Non-Employee Work

         The preceding discussion has documented that the CPS-ASEC information on calendar year

 earnings is missing a significant and increasing amount of self-employment activity. Because this series

 has behaved so similarly to other series based on household survey data, there is reason to suspect that

 the same is true of other household survey measures of self-employment.

         One way to improve existing household survey measures of self-employment and alternative

 work arrangements more generally would be to add survey questions that probe more directly regarding

 these arrangements, either as part of the core survey or (perhaps more plausibly) on periodic supplements.

 The Contingent Worker Supplement (CWS) to the CPS, fielded on several occasions between 1995 and

 2017, has included questions both about whether the individual has an explicit or implicit contract for

 continued employment and about alternative work arrangements—whether the person’s main job was as

 an independent contractor, on-call worker, temporary agency worker or worker at a contract firm (see

 Cohany 1996, Polivka 1996a, Polivka 1996b). The smaller Quality of Worklife (QWL) supplement to

 the General Social Survey also has produced estimates on the prevalence of the same four alternative

 work arrangements on the main job.

         Estimates of the prevalence of alternative work arrangements based on the CWS for six years

 between 1995 and 2017 are shown in the top panel of Table 4; estimates from the QWL supplement to the

 GSS for four years between 2002 and 2014 are shown in the table’s bottom panel. Although the estimates

 from the two surveys differ with regard to the estimated prevalence of some types of work, in particular

 work as an independent contractor, they agree that the prevalence of the different alternative work

 arrangements has not trended upwards over time. It is important to note, however, that these questions

 were asked only about people who had already been identified as employed in response to the survey’s

 standard employment questions and only about their main jobs. Both of these features of the two surveys




second job in the CPS-ASEC. There was no downward trend in DER self-employment earnings over our sample period
for any of the three groups.
                                                                                                22 | P a g e
     mean that there is likely to be work under alternative arrangements that, in part by design, they do not

     capture.

                In October and November 2015, before the fielding of the 2017 CWS, Lawrence Katz and Alan

     Krueger arranged for the core CWS questions to be collected on the Rand-Princeton Contingent Work

     Survey (RPCWS) administered as part of the Rand Corporation’s online American Life Panel (ALP)

     (Katz and Krueger 2016). The intention was that the RPCWS would produce estimates for 2015 that

     could be compared to the CWS estimates for earlier years. In contrast to the 2017 CWS, the 2015

     RPCWS produced substantially higher prevalence rates for all four types of alternative work than had

     been estimated in the 2005 CWS, results that were interpreted as evidence of substantial growth in the

     prevalence of these arrangements on individuals’ main jobs. Given these findings, many people were

     surprised when the 2017 CWS estimates turned out to be so similar to the 2005 CWS estimates. There

     are several reasons, however, to have suspected that the RPCWS estimates might not be directly

     comparable to the earlier CWS estimates.

                First, the RPCWS data were collected through an online panel, the ALP, whose members are

     assembled from a variety of sources with an unknown response rate. 14 Given the way in which it was

     assembled, the RPCWS sample may be less representative of the population than the CWS sample in

     ways that reweighting based on observables cannot fully correct. Second, whereas the CWS asks

     respondents to provide information for all members of their households, the RPCWS asks respondents to

     report only for themselves. To the extent that respondents are able to report more fully about their own

     experiences than about the experiences of others in their household, this could mean that relying only on

     self-reports will produce more accurate information than accepting both self and proxy reports, but by the

     same token may undermine the comparability of the RPCWS to the CWS. Third, the RPCWS and the

     CWS collected information for different times of the year, with the CWS asking about work during a

     mid-February reference week and the RPCWS about work during an October or November reference

     week. It is possible that the reliance on alternative work arrangements fell between 2015 and 2017 as the

                                                                                                    23 | P a g e
     labor market tightened, but this seems unlikely to explain the large difference in the estimates from the

     2015 RPCWS and the 2017 CWS. We view the different findings obtained in the two surveys as a

     cautionary tale about the importance of consistency in measurement for assessing trends in work

     arrangements.

             Beyond the issue of comparing the RPCWS to the CWS, there is the concern already noted that

     the CWS, GSS and RPCWS all could be missing non-employee work on the part of people who are not

     categorized as employed based on the standard employment questions or whose self-employment is not

     their main job. In the linked data described in the previous section of the paper, there are a significant

     number of people for whom no self-employment during the year is recorded in the household data but

     who have self-employment income that is captured in the DER. These are divided among people with no

     income from employment at all in the CPS (19.3% on average over the 1996 to 2012 period); people with

     only wage and salary income in the CPS but wage and salary income plus self-employment income in the

     DER (44.9% on average); and people who have only wage and salary income in the CPS and only self-

     employment income in the DER (35.7% on average). 15 While these numbers refer to self-employment at

     any point during the year rather than to self-employment at a point in time, they suggest that there may be

     a significant amount of non-employee work that would not be uncovered by probing only about an

     already-reported main job (the final group in the cited numbers based on the linked annual data) and that

     such a focus may miss important ongoing changes.

             Several other recent surveys have contained questions designed specifically to learn about the

     prevalence of informal work activity. The Enterprising and Informal Work Activities (EIWA) Survey

     (Robles and McGee 2016), administered as an online survey to the GfK KnowledgePanel in October and

     November of 2015, contained a battery of items asking respondents about informal income-generating

     activities over the prior six months, including in-person service activities such as child care,

     housecleaning or landscaping; selling new or used items at garage sales or flea markets; and selling

     services, selling items or renting property online. The EIWA estimates indicate that 36% of the adult U.S.

1997-2012 are 19.5%, 45.0% and 35.5%.

 population engaged in at least one of these activities during the six-month reference period. Although

 there might be debate about whether renting or selling items should count as work activity, the survey

 estimates show that 27% of the adult population earned income by housecleaning, house sitting, yard

 work or other property maintenance tasks and that 17% earned income by babysitting or providing

 childcare services.

          The 2015 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), also administered via

 the GfK KnowledgePanel, contained a single question about whether a respondent was currently engaged

 in informal work activity. Among adults who were not students and not retired, about 20% of those under

 age 30, 15% of those age 30 to 44, and 11% of those age 45 and older said they were engaged in informal

 work (Board of Governors 2016). The 2016 SHED adopted the more detailed set of questions about

 informal work activity developed for the EIWA and a one-month reference period. An estimated 28% of

 all adults reported having earned money from informal work activities during the previous month (Board

 of Governors 2017). A final recent survey, the Survey of Informal Work Participation (SIWP), also finds

 high rates of participation in informal work activities. Among non-retired adults age 21 and older

 surveyed in the two waves of the survey conducted in 2015, an estimated 37% were currently engaged in

 paid informal work, not including survey work, and 20% were engaged in informal work after excluding

 work related to renting and selling (Bracha and Burke 2016). 16

          A recent survey experiment described in Abraham and Amaya (2018) provides some additional

 evidence about how different approaches to probing for informal employment might affect the share of

 people for whom employment activity is reported (the employment rate) and the share of those with

 employment for whom more than one job is reported (the multiple job holding rate). The experiment was




16
   In addition to these surveys, the Survey of Income and Program Participation includes a category for reported work
on a person’s main job that cannot easily be classified as either work for an employee or self-employment. The utility of
these data is limited by the fact that they do not allow different arrangements within the “other” category to be
distinguished. The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) independent work survey (Manyika et al 2016) also attempted to
capture all informal or independent work, whether it represented a person’s primary work or was supplemental to a
primary job. The independent work concept applied in the MGI survey, however, is not comparable to that applied in
other research.

     embedded in a survey carried out for the 2016 Joint Program in Survey Methodology (JPSM) practicum.

     Subjects for the survey were recruited using Mechanical Turk, Amazon’s crowdsourcing platform.

             The survey collected information on the characteristics of the members of respondents’

     households. It also asked questions to identify each household member’s employment status and, for

     those who were employed, whether they held more than one job. With the exception of some special

     questions concerning sexual orientation and gender identify included for testing, all of the questions about

     household members’ characteristics and employment status were taken directly from the CPS

     questionnaire. Additional questions about informal work activity were asked about one randomly-

     selected member of each survey respondent’s household. In one version, randomly assigned to half of the

     cases, respondents were asked a global yes/no question about whether there had been any such work

     activity during the reference week (the global question). In the second version, respondents were asked

     about each of six different possible types of informal work activity, with examples provided for each of

     them, and to indicate whether any other type of informal work activity had been performed (the detailed

     question). 17 In cases where employment had already been reported for the person to whom the added

     probe applied, the respondent was asked to indicate whether any reported informal work activity had been

     included in the responses to the standard CPS employment questions. Employment rates and multiple job

     holding rates were computed based on the responses to the CPS questions and then were re-computed to

     incorporate the additional work activity uncovered by probing.

             The first row in the upper panel of Table 5, summarizing selected results from Abraham and

     Amaya (2018), displays the employment rate that is estimated based on the standard CPS questions; the

     second row displays the augmented employment rate that incorporates the additional information

     provided in response to the informal employment probe; and the third row shows the difference between

     the two estimates. The employment rate is defined as the percent of the sample categorized as having

     been employed during the survey reference week. The second panel of the table reports similar

  The six types of activity in addition to the “other” category were services to other people; services to a self-employed
individual or business; performing as an actor, musician or entertainer; driving for a ride-sharing service; assisting with
medical, marketing or other research; or posting videos, blogs or other content online. A list of examples was given for
each category.
                                                                                                            26 | P a g e
information on the multiple job-holding rate for those categorized as employed based on the standard

CPS questions. The multiple job holding rate is the percent of this group who had more than one job

during the survey reference week. Estimates are shown separately for respondents asked to report for

themselves and those asked to report for another member of their household, in each case differentiated

by whether the respondent received the global probe or the more detailed probe.

        Probing to ask about informal work activity produced notably higher estimated employment and

multiple job-holding rates whether respondents were reporting for themselves and or for another member

of their household, and whether the respondent received the global or the detailed probe. Although the

sample of Mechanical Turkers used in the study is not representative of the population as a whole and

the magnitude of the changes in these estimated rates likely would have been different in a more

representative sample, the fact that probing has such a consistent effect on the estimates suggests that

learning about informal work activity is likely to require asking more than the standard employment

questions.

        In addition, the estimates suggest that asking the global question versus the more detailed

question about informal work may make a larger difference when the respondent is answering questions

about someone else. For those reporting about their own work activity, the two forms of the question

have very comparable impacts, and the differences between the effects of the two question treatments are

not statistically significant. In contrast, when the respondent is reporting for another household member,

asking the detailed probe rather than the global probe produces a larger increase in both the estimated

employment rate and the estimated multiple job-holding rate. Given the nature of the survey sample, the

magnitudes of the differences between the estimates for respondents and those for others in their

household are unlikely to generalize, but as discussed more fully in Abraham and Amaya (2018), it is

informative that detailed probing makes a larger difference compared to using a global probe when

respondents are being asked about others in the household rather than about themselves.

        Other recent research also has produced results suggesting that the standard CPS questions may

not fully capture informal work activity. The SIWP surveys fielded in 2015 included employment

                                                                                                27 | P a g e
questions similar to those on the CPS together with additional questions about informal work. Assuming

that anyone who was currently engaged in informal work activity should have been counted as employed,

accounting for that work would have raised the point estimate of the overall employment rate from 62.0%

to 64.6%, though the survey sample was relatively small and this increase was not statistically significant

(Bracha and Burke 2016). Preliminary results from a 2015 survey of Mechanical Turk respondents

conducted by Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger indicate that 72% of small jobs or gigs beyond the main

job were not reported in response to the CPS multiple job holding question (Katz 2018). Taken as a

whole, these findings suggest that standard household survey questions may miss some individuals’

primary work activities, perhaps because the survey respondent does not think of them as a job, and that

there is a sizable risk they will fail to uncover secondary work activity. Devising an appropriate set of

more probing questions that could be asked at regular intervals on ongoing household surveys would

allow trends in work activity and work arrangements to be gauged more accurately.



VI.     Other Sources of Information on Non-employee Work

        In addition to household survey data and the earnings information derived from Schedule SE

that we have already discussed, useful information about non-employee work could be gleaned from

employer surveys, other tax records and associated data repositories, and information held by private

firms. We discuss each of these potential data sources briefly in turn. A central theme of our discussion

will be that the integration of survey, administrative and private data has the potential to add important

new insights to our understanding of the changing nature of work.

        Employer Surveys. A natural approach to learning about alternative work arrangements would be

to ask employers. Employer-provided information is unlikely to be especially helpful for learning about

how alternative work arrangements fit into workers’ careers, but could be quite helpful for learning about

the scale of such activity and thus for productivity measurement. Capturing firms’ use of contract workers

is an issue that has been of particular concern to the federal statistical agencies. More specifically, the

agencies have recognized that, for the purpose of allocating economic inputs by sector and measuring

                                                                                                  28 | P a g e
sectoral productivity, the employees of Professional Employer Organization (PEO) and Temporary Help

Service (THS) firms should be assigned to the industry in which they are actually working rather than to

staffing services. Dey, Houseman and Polivka (2012) used data from the Occupational Employment

Survey on the occupational distribution of staffing services employees together with information from the

Contingent Worker Supplement on the industries in which staffing firms place workers to generate

estimates of the industry distribution of placements by PEO and THS firms. Over the 1989 to 2004 period

studied in their paper, accounting for such placements had a noteworthy impact not only on trends in the

input of labor to manufacturing but also on measures of manufacturing labor productivity.

      While recognizing that this issue needs to be addressed, both BLS and Census have faced

challenges in fully capturing and allocating THS and PEO activity. For a number of cycles, the

Economic Census has included questions for PEO firms about the industries in which leased workers are

placed (Lombardi and Ono 2010), but similar questions are not asked of temporary help service firms nor

is it clear that they would be able to answer them. At BLS, a study was carried out in 2005 to assess the

feasibility of collecting information from THS and PEO firms in the Current Employment Statistics

(CES) survey on where they placed workers. The conclusion was that many THS and PEO firms do not

have records concerning the industry of their clients and that a substantial minority would be unable or

unwilling to provide this information on the CES (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005). Both the Census and

the BLS efforts just described sought to be able to allocate the employees of the PEO and THS firms

across industries, an important but limited objective. Obtaining this information would still leave

unanswered important questions about firms’ use of the services of self-employed individuals working on

their own account.

      In principle, both the services provided by contract company workers and the services provided by

sole proprietors, independent contractors, and so on should be captured in the Business Expenses Survey

(BES) conducted by the Census Bureau as a part of the Economic Census and its program of annual

economic surveys. Rather than asking service suppliers to provide information about their customers, the

BES asks the firms who are customers to report on their spending for these services. The information
                                                                                               29 | P a g e
     obtained through the BES is an important ingredient in the construction of the Input-Output tables. The

     categories of expenses for which firms are asked to report vary somewhat depending on the industry, but

     include a category for temporary staff and leased employees obtained through temporary help service or

     PEO firms, a category for purchased professional and technical services and categories for other types of

     purchased services. The data are collected annually for manufacturing and services, but only once every

     five years for other industries, and they are denominated in dollars rather than in the amount of labor used

     to produce the service in question. Perhaps more important for our purposes, the payments in any

     category that a firm makes to individuals working as independent contractors or freelancers are

     aggregated with the payments made to more traditional businesses and cannot be separately identified.

             Another interesting effort to collect information from the users of labor supplied under various

     arrangements was the addition of a module on this topic to the 2015 Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs

     (ASE). 18 The module included questions on whether the firm used different types of workers—full time;

     part time; day laborer; temporary help service employee; leased employee; or contractors, subcontractors,

     independent contractors, or outside consultants—as well as questions regarding what share of the total

     number of workers were of each type and the types of tasks each type of worker performed. Published

     data based on the survey module break the estimates out by the age of the business enterprise and other

     business characteristics. The approach developed for the 2015 ASE is interesting in part because it offers

     the possibility of insights into the use of non-employee workers by young businesses that may be more

     innovative in their workforce organizational structure.

             Because the Census Bureau does not believe that it has a valid basis for reweighting information

     collected in response to the type of worker questions to account for either unit or item nonresponse, the

     published estimates apply only to responding firms, which represent approximately 65% of all firms,

     49% of employment, 48% of payroll and 48% of revenue. Among the firms represented by the

     responses, 2.9% used day laborers, 4.6% used temporary help service employees, 0.8% used leased

     employees and 29.7% used contractors, subcontractors, independent contractors, or outside consultants.

18
  The ASE is a survey of approximately 290,000 employer firms, of which just under half are less than 10 years old.
See Foster and Norman (2016) for further details about the ASE
                                                                                                       30 | P a g e
At firms where they were used, workers of these types accounted for fewer than 25% of all workers at a

majority of firms (and for day laborers and temporary help service employees, at a very large majority of

firms), but leased employees and contract workers accounted for 75% or more of workers at between a

fifth and a quarter of firms where they were used. There is more to be learned from a careful examination

of these new data and this approach to learning about the use of workers under alternative arrangements

perhaps could be adapted for use in other settings.

        Tax Data. The analysis described earlier in the paper based on CPS data integrated with records

from the DER demonstrates the value that can be added by integrating survey and administrative data.

Integration of the Form 1099-MISC data into this infrastructure also would be very valuable. Being able to

track the longitudinal relationship between individuals identified through their PIKs (SSNs) and the firms

identified through their EINs who are issuing the Form 1099-MISC’s to them would be especially

interesting. Some individuals may have longstanding self-employment relationships with a single firm;

these would be reflected in the individual receiving a 1099-MISC from only one EIN for many years

consecutively. Other individuals may be receiving multiple 1099-MISC forms from multiple EINs with

considerable turnover in the latter. These two patterns would imply quite different work arrangements from

the perspective of both the individual and the firm.

        Integration of other sorts of tax data also has the potential to yield new insights. As an example, in

other recent work, we have created a data file containing information on self-employed sole proprietors

derived from the microdata that underlie the Census Bureau nonemployer statistics, the unemployment

insurance wage records contained in the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD)

infrastructure, and personal characteristics from the Census Bureau’s Individual Characteristics File. We

are using these data to study changes in the Taxi and Limousine Services industry during the period of

explosive growth it has experienced following the introduction of online apps for matching workers to

customers, looking both at new entrants and incumbents in the industry (Abraham et al 2018). This is just

one example of the sorts of analyses that can be carried out using this data infrastructure.




                                                                                                31 | P a g e
          Financial Data. Anonymized individual-level financial records are another potential source of

 information about certain forms of non-employee work. In an interesting stream of research, Farrell and

 Greig (2016a, 2016b) use transaction-level data from customers with JP Morgan Chase banking and

 credit card accounts to examine flows of income that originate from a set of online platforms identified

 by the research team. Their findings suggest that online platform workers reflect a small but rapidly

 growing sector of the workforce. Their findings also suggest, however, that such work is a secondary

 source of income for most households, reinforcing the importance of looking beyond the main job to

 develop a complete understanding of the role of non-employee work.

          Taking a somewhat different approach, Koustas (2018) analyzes transactions-level data for the

 users of one company’s online personal financial management software. In a sample of individuals

 identified as receiving regular bi-weekly paychecks, he finds that work as an Uber driver mitigates

 fluctuations in pay and makes a significant contribution to allowing drivers to smooth their consumption

 when earnings from a main job fluctuate.

        Private Sector Company Data. A final source of information that has been used by researchers

interested specifically in the rise of the online platform economy has been person-level data from companies

in the online platform sector. Hall and Krueger (2018), for example, have analyzed administrative data on

Uber’s “driver/partners” derived from the company’s records. In addition, to enhance the administrative

data, they also carried out a survey of these driver/partners. To help provide perspective on their findings,

they compare patterns of activity of drivers/partners to information from the American Community Survey

on taxi drivers and chauffeurs. They find, for example, that Uber drivers/partners work fewer hours per

week than taxi drivers and chauffeurs.

          While the findings from these various studies are fascinating, the properties of many of the new

 private data sources are not yet fully understood. The JP Morgan Chase Institute has taken significant

 steps to facilitate access by outside researchers to their data and there are other organizations that have

 developed collaborative relationships with outside researchers. The involvement of outside researchers

 undoubtedly will be helpful for learning about the strengths and weaknesses of these new types of data.

these data in an appropriately secure environment with the survey and administrative records discussed

above seem like worthy longer-term goals.



VII.    Conclusion and a Path Forward

       The widely perceived rise of the gig economy is as yet not well measured or well understood. Gig

economy workers should be classified as self-employed, but data from the core traditional household

surveys do not show an increase in self-employment activity. There is more evidence in the administrative

data of growth in the number of individuals receiving income from self-employment, though much of the

growth observed in these data occurred between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, prior to the emergence

of the app-based gig activity that has captured the popular imagination. If available data on self-

employment are failing to capture ongoing growth in non-employee work activity, estimates of growth in

labor inputs may be too low, estimates of aggregate productivity growth may be too high, and the pattern of

estimated productivity growth may have been distorted.

.       A challenge in understanding and measuring the rise of the gig economy is being able to

document where such activity fits into the full range of non-employee work. Identifying the key

attributes that characterize different forms of non-employee work may help us close in on the traits of

jobs that are most appropriately characterized as gig work. In the framework we have developed, gig

workers are a subset of the unincorporated self-employed as identified in multiple data sources. We have

discussed the challenges to quantifying the prevalence of gig employment using either existing

household survey data or administrative records on their own.

        Our analysis highlights the potential payoff from improvements in economic measurement along

two key dimensions. First, there is a high potential payoff to modules conducted at regular intervals on

ongoing household surveys that would probe more deeply about non-employee work activities. This

should not be surprising, since gig employment is often a secondary activity that existing household

surveys are not well designed to capture. Such activity may not be mentioned by respondents in cases

                                                                                                33 | P a g e
where gig work is not a person’s primary activity and where the standard household survey employment

questions do not cue adequately that it should be reported. To the extent that job attributes define the

various types of non-employee work arrangements, probes about employment usefully could be

supplemented with questions about job attributes.

        A second improvement in economic measurement would be to develop estimates based on survey

and administrative data that have been integrated at the individual level. Such integration offers great

potential for understanding the changing nature of work, particularly for non-traditional work activities

that are inherently difficult to define and measure. Measures derived from tax data show an increasing

amount of self-employment that is being missed in household surveys, yet the tax data by themselves are

not informative about who these workers are and may be missing “off-the-books” work. Linking tax data

with household survey data gives us not only the worker’s demographic characteristics, but also the

worker’s family characteristics – something that is crucially important for understanding how gig

employment is related to family income and health insurance coverage. In addition, to the extent that

household surveys capture “off-the-books” work that is not reported to the tax authorities, the two sources

together may provide a more complete picture than either source alone.

        A key missing piece of the puzzle is to understand where non-employee work fits into the career

paths of workers. The limited evidence that is currently available suggests that much of the online

platform/on-demand non-employee work to date has been supplemental in nature rather than something

that participants have undertaken as a primary activity. There is, however, much more to be done to better

understand how individuals are combining traditional employment and non-employee work. Longitudinal

matched employer-employee data that also fully integrate non-employee work activity will be invaluable

for addressing these questions. Developing this data infrastructure will be challenging but is something

we believe can be accomplished by building on the work we already have done to integrate the CPS-

ASEC, DER, LEHD and nonemployer business data infrastructures. Being able to add Form 1099-MISC

data, including identifiers for both the recipients and the providers of reported payments of non-employee

compensation, would greatly enhance the value of the integrated data infrastructure. More generally, we

                                                                                                34 | P a g e
envision making use of survey and administrative data to measure and analyze the full taxonomy of non-

employee work in the context of the career paths of workers over their life cycle.

Data Appendix


           Household survey data on self-employment. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly

household survey with a sample that represents the civilian population of the United States. The basic

monthly CPS questionnaire collects relatively rich information on the characteristics of all members of

selected households age 16 and older, including their age, sex, race, ethnicity, nativity, disability status, and

education. The monthly instrument also contains questions to determine whether household members were

employed during the survey reference week (normally the week that includes the 12th of the month) and, if

so, whether each person had more than one job during that week. For those categorized as employed, the

CPS asks about the occupation and industry of the main job, hours on the main job, and combined hours on

any other jobs. Additional questions are asked that allow a person’s status on their main job to be categorized

as wage and salary, self-employed with an incorporated business, self-employed with an unincorporated

business, or unpaid family worker. In published Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) statistical series on self-

employment based on the monthly data, individuals who operate an incorporated business are categorized as

wage and salary workers rather than as self-employed, but both the incorporated and the unincorporated self-

employed can be identified in the underlying microdata. Information on the industry, occupation and type of

employment for any reported second jobs is collected for a quarter of the sample—those in the so-called

outgoing rotation groups—and is not collected at all for any additional jobs. Finally, for the quarter of the

sample in the outgoing rotation groups, the monthly CPS collects information on earnings on the main job.

Except for the information on disability status, which has been collected since June 2008, all of these data

are available on a consistent basis beginning in 1994, the year of the most recent major CPS redesign.

           The Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) supplement that is administered each spring to CPS

households collects information for the preceding calendar year. Respondents are asked about the number of

weeks during the year worked by each member of the CPS household, the number of jobs each household

member held during the year, and the industry, occupation and type of the longest job. 19 These data allow



19
     Individuals who hold two jobs simultaneously rather than in sequence are instructed to report holding just one job.
                                                                                                              39 | P a g e
the longest job held during the year to be categorized as wage and salary, self-employed incorporated, self-

employed unincorporated or unpaid. In addition, the CPS-ASEC supplement contains questions about wage

and salary income and business income received during the year, whether from the longest job or from other

jobs. The data on business income from employment other than the longest job combine profits from

incorporated and unincorporated self-employment. We use the responses to these questions to construct a

self-employment indicator that equals one if a person is classified as self-employed unincorporated on their

longest job and has positive self-employment earnings or, if the longest job was not unincorporated self-

employment, has positive self-employment income on a job other than the longest job. Data from the CPS-

ASEC supplement are available beginning in 1962.

        Although we do not know whether self-employment earnings on a job other than the longest job are

from incorporated or unincorporated self-employment, we expect most self-employment outside of the

longest job to be unincorporated self-employment. We cannot look at this directly, but have looked at data

from the monthly CPS that, for those in the outgoing rotation group, captures class of worker both for the

main job and for any second job. Using these data, we identified people who were self-employed

unincorporated on their main job or were either self-employed incorporated or self-employed unincorporated

on a second job. Consistent with our prior that secondary incorporated self-employment is relatively rare,

only about 2 to 3 percent of those categorized as self-employed according to this definition were so classified

because of a second job that was reported to be incorporated self-employment.

        The American Community Survey (ACS) is a Census Bureau survey with a very large sample that

represents the U.S. civilian population. For each household member age 15 years or older, the ACS asks

whether the person worked for pay during the prior seven days (“last week”). For those who are reported to

have worked, additional questions collect information about the main job held during the reference week—

the industry and occupation of the work and whether the person was a wage and salary worker, self-

employed with an incorporated business, self-employed with an unincorporated business, or an unpaid

family worker. The ACS also requests the total amounts of employee compensation and self-employment

income earned by each household member over the prior 12 months. These data could in principle be used to

                                                                                                   40 | P a g e
construct an earnings-based measure of self-employment activity. Because the questions on the ACS do not

ask separately about income from the longest job versus income from other jobs, however, the resulting

measure would encompass everyone reporting income from either incorporated or unincorporated self-

employment. ACS estimates of self-employment on the main job last week are available from 2005 through

the present. Although some ACS data were collected beginning in 2001, the survey was not fully

implemented until 2005 and that is the first year for which published estimates are available.

        Tax data on self-employment. The Master Earnings File (MEF) maintained by the Social Security

Administration (SSA) is one source of administrative data on self-employment earnings. The MEF includes

information on each W-2 a person received for calendar years from 1978 onward, including the earnings

reported on the W-2 and the employer from whom those earnings were received, and on the total self-

employment earnings in each of the same years reported on a Schedule SE filed by the taxpayer. A Schedule

SE is required of sole proprietors, general partners and farmers with gross self-employment earnings above a

defined threshold that effectively has been set at $433 over the period covered by our analysis. More than

85% of Schedule SE filers are sole proprietors (Jackson, Looney and Ramnath 2016). The MEF records are

not public, but an extract called the Detailed Earnings Record (DER) covering all linked CPS-ASEC and

SIPP respondents for whom there is a Protected Identification Key (PIK) has been provided to the Census

Bureau for specified statistical uses. The latest extract delivered to the Census Bureau for the CPS-ASEC

sample contains information on MEF earnings for 1978 through 2012 for individuals in the 1997 through

2013 CPS-ASEC samples, from whom survey information referencing the years 1996 through 2012 was

collected.

        The Census Bureau’s Business Register (BR) is the master business list that the Census Bureau

maintains for use as a sample frame for all of its business surveys as well as a source that is tabulated directly

to produce a variety of business statistics. The BR is based primarily on administrative data from business

income and payroll tax returns. It includes records for both employer and nonemployer businesses. Each

record on the file is assigned a detailed industry code. Employer businesses are those with positive payroll in

a year while nonemployer businesses are those with qualifying business revenue but no paid employment. As

                                                                                                     41 | P a g e
stated on the Census Bureau’s website, “most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating

unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal

source of income.” To be included in the nonemployer universe for tabulation, other than in construction, a

business must have at least $1,000 in gross revenue (in construction, the threshold is at least $1 in gross

revenue). Businesses with more than some maximum amount of annual revenue are excluded from the

nonemployer universe on the grounds that businesses with revenues over the threshold amount are likely to

have employees and thus to appear on the list of employer businesses. The upper revenue threshold is

determined based on the business’s legal form of organization (sole proprietorship, partnership or

corporation) and industry. Information about payroll and other business costs also is recorded in the BR.

Published data on nonemployers are available beginning in 1997 and statistics broken out by legal form of

organization have been produced since 2004.

        The Form 1099-MISC also contains information relevant to assessing trends in self-employment

income. This is the tax form used by businesses to report payments of non-employee compensation.

Applicable regulations require that a Form 1099-MISC be filed by business payers when non-employee

compensation paid to any source equals or exceeds $600 over the course of a year; applicable amounts are

recorded in Box 7 of the form. One complication is that a Form 1099-MISC may be issued either to an

individual (using an SSN) or to a business (using an EIN). Further, the dollar amounts reported on the Form

1099-MISC are gross payments rather than the net amounts earned by the recipient after expenses.

Individuals or businesses performing work for a homeowner rather than for a business will not receive a

Form 1099-MISC. Staff at the Department of the Treasury have compiled counts of the number of

individuals and the number of businesses receiving Form 1099-MISCs that had positive amounts reported in

Box 7, Non-employee Compensation, for each year from 2000 through 2012. These counts are available

from U.S. Department of the Treasury (2015), but as of this writing have not since been updated.

        To calculate a self-employment rate – the share of workers who are self-employed – a measure of the

total number of workers is needed to serve as the denominator. The denominators for the monthly CPS and

the ACS measures are estimates of the number of people employed during the survey reference week based

                                                                                                     42 | P a g e
on the same survey. For the two CPS-ASEC measures, the denominator is the estimated number of people

with any work activity during the year in question, again based on the same survey. The denominator for all

of the measures based on administrative data is the estimated number of people with any employment during

the year based on the earnings captured in the DER.

           A complication is that we do not have DER data for 2013, 2014 or 2015. For those years, we

projected the 2012 DER employment estimate forward using the ratio of annual average employment from

the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly payroll survey (formally, the Current Employment Statistics survey)

for the year in question to 2012 annual average payroll survey employment. Over the years from 1996

through 2012, the annual percent change in employment estimated using the DER and the percent change in

annual average payroll survey employment have a correlation of 0.89, and the two series also had a similar

mean annual growth rate (0.72% for the payroll survey and 0.76% for the estimate of employment based on

the DER). The similarity in the two series’ behavior over the 1996 to 2012 period gives us reasonable

confidence that the DER employment values we project for 2013 through 2015 should be approximately

correct.

           Linked Household Survey-Administrative Data File. Individuals in our linked household survey-

administrative sample were members of a household for which a CPS-ASEC interview was conducted in at

least one year between 1997 and 2013. In each case, the reference period for these interviews was the prior

calendar year, meaning that information was obtained for the years 1996 through 2012. These CPS-ASEC

individuals were linked to W-2 and Schedule SE earnings information provided to the Census Bureau by the

Social Security Administration (SSA) in the form of the Detailed Earnings Record or DER, the previously-

mentioned extract from the Master Earnings File or MEF. This linking was performed using the Protected

Identification Key (PIK), which is a replacement for the SSN.

           One complication in creating the linked file is that the PIK is missing for 20% to 30% of ASEC

respondents, depending on the year. We used propensity score methods to reweight the sample of people for

whom we have a PIK so that they represent the population as a whole. For each year, we estimated a

regression model in which an indicator for having a PIK was regressed on indicators for age group, gender,

                                                                                                   43 | P a g e
race, education, marital status, foreign-born status, state of residence, and whether the person reported being

employed in the relevant CPS-ASEC. We used the coefficients from this model to calculate each individual’s

probability of having a PIK and applied a weight adjustment factor equal to the inverse of this probability to

the CPS-ASEC estimation weight. Individuals with a PIK were retained in our sample regardless of whether

we were able to locate any W-2 or Schedule SE earnings for them in the DER.

        The presence of imputed values for self-employment status in the CPS-ASEC creates another

complication. These values are imputed for individuals representing approximately 20% of the population.

We have replicated our analysis with all of these cases dropped from the linked sample and the data

reweighted using propensity score methods to account for the loss of observations that lack directly reported

information on self-employment. Restricting our attention to individuals with directly reported self-

[1] Information returns are required to be filed with the IRS only by certain types of payers and only for payments that exceed certain thresholds. Depending on the
arrangements under which they work, those receiving non-employee compensation could receive a 1099-MISC or, since 2011, possibly a 1099-K.
[2] Schedule E is used to report S-Corporation profits and distributions of patnership income. Some of the latter may be subject to self-employment tax. Unincorporated farm
operators are required to file a Schedule F rather than a Schedule C. Individuals with incomes that are sufficiently low may not be required to file an income tax return.
