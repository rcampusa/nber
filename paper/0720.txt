            Intertemporal Substitution in Consumption


                         ABS TPJC T



     Does a higher real interest rate induce significant post-

ponement of consumption? According to the theory developed
here, this question can be answered by studying the relation
between the rate of growth of consumption and expected real
interest rates. In postwar data for the United States, expected
real returns have declined over time in the stock market and for

savings accounts. Over the same period, the rate of growth of
consumption has been almost steady. The paper concludes that
intertemporal substitution is weak, for if it were strong, the
growth rate of consumption would have declined.

Intrnruction



    The maqnitucle of the substitution between present and future

consumotion induced by chanqes. in the real interest rate is one
f    the centra1 auestjons of macroeconomics. If consumers can he
inucr to        Postpone consumption by modest increases in interest
rat-es, then     (1)    the IS curve is relatively fiat and
crowdjnq_ig an imnortant consideration, (2)              the dead—weight
loss from the taxation of interest is       important,   and (3)   the
hurrin    of   the national debt or unfunded social security is
relatively unimnortant, to name three of the many issues that
rest on the intertemporal substitutability of consumption.
  In contrast to most recent research, this paper attempts to

estimate parameters of the representative individual's utility
funrtion, rather than arameters of the consumption function or

savings function. As Pohert Lucas (1976) has pointed out, there
may not he anything that could properly he called a consumption
or savings function——the relation between consumption, income,

and interest rates depends on the wider macroeconomic context
an* may not he stable over time, even though consumers are

a1wavs trying to maximize the same utility function. The
techniques of thi.s paper are more robust with      respect   to this
kind of instability than are standard econometric models of
consumption and savings.

  rphe   essential     idea of the paper is the following: Consumers
plan to change their consumption from one year to the next by an
amount that depends on their expectations of real interest
                                —2—




rates. Actual movements of consumption dii. fer from planned
movements    by a   corrnletely unpredictable random variable that
       all of the information available next year that was
inr'exes                                                            not
incorporated in the nianning orocess the year before. If
exoectations    of real interest rates      shift, then there should he
a corresponding shift in the rate of change of consumption. The
maqnitue of the response of consumption to a change in real
interest expectations measures the interternporal elasticity of

suhstitution. All of this is set up in a formal econometric

model where the assumptions are formalize and the estimation
techniques rqorouslv justified.
  Over the postwar period, there has been a downward shift in
the expected real return from common stocks and savings
accounts, the investments that presumably set the relevant real
interest    rate for most consumers. Over the same period, there
has been only a small downward shift in the rate of growth of
consnnilDtion. Consequently, all      of   the estimates presented in
this oaner of the interternporal elasticity of substitution are
small.     Most of them are also quite precise, supporting the
strong conclusion that the elasticity is unlikely to he much
above 0.1, and may well he zero.

 1. Theory    of the    consumer under uncertain real interest rates


   The theory      outlined    in this section is based on the work of

Douqilas Breeren (1.977,1979), and a number of other economists.
Consumers maximize       the   expected value of an intertemporal
utility   function,

 (1.1)       ...   +e    (t_l)u(c         ) + p_dtu(c)       +
                                                                 e_d(t+i)u(ct+l)   +

                   et+2)u(ct?            +



For the nurposes of what follows, it                is   not necessary to make
specific assumptions about the market setting of the

  ximizatjon. At one extreme, the consumer could face a full
set of markets in contingent commodities, and then the budget
constraint would say that the sum of all the consumer's demands

for the continqent claims valued at market prices would equal

his endowment. At the other extreme, the consumer could he
Robinson Crusoe, with a single risky investment in a real asset.
Then the budget constraint would              say   that his holdings of the

real asset could never he negative. For a further discussion of
this ooint, see Sanford Grossman and Robert Shiller (1981).

  In any case, one of the many choices facing the consumer is to
snend a little less, x, in year t—l, invest x in one asset, and
soend the stochastic proceeds in year t. Suppose that a unit
investment in year t—l         returns    e    in year t. At the point of
maximum expected utility, the consumer will have thought through
all oossihi]ities of this kind, and expected utility will reach
                                   —4—




a maximum at x=O, so the derivative of expected utility with
respect to x v'iil he zero at that point. Only the terms in
exneote      utility dated    t—l and t participate in this
cac'u1ation, so the      re'.evant      first order condition cn be
wri tten

At x=O,



(1   .            Fti   e u (Ct) = ed u' (Cti)


This     is the precise mathematica]., formulation of the principle

that the marg:inal rate of substitution should equal the ratio of
the :Ptthes of present and future consumption. Under
uncertainty, it is not true that the expected marqinal rate of
substitution should     equal     the expected price ratio (the discount
function) .    Rather, the expected value of future marginal
uti.Jitv multiplied by the stochastic return should equal the

current value of marginal utility. Note that this
"reallocation" condition is the generalization of the

proprsiton investiqated in my earlier paper (Hall (1978)) that
                                —5—




marqinal   utility should he    a trended random walk when real
 intrest rates are constant over time.
  Further progress in translating the reallocation condition

 nto consecuences for observed variables requires assumptions

about th distributions of the random influences. A set of
assumptions introduced by Breeclen (1977) seems a natural

aporoach. First, assume that the real interest rate,
conritiona on information available in year t—l, obeys the
normal r9istrihutjon    with mean r and variance             Because
interest '-ates   as   they are defined in this paper can he
inrlpfinitelv neqative, the normal distribution is a natural

assumption. geconr9, assume that the consumer's rule for

procesinq new information about income and interest rates makes
the distribution of marginal utility log—normal, conditional on
information available last year; that is, log u' (ce) is normal
with   mean m
            t and variance vC
  Because the new information arriving in year t has a bearing
on both the actua1. return to investments maturing in t and on

the consumer's long—term well     heinq   estimated in that year, the
two random variables r and log ii'
                                      (Ct)     will   he correlated; I
will let V       stand for their covariance. Then the random
             c
variable on the left—hand side of the condition for optirnality

of the consumption rule, etut (Ct) ,      is   log—normal; its log has
mean r +      and variance Vt    +V   +   2Vr•        From the rule that
the expectation of the exponential of a normal random variable
with mean m and variance v is                  the expectation of the
left—hand side of the condition is

In ?oqs, i-he condition takes the simple linear form,



(1.7)         r +         + Vr/2 + vc/2 + Vr,c =        d + log u'(cti)


Reca1l that the condition is a constraint on the consumption
ru1e. It may he useful to rearrange it so that those parts
controlled by the consumer are on the left and exogenous parts
are on the riqht:



(1.)         m — log u'(c1)               +   v/2 + Vrc = _ri-   —
                                                                     Vr/2   + d



If the structure of uncertainty is stable over time,
                                                                        Vr,c
V, and d can all he combined in a constant, k:


                —   log   u' (ct_i) = k —
                                                 r
Put another way, the random variable log(u' (c)/u' (ct_i)) is

norma1 with mean 1< -   ri- and variance v.
  The development of the model to this point is the following:

   and ioq(u' (ct)/u' (ct_i)) are bivariate log—normal with means

                   *
                   r,   conditional on information available in year t—l.
The stronq testahl.e implication of the theory is that the mean
of the marqinal rate of substitution is shifted only by the mean
of i-he real interest rate. Information available in year t—l is
helpful n prei5ctinq the marginal rate of substitution only to
the extent that it nredicts the real interest rate. This

testahi.e implication is the )oqical extension of the one derived
in my earlier paper under              constancy   of real interest rates. In
that case, rio variahie known in year t—i should help predict the
marqina rate of substitution.
  The next step in deriving testable implications is to assume a
functional form for the utility function. .Breeden has suggested
the natural choice,



                   u(c)   =   (il/s)
Its   marqinai utility is


i.ll)                  u' (c) =   c"
Here s is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the

reciprocal of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. In the
next section, a more elaborate specification is introduced where
separate oarameters control intertemporal substitution and risk
aversion. I show that the procedure developed here for the
simple additive utility function actually estimates the
intertemporal. elasticity of substitution. The hivariate
                                   —8—




rlation   between consumption and real interest rates does not
reveal anything about risk aversion.
  It is convenient at this point to multiply            the   log of the

marginal rate of substitution by the elasticity of substitution,
s, to Put the hivariate model n the following form: r and

lr(Ct/C1) are    lointly normal with means r and k +               sr,
variances vr and vc   ,   and covariance v,       .   Here I have redefined
k, v, and Vrc so as to eliminate an inconvenient s.
  FinaJy, it will he useful to write out the model in more
standard econometric form, with explicit disturbances:



(1.12)        r =   r     +
                              Ut

 2. flistinj±n intertemnorral substitution from risk aversion




    In this section, I wiLl argue that the regression of the rate
of change of consumption on the expected real interest rate
reveals the intertempor]. elasticity of substitution, not the

coefficient of relative risk aversion. In order to infer

anvt-.hnq about risk aversion, more than one asset must he

considered. The argument proceeds by introducing a utility
function   where separate parameters control risk aversion and
intertempora]. substitution. Consumer optimization gives rise to
exactly the same hivariate model of real returns and the change
in consumption derived in the previous section. The risk
aversion Parameter is not identified econometrically from the

data on the return to a sinqle asset and the rate of change of
consumot ion.

    The utility function is the earlier function raised to a
Power:

I define the intertempora] elasticity of substitution as the
elasticity of substitution between consumption in any pair of
years under certainty; this is plainly the parameter, s. On the
                                      —10—




other hand, I define the coefficient of relative risk aversion
according to its standard atemporal definition applied to the
utility function obtained by inserting a common stochastic level
of    consurnDtion in every year into the function just given. This
is easily seen to he the parameter a. I assume that s is less
than one and a exceeds one.

  Raped on the same loqic as before——that the reallocation of a
unit of wealth from year t—1 to year t not change expected
util4tv——the rea1location condition is



                                                                a—i/s

Then the reallocation condition can he written as

 Suppose, as before, that r and log c are distributed normally
 conditional on               information                      available in year t—1. Suppose
 further that loq                  z is distributed                     normally as well. The   joint
dstrjhutjon of the three variables is multivariate normal with

means r, c, and z,                                 variances                 and v, and covariances

Note that the mean,           drops out       because       it appears on both
sides of the reallocation condition. Collect all of the
constants here into a single constant, k. Then log(c/c_1) is
norma1. with mean k + sr. The               complete      bivariate model of the
observed variahies, stated in the usual econometric form, is



(2.11)           r   =   r + Ut

(2.12)           Joq(c/c1)        = k   + sr +


This s precisely the same as derived for the earlier case where
a =    1/s.    The coefficient of relative risk aversion, a, does not
appear in the loint distribution of the two observed variables.

The coefficient of the expected real interest rate in the

consumption equation s unambiquously the elasticity of
intertemporal.substitution.
  Estimation of the risk aversion                 parameter would be possible in
a multivariate system with the real returns to two or more
assets. Then the magnitudes of the risk premiums together with
the correlations of the returns with consumption would provide
                                —13—




estimates    of   a.




3. Pxpectations of the real interest rate




  To    complete the mor9el it is necessary to relate the
conr94tional mean of the real interest rate, r, to observed

variahl.es known to consumers at the time that they choose

Recall, that r is the mean of the subjective distribution for
the real    interest   rate held by the typical consumer at the time
consumption decisions are made for year t—l.       What I will call
the "conventional specification" for expectations has been
emoloyed frequently in macroeconomic models derived, from

rational expectations and, in particular, underlies the recent
work of Lars Hansen and Kenneth Singleton (1981) on consumption.

The conventional specification says that the mean of the
subjective distribution is a linear combination of observed
variables:



(3.1)        r = xt_ih


anr the coefficients, h, are known in advance. Under this

srecification, the complete model of expectations and
                              —14--




consumption becomes a simple application of bivariate regression
with parameter constraints across the equations.
  The conventional approach to the characterization of
expectations relies on the implicit assumption that the public
has always known the coefficients, h, of the forecasting
equation for the real interest rate. The least—squares estimate
of h embodies information that was not actually available to

consumers, because it comes from a regression with later data.

The fitted value, xih, cannot really claim to he the mean of
the subjective distrihuti.on at t—l because it draws on
information unavailbie in year t—l. As a practical matter, the
problem is apparent in the following way: The    fitted   value,
xt_h, is much   too   good a predictor of actual real interest
rates, especially rates derived from the stock market. The
fitted values fluctuate far too much to interpret them as truly

the means of the subjective distributions held by the typical

consumer.

  A more satisfactory alternative is a formal Bayesian
characterization of the subjective distribution of the real
interest rate. In this view, consumers begin the sample period
with a prior distribution on the parameters of the subjective

distribution of the real interest rate. As each year passes,

they update their subjective distributions to form a suitable

posterior distribution, which then plays the role of the

sublective distribution of the prospective real interest rate.
Within the framework of a model in the form
                                       —15—




 (3.2)          r =    xtih   +
                                  Ut


if   the   oosterior   distribution for b is normal (as well as the

distribution of ut) ,     then r is distributed normally conditional
on          and the theory of consumption developed earlier
continues to aTDtily. The mean of r from this type of model is

much hetter behaved than is the fitted value from a regression.
To keen the Bayesian model simple (with only a tiny substantive

effect) ,   I   wfll assume that the variances of the surprises   ,



arid Vt, are known in advance. In year t—l, the consumer and the
econornetrician have a record extending from 1 to t—l. The

consumer wants to infer the mean, ht_i, of the posterior

distribution of the coefficients governing the real return. If
the surprise in consumption were uncorrelated with the surprise
in the real. return, the problem would he a straightforward one

of univariate Bayesian regression. Suppose that the consumer
started with a prior distribution on b with mean b and precision
matrix P (that is, the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution is P1) .         Then the mean of the posterior
distribution for h after accumulating evidence through year t—l
woud he


(3.3)           hti = (LX'X       +    P)(-—X'r   +   p)

Here X and r are the matrix and vector, respectively, of data

available through year t—l.
  Because the record of forecast errors in consumption conveys
                                —16—




additional information relevant for estimating h, the consumer
an9 the econometri.cian actually face a problem in bivariate
Ba'esian reqression.         Let W he a matrix consisting of two

co1umns, the first a constant and the second the history of
vaues   of   the mean of the posterior distribution for r in past
years. Then define

can then compute the mean of the subjective distribution as

This number then becomes data for re—restirnation next year and

each subsequent year.

  The following intuitive summary of the econometric procedure
wflJ    provide   a reasonably accurate guide: For each year, run a
regression using data available only up to that year to estimate

the parameters, h. Include the consumer's prior beliefs held at
the beginning of the period in this regression. Compute the
fitted value from the regression and call it rt. This process
wfll yield a complete time series for r*. The very last
regression will also provide the econometrician's best
                                        —18—




-9escriotion of information about both the process generating

real returns and the response of consumption, provided that the
econometrjcian also holds the same Drior beliefs as the
consumer.

     Because the econometrician usually presents just            the   sample
evidence, not the osterior distribution incorporting prior
beliefs,       it    is   also   useful to re—estimate at the end   with
conventional hivariate regression, but using the same series for
r*   .    The re—estiiation gives sample evidence conditional on the

va'idity of the characterization of the prior beliefs of
consumers at the heginninq of the sample. In what follows, it
is       important   to distinguish between the prior beliefs attributed
to consumers and those which the econometrician might hold. The
puroose of Bayesian analysis here is to generate a reasonable
series for expected real interest rates, not to impose anyone's

prior heiefs about parameter values. In particular, at no time
is any informative prior placed on the parameter of highest

scientific interest, the intertemporal elasticity 2
substitution.             Toreover, the more informative is the prior on
the coefficients, h, the less precise is             the   derived information
about the elasticity.

Data



 Following       are brief definitions of the data series used in
this   stud'i:




 Ct:     real consumption of nondurahies (not including services)
         in the fourth quarter of year t, from the U.S. national
         income and product accounts.



         realized real return after taxes on a investment in the

         Standard and Poor's 500 stock portfolio on a random date
         in   the   fourth quarter of year t—l,   liquidated   one   year
         I ater,

                                      OR
         realized real return after taxes from a savings account

        earning the regulated passbook interest rate,
                                     OR
        realized real return after taxes from holding a sequence

        of four 90—day Treasury bills over the year.


 ht: log of the S&P 500 index of share prices, deflated.


        dividend yield of the S&P 500.



 zt: nominal yield of 90—day Treasury bills in the third
        quar ter
                              —20—




       nominal   requlated passbook interest rate in the third
       cuarter



  mt: log of the money stock (M concept) ,        deflated.

  Pt: log of the implicit deflator for consumption of
       nondurables (used as 'eflator for all deflated
       variables)



  Vt: log of :1isposabl e   income, deflated.




  Data are observed annually, hut consumption is measured as the
average flow over a calendar quarter. The       theory   as developed
earlier aoplies to consumption measured instantaneously,

seoarated by a time span of any length. In practice, the time
span should be long enough to permit consumers to assimilate
information and put consumption plans into effect; a year seems
reasonahl.. e from this point of view. Hansen and Singleton (1981)

make use of unpublished monthly data on consumption, which might

offer some further advantages. Again, an annual spacing of
observations seems most harmonious with the theory.

  It is important that the variables used by consumers to
predict real interest rates (hti,
                                     dt_i, z_1,            m_1,
and       he known when consumption dated t—l is determined.
For quarterly series (p and y) I used data for the third
quarter. They are not actually published until about three
                              —21—




weeks into the fourth quarter, but this does not appear to be an
important problem. For m I used data for September; again,
these   are   not published until the first week of the fourth

auarter. The stock market index, h, is puhished essentially
instantaneously, but for the results in this version of the
paper I used its average value over the third quarter. The
timing of the dividend yield series, d, is ambiguous. I used
the value reported by Standard and Poor's for the third quarter,
hut this seems to involve some averaging with earlier data, and

a series with higher predictive Power may be available. For the
Treasury bj1 ye1d, z, I used monthly data for September,
though, again, instantaneous data might he sli.ghtly superior.

For the no&nal passbook rate on savings accounts, q, I used the
value specif3ed in the requlations prevailing at the end of
September.

  After—tax magnitudes were calculated using the effective
marc,inal rate under the federal personal income tax from John
Seater (1980). The fu'l nominal amount of dividends and
interest was assumed to he taxed at this effective marginal

rate. Capital gains and ].osses were assumed to be untaxed, on
the grounds that the combination of low statutory rates,

taxation only at realization, and forgiveness of accrued gains
at death make the effective rate close to zero.
  All data for the study are listed in an appendix available
from the author.

5.     Resu].ts



     Before plunging nto formal econometric results, I think it is
useful to indicate why the data          virtually   dictate the answer
that nervaThs of the the results of this paper, namely that the
'ntertemporal elasticity of substitution is small. Some simple

facts about the data are apparent just by taking averages over
the first half of the postwar period (1952 throught 1965) and
the second half (l96 through 1979):
                           Real return                      Average growth
                                                            of consumption

l96—79            —1.6        —2.0         —0.2                  2.5

All three measures of real returns were lower in the second half

of the era, vet the growth of consumption was almost unchanged.
A very rough estimate of the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution is the ratio of the decline in the rate of growth
of consumi,tion (0.4 percentacie points) to the decline in the

real return (12.8 percentage points for the stock market, 3.5
points for passbook savings, and 1.5 points for Treasury bills).

These ratios are 0.031, 0.114, and 0.270, actually quite close
to what emerges from formal econometric analysis.

The stock market

   some experimentation        with univariate prediction equations for
the real return to common stocks suggested that the following
variables    har suhstntial value in            predicting the return: the
d.vtdend    yield          a dt2) ,       the    change in the stock price
index (htiht) ,          the   rate of inflation                     ,   and the
rate   of growth of real income                         .    I will start by
'iscussinq the resuts of estimating the conventional
soecification for the expected real return, though these results
will prove       defective. Applying bivariate regression to the

equations    for the real return and the rate of growth of
consumption gives:

   =   —0.0 — 4.4          +   10.4 rlt2 — 2.9              t—lt—2 —

                   (fl.005) (0.043)
                    (standard errors are in parentheses)


In the second equation, r stands for the analytical expression
on the right—hand side of the first equation, not the numerical
vaues. Actual estimation was by multivariate least squares
(minimization of the determinant of the residual covariance
matrix) .   The standard errors of the residuals in the two
equations are 0.153 and 0.019 respectively.
                               —24—




  Taken at face value, these results say, first, that there are
irnoortant shifts in the expected real returns in the stock
rnrket associated with variables known in advances         The

hvpcthesjs that all the coefficients on the right—hand side of
the real return equation except the constant are zero is
overhwelmnqly rejected. Although it is       true   that this equation
is the result of an informal specification search, every

can'-'iate in the search revealed an important predictable

element in rea1 returns. Every equation explained at least half

of the variance o r. All agreed that expected real returns in
the stock market decined over the period, a finding that
confirms results reported by Eugene Fama (1980)

  Second, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, s, (the
coefficient of r in the consumption equation) is estimated
quite precisely to he small. The 95 percent confidence interval
incJurles values of s only up to about 0.05.

  Table 1 gives the actual and fitted values for the real return

and the rate of growth of consumption, and shows clearly the
problem with   the   conventional econometric model of expectations
¶1hen apoHed to a variable like the realized one—year return to
common stocks. Although the equation for the real rate includes
onv fi.ve variables, its fitted values manage to pick up an
astonishinq amount of the actual variability of the left—hand

variable. The equation correctly signals the stock market

breaks of 1962, 1966, 1969, 1973—74, and 1977. An investor who
had access to this equation throughout the period could have

earned an outrageous return from a suitably leveraged position
based on the equation. But this is only a variant of the

trivial ohservation that perfect foresight will make any

investor infinitely rich. The rule itself embodies a lot of
foresight.

     The expected real return inferred from the conventional

snecification of expectations is excessively and implausibly
volatile. Armed only with the evidence actually available in
each year, nobody would      predict   as wide fluctuations as appear
in    the   fitted values for the real return in Table    1.
Correspondingly, the finding of a small coefficient when the

fitted value is the right—hand variable in the consumption

equation is no surprise. Ry the standard argument of errors in
variables, a noisy right—hand variable receives a coefficient
that is biased     toward zero. Nonetheless, a good deal of
investigation suggests that the true coefficient of the expected
real return in the consumption equation is small, even though
the standard econometric technique very clearly uses an estimate

of the expected real return that is badly contaminated. In the

first place, the simple manipulation reported at the beginning
of this section is quite robust, though inefficient. In the
standard econometric framework, it amounts to the use of a
single time dummy as the only predictor in the equation for the
rea! return. Because of its simplicity, it is much less likely
to introduce excess variation into the predicted real return.

  The Bayesian characterization of the subjective distribution
of the real return is the most promising way       to   enforce

 reasonable behavior on the key variable, r .        Relative   to the
conventional specifl.cation, it has two       favorable
characteristics. First, it does not attribute perfect foresight
to consumers. They are viewed as forminq the subjective mean,
       oureiv from information available at the time. Second, it
provides a way       to   make consumers mildly skeptical of strong but
largely untested relations between observed variables and

predicted real returns. Consumers are viewed as thinking that
larqe coef ficients in h are unlikely. As it happens, estimates
                                                          *
of    s derived from the more reasonable series for r emerging
from the Bayesian specification confirm the finding of a very
small vaue of s.
     I assume that the public believed that the expected real
return in 1953 was five percent, and that this value was

unaffected by any variable known in advance. In terms of the

parameter vector, h, the mean of the public's prior distribution
3.5 (.15,    0, 0,   0, 0, 0).   I characterize the precision of their
beliefs     in   terms of a diagonal precision matrix, with diagonal
eJements of the form,



(5.1)            (l,lO0,l00,lO0,i.00,100)p2

The overall precision is controlled by the parameter p——high

values of p indicate profound skepticism about large values of

the coefficients, h. I note again that no informative prior is
placed on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, s.
  For simplicity, I assume that the residual covariance matrix
                                      —28—




was known to the public from the start; I take it to be


                              .0243            .00248
             V           =
                     v        .00248
                                               .000384J

The procedure, then, is to comPute the bivariate formula for the

posterior mean of the coefficients, b, for each year, and then
to comnute the mean of the subjective distribution for the real
                 *                      *
return,      r .
                            •
                     The series for r       is the only thIng that is saved
from the computations for each year. Then the bivariate system
is estimated once again without any informative prior
distribution                                              *
                     on b, tre:ing the series for r as data.
     Table   2    presents the series for r* obtained by this technique
for three values of the precision parameter, p: 3, 1, and .01.
Of these, the most reasonable seems to be the column for p=1.
It    is very much smoother than the predicted            value from the least
squares results in Table 1. Even though the public is viewed as
thinking that 5 percent is the likely return as of 1953, in 1954
they    have been persuaded by unfavorable experience to lower
their expected return to 1.8 percent, but then very favorable
returns raise the posterior mean above 10 percent through 1957.
From 1959 through 1966, expected real returns remain between 9
and 11 percent. Then the subjective mean declines modestly
until   the      debacle of 1973—74, which      persuades the public that
expected         returns have dropped to 4 or 5 percent.

   The results for the consumption equation, using the r* from
 Table 2, with the precision parameter, p, equal to 1, are



       lo(c/c1) = .033        —   .075
                        (.008) (.083)


The equation for the rea. return was estimated joint.ly, but only

because of the covariance of its residuals with those of the

consumption equation, so I will not trouble the reader with the
parameter estimates for the real return equation. The switch to
                                    *
a more reasonable series for r only Strengthens the conclusion

that s s very sma]. Note that the estimate is quite precise.
I should emphasize that no informative prior has been placed on
                                    *
s, onJy on the parameters of r

  The prior distribution in this analysis is not a statement
about the investigator's beliefs, as in the usual application of

Bayesian analysis. Rather, it summarizes what the public
believed in 1953 and so presumably is related to sample evidence

from earlier years. The conclusion about the low value of the

intertem!,oral elasticity of SUhStjttj is not sensitive to the
precision of the prior. With the precision increased by a
factor of 3 the coefficient on
                                    r*t in the consumption equation
becomes slightly, hut   not   significantly, negative. With the
precision decreased by a factor of 100, the coefficient is 0.044
with a standard error of 0.051. The more informative is the
prior, the smoother is the r*t series and the higher is the
                               —31—




 standard error of the elasticity,    S.    But all results agree on
 the low va'ue of s.




 Sav.ngs accounts




  A surprisinci1v large volume of household wealth is held in the
form of savings accounts, so it is relevant to examine the

relation between their real return to and the rate of change of
consur1pton. Recall    that   the basic relation derived at the
beginning of the paper applies to each asset when consumers face
numerous alternative means for holding wealth. For savings
accounts much the same conclusion emerges as for stocks:         By any
reasonabje measure, anticipated real returns have declined

substantially over the past thirty years, while the rate of
growth of consumption has remained almost constant. These two
facts are consistent only with a low elasticity of intertemporal
suhtitutj.
  l3ecause the nominal return to savings accounts is tightly
regulated and changes infrequently by      small   amounts, the main
problem in predicted real returns is predicting inflation.

Lagged nominal variables, particularly the money stock and
lagged inflation, might seem logical candidates for predicting
                                   —32--




the   real return,   and   this   indeed turns out to he the case. The
laqqed change in the nominal value of common stocks also emerged
as a useful predictor over the whole sample. Because the real
return to savinqs accounts fluctuates relatively little, the
i,rohlem of   wild reqression      coefficients and implausibly good

predictions hardly    arises in this case. Table 3 shows the
actual and    expected real return for the same prior distribution
used for the     stock market, but with the precision parameter, p,
set to .001. 'he      ecuation     relating the change of           consumption   to

the   expected   real interest rate          is

       lo(c/c1)        =   O.02   + 0.039
                           (0.004) (0.175)



Again, the estimated value of the interternporal elasticity of

substitution,    s, is close      to   zero       and is reasonably precise.
Because there has    been rather less variation in expected real
returns to savings accounts,           the   standard     error of the estimate
of s is considerably larger,           hut still, the confidence
probability that     s exceeds     0.2     is only     about 15   percent.

Treasury hiil.s




  Direct hoi eho r ownership of short—term marketable
instruments ike Treasury hills has been common since the
mr—lqcOs•     Aqain, the relation between thei.r expected real
return an-I the rate of qroith. of consumption should reveal
somethinn      bout the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

However, as Euqene Fama (1975) pointed out, the expected real
return to Treasir' hills has been close to a constant. Unlike
other forms of consumer assets, there has not been a pronounced
decline in the real earninqs of Treasury hills. Consequently,
the estimate of s derived by a7plying the techniques of this
paper is biqhlv imprecise. Some predictive power was found for
the money stock, laqqed one an'-' two        years, the lagged rate of

inFlation, the laqged nominal return on Treasury bills, and the

laqqed   rate   of growth of real income. With a prior mean of 1
percent in      1953 and   the same precision matrix as before, with

p=.0l,   the    estimated relation is



         loq(c/c =           0.023 + 0.59
                           (0.00) (0.54)



These results do not contradict the earlier findings of low
values of s, hut      they   do not support them either. The    evidence
from Treasury hills simply does          not shed any light on the   issue
                                     —35--




 of    intertemporal substitutihility.




0onr1 us ions


     One cannot     errerqe   from this study of the evidence thinking
that            of non iur3 es is a major source of
        consurnnt

intertenpora substitution and therefore part of the explanation
of the ups an downs of real output. This is exactly the
onnosite of the conci usion I reached in closely related work on
intertempora! substitution in labor supply (Hall (1980) ) in an     ,


econometric framework not nearly as fully worked out as the one
used here. I an rrepared            to defend both conclusions on

intu.tive, nractica. grounds. People are quite willing to work
har- this year an take it easy next year, in response to a
modest incentive from rea1 waqes and real interest rates. They
recTuire much     Thrqer      incentives to eat and drink more than usual
this year arid      less   than usual next year. whatever cyclical
fluctuationstake olace in consumption of nondurables (and they
are ver weak) rohah1y cannot he attributed to the
ir1tertempora       substitution effects featured in modern theories
of    equilibrium business cycles. In fairness to the proponents
of such theories,             don't think that intertemporal substitution
in consumption has been given much of a role. The evidence of
this paper sugqests we        should stick   with the labor supply side
of household preferences in equilibrium explanations of
f' ctuat ions.

  I ian     i   searate    paper on some of the macroeconomic
impl ictions of low        intertempora    substitutability of
consumption, sol will         confine   myself to two     brief   comments.
First, the substitution elasticity controls the speed of

convergence of the simple general equilibrium model to its
steae9v state. If the elasticity is zero, then convergence never

occurs——the lonq—run state of the economy depends on its initial
conitions. The simple          idea   conveyed by   the   model with positive
substitution that eventually the economy moves to a point where
the marqinal product of capital equals the rate of time
preference does not appl'7 when the elasticity is            zero.     It is
virtuaUy irrelevant with very low but positivevalues of the

elasticity,     because    convergence can take thousands of years.

  Second, the strength of the intergenerational redistribution

effects of the national, debt or unfunded social security,

debated recently by Robert Barro (1976) and Martin Feldstein

(1976) ,   deend   on the elasticity of substitution. Of course, as

Barro points out,     if   families hehave as single individuals with

infinite lifetimes, redistribution among generations is
meaningless. But if the economy contains isolated individuals
with finite lifetimes, then the elasticity of substitution

governs the extent to which redistribution of consumption within

lifetimes offsets the government's attempt to redistribute
consumption across aenerations. With low substitution,
