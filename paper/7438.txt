Making the French Pay: The Costs and Consequences
of the Napoleonic Reparations
Eugene N. White
NBER Working Paper No. 7438
December 1999
JEL No. F34, N13, F41

                                             ABSTRACT


        Reparations as an instrument of international peace settlements were abandoned after the failure
of Germany to pay its post World War I indemnity. However, reparations played a useful role in the
construction of earlier peace treaties. This paper examines the payment of reparations by the French after
the Napoleonic Wars. By most measures, these reparations were the largest ever fully paid; and they
imposed a high cost on the economy in terms of lost output and consumption and diminished capital stock.
The incentives to pay were appropriately set and payment permitted France to be accepted once again as
an equal among the great powers.
