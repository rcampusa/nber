The Effect of Post-and-Hold Laws on Alcohol Consumption

NBER Working Paper No. 21367

JEL No. I18

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the effects of post-and-hold laws on alcohol consumption and price. Post-and-
hold laws require alcohol wholesalers to provide a list of prices to the state, which can be reviewed
by retailers, competitors and the public. These laws were generally enacted at the end of prohibition
with the intention of limiting alcohol consumption by raising prices. The laws may also have the
unintendedconsequence of protecting small retailers. Recently, several large retailers have argued
in court thatthese laws are counter to the Sherman Act, which limits anti-competitive behavior. This
paper followsthe recent paper by Cooper and Wright (2012) and adds new data and new statistical
tests. Both difference-in–differencemodels and synthetic control models are employed. The estimation
results provide no persuasive evidence of an effect of post-and-hold laws on the consumption of either
beer, wine, or spirits. There is also no persuasive evidence that the laws increase the prices of these
products. One possible explanation of this null effect is that the wholesale markets for alcohol are
so highly regulated that post-and-hold laws have no discernable marginal effect. The empirical
results presented in this paper do support alcohol excise taxes as effective means of reducing alcohol
consumption.

1. Introduction

         Alcohol is the third-leading cause of preventable mortality in the United States (Mokdad,

2004). This mortality includes deaths from liver cirrhosis and alcohol related fatal motor vehicle

accidents. Heavy drinking is also a major risk factor for heart disease and various forms of

cancer (Grønbæk et al., 2000). Alcohol has also been found to play a significant role in non-

fatal accidents, violent crime, poor birth outcomes, marital instability, and unemployment

(Wagenaar et al., 2010). Because much of these costs are borne by the state or by individuals

who do not abuse alcohol, alcohol control is a justifiable goal of public policy.

         Alcohol control policies include restrictions on the sale of alcohol, alcohol excise taxes

and drunk driving laws. In the set of restrictions on the sale of alcohol, one group, which has

been understudied, are laws governing the economic behavior of alcohol wholesalers. The

modern history of laws affecting alcohol wholesalers begins with the enactment of the Twenty-

First Amendment. At that time, many states adopted a system to regulate alcohol sales known

as the License system.1 Each License state has an elaborate bureaucracy, which enforces

alcohol laws and violators can lose their license to operate. Under the License system, firms

can be producers, distributors or retailers but vertical integration is prohibited.2 Many of the

states that chose the License system also enacted a set of laws, which govern the economic

relationship between wholesalers and retailers of alcohol. Morgan (1988) cites the 1933 report

by Fosdick and Scott, which provided the plan for the states to regulate the distribution of

alcohol as prohibition was ended. The goals of the plan were to maximize tax revenues while

promoting temperance.

         The four key wholesaler laws are minimum mark-up laws, volume discount laws, limits

on credit to retailers, and post-and-hold laws. In theory, these wholesale laws have the effect of

protecting smaller retailers. This has an ambiguous effect on public health because it may

increase average prices but it may also increase the number of retail outlets. Each of these

laws is beverage specific. That is, the specific wholesale laws for beer, for wine and for spirits

can all be different. Minimum mark-up requires that wholesalers establish a minimum markup

for each product sold based on the producer’s price. Volume discounting laws require

wholesalers to charge the same price for products regardless of the amount purchased by

retailers. Credit restriction laws limit the wholesalers’ options to provide credit to retailers and

thus raise the cost of doing business to retailers. Post-and-hold laws require wholesalers to

provide a list of prices to the state, which can be reviewed by retailers, competitors and the

public. The hold component requires that these prices be held for a set amount of time (usually

30 days), which allows all retailers the opportunity to make purchases at the same price. The

post-and-hold laws are typically tied to minimum pricing and volume discounting laws. Under

post-and-hold laws, quantity discounts are prohibited and wholesalers are required to provide

the same price schedule to all retailers. Some states also have a formula that maps posted

wholesale prices into minimum retail prices, which prevents retailers from pricing below cost.

Post-and-hold laws reduce price competition among both retailers and wholesalers because the

posted prices are locked in for a set amount of time.

       One reason that the effects of the state wholesaler laws are an important research

subject is that several large alcohol retailers have argued that the state wholesaler laws are in

conflict with the Sherman Act, which limits anti-competitive behavior. This is also a state-

federal conflict since the authority to regulate alcohol is a state prerogative while the Sherman

act is a federal law. A series of court challenges brought by retailers against state

governments have addressed this conflict without any overall resolution to date. In Granholm

v. Heald (2005), the Supreme Court struck down laws in New York and Michigan that allowed

for within-state direct shipments from wineries to consumers, but banned out-of-state

shipments. This ruling established that state alcohol regulations could be in violation of federal

antitrust laws. In Costco v. Hoen (2009), the state of Washington’s liquor laws were subjected

                                                  3
to scrutiny under the Sherman Act. Costco failed to win a court victory but subsequently

succeeded in changing the laws through a voter initiative. In Maryland, a large retailer

successfully sued the state to end post-and-hold pricing system and the prohibition of volume

discounts (TFWS v. Schaefer et al., 2004, final appeal 2009).3 Also, governor Malloy of

Connecticut has argued for repeal of Connecticut’s post and hold law because he believes it

creates excessive restrictions on competition and pricing (Hartford Courant, Feb 13, 2015). In

Michigan, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, has lobbied the Michigan Alcohol Control

Commission to rescind the state’s post-and-hold law as anticompetitive.

           The courts have noted that there is very little research to date on the effect of the

wholesaler laws on alcoholrelated public health. Two reasons for the limited prior research on

alcohol wholesale laws are the difficulty of collecting data on these laws and the limited number

of changes in the laws over time. A study by Ornstein and Hanssens (1985) using data from

1974-1978 finds that post-and-hold laws and minimum markups increased the price of spirits.

Jaeger and Storchmann (2011) conclude that the state alcohol price laws more or less

effectively abolish competition between wine retail outlets, which should increase prices. The

most recent and comprehensive study was by Cooper and Wright (2012) who show that the

post-and-hold laws reduce consumption by 2–8%. However, they find no relationship between

post-and-hold laws and drunk driving accidents nor with underage drinking.

           This paper specifically examines the empirical inconsistency between consumption and

the other outcomes found by Cooper and Wright (2012). Our paper resolves these

inconsistencies and expands the work by Cooper and Wright in several respects. We first

recreate the empirical work on alcohol consumption presented by Cooper and Wright (2012)

and get the same results as they did. Next, we add alcohol consumption data from 2005 to

2012. We also analyze data on beer, wine and spirits prices. Finally, we extend the statistical

work to also include synthetic control models and fix a coding error in the post-and-hold status

of Massachusetts. For alcohol consumption, adding additional years leads to a critical change

in results. We no longer find a significant effect of post-and-hold laws on alcohol consumption.

On the one hand, it is positive that our findings for consumption align with Cooper and Wright’s

(2012) findings for drunk driving and underage drinking. On the other hand, the lack of

robustness with respect to different time windows is troubling. Thus, additional analyses using

price data and the synthetic controls method were added to ensure our finding is not just an

anomaly. All of these new results confirm Cooper and Wright’s (2012) conclusion that post-and-

hold laws do not reduce alcohol consumption or affect alcohol prices. This new evidence on the

ineffectiveness of these laws is important to both the courts and to the states with these laws

because of the increasing pressure to eliminate them. Our research is also important to public

health in that efforts to support these laws are not likely to reduce problems with excessive

alcohol consumption.



2. Data

          The study of wholesaler laws is complicated by both the limited time variation in state

wholesaler laws and the limited availability of historical data. States, which employ a state-

owned monopoly for the wholesaling of alcohol, by beverage type, are not included because the

wholesaler laws relate only to private wholesalers. Two states are monopoly for wholesale

beer, three states are monopoly for wholesale wine and 18 states are monopoly for wholesale

spirits. Data on post-and-hold laws for beer, wine and spirits from 1983 to 2010 were published

by Cooper and Wright (2012) and checked for consistency with the newly published wholesaler

laws in the Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS).4 We used the APIS to extend the sample

period provided by Cooper and Wright (2012) to 2012.

 The data are from: http://www.alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov. The only discrepancy was for Massachusetts, which has
a post-and-hold law. Cooper and Wright (2012) did not include Washington State in their regressions, but did present
Washington State data in a descriptive table. Washington State temporarily dropped their post-and-hold law in 2008
but the court required that it be reinstated.

         The wholesaler law data were merged with alcohol consumption data, alcohol demand

variables and alcohol tax and alcohol price data. Data on beer, wine and spirits and? per capita

consumption of alcohol was obtained from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and

Alcoholism.5 Data is currently available up until 2012. Consumption is reported on the state

level in ethanol equivalent gallons and is divided by the state population that is 14 years of age

and older. The independent variables include measures related to alcohol demand. Data on

the percentage of the population, by year-state aggregate, who are white, married and age 18

or older were included. Also, data on median household income per capita was included. These

data are available from the US Census. Data on the percentage of the population, by year-state

aggregate, that are members of Evangelical or Catholic religious institutions comes from the

Association of Religious Data Archives.6 These surveys are done every 10 years and thus the

percentages between survey dates were interpolated. Finally, information on zero tolerance

laws, blood alcohol concentration laws and the minimum legal drinking age come from the

National Highway Traffic Administration.7 The beer excise tax, wine excise tax and spirits tax

come from the Brewers Almanac, the National Tax Foundation and state-specific sources.8

         Average state beer and wine prices were calculated from American Chamber of

Commerce Research Association (ACCRA, now known as C2ER) data. The ACCRA records

the price of a few standardized items in at least one store in most metropolitan areas across the

U.S. In terms of alcoholic beverages, the ACCRA data collects the price of a six-pack of

Budweiser, a 1.5-liter bottle of Paul Masson/Livingston/Gallo Chablis or Chenin Blanc, and of

750ml J&B scotch. The collection of spirits prices has been stopped in 2004. The ACCRA data

are reported by city and by quarter. Minor adjustments were made to the data to correct for

changes in the survey brands.9 The ACCRA data have been criticized for small sample sizes

and reliance on only one beer product and one wine product (Ruhm, 2012). The sample size

problem was corrected to some degree by computing population weighted year-state average

prices. Sample means and standard deviations are provided in Table 1.

 ACCRA switched beer brand from Budweiser to Heineken in 2000. A state specific correction factor equal to the
1999 price of Budweiser divided by the 2000 price of Heineken was calculated and used to adjust the Heineken
prices to approximate Budweiser prices. A minor adjustment was made in the wine price to correct for changing
brands in a single year and for bottle size.

       A regression analysis of the volume discount, minimum price and credit restriction laws

is not possible because we only have data on these laws from 2003 to 2014 and over this time

period there is no time variation in these laws. However, a descriptive analysis provides some

evidence on the effects of these laws. Figure 1 uses data from 2012 and shows annual gallons

                                                 8
of ethanol consumption per capita for states with zero to four laws. Beer, wine and spirits

consumption data are presented. Typically, states have one or two laws and very few states

have three or four laws. Figure 1 suggests that there is very little correlation between the

number of laws and per capita ethanol consumption.

3. The Empirical Approach

3.1 Introduction

       The empirical goal is to estimate the effect of post-and-hold laws on alcohol

consumption and prices. Policy endogeneity can be a concern when estimating the effects of

public policy. Endogeneity would be a concern if states with heavy social costs of alcohol

enacted post-and-hold laws to reduce this problem. However, the enactment of the post-and-

hold laws reflects alcohol sentiment in the distant past and the recent revocation of these laws

in some states reflects the successful or threatened court cases brought by large alcohol

retailers in the state. Thus, endogeneity of post-and-hold laws does not seem likely to be an

important concern.

       Two empirical approaches are employed. The first approach is a difference-in-difference

model (DD). The intuition behind a DD model is to employ the change over time in states that


                                                 9
have not rescinded their post-and-hold laws as the counterfactual for the change experienced

by states that did abolish their laws. The DD model isolates the effect of the policy change from

the effect of both time-invariant unobservables and from the effect of other events that occur

over the time period by estimating the difference over time between the control states and the

treatment state. One concern with this method is that the choice of control states is arbitrary.

The second empirical approach, the Synthetic Control (SC) method, mitigates this concern. The

key advantage of SC is the choice of the comparison group (Abadie et al., 2010). Instead of

using all available comparison states as the control group for a treatment state, SC constructs a

counterfactual as a weighted combination of this “donor pool” of states. The weights are chosen

to minimize the difference in pre-intervention characteristics between the synthetic control group

and the outcome in the treatment state in the pre-treatment period. Thus, the control group is

selected to provide the best match for the treatment state. To ensure that the synthetic versions

of the treatment state resembles the actual treatment state, both in terms of the pre-treatment

characteristics and in terms of the outcome of interest, Abadie et al. (2010) recommend that

lagged values of the outcome variable should be used as matching variables. Following this

recommendation, 1-year and 2-year lags in alcohol consumption and prices were employed as

predictors. A disadvantage of SC is that only one policy change can be evaluated at a time and

in most cases there are a limited number of donor states which impacts inference.



3.2 Difference-in-Difference Results

       The following DD model is estimated, following Angrist and Pischke (2009):

                          Ystj= θ1PHstj + θ2EXstj+ θ3Xst + ηs + ηt + ηst +μstj    (1)

Ystj is the outcome of interest, i.e. either alcohol consumption or alcohol prices, in state s, at time

t, for beverage type j (beer, wine, spirits). PHstj indicates the presence of a post-and-hold law for

beverage j in a state s, at time t. EXstj is the sum of federal and state excise taxes, Xst represent



                                                    10
other alcohol demand variables, ηs are state fixed effects, ηt are time fixed effects, ηst are linear

state specific time trends and μstj is an idiosyncratic error.

         The key identifying assumption in the DD models is the common-time trend assumption.

That is, trends in alcohol consumption and prices would have been the same in both treatment

and control states had the post-and-hold laws never been rescinded in the treatment states.

Obviously, the counterfactual scenario of no treatment in the treatment state cannot be

observed. However, the time trend in states with and without a post-end-hold law can be

observed. If these time trends are similar, the assumption that without the treatment, treatment

states would have behaved similar to control states is believable. These data for alcohol

consumption and price are presented in Figures 2-7 and suggest that this is indeed the case.

The solid lines represent consumption and prices in states which have post-and-hold laws in

place, the dashed line shows the same time trends for states without post-and-hold laws. Within

the graphs, states are shifted from the treatment into the control group based on changes in

their laws. For example, Delaware rescinded its post-and-hold law for wine and spirits in 1999

and thus is in the post-and-hold group up until 1999 and subsequently in the no post-and-hold

group.

          In Figure 3, which shows the data for per-capita beer consumption, the difference

between the two lines is virtually constant. In Figures 4 and 6, for wine and spirits consumption,

respectively, the time pattern is very similar for states with and without post-and-hold laws.

Figure 2 and figure 6 show that beer and spirits consumption in states that have post-and-hold

laws is higher than in states without the laws although the reverse is true for wine consumption.

Figures 3, 5 and 7 show the time trends for beer, wine and spirits prices, respectively. Again, it

is clear from these figures that there is a common time trend in prices for both the states with

post-and-hold laws and without post-and-hold laws. It is important to note that differences in

levels between what are essentially the treatment and control groups are not a threat to the

identification strategy. The key identifying assumption is that the trends in alcohol consumption,

                                                   11
not the levels, are the same in both types of states. The raw data suggests that this is indeed

the case for both alcohol consumption and prices.

            The DD results for the effects of post-and-hold laws on beer, wine and spirits

consumption are presented in Table 2 and for prices in Table 3. The specifications are based

on equation (1). All regression models were estimated with state level clustered standard

errors, and all specifications included state and year fixed effects. There are three

specifications for each of the three beverages for a total of nine regressions in each table. The

first specification in each set includes only the post-and-hold law, the excise tax and the state

and time fixed effects. The second specification in each set adds demographic variables,

religion variables, drunk driving laws. The third specification in each set adds a state-specific

time linear trend variable. State-specific linear trend variables can help control any correlation

between a change in the post-and-hold law and other trends affecting state-level alcohol

consumption. These specifications parallel those employed by Cooper and Wright (2012).

            The results in Table 2 show that the coefficient of the post-and-hold law is negative in all

specifications although statistically significant in only four out of nine specifications. It is

standard practice in DD settings to test the result of robustness to an inclusion of linear state-

specific time trends. The post-and-hold law coefficients do not hold up to this robustness check,

and are rendered insignificant. These models represent the preferred specification, as it is

conceivable that there are idiosyncrasies that change within states over time. Such

heterogeneity in trends is then accounted for by including state-specific time trends. Problems

associated with including linear state-specific trends, such as endpoint bias or extreme state-

specific one-time events associated with alcohol consumption/prices, appear to not play an

important role in the data at hand.10

            In the preferred models with state-specific time trends, the effect of post-and-hold is

negative for wine and spirits and marginally statistically significant. Cooper and Wright (2012)

reported highly significant effects that are about twice the size but only employed data from

1983-2004. To examine the discrepancy between their results and our results more carefully, a

10
     Wolfers (2006) describes the problems with state-specific linear time trends in detail.

                                                             14
set of regressions using the same data, but with the sample period limited to 1983 to 2004 were

also estimated. These regressions produced the same results as reported by Cooper and

Wright (2012). Thus, the results are not robust with respect to the length of the post-change

sample period. Overall, the DD results provide some evidence for the notion that post-and-hold

laws result in lower alcohol consumption.

         The results presented in Table 2 for beer and spirits indicate that taxes have a significant

and negative effect on consumption. The average tax per gallon of beer is 74 cents per gallon

and the estimated tax elasticity for beer is about -0.15, which is consistent with past studies

(Dave and Saffer, 2008). The average spirits tax is $16.63 per gallon and the estimated spirits

tax elasticity is thus about -0.32.11

         Table 3 presents the results for the effects of post-and-hold laws and excise taxes on

beer, wine and spirits prices. Post-and-hold laws should raise prices but all of the coefficients

for post-and-hold are negative and three even are marginally significant. However, in the

specification including state-specific time trends, none of the post-and-hold coefficients is

significant. There is, therefore, little evidence for the notion that post-and-hold laws increase

prices. On the other hand, excise taxes are positively associated with prices in Table 3. The

point estimates are significant in seven out of nine specifications and generally robust to the

inclusion of time-specific trends. The estimated sizes of the pass-throughs for beer, wine and

spirits, respectively are 0.6, 1.4 and 1.5. These values as consistent with previous studies and

indicate limited competition in the wine and spirits markets. This consistency of the tax results

across studies also add credibility to these models and suggest that the results for post-and-

hold laws are also valid.




11
  The limited published data on the spirits tax elasticity suggests that it is larger in absolute value than the beer tax
elasticity.

3.3 Synthetic Control Results

       Additional statistical testing for an effect of the post-and-hold laws is warranted partially

because the DD results were not robust with respect to the length of the post-change sample

period. SC can be employed when there is a single policy change and a sufficient amount of

pre-intervention data to create a good control group. There is sufficient pre-intervention

consumption data available and with some exceptions sufficient price data. In order to construct

as good a match as possible, we always use all available pre-treatment years, as is common

practice. If the post-and-hold law has an effect, there should be substantial post-treatment

differences between the treatment and the synthetic control group. These differences are

measured as the mean square prediction error (MSPE) or, in order to better account for outliers,

the square root of the mean squared prediction error (RMSPE). The effect of the treatment is

evaluated by the ratio of the post-treatment RMSPE to the pre-treatment RMSPE. The pre-

treatment RMSPE tends to be relatively small since the synthetic control state is designed to

resemble the treatment state during that time period. A relatively large RMSPE in the post-

treatment period, which is defined as the three years following the law change, is evidence that

the intervention had an effect.

       The significance of the estimated treatment effect can be gauged through a set of

falsification tests, termed placebo tests. Each state in the donor pool is tested as if it were the

state with the treatment. Because the intervention never actually occurred in donor pool states,

the RMSPE-ratios should be much smaller than the true treatment state ratio. If, however, the

RMSPE ratios instead resemble those obtained from the true treatment state, then this is a

strong indication that the intervention had no effect. Thus, the placebo tests provide a

distribution of RMSPE ratios, and the RMSPE ratio of the true treatment should be located in

the upper tail of this distribution to conclude that the intervention had an actual effect.

       Abadie et al. (2010) argue that a p-value can be constructed by calculating the percent

of placebo ratios that are greater than or equal to the treatment state ratio. This value can be

                                                  18
interpreted as the probability of obtaining an estimate at least as large as the estimate obtained

for the actual treatment state when the intervention is assigned at random. However, when

there are only a small number of placebo tests for a given treatment, the calculated p-value will

be artificially large, biasing the inference towards no effect. Dube and Zipperer (2015) argue

that when there are multiple SC case studies, the data from each study can be employed to

construct a p-value for the set of studies. They provide a table of critical values based on

alternative significance levels and number of case studies. For post-and-hold laws there are

distributional assumptions, which may limit the validity of a group p-value. The graphical

presentation of this significance criterion can be seen in figures 8-13. When the ratios for a set

of SC cases show that treatment state falls within the range of the placebo states, it can be

interpreted as no effect of the treatment.

       Given the data and the requirements of the SC test, there are nine sets of results for

consumption and six sets of results for price. To provide a concise presentation, the results

from the SC tests are grouped into six figures. Figures 8-10 present the results for beer, wine

and spirits consumption, respectively and figures 11-13 present the results for beer, wine and

spirits prices, respectively. In each figure, the lowest horizontal line provides a numeric scale

for the ratio of the post-treatment RMSPE to the pre-treatment RMSPE for all of the tests in the

figure. Each of the other horizontal lines presents the results for a state-specific change in the

post-and-hold law and the results for all the related placebos. The data points on each line are

the ratios for the placebo states and the actual treatment state. Only the treatment state is

labeled and is represented by a square rather than a point.

       Figure 8 shows that for beer consumption all of the treatment states fall within the range

of their own placebos and fall within the range of the set of all placebos. The calculated p-value

is .466, which indicates that changes in the beer post-and-hold laws had no effect on beer

consumption. Figure 9 shows that for wine consumption, all but one of the treatment states fall

within the range of their own placebos. However, all treatment states fall within the range of the

                                                19
set of all placebos. The calculated p-value is .403. This indicates that changes in the wine

post-and-hold laws also had no effect on wine consumption. Figure 10 shows that for spirits

consumption both treatment states fall within the range of their own placebos. The estimated p-

value is .095. These results generally confirm the DD results. That is, improving the choice of

control groups by means of SC, still results in no effect of post-and-hold laws on alcohol

consumption.

        Figure 11 displays the SC results for beer prices.12 For beer, Washington introduced

post-and-hold laws in 1995 and has a higher RMSPE-ratio than its placebos. Pennsylvania,

which revoked its post-and-hold law in 1999, also has a relatively large RMSPE-ratio. The

estimated aggregate p-value for this series is .022. Figure 12 shows that for wine, all states fall

within the range of their own placebos. The p-value is .200. In Figure 13, only Delaware is

included and it falls within the range of its placebos with a p-value of .333.13

        Generally, for price, the treatment state RMSPE-ratios fall within the range of the set of

all placebos, indicating that changes in the post-and-hold laws have had no effect. The single

exception is Washington State for beer. However, Washington State is not a large outlier. For

instance, the treatment country in Abadie et al. (2012) had a RMSEP-ratio that was 50% larger

than the RMSPE-ratio for the nearest placebo. This is clear evidence for a treatment effect. For

the largest outlier in this study, this difference is just 12.5%, which is not nearly as conclusive.

Collectively, the evidence suggests that post-and-hold laws have not reduced consumption and

have not raised prices.

  Oregon was not included because the required price data was not available.
13
  Maryland, which changed its post-and-hold laws for spirits in 2004, could not be included as the ACCRA ceased to
collect price data on spirits in the same year.

4. Conclusion

       The primary purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of post-and-hold laws

on alcohol consumption and price. Both DD models and SC models were employed with a 30-

year panel of state level data. The estimation results provide no persuasive evidence of an

effect of post-and-hold laws on the consumption of either beer, wine, or spirits. There is also no

conclusive evidence that the laws increase the prices of these products. These results show

that post-and-hold laws are ineffective in discouraging alcohol consumption. One possible

explanation of these results is that the wholesale markets for alcohol are so highly regulated

that post-and hold laws have no discernable marginal effect. For example, many states use

mandated exclusive territories, which make wholesalers monopolists for specific products in

specific areas.

       The alcohol wholesaler laws, in theory, protect small alcohol retailers. This is difficult to

empirically test because almost all states allow the sale of beer in grocery stores and many

states allow the sale of wine and spirits in grocery stores. Comparisons of grocery stores are

not useful because these stores sell a wide variety of other products. However, a comparison

can be made by limiting the data to wine and spirits and to states that do not allow the sale of

these products in grocery stores. There are only 10 states that fit these criteria. Figure 14

presents the number stores with five or less employees as a percent of all stores by the number

of wholesale restriction in the included states. The number of small stores is about the same for

zero, one and two restrictions. There are no states with three restrictions in this sample and

only Connecticut has four restrictions. Figure 14 shows Connecticut has relatively more small

alcohol retailers than the other states in this limited sample. These results could also be due to

some other unobserved factors in Connecticut.

       The empirical results for alcohol excise taxes are found to be associated with lower

consumption and higher prices, which is consistent with the previous literature. Economic

theory predicts that compared to regulation, taxation is often a more efficient way of internalizing

negative externalities. Regulation can result in income for certain favored groups such as small

retailers while taxes generate revenue for the state. In addition, the price mechanism has

proven to be powerful at changing undesirable behavior. The empirical evidence in this paper

and in other papers confirms these predictions. Taxes are more effective in driving up alcohol

prices and reducing consumption than the post-and-hold laws. Of course, higher prices may not

necessarily be welfare enhancing since most individuals drink moderately and do not cause any

negative externalities.
