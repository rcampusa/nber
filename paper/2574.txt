              Bubbles, Fads and Stock Price Volatility Tests:
                           A Partial Evaluation



                                  ABSTRACT




        This is a summary and interpretation of some of the literature on stock
  price volatility that was stimulated by Leroy and Porter (1981) and Shiller
  (198la).   It appears that neither small sample bias, rational bubbles nor some
  standard models for expected returns adequately explain stock price
  volatility. This suggests a role for some nonstandard models for expected
  returns. One possibility is fads' models in which noise trading by naive
  investors is important. At present, however, there is little direct evidence
  that such fads play a significant role in stock price determination.

     Nearly seven years have passed since the publication of the original LeRoy

and Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981a) volatility tests.     The number of papers

analyzing or developing volatility tests on stock prices has now grown to the

point that a nonspecialist may have trouble getting an even general sense of the

current state of the volatility debate.    This paper is intended to help such a

nonspecialist, by summarizing and interpreting the literature.

     Section I summarizes the techniques and conclusions of some volatility tests

that assume constant expected returns.     Section II considers whether small sample

bias is likely to explain the excess stock price volatility found in most of the

studies summarized in section I.    The presence of near or actual unit root

nonstationarity in stock prices certainly causes substantial small sample bias in

the test in Shiller (l981a), and quite possibly in other studies that assume

stationarity.   Subsequent studies that explicitly allow for unit roots find

excess volatility that is typically an order of magnitude smaller than for

studies that assume stationarity- -but they do still tend to find substantial

excess volatility.    While not much is known on small sample bias in tests that

allow for unit roots, it does not seem that such bias explains the persistent

finding of excess volatility.     Indeed, I present a little evidence that certain

tests that do        find excess volatility have poor small sample power against

interesting alternatives.

     The rest of the paper proceeds under the tentative conclusion that stock

prices are more volatile than can be explained by a standard constant expected

return model.   Section III considers explaining the excess volatility by adding

to the usual constant expected return stock price an explosive rational bubble

(Blanchard and Watson (1982), West (1987)).    For a variety of theoretical and

empirical reasons, this does not seem to produce a satisfactory explanation.

      If bubbles are ruled out, so that any deviations from the constant expected

return stock price are trensitory, these deviations will give rise to predictable

variations in returns.     Section IV considers whether stock price volatility is

adequately explained by some standard models for expected returns.      The evidence

here is somewhat limited, but the answer appears to be no (Campbell and Shiller

(l987b), West (1988)),     This seems to be true at least in part because such

models do not generate sufficient variability in expected returns.

      This suggests that it might be useful to consider some nonstandard models

for   what determines expected returns. Section  interprets "fads" models as
                                                    V


arguing that trading by naive investors creates nondiversifiable risk that
sophisticated investors must take into account (Campbell and Kyle (1986), DeLong
et ml. (1987), Shiller (1984)). It follows that an appropriate model for
expected returns will reflect such trading.      The fads literature is, however,

rather new, end has yet to model risk as precisely as have the traditional models

discussed in section IV.      There is little direct evidence that trading by naive

investors plays a substantial role in stock price determination.       Such evidence

as there is in favor of fads is largely indirect, and consists of negative

verdicts on traditional present value models.       One would prefer a parametric

model, so that the model potentially could be rejected because of implausible

parameter    estimates or painfully large   test statistics.
       I   conclude that the most important direction for future research on stock

                                                              but development of
price volatility is therefore not still more voleti1ty tests,

parametric models to explain the excess volatility that some, including me,

believe to be reasonably well established.       My own sense is that consideration of

fads is likely to he productive.     But someone skeptical about fads models could

                                                                            the
reasonably conjecture that any such models will be in as much conflict with
                                     3

data as are traditional present value models, and that refinements of these

latter models are a more promising avenue for research.

        Before turning to a detailed discussion, it is well to remind the reader

that this is a partial evaluation of volatility tests, in two senses.             First,

space constraints preclude detailed discussion of many relevant issues.              I   give

relatively short shrift to some cf the topics covered in detail in the survey

papers of Gilles and LeRoy (1987b), which focuses on potential problems with

Shiller's (l98la) test, and of Camerer (1987), which discusses in detail how

imperfect aggregation of information can lead to seeming excess volatility of

stock prices.        Second, as a participant in this literature, I am nardly unbiased.

While    I   have attempted to represent all points of view, I have of course

emphasized those that I find most compelling.



I. Overview of Empirical Results

        Table   I   summarizes the results of some volatility tests that assume constant

ex-ante returns.        To make this task manageable,   I   have limited myself to

empirical results that in my somewhat arbitrary opinion could be cast in the form

V/V*, where V measures the volatility of the market's forecast of fundamentals,

V* the volatility of the econometrician's measure of fundamentals, and V/V*>l

indicates excess volatility.         This means that while most of the papers cited

below test a number of implications of the model being studied,           I   will consider

only those tests that seem to me to be similar in spirit to the original LeRoy

and Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981a) comparison of the variance of a stock price

(V) to that of a certain function of dividends (V*).            My sense is that my

self-imposed restriction probably selects from the studies cited below the IBaS

rather than the more striking evidence: the equality tests in LeRoy and Porter
                                        4

(1981) and Menkiw et al. (1985), for example, yield sharper results than dn the

inequality tests reported be low.              Analyses that supply neither new empirical nor

Monte Carlo estimates (e.g., Marsh and Merton (1986)) are ignored in this section

but will be discussed later.

      To facilitate the distussion below of whether inapproprete accounting fur

unit root nonstationarity explains the results of the volatility tests,                   the

papers in Table        7   are grouped according to vhether the test is asympttticslly

valid only under stetionarity, with a unit arithmetic root (APt stationary), or

with o unit logerithmic root (tlog(P) stationary).                    Listings within each group

are alpheberitel.           In Table   I, column (2) gives the sample period.        Most ti the

studies use Shiller's (l981a) long term annual data, which splices Cowles

Commission     data beginning in        1871   to more retent date    from   the Standard and
Poor's Composite Stork          Price Index.      For tonveoiente I will refer to this as

simply   the   S and    F   data. Shiller (l981e) and        West (1988)   siso use the Shiller's
mrdified   DowJones. Campbell end              Sh.iller   (l987b) also use the New York Stork

Exchange   equal and velue weighted indices.     the exception of LeRoy and
                                                           With

Porter, all the studies cited in the Table use annual date, in parr to avoid
dealing with sessonelity in dividends. See the cited papers for addfticnal
detail on the date.
      Column    (3) reports the empirical value of            V/V*,   calculated for a given paper
as described below           The   pvalua in column (4)       gives   the probebilioy of seeing
the   column (3) value for V/V*,            under the null that the model is equation (4)

below and unit roots, if any, take the form indicated in column (5).                    For Monte

Carlo studies, indicated by "Ttsample size" in column (2), the V/V* value is not

tha median but instead matches an estimated empirical value.

       A brief discussion of the models and tests now follows,                  This may be skipped
                                         S

by readers familiar with this literature.                This is intended to suggest the basic

ideas involved, but not to spell out the precise details.                I will slur over

inconsequential differences between the models and tests described below and

those in the papers cited (e.g., whether current dividends are known when price

is set).        Some authors have reported asymptotic p-values for test statistics

other than V/V* (e.g., West            (l8)   reports the p-value for H0:V*_VO,     for V* and

V defined below).         In such cases, I have felt free to associate those p-values

with V/V*, even though the statistic for V/V* would of course be numerically

different.        Detailed references to the sources of the entries in the table may be

found in the appendix.

      The constant expected return model supposes


            =
(1)   Pt        bE(Pt÷i+DtIIt),

where           is a real stock price, b a constant discount rate, b1/(l+r), r the

constant real expected return,

Substituting recursively for '÷1'             t+2'     etc., and using the law of iterated

expectations, gives

The left hand sida of (6), which Blanchard and Watson (1982) calculate assuming

stationarity of dividends, is raportad as V/Vt in line 1.

      Dna of the major problems of the initial volatility tests, emphasized in

particular by Kleidoo (1986b) and Marsh and Merton (1986), was of course the

assumption that variables do not have unit roots.                   Lines (6) to (8) of Table I

suarize      some tests that are appropriate if the nonstationarity results from s

unit arithmetic root.       In such a      case,   the model (4) implies that    and                      are
                                                                              Pt

(Campbell and Shiller (1987a)).          Basically, a unit arithmetic root causes a

linear (but not exponential) stochastic trend in dividends and prices, so

subtracting a suitable multiple of              from

leaves a stationary random variable.            Mankiw et al. (1985) show that as a result

when nT-t, T the last period in the sample.

       Campbell and Shiller (1987a) (line (8)) calculate statistics similar to (6)

and (7), expending Ht to include lagged I' and               D.   West (1988) calculates (6),


       Ht defined as in Blanchard and Watson (1982) to consist of just lagged
with

dividends, but allows for unit arithmetic roots.

       Lines (9)   to   (12) in Table I report studies that have accounted for

nonstationarity by allowing for unit logarithmic roots.                      Kleidon (l986b) and

Shiller (1983) both aasue that        follows a random walk, with
                                                                                         1   consisting
                               log(D)

        The initial tests, in lines (1), (3) and   (4))   of Table   I,   found axtrsme

excess volatility, with the variance of stock prices or thoir innovations

exceeding a theoretical upper bound by orders of magnitude.          The statistical

significance of the excess volatility was, however unclear.          For example, LeRoy

and Porter (1981), using the asymptotic distribution, found a violation

significant at the five percent level in only one of their four data sets.           As is

evident from a glance at the estimates of V/V* for lines (6) on, allowing for

unit roots results in considerably smeller estimates of excess volatility.              It

seems that these initial tests tend to find spuriously large estimates, at least

if unit roots are present.

population variances of    P and       exist,   Even though V/V* can be estimated
consistently, Shiller's (1981a) procedure tends to produce finite sample

estimates that are spuriously high, with the bias likely to be quite pronounced

for the relevant sample sizes.      Kleidon (1985, pp2O-2l), for example, reports a

simulation with a sample size of 100 in which the population value of V/V* is .81

but the mean estimated value    s   2.2.   The Marsh and Mertori (1986) nonstationary

example in which the sample estimate var(Pt)/var(Pt*) is greater than one with

probability one, for any size sample, might be interpreted as simply a

nonstationary limiting case of the biases noted by Flavin (1983) and Kleidon

(1985) (Mankiw et al. (l985)).l

        While the logic of Flavin (1983) and Kleidon (1985) does not apply directly

to the Blanchard and Watson (1982) or LeRoy and Porter (1981) tests, the dramatic

fall in V/V* when unit roots are allowed suggests that similar arguments are

likely to be relevant for those tests.      Indeed, the Monte Carlo simulations in

Mattey and Meese (1986) Indicate that the Blanchard and Watson (1982) procedure

will tend to spuriously find V/V'>1 if unit roots are present but, as in

Blanchard and Watson (1982) (but not West (1988)), are not imposed.         Similarly,

Gilles and LeRoy (l987b, p64), seem to concede that biases similar to those in

Shiller (l981a) are probably present in LeRoy and Porter (1981).

        This leaves open the question of whether these biases are so large as to

explain the entire excess of V over V* reported in the various tests in Table I

Whether they even totally explain the Shiller (l981a) results is debatable.

Shiller (l986b) argues that Kleidon's simulation results (line (2)) are very

sensitive to the assumed dividend/price ratio.      Kleidon allows a range for this

ratio of about 1.5 percent (p-value of V/V*        .50)   to about 4 percent (p-value

.05).    If the empirical mean dividend/price ratio of about 5 percent is used, the

p-value suggested by Kleidon's simulation falls to .01 (line (5)).
                                 10

        Wnile another iteration of the Kisidon-Shiller debate may well suggest that

the p-value uf .01 is too low, it seems to me unlikely that small sample biases

will auffioa to ovatturn the conclusion thet stock prices move more relative tc

dividends than is consistent with the model (4),      I   conclude this fur two

reasons.      First, while there is some conflict among the papers summarized in

Table    I,   thara often are dffersnces in assumptions and approach that suggest why

come tests find excess volatiity while others do      not.    Thesa differences usually

sear to me to argue for the plausibltty of tha tests that find excess

volatility.      Specifically, the "1" and "0" entries in rows (t) and (7)) tand to

result when axpactad returns of less than 4 percent are assumed.           Expected

returns closer to the actual sample mean of about 8 percent result in the larger,

and statistically more significant, figures in these rows.          More importantly, as

documantad below, the K1sdon (line (10)) and LeRoy and Parke           (lna   (11))   tests,

which stand out from the other entries in the Table fot finding little or no

axocas volatility, appear to have poor power against a Shiller (1984) "feds'

alternative (see Gillas and LeRoy (1987b,p45)).      Sinoa   i.t   is just such an

alternativa that has bean proposed as an axplanaton of the results of other

volatility tests (Shillar (1984)), the Klaidon (line (10)) and LeRoy and Parka

(line (11)) results are not persuasive avidanos that the results of other tests

are misleading.

        The saoond reason I think it unlikely that small sample bIases will overturn

the finding of excess volatility is that the other tests in Table I that allow

for unit roots do tend to find violations of the relevant varanoa bounds.              While

thasa violations typically are an order of magntuda smaller than those of the
initial tests, they still ara numerically large. Since these tests directly
allow the (near or actual) nonstationarity that probably Is central to the small
                                      11

sample problems with the pepers in panel A, there does not seem to me to be a

reason to suppose any particular bias.                In fact, while there is of course some

small sample bias in these tests (Mattey and Meese (1986), West (1986,1988)), the

evidence on this does not suggest that such bias explains the excess volatility

that those tests tend to find.             See the entries for West (1988) in Table        I.


       The rest of this section citains a small study of the power of the Kleidon

(line (10)) and LeRoy and Parke (line (11)) tests against a Shiller (1984) 'fads"

alternative, or, more generally, any alternative that generates slowly decaying

deviations of stock prices from the constant expected return price determined by

(4).    Suppose that



(l2)(a)      log(D)     i +    log(D_1) +
       (b)   log(P)     t   + 1og(D) +

       (c)   a     a1 +
                        —
                            N(0,   ,,2),   v — N(Q, 02), Ev          0 all t,s.



Equation (12a) says that dividends follow a logarithmic random walk, as in

Kleidon (1986b) and LeRoy and Parke (1987).               Equations (l2b) and (12c) say that

the mean log price-dividend ratio           t   is   perturbed by the stationary AR(l) random

variable         The Kleidon (1986b) setup is a special case of (12) with                  a
                                                                                       a        0.

In the spirit of O'Brien (1984), Shiller (1984) and Summers (1986), one can

                 as a "fad" that drives the stock price away from the value that
interpret    a
                                                                               2
would result If the data were generated by a model consisting of (4) and (12a).

       The S and P data (1871-1985) were used to calculate point estimates of the

parameters in (12).     The numbers at the foot of Table II result when            j   and

were set to the mean     and   sample variance of        log(D),    r to the sample mean        of

sample estimate of cov(a4./a l)/02 and         oa      (l2)o.         There are several ways to

emphasize that with these parameter estimates, the date generated by (12) are

rather different from those generated by a model with oonstaot expected returns

sod a lognormsl random walk divideod process.            First, a shock to at that pushes

                                                                                   (4   =       =
iog(P)-log(D) from its mean has a half life of nearly foor years
.48).    In the seose auggested by Summers (i986), this can he argood to be a

sigoiticant devistioo from the constant dvtdeo&prtce ratio pcedicted by

Kletdoos (l986b) model.       Second, more than half (57 percent, to he exact) of thu

implied variance of Alog(P) is due to shocks to              a4.   rather than to log(D,J.

Third, the implied standard deviation of the ooe period expected return

                       is quite substantial, about ,05. (The implied uocooditooal
E[(Pt1+D)/PJIti
mean, return is about 1.08).      For any or all of these reesoos, one would hope that

a volatility test would distinguish between data generated by (12) oo the one

hand and   (4) and (12a)   oo the other.

      Consider first the LeRoy aod Parke test.           Computing     var(P/D)/ver(P/DJ
requires estimates of just four momeots: the meao expost return, the variance of

P5/Dt ard the mean cod verisoce of Ot/Ot.          (LeRoy and       Perke (1987)).   But with

the   paraneters   listed at the bottom of     Table   II,   date generated by (12)     will
imply essentially the V/V*     computed   by   the LeRoy and Parke       (1987)   test, sioce
such date imply essentially these four sample moments,                See Table II, panel A.        A

finding of V/V* <I using the LeRoy and Parke (1987) test therefore does not in

di.stingush the model (4) from the alteroative           (12),
      Eveluatioo of the power of the Rleidoo (l986b) test seems to require a Monte

Carlo experiment.     The simulation generated 1000 samples of size 115, with the

presample values of log(P,) and log(D) matched to those of the S and P date in

                                       at
(with a different draw for each simulation).              P    was generated recursively, as in


                                                                           var(P+ /P) were
Kleidon (1986b).          The sample estimates of                    and
                                                      var(P+/P)
calculated in the usual way.             As stated in Table    I, panel B, the estimates     of

                                  m V/V* were less than one for n1,2, more for n=5,            10.
var(Pt+n/Pt)/var(P+n/Pt)
The question is whether the small values for              n1   and 2 are comforting evidence

concerning a model consisting of (4) and (12a).                The answer appears to be no.       In

the Monte Carlo simulations for n=l, for example, only 6 of the 1000 samples

produced a      V/V      greater than   1.   It appears, then that Kleidon's (1986b) test,
                                                                       5
like LeRoy and Parke a (1987), has poor power against this alternative.

        I   certainly do not consider this a definitive statement on the power of the

various tests in Table I, and fully agree with LeRoy and Parke (1987) that

additional study of the power of volatility tests is of great interest                     Nor do I

consider the question of small sample bias completely resolved.                 Nonetheless, for

the reasons summarized above, it seems unlikely to me that small sample bias

provides the bulk of the explanation for the excess volatility reported in Table




III. Rational Bubbles

        Stochastic difference equations such as (1) have a multiplicity of

solutions.       The solution (4) is unique provided that the terminal condition (3)

holds.       But if not, there are an infinity of solutions

               Pt       E(bi+bDt+,!It) Ct
                    a     + C.

             +                         = C.
(l+r)Cti         V,       E(VtjIt1)            C     is   by definition a rational bubble, an

othen4ise extraneous event that effects stock prices because everyone expects it

to do sc.7       Since the solution (13) satisfies the first order condition (1),

expected returns are constant and there are no arbitrage possibilities.

(Rational bubbles are possible with time varying expected returns,                           See Flood and

Rodrick (1987).            i use a constant expected return model for              simplicity.)       The

'f" superscript           on   F   is present because
                                                             P depends only on fundamentals,
       Slanchard and Watson (1982) note that it is possible to have bubbles that

grow and pop          The folluwing example of a strictly positive bubble is from West

(1987)



(14)             =
                      (C   t1 _C*)/mb               with probability   ir



                                                    with probability (1a)

                                          C<m<l, C>O.



The bubble bursts with probability 1-m, and has an expected duration of (l1T)

While the bubble floats it grows at rate (biO5 =                     (l+r)/m   >   l+r:   investors

receive an extraordinary return to compensate them for the capital loss that

would have occurred had the bubble burst.                     Whether or not the bubble bursts can

depend on fundamentals (e.g., ml/2, with the bubble bursting if there is had

news about budget deficits),              A1ternatvely,         whether the bubble bursts or not can

depend on extraneous "sunspots."                    It is possible to have a composite bubble,

consisting of a linear combination of bubbles like (14), with each (14) bubble

having its own       iT    end Ca.    Also,    'a   can vary over time (West (1987)).

       Rational bubbles therefore seem consistent with the recent (1987) pattern of

extraordinary stock price increases followed by a dramatic collapse.                          Rational

bubbles also seem a potential rationalization of excess volatility teats.                             Even
                                  15

if the bubble is uncorrelated with fundamentals, stock prices move more than the

model (4) predicts; if this correlation is positive, so that the market

overreacts to news about fundamentals (Shiller (1984), DeBondt and Thaler

(1985)), excessive stock price movements are even easier to rationalize.

Moreover, this can be done with small or even no variations in ex-ante returns.

The rational bubble explanation was one that I favored in West (1987) and in the

initial version of West (1988) (which, in fact, was initially titled 'Speculative

Bubbles and Stock Price Volatility').        I no longer find this interpretation

particularly appealing.     I   will explain this by first reviewing the theoretical

literature on bubbles, and then discussing some empirical results.

     One immediate theoretical restriction on rational bubbles is that they

cannot be negative.   If
                           C<O and     the stock price is lower than its fundamental,

the possibility of an extraordinary capital gain when the bubble bursts must be

compensated for by a potential capital loss if the bubble continues to float

downward.   Since stock prices must be nonnegative, there will be, for any bubble

process, a low enough stock price that precludes any further capital loss.          Since

such a stock price is inconsistent with a bubble, so, too, is any higher stock

price than can lead to such a low stock price.       8y a backwards recursion, there

cannot be a negative bubble on a stock, because any such bubble leads to an

infeasible price with nonzero probability.

     Are positive bubbles similarly inconsistent with rationality?        In models

where agents have infinite horizons, the answer appears to be yes (Tirole

(l982)).8   Any agent who sells a stock at a price higher than its fundamental can

exit the market, leaving negative present value for whomever buys it.       Bubbles

are ruled out when agents have infinite horizons even if traders have

differential information and if short sales are prohibited (Tirole (1982)).
                                       16

          Positive bubbles are not, however, ruled out in models with finite horizon

agents.         Tirole (1985) stodes this in a nonstochastic, perfect foresight,

overlapping generations model.              Each generation will be willing ro pay more than

fundamental value for an asset, provided the succeading generation is similarly

willing,         It is necessary that the hubble not inflate the stock price so fast

that stock market wealth ends up exceeding GNP (to take so extreoe example).

Otherwise, a backwards recursion will rule out bubbles.                 In Tirole's (1985)

model,      this  that the rate of g:uwth of the economy must he greater than the
                   means
return on the stock. In such a case, the steady state per capita hobble may he
positive.
          While I am not aware of a stochastic cars iOO       of   Tirola' s modal, intuition

suggests (to me, at least) that such a generalization can be accomplished.                     Some

unpleasant issues would, however, have to be handled.               Oibe and Grossman (1987)

note that if there ever is a bubble, ft would have to be present from the first

day of trading: E(OttI,        )   =
                                       (l±r)O.    and
                                                        C nonnegative   means that if

then      cO    with probability one:       Merton (1985) notes that there must be acme

mechanism to limit managerial issues of new stock,

          More fundamentally, one must ask how reasonable is Tirole's necessary

oondt ion thst the mean growth rate of the economy be greeter than the mean

return    the stock price (assuming, again, that titis is a necessary cooditon in
           on
a stochastic version of Trole's model).9 The mean annual real axpost return on
S   and P data 187 14986      is about 8 percent; the mean       growth   rate of real   GNP   i5
about 3 percentJ°          In the case of a     burating   bobble such as iO   (14),   moreover,
the    relevant comparison is probably between one plus the growth rate and (1+r)/m

>   l+r   rather than l+r: one presumably must insure zero probability that the stock

price exceeds the value of national output.              While taxes and so forth muddy the
                                   17

issue, the excess of the mean ex post return on aggregate stock price indices

over the mean growth rate of the U.S. economy does not suggest that Tiroles

necessary condition will apply.         See Abel et al, (1986).

       Is the seeming excess volatility of stock prices nonetheless strongy

suggestive of rational bubbles?         There are several reasons why the answer seems

to   me to be   no.   First, Flood an I Hodrick (1986) argue that at least certa n

stock market tests, including Mankiw et al. (1985), implicitly aliow             rbh ce

under the   null.       Some tests for finite maturity bonds also fird some sidence

excess volatility (e.g., Singleton (1980)), which, if true, cannot be due to

bubbles: there cannot be a bubble on the final date when the bond          -res       and

therefore by a backwards recursion there cannot be a bubble at any 'ar er sate.

One would like to have a common explanation for the excess volati.. tj           thatseems
to be found in these various tests applied to various assets.           te.ond   as

discussed in West (1987), while my tests are perfectly capable of

something that looks roughly like a bubble, they are probably not          abe   to

discriminate between a bubble and "noise" that is almost but not tucte a buoble:


E(CJIi)                      (say) .99 instead of •(l+r) a 1.08.        '"bird, bubbies


suggest that stock prices should grow at a rapid rate.            If dividends grow note

slowly than the rate of return (an assumption implicitly made when          E(IbO+.)
was assumed to be well defined in (13)), the dividend/price ratio should fall and

capital gains should take an increasingly large share of ax-post returns,             But

for the S and P data, 1871-1986, this does not seem to be the case.           The mean

ex-post return in the first half of the sample, 1872-1928, is 8.6 percent             with a

mean dividend price ratio of .053;        in the second half of the sample cbs figures
                              12
are 8.3 percent and .051.

       In sum, theory for rational bubbles is still at a preliminary stage.           But
                                        18

the  theory so far developed suggests conditions for bubbles that are too
stringent to rake bubbles particularly attractive: the growth rate of the econoay
rust be greeter then the return on the stock; eny asset with o bubble rust b±ave
always had a        posittve bubble; factors other than hobbles rust explain any excess
volatility      on   finitely lived assets, and perhaps sore of the excess volatility on

stock    prices as well. In addition, the evidentc for explosive bubbles cc             West

(1987)      is at best suggestve and consistent as well with deviations from

fundsrencals being borderline stetionary.




        A   netursl candidate to explain any excess price volatility is roveaents in
expected returns.           Ynis was of course emong the explanetions    proposed in    soma   of
the    first published comments on           volatlty   tests (Long (1981)). and has been

argued more recently by Flood at al, (1986).               Indeed, the model (4), end

therefore the variance huunde that folloss from it; neqcire only the terminal

condition (3) end a constant expected return.              So if, in population, there is

movements.    Campbell and Shiller (l987c) further find little theoretically

plausible connection between stock prices and their measures of expected returns,

and suggest (p35) that the smaller and less significant estimates of V/V* are

found in specifications that seem to pick up certain spurious correlations.      It

should be noted that both papers allow for unit roots, so that there is no

obvious reason to believe that small sample bias explains the excess volatility.

     Now,    one could argue about the accuracy of the linearizations used, or about

the validity of the models of expected returns assumed in the parametric tests in

Table III, or about how well official consumption data capture the utility flows

really necessary to test the consumption based asset pricing model.    There are

many nontrivial problems associated with the tests just described.    But the

evidence to date does not suggest that traditional models of return determinetioo

successfully explain the seeming excess volatility of stock prices, even in

ronjunction with small sample bias.



flds
     The tentative conclusion that neither rationsl bubbles nor traditional

models of return determination can explain stock price volatility suggests that a

nontraditional model for return determination might be required.     In "fads"

interpretations of the volatility tests, noise trading by naive investors plays a

significant role in stock price determination.    Shiller (1984) and DeBondt and

Thaler (1985) argue that psychologicsl and sociological evidence is consistent

with indiv±dusls following "Irrational" trading rules, overreacting to news.

Poteotslly, this both generates wide variations in expected returns and renders

inadequate traditional models for return determination.

     -One   simple way to think through the possible sffects of fads is to add a
                                  21

factor die to noise trsding to the level or log of whet would he the fundementel

price if expected returns were constent (Campbell and Kyle (1986), Poterba and

Summers (1987), O'Brien (1984), Shiller (1984)),                    Equation (12) is a simple

example of this (though to capture investor overreactoo one might want tIe

This apparently      is the conclusion of some readers              of Sh11er (981a) (e.g.,

Atklay (1983,.
       Another interpretation i5 that while some fractun of tredng is done cy

naive traders, another fraotton of trading is done by sophstioated fnvestnrs who

insure that there are no extraordinary expected returns once risk is properly

actounted for (Campbell and Kyle (1986), DaLong at ci. (1987)).                      This does not

mean that stock prices are driven to whatever level they would be in the absence

of fads.     RIsk is created by naIve investors, whIch suphlstltsted investors must

take into account.       Such risk might not, however, be captured by traditional

models. See especially Dethng at al. (1987), whlth tontains a highly stylized
                              22

model in which nondiversifiable risk created by noise trading causes the prices

of two seemingly identical assets to diverge.14

    There is of course much anecdotal evidence of fads,     including the famous

beauty contest passage in Keynes (1964).     Nore formal evidence consistent with

stories of investor overreaction may be found in DeBondt and Thaler (1985, 1987)

and Lehmann (1987).   These papers find that abnormally high returns can be earned

by following a contrarian strategy of buying stocks that recently have had

relatively poor returns, shorting stocks that recently have performed well'5

See DeLong at al. (1987) and Camerer (1987) for additional examples.

     At a more aggregativa level, a growing number of studies suggest that there

is a significant stationary component to stock prices (Lo and McKinley (1987),

Fame and French (1988), Poterba and Summers (1987)).     This component
                                                                          (a   in

equation (12)) is associated with econometric predictability of stock returna,

using variables such as lagged dividend-price ratios or earn1ngs      The

predictability is particularly marked at long horizons, say, over two years

(Campbell and Shiller (1987c), Fama and French (1987,    1988), Flood at al.

(1986)).

     Poterba and Summars (1987) and Shillar (1984) interpret this as evidence of

slowly mean reverting fads.   But the only unambiguous interpretation of evidence

that stock prices do not follow a random walk is that expected returns are time

varying.   Whether or not the studies just cited imply movements in expected

returns that can best be explained by fads is debatable (Fama and French (1987));

one can trivially define
                           an      equation (12) as simply the log of the ratio of

the stock price (15), with returns determined by some standard modal, to a

constant expected return price.      So evidence of a stationary component   is at best


suggestive of fads.   This applies as well to Campbell and Kyle (1986), a fully
                                 23

articulated empirical study that allows for fads.          It estimates an explicit model

of tradiog by sophisticated Investors, when a residual ooise process affects

stock prices.    It finds that the noise process accounts for over one fourth of

stock price movements in the S and P data, 1871-1984, but does not present any

evidence that this process results mainly from trading by naive investors.

       Traditional present value models (e.g., those discusaad in section IV           are

well enough specified tnat one can potentially argue that theae aodela cannot

adequately explain stock price volatility.        I   do not believe that the same can be

said   for fads models that have bean developed so far.       The   quantItative ev:dence
in   favor of fads aa an explanation     of stock price volatility    a   largely   indirect,
in   the form of negative veidicta on bi1bbLea and on tradItional models for

returns.

       Mora direct evidence on   fads,   and tests of restrictions Implied by fads, may

wall ha forthcoming shortly.      But at present there is littla formal positiv

evidence to sway someone unsympathetic to fads models

Kleidnn (1986b) tests have power against the alternetive that there are slow

moving divergences of stock prices from a constant expected return fundamental

value,

3.   Sketch of algebra:    Let         consist of past   s and v.      Since
                                                                               P1/P and      Ct/P1

are lognormal, and a1 and               are independent, it is straightforward

to show that E{i+Dt)/PtlIt] =                exp[+(Ø-l)at+.5(o2+o2)j'+ expft-ai.             Tha

axpectad return is thus the sum of two lognormal random verables, and one can

grind through standard formulas to compute its vsriance.

4.   My estimate of V/V*   is considerably higher than thet         of LeRoy and Parke

(1987), even though data are quite similar,              This is basically because the LeRoy

and Parke method of calculating             is very sensitive to the estimated
                                var(Pt*/Dt)
value of the following: (mean expected return)1 x (meen value of Dt+i/Dt).                    They

compute this to he .9548,        I   get .9427.   Were I to use the .9548 figure, V/V*

would fall from .63 to .38, much closer to LeRoy and Parke's estimate of .29.

5.    My estimates of V/V* are ootably bigger than Kleidon's (l986b) for n5,              10.


Two   minor reasons   are choice of discount rate (I use         the inverse of the mean

ax-post   return,   Kleidon tries various imposed values) and sample period.            The

ma3or    reason   is that Kleidon calculates var(P÷/P)           and
                                                                       var(Pt÷/P)    by taking
                                25

the som of squared deviations not around the respective sample means but, for

both, around en estimate of     E(P/P).      If I had mimicked his procedure the

Table II value of V/V* for    n10,   for example would be 1.80 rather then 4.18.

Because the sample means of
                                P1/P     e            are rather different, Kleidon's

technique sharply raises the estimate of ver(P+lO/P) end thus sharply lowers

the estimate of V/Vt.      Although Kleidons technique is eppropriate uoder ois

null, it clearly results in substenciel bias under the present alternative.

6. 1 shousd note that the Marsh and Merton .i986l dividend smoothing argument

seems to me to be one of smell sample ties lr.djoen by Ineppropriete treatment of

rnt   roots, as suggested stove.     Marsh ant Metton (1986, p485), however, seem to

suggest cast e desire of osoegere to smooth dividends by itself iovalidetes

volatility compsrisor.s.    This is not correct.   A ksy to the validity of the

variance 'ounds methodoiogy is e stable set of decision rules by market

psrtw:ipants, and a anape large enough for the data to accurately ref leot the

functioolng of thosp   nIce     See Kleidon (1985,1986b).   Note tnat if this key

conditIon is not, any icatistical inference on the joint dynemios of the dividend
process, including tnst in Marsh end .Merton (1987), is not valio. See Shiller
(198lb)   on the related issue of biases that might result when market participants

anticipate events that never occurred.

7. It shoald be emphasized    that throughout the paper, the term "bubble" refers to

the explosive process C.      By contrast, many authors (e.g., Ackley (1983); use

bubbles to refer to any deviation from fundamentals induced by speculation.

8. But see Gilles and LeRoy (1987e), which     apparently concludes that bubbles car

in principle exist in such models.

9. See Abel at al. (1986) for    a discussion of condftions that rule out bubbles in

a stochastic environment.

10. 1 computed this using the figures for GNP in 1875-1985 in Gordon (1987), for

GNP in 1986 in the October 1987 issue of the Federal Reserve Bsnk of St. Louis's

fliflQnQiGILQa.
11. The Mankiw et      al.   (1985) test is, however, likely to unreliable in the

presence of bubbles, even though these are allowed under the null.        Confidence

intervals will be large: in the presence of bubbles, the variance of the Mankiw

et    al.   (1985) estimates is blowing up, for exactly the reasons the variance blows

up in the presence of a logarithmic random walk (Merton (1985)).

12. As usual, there is also potentially a peso problem, where        anticipations of s

never-realized shift in the dividend process can look like a bubble that grows

and pops.       See Flood and Hodrick (1987), Obstfeld and Rogoff (1986), and Smith

(1987).

13. Unlike Shiller (1981a), however, neither West (1988) nor Poterba and Summers


(1987) give any evidence on the accurscy of their linearizations.        West's (1988)

in particular is unlikely to be very reasonable in the presence of unit roots,

14.    It should be noted that in this interpretation of fads, many of the

traditional tools of financial analysis are still applicable, with the presence

of nciae trading an additional constraint facing rational investors.        It

therefore seems extreme to conclude (Kleidon (l986a), Merton (1985)) that we can

allow for fads only by iioring much of our accumulated knowledge about finencisi

marketa.       See Shiller (1986a).

15. Whether these seeming pricing anomalies reflect not idiosyncratic       rak     but

miameaaured nondiveraifiabli riak is, however, unclear.

Notes:
1. A column (2) antry of "Tsample size" indicates a Monte Carlo study rather than an
empirical point estimate.
2. In column (3), entries were rounded down to zero if V/V*<l but otherwise were rounded to
the nearest integer. See the text for how V/V* is calculated for a given entry.
3. Entries in column (4) were rounded as follows: .00 zeans that the reported p-value is
less than .005; .01, between J0S and .01; .05, between .01 and .05; .10, between .05 and
.10; .50, greater than .10.
