I. INTRODUCTION

       How can we explain the short-run behavior of output and

inflation?        Since Fischer (1978), many researchers have sought to

do    so   with   models   that   combine   nominal    price    stickiness   and

rational expectations.        Currently, the most popular models of this

kind are Taylor’s (1980) and Calvo’s (1983) models of staggered

price adjustment.          Unfortunately, recent work shows that these

models fail to fit key facts about the macroeconomy. In particular,

the    models     are   inconsistent   with   the     inertia   in   real-world

inflation -- the persistent effects of shocks to inflation, and the

output costs of reducing inflation (e.g. Fuhrer and Moore, 1995;

Roberts, 1998; Mankiw, 2000).

       In searching for better models, some authors suggest relaxing

the assumption of rational expectations.            They argue that some or

all agents have "backward-looking" expectations: expected inflation

equals past inflation (e.g. Ball, 1991; Roberts, 1997; Rudebusch

and Svensson, 1999).         Roberts (1998) and Fuhrer (1998) show that

the canonical staggered-price-setting model fits the data much

better when backward-looking behavior is introduced.                  However,

backward-looking models were rejected in the 1970s for a good

reason: the Lucas (1976) critique.              While the models fit the

behavior of inflation in the current monetary regime, expectations

are likely to change if monetary policy changes.                     Therefore,

backward-looking models produce misleading predictions about the

effects of policy shifts.


                                       1
      Thus researchers face a dilemma: rational-expectations models

fail to fit key facts, but backward-looking models are subject to

the Lucas critique.         This paper looks for a solution to this

dilemma.       I     propose      a     less-than-fully-rational          model    of

expectations that is applicable to any monetary regime.                            The

deviation from rationality is that agents use only a limited set of

information    to    forecast     future        variables.       Specifically,     in

forecasting      inflation,     they      use    only    the    past    behavior   of

inflation.    They use this univariate information optimally, but

they do not use information on other variables, such as output or

interest rates.      Following Akerlof and Yellen (1985a), I interpret

this behavior as a "near-rational" approach to forecasting that

reduces the costs of gathering and processing information.

      For the postwar United States, my assumption is close to the

assumption of backward-looking expectations.                   For this period, the

univariate behavior of inflation is close to a random walk; thus

lagged inflation is close to an optimal univariate forecast of

inflation.    However, my model does not assume that backward-looking

expectations are a fixed feature of the economy.                  In other monetary

regimes, the univariate process for inflation can differ greatly

from a random walk.        In such regimes, expected inflation differs

greatly from lagged inflation.

      After discussing alternative theories of expectations, I embed

the   theories      in   simple       sticky-price      models    and    test   their

implications. Since the goal is to capture shifts in behavior


                                           2
across regimes, I test the models using data from two different

periods in U.S. history.       The first is the period from 1960 to the

present, when inflation has been highly persistent.             The second is

the period from 1879 through 1914, when the U.S. had a gold

standard.    In that period, the univariate process for inflation was

close to white noise.      As a result, my assumption of univariate

forecasts implies that expected inflation was close to a constant.

     Like previous researchers, I find that sticky-price models

fail badly at fitting the data under the assumption of rational

expectations.      For   the    post-1960   period,     the    assumption    of

backward-looking expectations fits the data well, again as others

have found, but this result does not carry over to the period

before 1914.      Models with backward-looking expectations imply

persistent effects of inflationary shocks that do not exist in the

pre-1914 data.   In contrast to these failures, my new assumption of

optimal univariate expectations performs well for both historical

periods.    With these expectations, sticky-price models fit both the

inflation    persistence   in    the   later   period    and    the   lack   of

persistence in the earlier period.

     The rest of this paper contains seven sections.             Section II

discusses current models of expectations and Section III proposes

my new approach.    Section IV discusses the two historical periods

that I study, Section V describes my sticky-price models, and

Sections VI-VII present the main empirical results.             Section VIII

concludes.

II. INFLATION INERTIA AND CURRENT MODELS OF EXPECTATIONS

     A. The Taylor-Calvo Model with Rational Expectations

     Since the 1970s, most researchers studying inflation dynamics

have used models with rational expectations.                To capture the

interactions of inflation and output, they often assume frictions

in wage- and price-setting.       In recent years, many researchers have

converged on a particular specification: the Taylor-Calvo model of

staggered price adjustment and the "New Keynesian Phillips curve"

that it implies (Roberts, 1995). Goodfriend and King (1997) argue

that the Taylor-Calvo model with rational expectations is part of a

"new synthesis" in macroeconomics, and the model has become a

standard tool for analyzing alternative monetary policies (e.g.

Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997; McCallum and Nelson, 1999).

     Unfortunately, recent research shows that the Taylor-Calvo

model fails to capture a central feature of the modern economy:

inflation inertia.       For the postwar United States, there is strong

evidence that shocks to inflation have persistent effects, and

reducing     inflation    requires   substantial    output    losses    (e.g.

Christiano et al., 1994; Romer and Romer, 1989; Ball, 1994). Recent

authors use a variety of techniques to show that the Taylor-Calvo

model cannot fit these facts if one assumes rational expectations.

For example, Gali and Gertler (1999) show that the model produces a

perverse     Phillips    curve:   higher   output   leads    to   a   fall   in

inflation.    Similarly, Mankiw (2000) shows that the model produces

implausible responses to monetary shocks, with output and inflation


                                      4
moving in opposite directions.              These counterfactual predictions

make the model an unreliable tool for policy analysis.

     Of course, what the data reject is the combination of rational

expectations with the particular specifications of price setting

chosen by Taylor and Calvo.           In principle, the Taylor-Calvo model

might    be   modified   to    make    it    fit   the    data   under     rational

expectations.         Researchers such as Fuhrer and Moore (1995),

Rotemberg     and   Woodford   (1997),       and   Gali   and    Gertler   explore

variations on the model.         However, no consensus has emerged on

whether these variations are successful in fitting the facts.                  Thus

other researchers, and this paper, take a different approach:

relaxing the assumption of rational expectations.

     B. Backward-Looking Expectations

     Until the 1970s, the standard model of expectations was

backward-looking: expected inflation was assumed to equal lagged

inflation (or an average of several lags).                 Given the empirical

failures of rational-expectations models, some researchers have

suggested a return to backward-looking models, or models with both

backward-looking and rational agents (e.g. Ball, 1991; Roberts,

1997).   Backward-looking behavior helps explain inflation inertia:

since firms choose prices based on expected inflation, backward-

looking expectations make inflation depend on lagged inflation.

Roberts (1998) shows that the Taylor-Calvo model fits the data much

better when he assumes that some price setters are backward-looking

than when he assumes rational expectations for all.


                                         5
     But   can    one    justify   the       assumption    of   backward-looking

expectations theoretically?        If we examine only the postwar United

States, the answer is yes.         In recent decades, the persistence of

inflation has been strong enough that current inflation is a fairly

good predictor of future inflation. Inflation usually changes

slowly, and the occasional large changes are often the result of

unforecastable shocks, such as OPEC price rises.                   Consequently,

backward-looking    inflation      forecasts      are     not   much   worse   than

forecasts that use information optimally.

     This reasoning suggests that we can interpret backward-looking

expectations as a "near-rational rule of thumb" (Akerlof and

Yellen, 1985a).    It is costly to gather and process the information

needed for fully rational inflation forecasts.                  Some large firms

pay these costs -- they hire economists to build forecasting models

and monitor the Fed.         For the local pizza parlor, however, the

costs of these activities are larger than the gains from improved

inflation forecasts.       So the pizza parlor uses the inexpensive and

reasonably accurate rule of setting expected inflation equal to

past inflation.         This justification for near-rational inflation

forecasting parallels justifications for near-rational behavior in

price adjustment (Akerlof and Yellen, 1985b) and in consumption

(Cochrane, 1989).

     The empirical results below support the view that backward-

looking expectations are near-rational in the current regime. If

one forecasts inflation to equal past inflation, the forecast error


                                         6
is simply the change in inflation.                     For annual data on the GDP

deflator from 1960-99, the standard deviation of inflation changes

is 1.16 percentage points.            If one forecasts inflation over 1960-99

with a vector autoregression including output, inflation, and a

short-term interest rate, the standard error of the forecasts is

0.84    percentage       points.       Thus       a   substantial      increase         in   the

sophistication of forecasts reduces the typical error by only a few

tenths of a percentage point.               This improvement gives firms little

incentive to abandon backward-looking expectations.

        C. The Lucas Critique

       A limitation of the preceding argument is that it relies on a

feature of the economy -- the persistence of inflation -- that

arises in a particular monetary regime.                    In other possible regimes,

inflation       would    not    be    persistent,          and    so     backward-looking

expectations would be far from rational.                          For example, if the

Federal Reserve adopted a strict price-level target, inflation

would    have    negative      serial       correlation,         because       policy    would

reverse    deviations        from    the    target.         In    such     a   regime,       the

expectation that inflation will equal past inflation would be

obviously unreasonable, and would produce large forecast errors.

Firms     with    backward-looking           expectations          would       have     strong

incentives to change their behavior.

       This   idea      is   more    than    a    theoretical       possibility.             The

inflation persistence in the postwar United States does not extend

to   earlier      historical        periods.          In    particular,         the     serial


                                              7
correlation of inflation in the decades before 1914 is close to

zero (Barsky, 1987).         As documented below, this fact implies that

backward-looking expectations produce large forecast errors for

that period.    The pre-1914 behavior of expectations is likely to

differ from its recent behavior, leading to different inflation

dynamics.      This    idea    is   supported        by   evidence    that     pre-1914

Phillips curves have smaller coefficients on lagged inflation than

postwar Phillips curves (Gordon, 1980; Alogoskoufis and Smith,

1991).

      Because of the Lucas Critique, it is dangerous to assume

backward-looking expectations when comparing different monetary

regimes.    The usual response to this problem is to assume rational

expectations    --     but    in    models      of   inflation       dynamics,    this

assumption    produces       unrealistic       predictions       about   the   current

regime.    We need a new model of expectations that fits the current

period and also makes plausible predictions about other regimes.



III. OPTIMAL UNIVARIATE EXPECTATIONS

      What is the right near-rational model of expectations? There

is inevitably some arbitrariness in answering this question.                       Part

of   the   appeal     of   rational    expectations         is    that   it     has   an

unambiguous    definition.          When       one   relaxes      this   assumption,

rationality can fail in many ways -- agents can ignore various

pieces of information, or make various systematic errors.                             (To

paraphrase Tolstoy, all rational models are rational in the same


                                           8
way, but every non-rational model is non-rational in a different

way.)   One can imagine a deep theory of information gathering and

processing that predicts deviations from rationality, but research

in this area is in its infancy (e.g. Sargent, 1993).              The best one

can do at present is to propose plausible but ad hoc types of

behavior and see whether they fit the data.1

     This paper examines one type of near-rational behavior.                    I

assume that agents predicting inflation make optimal univariate

forecasts.      The   deviation     from   rationality     is   the    fact   that

forecasts are univariate: agents ignore relevant variables such as

output and interest rates.          Aside from this limitation, agents’

forecasts are optimal: they use inflation data as best they can.

Metaphorically,       one    can   imagine   firms   who    use       Box-Jenkins

techniques to select an ARIMA model for inflation, but who do not

go to the added trouble of using multivariate techniques.

     The justification for this behavior is the same as the earlier

justification     for       backward-looking    expectations:         univariate

forecasting is a near-rational rule of thumb.               It economizes on

information costs because it requires examining only a single,

obvious variable, and it produces forecast errors only modestly

larger than fully rational expectations.                 Here, however, the

justification is not specific to a particular monetary regime.                  In


1
 As Sargent puts it, "when we withdraw the assumption of a commonly
understood environment, we have to replace it with something, and
there are so many plausible possibilities. Ironically, when we
economists make the people in our models more "bounded" in their
rationality...we must be smarter...." (p. 2).

                                       9
my   model,    expectations    adjust       to    changes        in   the   univariate

inflation process, allowing them to remain near-rational.                          In

particular, I show below that univariate expectations are close to

rational in both the post-1960 and pre-1914 periods.

      My model of expectations has many antecedents.                    In the early

days of rational expectations, Sargent (1973) and McCallum (1976)

discussed the idea that expectations might be based on univariate

forecasts,    calling   this   model    "partly          rational     expectations."

McCallum suggests that lagged inflation rates are the variables

"most   likely    to    be   considered          by     market    participants"    in

forecasting inflation.       More recently, applied researchers such as

Staiger et al. (1997) use univariate forecasts as proxies for

expected inflation when estimating Phillips curves.

      At a broader level, I follow a number of authors who seek to

explain inflation behavior with deviations from rationality. For

example, "bounded rationality" is central to Sargent’s recent

interpretation     of   U.S.    inflation             history    (although     Sargent

emphasizes bounded rationality on the part of policymakers rather

than private agents).        Lucas’s (1973) model of the Phillips curve

is another inspiration for my work, although Lucas calls the

friction in his model "imperfect information" rather than near-

rationality.     In both Lucas's model and mine, agents ignore certain

observable variables -- in his case, they ignore the price level in

estimating relative prices -- but they use the information they do




                                       10
collect optimally.     Thus my model builds on a theme that is common

to such diverse researchers as Lucas, Sargent, and Akerlof-Yellen.

      Since my model is just one kind of near-rational expectations,

future   research     should    explore      others.       One      can    imagine

expectations that are closer to full rationality; for example,

agents might use data on output as well as inflation to forecast

future   inflation,    while      still    ignoring      interest     rates.     Or

expectations could be farther from rationality; agents might use

AR-1 models of inflation rather than optimal ARIMA models. A

generalization of my model might include a mixture of fully-

rational and less-than-rational agents, following Roberts (1997)

and   others.   Future     work    can     ask   which   variation        on   near-

rationality best captures the behavior of inflation.



IV. EXPECTATIONS IN TWO MONETARY REGIMES

      In Sections VI and VII below, I test macroeconomic models with

univariate expectations in two historical periods.               As preliminary

steps, this section describes the two periods and presents evidence

on what kinds of expectations are near-rational in each of them.

      A. The Two Periods

      The first period I examine is the current regime of highly

persistent inflation, which I date from 1960 through the present

(my data end in 1999).         Some authors consider the entire period

since World War II, but Barsky (1987) finds that strong inflation

persistence emerged only around 1960.             For the post-1960 period,


                                      11
Barsky and others find that the process for inflation has a unit

root.        A common interpretation is that policy has accomodated

shocks to inflation, leading the shocks to have permanent effects.

      For annual data on the GDP deflator, an augmented Dickey-

Fuller test confirms the finding of a unit root in inflation over

1960-1999.         Therefore, I construct inflation forecasts with a

stationary model for the change in inflation (                       ).       For annual

data,    I     assume      that   the   univariate       behavior    of           can   be

approximated by an AR-2 process.              Table I reports OLS estimates of

the     AR    coefficients.           Both    coefficients     are     statistically

significant but modest in size.                   The small coefficients confirm
                                                                          2
that inflation is fairly close to a pure random walk.

      The other period I examine is the gold-standard era from 1879

through 1914.        Friedman and Schwartz (1963) argue that there were

important regime shifts in 1879, when the U.S. returned to the gold

standard, and in 1914, when the Federal Reserve was established. As

discussed above, previous work finds that inflation was close to

white noise during this period -- the price level was close to a

random walk.        Shocks such as gold discoveries and shifts in money

demand produced one-time changes in the price level.

      I reexamine the inflation process for 1879-1914 using the two

leading series for the output deflator, those of Balke and Gordon

(1989)       and   Romer    (1989).     For       each   series,    Table     I   reports


2
 I do not include a constant in the model for ∆π. This means I
assume no deterministic drift in the level of inflation.

                                             12
estimates of AR-2 models for the level of inflation. All the

coefficients are small and statistically insignificant, confirming

that inflation was close to white noise.                        The constant in the

equation is also close to zero, implying that the univariate

forecast of inflation is close to zero in all years.

    In the empirical work below, I assume that the periods 1960-99

and 1879-1914 are stable monetary regimes, and that price setters

know    the    univariate       inflation     process      in    each      period.    The

assumption of stable regimes appears reasonable.                           Some authors

suggest    that      there   were   regime     shifts      in    1979   (the      Volcker

appointment and change in operating procedures) or 1986 (when

Taylor’s      (1993)   interest-rate        rule    begins      to   fit    the    data).

However, Chow tests based on these dates fail to reject a stable

inflation process over 1960-1999 (p=0.20 for 1979 and p=0.77 for

1986).

       Even if the inflation process is stable, it is questionable to

assume that agents know the process throughout the regime. This

assumption      is     weaker     than   the       usual     rational-expectations

hypothesis, in which agents know the entire structure of the

economy.      However, as stressed by Sargent (1999), agents are not

endowed with a priori knowledge of inflation behavior.                         Instead,

they must learn about it over time, perhaps by reestimating the

inflation process as new data arrive.                Future work should combine

this idea about learning with my idea of limited information sets.

One could assume, for example, that expectations are determined by


                                         13
real-time estimates of the univariate inflation process rather than

the true process.

     B. What Expectations Are Near-Rational?

     I argue above that optimal univariate forecasts are a near-

rational   form   of   expectations    in   many   monetary   regimes.   In

contrast, backward-looking expectations are near-rational only if

inflation is highly persistent.            Here I confirm these ideas by

computing forecast errors for various kinds of expectations.

     As a benchmark, I first compute errors based on optimal

multivariate forecasts.       For both the pre-1914 and post-1960

periods, I forecast annual inflation based on lags of inflation,

output, and a short-term interest rate.             Output is defined as

detrended real GNP (for the early period) or GDP (for the later

period); the trend is measured by the Hodrick-Prescott filter with

smoothing parameter 1000.      Inflation is the percentage change in

the GNP or GDP deflator.         For the early period, output and

inflation data are taken from both Romer and Balke-Gordon. The

interest rate for the later period is the Treasury bill rate; for

the early period it is the commercial paper rate from the NBER

Macro History Database.

     As discussed above, inflation appears to be non-stationary for

the post-1960 period.     Following Roberts (1998), I assume that the

nominal interest rate is also non-stationary, and that the real

interest rate, r=i- , is stationary.          (Equivalently, i and       are

cointegrated).    For the post-1960 period, I forecast inflation by


                                      14
regressing the change in inflation on lags of the stationary

variables y,      , and r.              For the pre-1914 period, I regress

inflation on y,    , and i.            For each period, I include two lags of

all variables.

     Table II presents the standard errors of these multivariate

forecasting equations.           For the post-1960 period, the standard

error is 0.84.    For the pre-1914 period, the standard error is 2.10

for the Balke-Gordon data and 3.26 for the Romer data, reflecting

greater inflation variability in the earlier period.

     Table II also reproduces the standard errors of optimal

univariate forecasts from Table I.              These exceed the errors from

multivariate forecasts by only a few tenths of a percentage point:

the increase is 0.25 percentage points in the post-1960 period, and

0.30 and 0.15 for the two pre-1914 data sets.            Note that output and

interest rates usually do make some contribution to forecasting

inflation: in the multivariate equations, these variables are

jointly significant for the post-1960 data (p<0.01) and for the

Balke-Gordon version of the pre-1914 data (p=0.02).              But the size

of the forecast improvements from adding these variables is modest,

making it plausible that near-rational agents would ignore them.

     Finally, Table II presents standard errors for backward-
                         e
looking expectations,    t   =     .
                                 t-1     As discussed in Section II, these are

not much larger than multivariate forecast errors for the post-1960

period.   But in the pre-1914 period, errors for backward-looking

expectations exceed errors for multivariate forecasts by 1.02

                                           15
percentage points in the Balke-Gordon data and 1.36 points in the

Romer data.   These increases in standard errors are much larger

than the increases from using univariate forecasts.   These findings

confirm that backward-looking expectations are far from rational in

the pre-1914 period.



V.   MODELS OF PRICE SETTING

     This section describes two models of price adjustment, which I

go on to test under alternative assumptions about expectations.

Both models are based on the canonical macroeconomic model of

imperfect competition (Romer, 1996, ch. 6), but they differ in the

timing of price changes.   The first model follows Taylor (1979): I

assume that each firm sets its price for two periods, and that

adjustment is staggered across firms.    In the second model, each

firm adjusts its price every period.       In this case, nominal

rigidity arises because some firms set prices before observing the

current state.

      The model with staggered adjustment has the advantage that

much recent research uses similar models; thus my tests of this

model are directly comparable to previous work.   For my purposes,

however, the model with staggering also has a major drawback:

estimating it requires data at greater than an annual frequency.

The reason, as detailed below, is that a plausible calibration sets

a period in the model equal to half a year. Unfortunately, only

annual data on output are available for the pre-1914 period.      I


                                16
therefore use my second price-adjustment model, which requires only

annual data, to compare the pre-1914 and post-1960 periods.

        A. The Model with Staggered Adjustment

       The economy contains a large number of imperfectly competitive

firms.      Each firm’s desired price in period t is given by

  (1)         p t*    =       pt + v y t    ,       v>0 ,

where p* is the desired nominal price, p is the aggregate price

level, and y is aggregate output (all variables are in logs).

Equation (1) can be derived from profit-maximization when firms

have    isoelastic              cost       and     demand   functions   (Romer,   ch.   6).

Intuitively, a rise in output shifts out each firm's demand curve,

raising its desired relative price.

       In this version of the model, a firm sets a fixed price for

two periods.          Let xt denote the price set by firms in period t for t

and t+1.     This price is chosen after firms observe the state of the

economy at t.             Following Taylor (1979) and Roberts (1995), firms

set xt equal to the average of expected optimal prices at t and t+1:
                  1 *
   (2)      xt =    ( pt + Et pt*+1 ) ,
                  2
where Et denotes firms' expectations at time t. Note that Et may or

may not equal a mathematical expectation, depending on whether we

assume rational expectations.

        Price setting is staggered, with equal numbers of firms

adjusting each period.                     Thus the price level pt is the average of xt

and xt-1:

   (3)           pt       =
                               1
                                 (xt + xt −1 ) .
                               2

                                                     17
As shown by Roberts (1995), equations (1)-(3) and algebra yield an

equation for inflation, πt ≡ pt - pt-1:
                          1                             v
    (4)        πt    =      ( Etπ t +1 + Et −1π t ) +     ( yt + Et yt +1 + yt −1 + Et −1 yt ) + ε t    ,
                          2                             2
where I add an error εt to capture inflation shocks not explained by

the   model.          I   assume        that      εt    is    serially        uncorrelated             and

uncorrelated with yt.

      Equation (4) is one version of the popular "New Keynesian

Phillips curve."           According to the equation, inflation depends on

expected inflation in the current and future periods, and on output

terms.     The empirical work below examines the performance of this
           3
equation.

      B. The Model with Prices Set for One Period

      In the second model of price adjustment, firms’ desired prices

are again given by equation (1).                          Each firm sets its price one

period at a time.                A fraction w of firms, the "sticky-price"




3
 Equation (4) is similar to equation (8) in Roberts (1995).
Roberts, however, writes the equation differently. He replaces the
term Et-1πt with πt + ut, where ut is an expectational error (ut ≡ Et-1πt
- πt). Making this substitution and rearranging leads to

    (4’)            πt = Etπt+1 + v (yt + Etyt+1 + yt-1 + Et-1yt) + 2 εt + ut .

Here, the only inflation expectation that appears explicitly is
Etπt+1 - the Phillips curve appears to be fully "forward-looking."
But Et-1πt enters the equation through the error ut. (This result
depends on Taylor’s assumption of fixed intervals between price
adjustments. As shown by Roberts, Calvo’s assumption of random
adjustments produces a version of (4’) without the ut term.)


                                                  18
sector, must set prices one period in advance.                         They set their

prices equal to the expected optimal price:

     (5)      p ts   =   E t −1 p t*   .

The other firms, the "flexible-price" sector, set prices after

observing the current state.                    Their prices are

     (6)     p tf    =   p t*    .
I include the flexible-price sector to allow output to have some

effect on inflation within a period.
                                                           s     f
       The aggregate price level is a weighted average of p and p :

      (7)     pt     =   w p ts + (1 − w) p tf      .
This equation and (1), (5), and (6) lead to
                                             (1 − w) v
   (8)     p t = E t −1 p t + v E t −1 y t +           yt .
                                                 w
Subtracting pt-1 from each side yields another Phillips curve:
                                             (1 − w) v
   (9)     π t = E t −1 π t + v E t −1 y t +           yt + ε t ,
                                                 w
where I again add an error εt. This equation is similar in spirit

to the earlier Phillips curve: inflation depends on expected

inflation and output terms.                        However, the dynamic structure is

simpler than before.



VI.    TESTING THE MODEL WITH STAGGERING

       The rest of this paper examines the empirical performance of

my    sticky-price       models            under   rational   expectations,   backward-

looking expectations, and optimal univariate expectations.                      In this

section, I embed these expectational assumptions in the model with

staggered price adjustment.


                                                   19
       In calibrating the model, a key parameter is the frequency of

price adjustment.          Following Fuhrer-Moore and Roberts, I assume

that   each   firm   adjusts     once   per   year.      This   assumption   is

consistent with the finding that the median U.S. firm adjusts at

this frequency (Blinder et al., 1998).                 Since a firm in the

staggering model adjusts every two periods, annual adjustment means

a period is interpreted as half a year.            I therefore estimate the

model with semi-annual data, which are available only for the post-
               4
1960 period.

       A. The Model with Rational Expectations

       A number of previous authors test my model of staggered price

adjustment (or similar models) under the assumption of rational

expectations.      These tests usually produce strong rejections (e.g.

Estrella and Fuhrer, 1998; Mankiw, 2000).             Gali and Gertler (1999)

present an especially simple demonstration of the model’s failure.

They estimate the model’s Phillips curve, equation (4), and obtain

a negative coefficient on the output term; this result contradicts

the underlying theory.          Here I assume rational expectations and

replicate     Gali   and    Gertler’s   negative      result.   This   exercise

provides a benchmark when I examine the model’s performance with

other kinds of expectations.




4
 In this section, the inflation and interest rate variables are the
semi-annual analogues of the variables defined in Section IV. To
obtain the output gap, I detrend quarterly output with the HP
filter (λ=16,000) and then aggregate the quarterly gap series.
                                20
        To   estimate           equation        (4),      I    first    replace        all     expected

variables with actual variables plus expectational errors.                                                This

yields

   (10)         πt    =
                          1
                            (π t +1 + π t ) +    v
                                                   ( y t −1 + 2 y t + y t +1 ) + ε t + u t + u t +1   ,
                          2                      2
where ut is an expectational error (ut ≡ (1/2) (Et-1πt-πt) + (v/2) (Et-1yt -

yt)).    Note there are two expectational errors, ut and ut+1, because

equation (4) includes expectations of variables at t and t+1.

Equation (10) simplifies to

   (11)          π t − π t +1    = v ( y t −1 + 2 y t + y t +1 ) + 2 (ε t + u t + u t +1 ) .

        The parameter v in (11) can be estimated by instrumental

variables.           As instruments, I use the output gap, the change in

inflation, and the real interest rate from t-1 through t-4.                                           Under

rational expectations, these lagged variables are uncorrelated with

the expectational errors ut and ut+1.                           They are also uncorrelated

with the white-noise error εt in the underlying inflation equation.

        The instrumental variables estimate of v is -0.049, with a

Newey-West           standard      error        of     0.016.          Thus     the      estimate          is

significantly negative.                  Recall that v is the effect of output on

firms’ desired prices in equation (1).                            The model of monopolistic

competition underlying (1) implies that v is positive.                                      Thus, like

Gali and Gertler, I find that the estimate of v contradicts theory.

        There        is   a     straightforward               explanation       for      the     model’s

failure.      For v>0, equation (11) gives a positive relation between

πt-πt+1 and an average of output from t-1 to t+1.                              πt-πt+1 equals -∆πt+1,

so this means a negative relation between output and the change in

                                                     21
inflation.         In the data, however, there is a positive relation

between output and ∆πt+1 -- the accelerationist Phillips curve.                                    This

contradiction between the model’s Phillips curve and the one in the

data produces the model’s rejection.

       B. The Model with Optimal Univariate Expectations

       I now show that the model of staggered price adjustment

performs better if rational expectations are replaced by optimal

univariate expectations.                 As a first step, I reestimate the model’s

Phillips curve, equation (4), and show that the parameter v has the

correct sign.

       In this version of the model, I replace the expected inflation

terms in equation (4) with optimal univariate forecasts.                                           For

consistency, I assume that output expectations are also given by

univariate        forecasts.                Semi-annual            inflation           forecasts   are

generated by an AR-4 model for ∆π with coefficients ρ1,..,ρ4; output

forecasts are generated by an AR-4 with coefficients β1,...,β4.

These assumptions determine the expectations in (4) in terms of the

AR parameters and current and lagged variables. For example, Etπt+1

equals πt+ρ1(∆π)t+...+ρ4(∆π)t-3. Substituting expressions like this

into (4) leads, after algebra, to

        To estimate this equation, I first estimate the AR processes

for ∆π and y and substitute the estimates of ρ’s and β’s into

equation (12).         With the AR coefficients replaced by numbers, (12)

has a single parameter, v.           I can estimate v by ordinary least

squares, since the error ε is uncorrelated with output and its own
                                                                                5
lags.    The estimate of v is 0.058 with a standard error of 0.014.

        Thus, in contrast to the case of rational expectations, the

estimated      v   has   the   positive   sign   predicted   by   theory.     To

understand why, recall that inflation is close to a random walk in

the post-1960 period; thus, with univariate forecasts, Et-1πt is

close to πt-1.      Roberts and others have shown that replacing Et-1πt

with    πt-1   helps     staggered-price-setting    models    fit   the     data.

Specifically, if this substitution is made in equation (4), the

equation reduces to a positive relation between ∆π and output - the

Phillips curve that appears in the data.




5   The estimated parameters substituted into equation (12) are
ρ1=0.029, ρ2=0.049, ρ3=-0.084, ρ4=-0.099, β1=1.237, β2=-0.476, β3=-
0.114, and β4=0.068. In principle, my use of generated coefficients
makes the OLS standard error for v invalid (Pagan, 1984). My
problem is sufficiently non-standard that it is difficult to
generate the correct standard error. However, Monte Carlo evidence
suggests that the OLS standard error is close to correct in this
application. I generate artificial data that mimic the output-
inflation dynamics in the true data using a VAR for y and ∆π and
bootstrap techniques. I create 50,000 artificial data sets, each
the same size as the true data set (80 observations). For each
artificial sample, I estimate v using my two-step procedure. The
standard deviation of the estimated v’s across samples is 0.015.
This bootstrap standard error is close to the OLS standard error of
0.014.
                                 23
     Obtaining a coefficient estimate with the correct sign is

fairly weak confirmation of a model.            I can, however, construct a

stronger test of the model’s quantitative implications.           To do so,

I first summarize the inflation-output interactions in the data by

estimating        an    unrestricted,    atheoretical     Phillips   curve.

Specifically, I regress the change in inflation on four lags of

itself, current output, and four lags of output; then I transform

the results to obtain an equation for the level of inflation.             The

first    column    of   Table   III   reports   coefficient   estimates   and

standard errors for this equation.              (Once again, I estimate an

equation for ∆π because inflation is non-stationary.)

     In equation (12), moving the lagged-inflation terms to the

right side yields a restricted version of the atheoretical Phillips

curve.    Once the estimated ρ’s and β’s are substituted in, the

coefficients on all the output and inflation lags are determined by

one parameter, v.          The second column of Table III gives the

coefficients that arise when v is set at its OLS estimate of 0.058.

To test the model, I test the hypothesis that all the coefficients

in the unrestricted Phillips curve equal their values in the
                                 6
restricted Phillips curve.

     An F-test fails to reject the equality of restricted and

unrestricted coefficients (p=0.66).             Most important, Table III


6
 This test treats the coefficients in the restricted equation as
constants; it ignores sampling error in estimating these
coefficients. This appears to bias the test toward rejection of
the model’s restrictions. Nonetheless, the restrictions are not
rejected.
                               24
shows that the two sets of coefficients are close in economic

terms.    In both cases, the first inflation lag has a coefficient

near one and the longer lags have coefficients near zero.                       And in

both cases, there are positive coefficients on current output and

one or two output lags.             The sum of output coefficients is 0.25 in

the unrestricted equation and 0.21 in the restricted equation. Thus

the Phillips curve derived from the model is consistent with the

stylized facts.

       C. The Model with Backward-Looking Expectations

       The final version of the staggered-adjustment model assumes

backward-looking expectations: Et-1πt=πt-1.                   The results for this case

are similar to the results for optimal univariate expectations.

This reflects the fact that the two models of expectations are

nearly equivalent for the post-1960 period.

       In equation (4), I substitute πt-1 for Et-1πt and πt for Etπt+1. I

assume that output expectations are also backward-looking and

substitute lagged output for expected output.                      Equation (4) reduces

to

(13)         π t − π t −1   = v (2 y t −1 + 2 y t ) + 2 ε t   .

The OLS estimate of the parameter v is 0.056 with a standard error

of 0.013.

       Equation     (13)       is     another        restricted      version   of   the

atheoretical Phillips curve.               In Table III, the third column gives

the Phillips-curve coefficients implied by (13) with v=0.056.                       Once

again, one cannot reject the hypothesis that the unrestricted

                                              25
coefficients equal the restricted coefficients. And once again, the

restricted and unrestricted equations tell the same economic story.

Inflation depends on lagged inflation with a coefficient near one

(or exactly one in column (3)), and on output terms.

     I   would   like   to   test   the   model   with   backward-looking

expectations against the model with optimal univariate forecasts.

However, this is not practically possible with post-1960 data,

because the models’ implications are so similar for this period. I

therefore turn to data for the period before 1914, when the two

kinds of expectations differ greatly.



VII. TESTING THE MODEL WITH ONE-PERIOD PRICES

     This section tests the second version of my sticky-price

model, in which a firm adjusts its price every period.           I again

assume that prices are adjusted once per year, which means here

that a period is a year.      I can therefore test the model for the

pre-1914 period, when only annual data are available, as well as

the post-1960 period.

     A. Rational Expectations

     It is easy to see that the model with one-period prices is

rejected if one assume rational expectations.            Paralleling the

analysis in the previous section, I start with the model’s Phillips

curve, equation (9), and replace expected variables with actual

variables plus expectational errors. This yields
                       v
   (14)     πt = πt +    yt + ε t + u t ,
                       w

                                    26
where ut ≡ Et-1πt - πt + v (Et-1yt - yt).       The πt’s cancel out, leaving

                    v
   (15)       0 =     yt + ε t + u t   .
                    w

One can again estimate the output coefficient, v/w, by instrumental

variables.    Since the left side of (15) is zero, the estimate is

obviously zero.     This implies v=0, which contradicts the model’s

assumption of v>0.

     To see the problem more intuitively, consider the model’s

implications when v>0.      In this case, equation (9) gives a positive

relation between πt-Et-1πt and actual and expected output.               Thus

variables that help forecast output also help forecast πt-Et-1πt. This

result contradicts rational expectations, which implies that πt-Et-1πt

is unforecastable.

     These results depend, of course, on the model’s simple timing

of price adjustment.       As shown earlier, the staggered-adjustment

model with rational expectations produces an estimate of v which is

negative rather than zero.        However, both a zero v and a negative v

violate theory.     The failure of rational expectations is a robust

result, although the failure takes different forms in the two

price-setting models.

     B. Optimal Univariate Expectations

     Like the earlier model with staggering, the model with one-

period prices fits the data fairly well if one assumes optimal

univariate expectations.       I show this is true for annual data from

both 1960-1999 and 1879-1914.

                                           27
     The Model’s Phillips Curve: With annual data, I use the

forecasting models for inflation in Table I: an AR-2 for ∆π in the

post-1960 period and an AR-2 for the level of π in the pre-1914

period.    In both periods I use an AR-2 for output to measure output

expectations.    For each period, I substitute the forecasting models

into equation (9) and obtain inflation in terms of lagged inflation

and current and lagged output.         I omit these equations, which are

the analogues of equation (12) for the model with staggering.               Once

estimates of the AR coefficients are substituted in, there are two

free parameters, the coefficients on Et-1yt and yt in (9).              In terms

of underlying parameters, these coefficients equal v and (1-w)v/w.

     Table    IVA     presents   OLS    estimates     of   the    two    output

coefficients for the 1960-1999 and 1879-1914 periods. For the post-

1960 period, the two coefficients are positive, and they are

jointly significant at the one percent level.              The estimates for

1879-1914 are imprecise, especially for the Romer data, reflecting

the high inflation variability in the period.              For both pre-1914

data sets, the yt coefficient is positive but the Et-1yt coefficient

is   negative,      contradicting   theory.        However,      the    negative

coefficients are far from significant, and confidence intervals

include large positive values.              Thus the pre-1914 data neither

reject nor strongly support the model’s predictions about output

effects.

     Again paralleling earlier analysis, I test the restrictions

that the model places on an atheoretical Phillips curve.               Table IVB

                                       28
presents unrestricted Phillips curves and the Phillips curves

implied    by    equation     (9)     with      univariate     expectations.      The

coefficients in (9) are set at the estimated values in Table IVA.

For the post-1960 period, the unrestricted equation is once again

obtained by estimating an equation for ∆π; for the pre-1914 period,

I estimate an equation for π directly.

     One    cannot    reject      the     hypothesis    that    the    unrestricted

coefficients equal the restricted coefficients for either 1960-1999

or 1879-1914 (the p-values are 0.3 and higher). In comparing the

restricted and unrestricted equations, the output coefficients are

not very informative, because they are estimated imprecisely.                     The

coefficients on inflation lags are more interesting.                  For the post-

1960 data, the sum of these coefficients is close to one in both

the restricted and unrestricted equations (as found before with

semi-annual data). For the pre-1914 data, the sum of coefficients

is less than 0.3 in both equations.                    Thus the restricted and

unrestricted Phillips curves shift across time in the same way.

     Previous papers such as Gordon (1980) and Algoskoufis-Smith

(1991)    have   pointed    out     the   shift    across    regimes    in    lagged-

inflation coefficients in unrestricted Phillips curves.                      As shown

below, the success in capturing this shift is what distinguishes my

model      of    univariate         expectations        from     backward-looking

expectations.        The reasons for the model’s behavior should be

clear. In the model, lagged inflation rates enter the Phillips

curve to the extent they influence univariate inflation forecasts.

                                           29
In going from the post-1960 to the pre-1914 period, the inflation

process becomes less persistent, so lagged inflation has smaller

effects on forecasts.

         Impulse Response Functions: To illustrate the performance of

the model, I borrow a technique from Fuhrer-Moore (1995) and

Roberts (1998): comparison of restricted and unrestricted impulse

response functions.          I first combine the unrestricted Phillips

curve estimated above with an equation for output in terms of

lagged output and lagged inflation.             These two equations are a

vector autoregression in recursive form (contemporaneous output

affects inflation but not vice-versa). For each time period, I

derive impulse response functions from the VAR; these summarize the

output-inflation interactions to be explained.

         I then replace the inflation equation in the VAR with the

Phillips curve from my model -- equation (9) with expectations

given     by   univariate    forecasts.     I   leave   the   output    equation

unchanged.       The resulting system yields impulse responses that

embody the model’s restrictions on inflation behavior.

         This exercise requires values for the coefficients on yt and Et-

yt in equation (9).
1
                             For the post-1960 period, I use the point

estimates in Table IVA.         For the pre-1914 period, recall that the

Et-1yt    coefficient   is    negative,    violating    theory,   but    highly

insignificant.      For this period, I set the Et-1yt coefficient to zero

(the lower bound of its theoretical range) and reestimate the




                                      30
coefficient on yt.       The new yt coefficient is 0.26 for the Romer

data and 0.11 for Balke-Gordon.7

     Figure 1 shows the impulse responses of inflation to output

and inflation shocks for the post-1960 and two pre-1914 data sets.

The solid lines in the graphs are responses derived from the

unrestricted VAR, and the dashed lines are restricted responses.

The graphs also show 95% confidence bands for the unrestricted

responses, derived by bootstrap methods.           The central message of

the Figure is that the restricted and unrestricted responses are

similar.   In particular, the restricted responses almost always lie
                                                                        8
within the confidence intervals for the unrestricted responses.

     Recall that pre-1914 Phillips curves have lower coefficients

on lagged inflation than post-1960 Phillips curves. This difference

is reflected in the persistence of inflation responses in Figure 1.

In both periods, inflation initially rises after an output or

inflation shock.     In the post-1960 period, inflation remains high

permanently (although, for inflation shocks, the long-run response

is smaller than the initial response).         In the early period, by

contrast, the effects of shocks die out quickly.            Again, these

results    arise   for   both   restricted   and    unrestricted   impulse

responses.


7
   I have also experimented with other coefficient values.      My
qualitative results are robust for wide ranges of values, as long
as the coefficients on both yt and Et-1yt are non-negative.
8
  I have also computed responses of output to output and inflation
shocks. The restricted and unrestricted responses are very close,
reflecting the fact that the model does not restrict the output
equation in the VAR.

                                    31
      C. Backward-Looking Expectations

      Finally, I examine the model with one-period prices under

backward-looking expectations.             This specification fits the post-

1960 data, but it is strongly rejected for the pre-1914 period.

      With backward-looking expectations,                I substitute πt-1 for Et-1πt

and yt-1 for Et-1yt in equation (9).             I then estimate the equation’s

two   coefficients       by    OLS.      Table    VA   presents   the    coefficient

estimates,    which      are     similar    to     those    for   the    univariate-

expectations case.

      Again paralleling earlier analysis, Table VB compares the

Phillips curve derived from the model to an unrestricted Phillips

curve.      The   results       differ   sharply       across   time    periods.   The

hypothesis that the unrestricted coefficients equal the restricted

coefficients is not rejected for the post-1960 period, but it is

rejected at the 99% level for both of the pre-1914 data sets.

      These results are explained by the coefficients on lagged

inflation    in    the        Phillips    curves.        Under    backward-looking

expectations, the first inflation lag always has a coefficient of

one in the restricted equation.            The unrestricted Phillips curve is

consistent with this result for the post-1960 period, but, as

discussed before, the pre-1914 coefficient is much less than one.

The unrestricted Phillips curve shifts in a way that is not

captured by the backward-looking model.

      Paralleling Figure 1, Figure 2 compares unrestricted impulse

responses for inflation to restricted responses, derived as before


                                           32
by replacing the VAR inflation equation with the model’s Phillips

curve. The Figure confirms the model’s failure for the pre-1914

period:    for    both    the   Romer     and   the    Balke-Gordon   data,       the

restricted impulse responses travel far away from the unrestricted

responses.        Specifically,     the    unrestricted       responses     die   out

quickly but the restricted responses do not. The backward-looking

model imposes inflation persistence that does not exist in the pre-
            9
1914 data.



VIII. CONCLUSION

     This paper proposes a near-rational model of expectations:

agents make optimal univariate forecasts of inflation and output.

This assumption helps to explain the behavior of U.S. inflation in

two different periods, 1960-99 and 1879-1914.                In contrast, neither

fully rational expectations nor backward-looking expectations fits

both periods.

     My model of expectations meets Lucas’s (1976) criterion for

reliable    policy      analysis:   it    holds   across     different    monetary

regimes.        In future work, I will apply the model to normative

questions       about   monetary    policy,     such    as   the   choice    of    an

instrument or target rule.          This analysis will account for shifts

in expectations as new policies change the univariate behavior of


9
  To derive the restricted impulse responses for the pre-1914
period, I again set the coefficient on Et-1yt to zero in equation (9)
and reestimate the coefficient on yt. The new yt coefficient is
0.17 for the Romer data and 0.08 for Balke-Gordon.


                                          33
output and inflation.   I hope this approach yields more credible

results than policy analysis based on fully rational expectations

(e.g. McCallum and Nelson, 1999) or backward-looking expectations

(e.g. Ball, 1999).
