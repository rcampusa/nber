                                         ABSTRACT

Allowing emissions permits to be banked and borrowed over time can yield efficiency gains. I
develop a model to demonstrate that banking and borrowing can also be allowed for a price
policy. I compare expected welfare between price and quantity policies, with and without
banking, under several different scenarios regarding uncertainty. A bankable policy can provide
an efficiency improvement by allowing for smoothing of costs, though it does not necessarily
dominate a policy that does not allow banking. The ranking of prices vs. quantities and of
bankability vs. non-bankability depends on both the slopes of marginal costs and benefits and on
the specification of uncertainty.

I. Introduction

       Under perfect information, an externality market failure can be efficiently solved using

either a price or a quantity instrument. For example, pollution can be reduced to its efficient

level through either a pollution tax or a cap-and-trade scheme. Under certain types of

information asymmetry, the equivalence between price and quantity instruments breaks down

(Weitzman 1974). It has been argued that an advantage of quantity instruments over price

instruments is that quantity instruments are bankable. For example, pollution permits in a cap-

and-trade scheme can be banked for future use if abatement costs are lower than expected in the

current period. Many real-world tradable pollution permit markets, like the Regional

Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, allow for

banking or borrowing (Chevallier 2012).

       Several papers that extend the framework of Weitzman (1974) consider the use of

banking and borrowing of permits and its effect on efficiency. Fell et al. (2012) evaluate the

welfare effects of allowing limited banking and borrowing, and they numerically simulate to find

that allowing for banking and borrowing can make a quantity policy nearly as effective as a price

policy. Williams (2002) argues that banking is optimal for stock but not flow pollutants.

Kollenberg and Taschini (2016) model a policy in which the emissions cap is updated by

policymakers in response to the number of permits in the bank to reduce costs. Most closely

related to this study are two papers that use two-period models to study the efficiency of

allowing banking. Pizer and Prest (2016) show that banking can improve efficiency and in some

cases achieve the first best; by contrast Weitzman (2018) shows that banking is always

dominated by either non-bankable ("fixed") quantities or non-bankable prices.

       The purpose of this paper is to consider another policy option that has until now been

ignored by policy modelers: what I call bankable prices. Intertemporal trading, or bankability,

can be built into a price policy as well as into a quantity policy. The firm is given a price in each

period but can choose to defer payment for its actual output or emissions until the future – that is,

the firm can bank some of its quantity in order to pay the price on it in a future period. Similarly,

the firm can borrow forward, with no restrictions. The firm has the option of deferring or

accelerating its tax liability. I develop a model allowing for bankable prices, and I compare that

policy to three other policies: bankable quantities, non-bankable quantities, and non-bankable

prices. Under several different scenarios regarding the correlation of shocks across time and

regarding the ability of the planner to observe those shocks, I provide expressions (analogous to

the well-known result from (Weitzman (1974)) for the expected welfare difference between one

policy and another.

       This study is the first to my knowledge that models bankable prices. It follows closely

from the models in Pizer and Prest (2016) and Weitzman (2018), both of which compare non-

bankable prices, non-bankable quantities, and bankable quantities, but omit bankable prices.

Like Pizer and Prest (2016), this model allows for policy updating: the planner can observe the

first-period shocks before the second period and adjust its policy in response. Like Weitzman

(2018), this model allows for shock values that differ across time but are correlated. By allowing

for both of these features, this models resolves the somewhat contradictory results from those

two papers, in addition to its contribution of modeling bankable prices.

       I find that the advantage of bankable prices depends on whether the planner can observe

the shocks and whether the shocks differ across periods. In the simplest scenario where the

shocks are identical across periods and the planner never observes them, bankability offers no
                                                  4


advantage to either a price or a quantity policy. When the planner observes the shocks after the

first period so policy updating is possible, bankability offers an advantage (in fact, it allows the

planner to achieve the first best). But, the advantage is identical for either a bankable price or a

bankable quantity policy; and thus bankability does not uniquely confer an advantage upon

quantity instruments. When the shocks differ across the two periods and are correlated, but the

planner never observes them, then bankable prices does not offer any advantage over non-

bankable prices. Finally, in the most complete scenario when the shocks differ across periods

and the planner can update policy after observing the first-period shocks, the advantage of

bankability is more complicated and cannot a priori be signed. Whenever prices dominate

quantities, then bankability dominates non-bankability. However, when quantities dominate

prices, then bankability may or may not dominate non-bankability. The comparison between a

bankable quantity policy and a non-bankable quantity policy identifies one term in which non-

bankable quantities dominate if marginal costs are steeper than marginal benefits, as identified in

Weitzman (2018). But in addition to this term, there is a term that represents an unambiguous

advantage of bankability, regardless of the slope of marginal cost or benefit curves. This

represents the fact that the firm can smooth its production over time in the face of the shock

value that it observes.

       Lastly, I provide a back-of-the-envelope numerical simulation exercise to gauge the

magnitude of the efficiency differences across policies when applied to global climate change

policy. Under the base-case parameter values, the bankable price policy strictly dominates all

other policies, and the efficiency gain of moving from a non-bankable price policy to a bankable

price policy is about one-tenth of the efficiency gain from moving from a quantity policy to a
                                                          5


price policy. Under other parameterizations, the efficiency gain of bankability can exceed the

efficiency gain of a price policy over a quantity policy.

         The following section presents the model and results from these four different scenarios

regarding the observation of shock values. Then, section III briefly explores the implications

through numerical simulations.



II. Model

         I begin with a simple two-period model to provide the main intuition. Consider the

standard specification of quadratic benefits and costs of some choice variable 𝑞𝑡 as in Weitzman

(1974, 2018):

                                                                           𝑐2
                            𝐶(𝑞𝑡 , 𝜃𝑡 ) = 𝑐0 + (𝑐1 + 𝜃𝑡 )(𝑞𝑡 − 𝑞̂) +          (𝑞 − 𝑞̂)2
                                                                           2 𝑡

                                                                           𝑏2
                           𝐵(𝑞𝑡 , 𝜂𝑡 ) = 𝑏0 + (𝑏1 + 𝜂𝑡 )(𝑞𝑡 − 𝑞̂) −           (𝑞 − 𝑞̂)2
                                                                           2 𝑡

The random variables, 𝜃𝑡 and 𝜂𝑡 , affect the first but not the second derivative of the cost and

benefit functions, respectively. That is, they shift the level but not the slope of the marginal cost

and marginal benefit functions. In expectation the random variables are equal to zero and

uncorrelated, and define 𝑐1 = 𝑏1.1 These assumptions imply that in expectation net benefits 𝐵 −

𝐶 are maximized at 𝑞𝑡 = 𝑞̂. There are two time periods, 𝑡 = 1 and 𝑡 = 2, and I ignore

discounting (i.e. set the discount factor = 1).

         I consider four different policies available to the planner, who always seeks to maximize

expected welfare (i.e. expected net benefits) 𝐸[𝐵(𝑞1 , 𝜂1 ) − 𝐶(𝑞1 , 𝜃1 ) + 𝐵(𝑞2 , 𝜂2 ) − 𝐶(𝑞2 , 𝜃2 )].

First, the planner can set a non-bankable quantity policy {𝑞̃1 , 𝑞̃2 }, detailing how much the firm


1
 This is equivalent to a normalization that ensures that in expectation 𝑞̂ is the optimal quantity; see Weitzman
(2018).
                                                          6


can produce each period. Given this policy, the firm's decision is trivial: it must produce 𝑞𝑡 = 𝑞̃𝑡

in each period.

         Second, the planner can set a non-bankable price policy {𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 }, in which the firm faces

a price per unit of output in each period. The firm's optimization problem in period 𝑡 is

                                              max 𝑝̃𝑡 𝑞𝑡 − 𝐶(𝑞𝑡 , 𝜃𝑡 ).
                                               𝑞𝑡


         Third, the planner can set a bankable quantity policy, setting {𝑞̃1 , 𝑞̃2 } but allowing the

firm to choose a quantity 𝐵 to bank (𝐵 > 0) or borrow (𝐵 < 0) between the two periods.2 At the

start of period 2, the firm would find itself with a bank 𝐵 and be required to produce 𝑞2 = 𝑞̃2 +

𝐵. If 𝐵 > 0, some of the first period's allotment 𝑞̃1 was banked, so the firm can (and must)

produce more than its allotment 𝑞̃2 . If 𝐵 < 0, then some of the second period's allotment was

borrowed back in the first period, so the firm in the second period must produce less than its

allotment 𝑞̃2 . At the start of period 1, the firm chooses both its actual quantity produced 𝑞1 and

the amount that it banks or borrows 𝐵 subject to 𝑞1 = 𝑞̃1 − 𝐵.

         Fourth and finally, the planner can set a bankable price policy, setting {𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 } but

allowing the firm to choose a quantity 𝐵 to bank or borrow between periods. If 𝐵 > 0, then the

firm banks some of its output to the second period, and therefore faces the second-period price

on that quantity. Thus, its first-period maximand is 𝑝̃1 (𝑞1 − 𝐵) − 𝐶(𝑞1 , 𝜃1 ). In the second

period, the firm faces the second-period price on its actual second-period output plus the banked

output, so its maximand is 𝑝̃2 (𝑞2 + 𝐵) − 𝐶(𝑞2 , 𝜃2 ). When 𝐵 < 0, these maximand expressions

are unchanged, though the interpretation of 𝐵 is borrowing from period 2 to period 1.




2
  What I refer to as a "bankable" policy is actually both bankable and borrowable; for conciseness I will just use the
term "bankable."
                                                          7


        For each policy, I solve for the firm's optimal response to a given policy level. Given

that, I solve for the planner's optimal policy level, set to maximize expected welfare given the

firm's response. Lastly, I solve for expected welfare given optimal policy and optimal firm

response. I compare expected welfare across the four policies to see which policy the planner

would prefer ex ante.3 I do this comparison for several different scenarios involving the

specification of the shocks and realization of the uncertainty over the random variables.



II.A. Scenario A: Identical shocks, No policy updating

        I begin with a simple specification of uncertainty before moving on to more interesting

and complicated cases. Nonetheless, even in this simplest of scenarios the intuition behind the

paper's main results can be seen.

        The random variables in this scenario are identical across the two periods; that is, 𝜃1 =

𝜃2 ≡ 𝜃 and 𝜂1 = 𝜂2 ≡ 𝜂. 𝐸[𝜃] = 𝐸[𝜂] = 𝐸[𝜃𝜂] = 0, and 𝜎𝜃2 ≡ 𝐸[𝜃 2 ] and 𝜎𝜂2 ≡ 𝐸[𝜂2 ]. The

firm observes its random variables before the start of period 1, but the planner never observes

them. Therefore, the planner is unable to update the policy between periods 1 and 2. The first-

                                      𝜂−𝜃
best outcome is 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏               . This result and all others are proven in the Appendix.
                                       2 +𝑐2


        First consider the non-bankable quantity policy {𝑞̃1 , 𝑞̃2 }. The firm's response to this

policy is trivial: 𝑞𝑡 = 𝑞̃𝑡 . Knowing this response, the planner chooses 𝑞̃1 and 𝑞̃2 to maximize

expected net benefits. That is, the planner's problem is

                           max 𝐸[𝐵(𝑞̃1 , 𝜂) − 𝐶(𝑞̃1 , 𝜃) + 𝐵(𝑞̃2 , 𝜂) − 𝐶(𝑞̃2 , 𝜃)]
                           𝑞̃1 ,𝑞̃2




3
 While the planner can choose which of the four policy options yields the highest expected welfare, the firm does
not have the option to choose which policy it is subject to, as in Krysiak and Oberauner (2010).
                                                  8


Given the specification of the benefit and cost functions and the structure of the uncertainties, it

is straightforward to show that the planner's optimal policy is to set 𝑞̃1 = 𝑞̃2 = 𝑞̂. Given this

policy and the firm's (trivial) response to it, the expected net benefits of the non-bankable

quantity policy is
                                         𝐴
                                       𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 )                                           (1)

The acronym 𝐸𝑊 is for expected welfare (i.e. expected net benefits), the subscript 𝑁𝐵𝑄

indicates the non-bankable quantity policy, and the superscript 𝐴 indicates scenario A (identical

shocks, no policy updating).

       Second, consider the non-bankable price policy {𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 }. In response to this policy, the

firm chooses the quantity in each period to maximize 𝑝̃𝑡 𝑞𝑡 − 𝐶(𝑞𝑡 , 𝜃). Each period, this yields

                                                      𝑝̃𝑡 −𝑐1 −𝜃
the firm's response function 𝑞𝑡 = ℎ(𝑝̃𝑡 , 𝜃) ≡ 𝑞̂ +                . Knowing that response, the planner
                                                         𝑐2


chooses 𝑝̃1 and 𝑝̃2 to maximize expected net benefits. Solving for the planner's optimal policy

yields 𝑝̃1 = 𝑝̃2 = 𝑐1 (the planner sets the price equal to the expected marginal cost). Given this

optimal policy and the firm's response to it, the expected net benefits of the non-bankable price

policy is

                                 𝐴
                                                              𝜎𝜃2                                    (2)
                               𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ) +              (𝑐 − 𝑏2 )
                                                              𝑐22 2


Comparing this equation to equation 1, the difference in expected welfare between the non-

bankable quantity policy and the non-bankable price policy is

                                      𝐴
                                                 𝜎𝜃2                                                 (3)
                                     Δ𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑄   = 2 (𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )
                                                 𝑐2


Here Δ indicates the difference in expected welfare between two policies, where the subscript

𝑁𝐵𝑃, 𝑁𝐵𝑄 indicates that it is the difference between the non-bankable price and the non-
                                                   9

                                𝐴           𝐴       𝐴                          𝐴
bankable quantity policy (i.e. Δ𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑄 ≡ 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃 − 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 ). The expression for Δ𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑄 is

simply the standard Weitzman (1974) prices-vs-quantities expression multiplied by two because

this is a two-period model.

       Third, consider the bankable quantity policy. In period 1, the firm chooses how much to

emit and how much to bank, 𝐵. If 𝐵 < 0, then this means the firm borrows from the next period.

For now assume no restrictions on banking or borrowing and no discount or penalty for banking

or borrowing. The firm's problem is

                                     max −𝐶(𝑞1 , 𝜃) − 𝐶(𝑞2 , 𝜃)
                                    𝑞1 ,𝑞2 ,𝐵


                                   𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑞1 = 𝑞̃1 − 𝐵, 𝑞2 = 𝑞̃2 + 𝐵

Because the firm's cost function is identical across periods (because of the identical shock) and

                                                                                        𝑞̃1 +𝑞̃2
concave, the firm will always want to perfectly smooth out production: 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 =                   . The
                                                                                           2

planner's optimal policy is the same as under the non-bankable quantity policy: 𝑞̃𝑡 = 𝑞̂ in each

period (actually the planner can set any pair 𝑞̃1 , 𝑞̃2 such that 𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 = 2𝑞̂ knowing that the firm

will smooth production across periods). As a result, the outcome under this policy will be
                                                                                   𝐴
identical to the outcome under the non-bankable quantity policy from equation 1: 𝐸𝑊𝐵𝑄 =

  𝐴        𝐴
𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 and Δ𝑁𝐵𝑄,𝐵𝑄 = 0. Under this simplest of assumptions about identical shocks and no

policy updating, banking offers no advantage to a quantity policy.

       Fourth and finally, consider the bankable price policy. The firm faces prices in each

period 𝑝̃1 and 𝑝̃2 . It is able to bank some of its output (or emissions) 𝐵 and pay the price in the

following period. Alternatively, if 𝐵 < 0, it borrows forward some of its output from the second

period and pays for it at the first-period price. The firm's problem thus is

                       max 𝑝̃1 (𝑞1 − 𝐵) − 𝐶(𝑞1 , 𝜃) + 𝑝̃2 (𝑞2 + 𝐵) − 𝐶(𝑞2 , 𝜃)
                      𝑞1 ,𝑞2 ,𝐵
                                                         10


                                         𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑞1 − 𝐵 ≥ 0, 𝑞2 + 𝐵 ≥ 0

The non-negativity constraints ensure that the firm cannot borrow or bank more than the total

produced. Other than that, there are no restrictions on banking or borrowing. Given an arbitrary

policy 𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2, it can be shown that the firm's problem has the following solution:

                                                      max{𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 } − 𝑐1 − 𝜃                                 (4)
                                   𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +
                                                                  𝑐2


For any price pair, the firm chooses to face the price in the higher-price period (if output

represents emissions and the price is an emissions tax, then higher price means a lower tax). If

period 1 has the higher price, then the firm will borrow all of its quantity from the second period

and pay it all in the first period. This is merely the simple intuition that, when the firm can

choose its price, it will choose the highest price that it can get.4 But, because the cost function is

identical across periods and convex, the firm chooses to actually produce an equal amount in

each period (𝑞1 = 𝑞2 ). Given the firm's solution, the planner's optimal policy is to set price

equal to expected marginal cost in each period, 𝑝̃𝑡 = 𝑐1 (more generally, the planner could set

either period's price anything lower than 𝑐1 and the other period's price equal to 𝑐1, since the firm

will choose to get paid the higher price). It follows that the outcome will be the same under this
                                                                            𝐴      𝐴
policy as it is under the non-bankable price policy (equation 2), so that 𝐸𝑊𝐵𝑃 = 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃 and

 𝐴
Δ𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝐵𝑃 = 0. Just like with the quantity policy, in scenario A banking offers no advantage to a

price policy.

 In all scenarios considered in this paper, this simple intuition remains, since the firm can always perfectly
anticipate the planner's policy and both period's prices. An extension to this framework would be to consider a case
where the firm does not know the prices with certainty and may hedge by banking only some of its emissions.

        The first row of Table 1 summarizes the expected welfare under each of the four policy

options, each expressed relative to expected welfare under non-bankable quantities (2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 )).

The remaining rows present the corresponding expressions for the remaining scenarios below.



II. B. Scenario B: Identical shocks, Policy updating

        Maintain the assumption that the shocks are identical across periods. But now the

planner is able to observe the value of the shocks 𝜃 and 𝜂 at the end of period 1 and update its

period 2 policy in response.5 This is identical to the main specification of uncertainty in Pizer

                                                                                                           𝜂−𝜃
and Prest (2016). As in scenario A, the ex-post first-best output level is 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏                        .
                                                                                                           2 +𝑐2


        Under a non-bankable price policy the firm's problem is again trivial (𝑞𝑡 = 𝑞̃𝑡 ). The

planner's problem can be considered separately by the two periods, since the planner has

different information in each period. At the start of period 2, the planner observes the values of

the shocks and chooses its quantity constraint 𝑞̃2 . The planner's optimal policy in period 2 is to

                                                                           𝜂−𝜃
set the constraint just equal to the optimal quantity: 𝑞̃2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏                . In the first period, the
                                                                           2 +𝑐2


planner knows that it will set that quantity in the second period but doesn't yet know what values

the shocks take. Choosing the first-period quantity that maximizes expected welfare yields 𝑞̃1 =

𝑞̂. Given this policy, the expected welfare of the non-bankable price policy is

                                     𝐵
                                                          1 𝜎𝜂2 + 𝜎𝜃2                                              (5)
                                   𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄                )
                                             = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 + (          )
                                                          2 𝑏2 + 𝑐2

 The planner can update in response to the observed values of the shocks but not in response to observing the level
of the bank 𝐵 as in Kollenberg and Taschini (2016).

          For a non-bankable price policy, the firm's response to policy is identical to what it is in

                                     𝑝̃𝑡 −𝑐1 −𝜃
scenario A: 𝑞𝑡 = ℎ(𝑝̃𝑡 , 𝜃) ≡ 𝑞̂ +                . At the start of period 2, the planner observes the
                                        𝑐2


shocks and sets the price policy to maximize welfare. This results in the planner achieving the

                                                      𝜂−𝜃                               𝑏2 𝜃+𝑐2 𝜂
first-best output level in period 2, 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏              , by setting 𝑝̃2 = 𝑐1 +               . In the first
                                                      2 +𝑐2                              𝑏2 +𝑐2


period, the planner will set 𝑝̃1 = 𝑐1 (without observing the shock value the planner just sets price

                                                                      𝜃
equal to expected marginal cost), which yields 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ − 𝑐 . As a result, the expected welfare
                                                                       2


will be

                          𝐵
                                                1 𝜎𝜂2 + 𝜎𝜃2    𝜎𝜃2                                                       (6)
                        𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃    = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ) + (          ) + 2 (𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )
                                                2 𝑏2 + 𝑐2      2𝑐2


Comparing this equation to equation 5 yields

                                                         𝜎𝜃2                                                             (7)
                                       Δ𝐵𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑄 =           (𝑐 − 𝑏2 )
                                                         2𝑐22 2


This expression is identical to the original Weitzman (1974) prices vs. quantities expression,

because here the two outcomes are identical to each other in the second period, and in the first

period the problem is identical to the one-period Weitzman (1974) problem.

          Next is the bankable quantity policy. Just as in scenario A without policy updating, the

firm will always want to perfectly smooth its output across the two periods, given its identical

and convex cost curves and its unlimited ability to bank and borrow. So, for any allocated

                                                                                                               𝑞̃1 +𝑞̃2
quantities 𝑞̃1 and 𝑞̃2 it will choose a level of banking or borrowing to achieve 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 =                                .
                                                                                                                     2

In the second period, after the planner has observed the values of the shocks, it will choose a

second-period policy level 𝑞̃2 to induce the optimal level of second-period output 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +
                                                            13

    𝜂−𝜃
          . To induce this, the planner can set any arbitrary quantity 𝑞̃1 in the first period, knowing
𝑏2 +𝑐2


that once it observes the shocks before the second period, it can respond by setting its second-

                                                                        𝜂−𝜃
period quantity policy so that the sum 𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 = 2 (𝑞̂ + 𝑏                     ), in which case the firm will
                                                                         2 +𝑐2


smooth and achieve the optimal output in each period.6 Therefore, a bankable quantity policy

with updating yields the first-best, as shown in Pizer and Prest (2016). This first-best outcome

results in expected welfare of

                                         𝐵
                                                                  𝜎𝜂2 + 𝜎𝜃2                                          (8)
                                       𝐸𝑊𝐵𝑄     = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ) + (           )
                                                                  𝑏2 + 𝑐2


Comparing this to equation 5 yields the difference

                                                       1 𝜎𝜂2 + 𝜎𝜃2                                                   (9)
                                          Δ𝐵𝐵𝑄,𝑁𝐵𝑄    = (          )>0
                                                       2 𝑏2 + 𝑐2


Bankable quantities dominate non-bankable quantities. Furthermore, comparing bankable

quantities to non-bankable prices (equations 8 and 6) yields

                                                  1            𝑏2 2 2                                                (10)
                                 Δ𝐵𝐵𝑄,𝑁𝐵𝑃   =              2
                                                         [𝜎 + ( ) 𝜎𝜃 ] > 0
                                              2(𝑏2 + 𝑐2 ) 𝜂    𝑐2


This is the main result from Pizer and Prest (2016): bankable quantities dominate non-bankable

prices under policy updating.

            However, Pizer and Prest (2016) do not allow for bankable prices. The firm's response to

this policy is the same as its response under scenario A:

                                                         max{𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 } − 𝑐1 − 𝜃                                    (11)
                                     𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +
                                                                     𝑐2

6
 The firm observes its shocks before period 1, and the firm knows what the planner's response to any arbitrary
shock will be, therefore the firm can perfectly anticipate the planner's second-period strategy at the start of the first
period though the planner does not choose it until the second period.
                                                    14




That is, just as with bankable prices, the firm will perfectly smooth its output over the two

periods. Furthermore, the firm will be able to "choose" its price among the two period's prices

by banking or borrowing such that it receives the maximum of the two prices. Given this firm

response, the planner is able to induce the first best in both periods. In the second period, after

                                                                                        𝑏2 𝜃+𝑐2 𝜂
observing the shock, it sets the price that induces the optimal outcome, 𝑝̃2 = 𝑐1 +                 . The
                                                                                         𝑏2 +𝑐2


first-period price can be anything arbitrary low enough to ensure that it is always lower than the

first-period price. Thus, the planner knows that the firm will actually face the second-period

price, and it knows that by the second period it will have enough information to set that price to

achieve the first-best. Therefore, the bankable price policy induces the first-best outcome 𝑞1 =

           𝜂−𝜃
𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏        , just as the bankable quantity policy does, so that Δ𝐵𝐵𝑄,𝐵𝑃 = 0. In contrast to the
           2 +𝑐2


result from Pizer and Prest (2016), here quantities do not strictly dominate prices under policy

updating. They do so in the Pizer and Prest (2016) model where only quantities are allowed to

be banked. But, when a price policy also allows banking, then both the price and the quantity

policy are equivalent (and both strictly dominate a non-bankable price policy and a non-bankable

quantity policy).

       The specification of uncertainty that allows for policy updating (used here in Scenario B

and also in Scenario D) requires some assumptions that may be seen as heroic. The firm and

planner are engaged in a mutual rational expectations equilibrium where each one's optimal

action is contingent on a self-fulfilling expectation of the other's action. The firm knows its

shock values from the start, and it knows that the planner will observe those values only after

period 1. The firm knows that the planner will update optimally after period 1 and makes its

decisions with that in mind. The planner anticipates the firm's decision and sets its policy with
                                                          15


that in mind. This degree of rationality may be unrealistic to assume in a situation where real-

world regulators are interacting with real-world firms.

         The second row of Table 1 summarizes the results for Scenario B. As in the first row,

each expected welfare expression is relative to the expected welfare of non-bankable quantities

in scenario A; that is, it omits the term 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ).



II. C. Scenario C: Correlated shocks, No policy updating

         In this scenario no longer allow for policy updating; that is, the planner never observes

the shocks and so cannot alter the policy between the two periods. However, here the shocks are

not identical across the two periods. Instead, they follow autoregressive processes given by:

                                                  𝜃2 = 𝜌𝜃 𝜃1 + 𝜀𝜃

                                                  𝜂2 = 𝜌𝜂 𝜂1 + 𝜀𝜂

The first-period shock values 𝜃1 and 𝜂1 are normally distributed with variances 𝜎𝜃2 and 𝜎𝜂2 ,

respectively, and they are independent of the second-period innovations 𝜀𝜃 and 𝜀𝜂 . Thus, for the

planner, as in the previous scenarios, 𝐸[𝜃1 ] = 𝐸[𝜃2 ] = 𝐸[𝜂1 ] = 𝐸[𝜂2 ] = 𝐸[𝜃𝑙 𝜂𝑚 ] = 0, and

𝐸[𝜃12 ] = 𝜎𝜃2 , 𝐸[𝜂12 ] = 𝜎𝜂2 . However, now 𝐸[𝜃22 ] = 𝜎𝜃2 (𝜌𝜃2 + 1), 𝐸[𝜃1 𝜃2 ] = 𝜌𝜃 𝜎𝜃2 , 𝐸[𝜂22 ] =

                                                                                                                 𝜂 −𝜃
𝜎𝜂2 (𝜌𝜂2 + 1), 𝐸[𝜂1 𝜂2 ] = 𝜌𝜂 𝜎𝜂2 .7 In this scenario the ex-post first-best outcome is 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏1 +𝑐 1
                                                                                                                  2   2


                 𝜂 −𝜃
and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏2 +𝑐2.

  Weitzman (2018), which allows for correlated heterogeneous shocks but not policy updating, considers a more
general specification that allows for any joint distribution of the two periods' shock values. The specification here is
a special case of that more general specification, although the intuitions gleaned from the general case can also be
gleaned from the special case.
                                                              16


       First consider the non-bankable quantity policy. The firm's response to this policy is as

always trivial: 𝑞1 = 𝑞̃1 ; 𝑞2 = 𝑞̃2 . Given this response, the planner chooses 𝑞̃1 = 𝑞̃2 = 𝑞̂ to

maximize expected welfare, which ends up being

                                              𝐶                                                         (12)
                                            𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 )



       Next consider the non-bankable price policy. The firm's response to these prices is the

same as in the previous scenarios, except now noting that the firm observes different shocks each

                    𝑝̃1 −𝑐1 −𝜃1                 𝑝̃2 −𝑐1 −𝜃2
period: 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +                 ; 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +                 . Knowing these responses but only knowing the
                        𝑐2                          𝑐2


distribution and not the values of all of the shocks, the planner maximizes expected welfare by

choosing 𝑝̃1 = 𝑝̃2 = 𝑐1; that is, the planner sets price equal to expected marginal damages (just

as in scenario A). Then, given this optimal policy, the expected welfare under the non-bankable

price policy is

                               𝐶
                                                                𝜎𝜃2 2                                   (13)
                             𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ) +                  (𝜌 + 2)(𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )
                                                                2𝑐22 𝜃


It follows that the advantage of non-bankable prices over non-bankable quantities is

                                                      𝜎𝜃2 2                                             (14)
                                      Δ𝐶𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑄     =    (𝜌 + 2)(𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )
                                                      𝑐2 𝜃


This is a slightly modified version of the standard Weitzman (1974) result, accounting for the

two periods and the correlation of the cost shock across periods 𝜌𝜃 . This result is identical to the

corresponding result in Weitzman (2018) (his equation 42) after imposing the specification of the

AR process for the shock.

       Next consider the bankable quantity policy. Now, the firm will still want to smooth

output over the two periods since it is free to bank and borrow. However, it will not perfectly
                                                                  17


smooth to the point where 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 , since the shocks are different across periods. Its cost-

minimizing response to the policy is

                                                 𝑞1 =      (𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 ) −
                                                         2                  2𝑐2

                                                         1                𝜃1 − 𝜃2
                                                 𝑞2 =      (𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 ) +
                                                         2                  2𝑐2

                                                    1               𝜃1 − 𝜃2
                                                 𝐵 = (𝑞̃1 − 𝑞̃2 ) +
                                                    2                 2𝑐2

                                                                       1                               𝜃1 −𝜃2
The smoothness is perfect across the two periods (2 (𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 )) except for the adjustment                     .
                                                                                                        2𝑐2


If that expression is positive, i.e. 𝜃1 > 𝜃2 , then the cost is higher in the first period than it is in

the second period, so the firm produces a little bit less in the first period than in the second

period and vice versa. Only the bank value 𝐵 depends on the difference in the assigned

quantities across periods; the chosen output levels only depend on their sum and on the shocks.

Given this firm response, the planner can set the quantities 𝑞̃1 and 𝑞̃2 to maximize expected

welfare. However, as in the previous scenarios, the planner actually need only choose the sum

𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 , since firms will respond just to that sum.8 The optimal policy for the planner is 𝑞̃1 +

𝑞̃2 = 2𝑞̂; i.e., it chooses the expected value of welfare-maximizing quantity. Lastly, given this

optimal policy by the firm, the expected welfare under this policy is

                                 𝐶
                                                               𝜎𝜃2 2                                      (15)
                               𝐸𝑊𝐵𝑄 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ) +                (𝜌 − 2𝜌𝜃 + 2)(𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )
                                                               4𝑐22 𝜃


(This is identical to the corresponding equation in Weitzman (2018), equation 25, after imposing

the AR structure.) The term in parenthesis (𝜌𝜃2 − 2𝜌𝜃 + 2) is strictly positive since 0 < 𝜌𝜃 < 1.

    That is, the firm's response to {𝑞̃1 , 𝑞̃2 } is identical to its response to {𝑞̃1 + 𝑥, 𝑞̃2 − 𝑥}.
                                                 18


       At this point, before considering the bankable price policy, compare the three policies

considered so far in scenario C. These are the same three policies considered in Weitzman

(2018), which (like Pizer and Prest (2016)) ignores bankable prices. As shown earlier, the

                                                                                  𝜎𝜃2
advantage of non-bankable prices over non-bankable quantities is Δ𝐶𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑄 =            (𝜌𝜃2 + 2)(𝑐2 −
                                                                                  𝑐2


𝑏2 ), which is positive whenever 𝑐2 > 𝑏2 , i.e. marginal cost is steeper than marginal benefit. The

advantage of bankable quantities over non-bankable quantities is

                                          𝜎𝜃2 2                                                   (16)
                            Δ𝐶𝐵𝑄,𝑁𝐵𝑄 =        (𝜌 − 2𝜌𝜃 + 2)(𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )
                                          4𝑐22 𝜃


This expression has the same sign as (𝑐2 − 𝑏2 ), so bankable quantities dominate non-bankable

quantities if and only if marginal cost is steeper than marginal benefit. This is identical to the

surprising result in Weitzman (2018) (his equation 47) that bankable quantities are not

unambiguously preferred to non-bankable quantities. The explanation is that bankable quantities

are unambiguously preferred on cost grounds, but not necessarily so when benefits are factored

in as well (as they are in the calculation of expected welfare). The non-bankable quantity policy

keeps quantity equal across periods, which is definitely not cost-effective. But, maintaining a

constant quantity is welfare-improving vis-à-vis benefits. When marginal benefits are steeper

than marginal costs, this smoothing over benefits dominates the lack of smoothing over costs.

       The advantage of bankable quantities over non-bankable prices is

                                          𝜎𝜃2 2                                                   (17)
                             Δ𝐶𝐵𝑄,𝑁𝐵𝑃 =       (𝜌 + 2𝜌𝜃 + 2)(𝑏2 − 𝑐2 )
                                          4𝑐22 𝜃


This is positive whenever 𝑏2 > 𝑐2 , so bankable quantities dominate non-bankable prices if and

only if marginal benefit is steeper than marginal cost. When comparing only these three policies,

this yields the result that non-bankable prices dominate bankable quantities, which dominate
                                                   19


non-bankable quantities whenever 𝑐2 > 𝑏2 , and that non-bankable quantities dominate bankable

quantities, which dominate non-bankable prices, whenever 𝑐2 > 𝑏2 , the result found in

Weitzman (2018).

       Does adding the fourth policy option – bankable prices – affect that ranking? The answer

is no, because bankable prices in this scenario are equivalent to non-bankable prices. To see

that, consider first the firm's response under bankable prices. It will still choose the period with

the highest price to bank or borrow all of its quantity to, and optimize in each period based on

that price. Its optimal output in each period is

                                              max{𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 } − 𝑐1 − 𝜃1
                                 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +
                                                          𝑐2

                                              max{𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 } − 𝑐1 − 𝜃2
                                 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +
                                                          𝑐2

The planner thus only needs to choose one effective price 𝑝̃, and its optimal price is 𝑝̃ = 𝑐1 . In

                                          𝜃                   𝜃
response, the firm will choose 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ − 𝑐1 and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ − 𝑐2 , and this will result in expected

welfare of

                                                    𝜎𝜃2 2                                         (18)
                          𝐸𝑊𝐵𝑃   = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ) +        (𝜌 + 2)(𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )
                                                    2𝑐22 𝜃


                                                     𝐶
This expression is identical to the expression for 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃 in equation 13, since under either policy

the planner chooses price such that the firm faces the expected marginal cost 𝑐1 in each period.

It follows that in scenario C, the addition of bankable prices does not change the ranking found

earlier when just considering the three other policies. Unlike in the case with policy updating

(scenario B), here in scenario C with correlated shocks, bankability provides no advantage over

non-bankability to a price policy.
                                                             20


         The third row of Table 1 summarizes the results from scenario C. It is not the case that

scenario C reduces to scenario A when 𝜌𝜃 = 𝜌𝜂 = 1, because there are innovations in the

second-period (𝜀𝜃 and 𝜀𝜂 ) that prevent the two periods' shock values from being identical to each

other.9 Furthermore, when 𝜌𝜃 = 0, expected welfare under scenarios A and C are identical to

each other for both price policies, though it is not the case that the two scenarios are identical to

each other.



II. D. Scenario D: Correlated shocks, policy updating

         The final scenario is the most general, since it includes both correlated shocks and policy

updating. After the first period, the planner observes the values of the first-period shocks 𝜃1 and

𝜂1 and can set the second-period policy in response to it. The planner never observes the second-

period shocks. This scenario thus generalizes both the model from Pizer and Prest (2016), which

considers only policy updating, and from Weitzman (2018), which considers only correlated

shocks. In addition to this generalization of those two models, here I also consider a bankable

price policy in addition to the other three policies. As in scenario C, the ex-post first-best

                          𝜂 −𝜃                     𝜂 −𝜃
outcome is 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏1 +𝑐 1 and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏2 +𝑐 2.

         First I consider the non-bankable quantity policy, where the firm's problem is again

trivial since it must choose 𝑞1 = 𝑞̃1 and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̃2. The planner will set

                                                             𝜌𝜂 𝜂1 − 𝜌𝜃 𝜃1
                                              𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +
                                                                𝑏2 + 𝑐2

                                                         𝑞1 = 𝑞̂

  In order to nest scenario A as a special case of scenario C, I would have to specify that the innovation to the
                                                                 2                                           2
second-period cost shock (𝜀𝜃 ) has a different variance (say, 𝜎𝜃2  ) than the first-period cost shock (say, 𝜎𝜃1 ), and
likewise for the benefit shocks. This would introduce another variable and in my assessment make the model less
tractable without providing additional insight.

In both periods, the planner sets the quantity policy equal to the value that maximizes expected

net welfare, conditional on the planner's information set. In period 1, before observing any

shocks, that value is just 𝑞̂. After the planner observes the first-period shocks, the optimal

quantity is updated. Given this optimal policy, the expected welfare is

                                 𝐷
                                                             1 𝜌𝜂2 𝜎𝜂2 + 𝜌𝜃2 𝜎𝜃2                                (19)
                               𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄   = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ) +
                                                             2 𝑏2 + 𝑐2


          Next consider the non-bankable price policy. As in scenario B, the firm's response to the

                                         𝑝̃1 −𝑐1 −𝜃1                   𝑝̃2 −𝑐1 −𝜃2
pair of prices is to produce 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +                 and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +                 . The planner's problem is
                                             𝑐2                              𝑐2


again in two stages: the period 2 policy 𝑝̃2 is chosen after the observation of the first-period

shocks, while the period 1 policy 𝑝̃1 is chosen before. The planner's optimal policy is

                                                  𝑝̃1 = 𝑐1

                                                   𝑐2 𝜌𝜂 𝜂1 + 𝑏2 𝜌𝜃 𝜃1
                                     𝑝̃2 = 𝑐1 +
                                                         𝑏2 + 𝑐2

                                                                        𝜃                     1 𝑐2 𝜌𝜂 𝜂1 +𝑏2 𝜌𝜃 𝜃1
This pair of prices will result in the firm producing 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ − 𝑐1 and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑐                                   −
                                                                         2                     2     𝑏2 +𝑐2

𝜃2
     . Substituting these values into the expression for expected welfare (evaluated before
𝑐2


observing the values of the shocks) yields

                         𝐷
                                                   1 𝜌𝜂2 𝜎𝜂2 + 𝜌𝜃2 𝜎𝜃2 𝜎𝜃2                                      (20)

Comparing expected welfare under the non-bankable quantity policy to expected welfare under

the non-bankable price policy yields the difference

                                                        𝜎𝜃2                                                     (21)

Prices dominate quantities whenever 𝑐2 > 𝑏2 , as in Weitzman (1974).

         Next consider the bankable quantity policy. Just as in scenario C, the firm's response to

                  1               𝜃1 −𝜃2             1                 𝜃1 −𝜃2
policy is 𝑞1 = 2 (𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 ) −            and 𝑞2 = 2 (𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 ) +            . Here the planner's policy
                                   2𝑐2                                  2𝑐2


choice is to set the sum 𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 to maximize expected welfare. After the first period the planner

observes 𝜃1 and 𝜂1 , and so it can set its second-period policy 𝑞̃2 as a function of these variables.

It cannot do so in the first period. However, the planner can choose any arbitrarily low first-

period policy (e.g. 𝑞̃1 = 0) knowing that the firm will respond only to the sum of the two policies

𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 , and so the firm can set this sum after the second period and in response to the first-

period shock values. The planner's problem is thus to choose the sum 𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 to maximize

expected welfare, conditional on observing the first-period shocks, and subject to constraints
                                                                                             1
given by the firm's response. This problem yield's the planner's solution 𝑞̃ ≡ 2 (𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 ) = 𝑞̂ +

1 𝜂1 (1+𝜌𝜂 )−𝜃1 (1+𝜌𝜃 )
                      . The planner sets the average quantity across the two periods equal to the
2        𝑏2 +𝑐2


planner's best guess about what the optimal quantity will be on average, knowing only the first-

period shocks. The firm's response to this policy is

                                           1 𝜂1 (1 + 𝜌𝜂 ) − 𝜃1 (1 + 𝜌𝜃 ) 𝜃1 − 𝜃2
                            𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +                                   −
                                           2          𝑏2 + 𝑐2              2𝑐2

                                           1 𝜂1 (1 + 𝜌𝜂 ) − 𝜃1 (1 + 𝜌𝜃 ) 𝜃1 − 𝜃2
                            𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +                                   +
                                           2          𝑏2 + 𝑐2              2𝑐2

Comparing this expected welfare to that of the expected welfare under non-bankable prices

yields the difference

                                   4                   𝑏2 + 𝑐2


The first term in this expression has the same sign as 𝑐2 − 𝑏2 . This term is analogous to the

result found here in equation 16 and in Weitzman (2018) that bankable quantities dominate non-

bankable quantities only when 𝑐2 > 𝑏2 . However, in addition there is the second term of

equation 23, which is strictly nonnegative. This second term captures the fact that there is an

advantage of bankability, regardless of the slopes of the marginal cost and marginal benefit

curves, since the firm (which has more information than the planner) is able to smooth out the

shocks and reduce costs with bankability. This term is missing in the model from Weitzman

(2018) since that model does not consider policy updating.

       Lastly consider the bankable price policy. As in scenario C, the firm's optimal response

                            max{𝑝̃1 ,𝑝̃2 }−𝑐1 −𝜃1                 max{𝑝̃1 ,𝑝̃2 }−𝑐1 −𝜃2
to a policy is 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +                            ; 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +                           . The planner's problem is
                                      𝑐2                                   𝑐2


similar to its problem under the bankable quantity policy – since it observes the first-period

shock values before the start of the second period, it can set its first-period price arbitrarily low

so that the second-period price is always binding, and therefore it can set this price to maximize

expected welfare conditional on observing the first-period shock values. Doing so, the planner
                        1
chooses 𝑝̃ = 𝑐1 + 2(𝑏             (𝑏2 (1 + 𝜌𝜃 )𝜃1 + 𝑐2 (1 + 𝜌𝜂 )𝜂1 ). This is the planner's expected value
                        2 +𝑐2 )


of the average marginal cost across the two periods given its observation of the first-period

shocks. In response to this policy, the firm chooses to produce

                                4                   𝑏2 + 𝑐2


The first term has the opposite sign as 𝑐2 − 𝑏2 . Compare that to the first term in equation 23,

which has the same sign as 𝑐2 − 𝑏2 . These terms represent the same effect, which goes in

opposite directions for bankable prices and bankable quantities. When marginal cost is steeper

than marginal benefit, there is an effect that yields an advantage to bankability for quantity

policies. This same effect yields an advantage to non-bankability over bankability for quantity

when marginal benefit is steeper than marginal cost. This is the effect identified in Weitzman

(2018). But for price policies, this effect works in the opposite direction. When marginal cost is
                                                 25


steeper than marginal benefit, non-bankability is preferred to bankability for price policies, and

when marginal benefit is steeper than marginal cost, bankability is preferred.

       The explanation for this, just like the explanation for the first term in equation 23, lies in

the trade-off between achieving cost-effectiveness and achieving "benefit-effectiveness," or

smoothing between periods so that marginal benefits are equal. For a quantity policy, making it

bankable ensures cost-effectiveness since firms will smooth to minimize costs, but this may

come at a cost of reducing benefits. For a price policy, making it bankable ensures that the firm

faces the same price in each period, which is not necessarily cost-effective since the cost shocks

vary across the two periods. But, relative to non-bankable prices, it forces the firm to more

efficiently internalize benefits. Thus, when marginal benefits are steeper and internalizing these

benefits is relatively more important, bankability dominates non-bankability for prices.

       In addition to that effect, there is another effect, captured in the second term in equation

25, and also in the second term in equation 23, that is unambiguously positive, so that it yields an

advantage to bankability regardless of the relative slopes, for either quantities or prices. This

term is absent in Weitzman (2018) and is due to policy updating – the planner's ability to do so

allows the firm to more cost-effectively smooth output over the two periods than it otherwise

would have.

       Equation 25 demonstrates that when 𝑐2 > 𝑏2 there are two offsetting effects in the

ranking of bankable versus non-bankable prices. The first term is negative and the second term is

positive. However, it can be shown that the first term is always dominated by the second term so

that the sign of Δ𝐷
                  𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑃 is always positive. Equation 25 can be rearranged to yield


                                                             2               22

                                                26


All terms in equation 26 are unambiguously positive. Thus there is an important distinction

between the advantage that bankability offers to price policies and the advantage that it offers to

quantity policies. Bankability is unambiguously preferred for price policies, but sometimes non-

bankability can dominate bankability for quantity policies, as shown in equation 23. Later, in the

numerical simulations, I verify this claim by finding parameter values that make it true.

       Next,

                                                𝜎𝜃2                                            (27)

                                                4𝑐22 2


This has the same sign as 𝑐2 − 𝑏2 . Just as in the original Weitzman (1974) model, prices

dominate quantities whenever marginal cost is steeper than marginal benefit; this holds even

when both prices and quantities are bankable, and even when shocks are correlated and policy

updating is available.

       Comparing all four policy options in Scenario D allows me to make the following claim.

When 𝑐2 > 𝑏2 , then non-bankable prices dominate non-bankable quantities (from Δ𝐷
                                                                                𝑁𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑄 , the


standard Weitzman (1974) result), bankable prices dominate bankable quantities (from Δ𝐷
                                                                                      𝐵𝑃,𝐵𝑄 ),


and bankable prices dominate non-bankable prices (from Δ𝐷
                                                        𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑃 in equation 26). When 𝑐2 <


𝑏2 , then non-bankable quantities dominate non-bankable prices, bankable quantities dominate

bankable prices, but the advantage of bankable quantities over non-bankable quantities is

ambiguous (from Δ𝐷
                 𝐵𝑄,𝑁𝐵𝑄 ). That is, quantities unambiguously dominate prices, but whether


bankability dominates non-bankability depends upon the parameter values.



II. E. Multi-period (𝑇 > 2)
                                                   27


        All of the previous scenarios consider just two time periods, but the basic intuitions

derived in them extend to a model with more than two time periods. For instance, when a

policy-maker can update after each period, she will choose to set the policy in the period in

which she has the most information, which is the final period. With bankable quantities, the

quantity allocated in the final period will determine the total quantity available, and with

bankable prices, the price set in the final period will be the binding price. In other words, while

in the two-period model, the policy-maker will "true up" the policy in the second period after

observing the shock, when 𝑇 > 2 the policy-maker will true up after observing as much as

possible in the final period.

        More concretely, consider the extension of Scenario D to the 𝑇 > 2 case. For the non-

bankable quantity policy, the optimal policy is 𝑞̃𝑡 = 𝑞̂ in all periods, and expected welfare is
  𝑀𝑃
𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 = 𝑇(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ), where the 𝑀𝑃 superscript denotes "multi-period." For the non-bankable

                                                                                                       𝜃
price policy, the optimal policy is 𝑝̃𝑡 = 𝑐1 in all periods, resulting in a quantity of 𝑞𝑡 = 𝑞̂ − 𝑐 𝑡 ,
                                                                                                        2



                          𝑀𝑃                         𝜎2
and expected welfare is 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃 = 𝑇 (𝑏0 − 𝑐0 + 2𝑐𝜃2 (𝑐2 − 𝑏2 )). The ranking between these two
                                                        2



policies is identical to that in the two-period case.

        The bankable quantity and bankable price policies are more complicated in the 𝑇 > 2

case. Consider first the bankable quantity case. The firm's problem is to choose its production

profile 𝑞1 , … 𝑞𝑇 to minimize costs in response to the policy variables 𝑞̃1 , … , 𝑞̃𝑇 and its observed

shock values 𝜃1 , … , 𝜃𝑇 . The banking and borrowing constraint is ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑞𝑡 = ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑞̃𝑡 . It can be

                                                                     ∑𝑞̃𝑡     ∑𝜃     𝜃
shown that the firm's solution is to produce in each period 𝑞𝑡 =            + 𝑇𝑐 𝑡 − 𝑐 𝑡 . The first term is
                                                                      𝑇          2    2


just the average allotment; if there were no cost shocks 𝜃 the firm would perfectly smooth
                                                    28


production. The second term is the adjustment based on the average cost shock, and the third

term is the adjustment based on the period 𝑡 cost shock.

        Given the firm's solution, the planner's solution is to choose the profile of policy variables

𝑞̃1 , … , 𝑞̃𝑇 to maximize expected welfare, though only the sum ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑞̃𝑡 matters. Since the planner

can true up the sum after observing the second-to-last-period shock, the expectations are taken

conditional on all shocks except for 𝜂𝑇 and 𝜃𝑇 . The expression for expected welfare that must be

maximized includes expectations of random variables across multiple time periods (e.g. 𝐸[𝜂𝑠 𝜂𝑡 ]

for arbitrary 𝑠 and 𝑡) and is thus generally intractable.

        Consider next the bankable price case. The firm's problem is to choose its production

profile 𝑞1 , … 𝑞𝑇 and the amount of output subject to the price in each period 𝑞1𝐵 , … , 𝑞𝑇𝐵 to

maximize net revenue in response to the policy variables 𝑝̃1 , … , 𝑝̃𝑇 and its observed shock values

𝜃1 , … , 𝜃𝑇 . That is, 𝑞𝑡 is the amount actually produced in period 𝑡, while 𝑞𝑡𝐵 is the amount for

which the firm earns revenue 𝑝̃𝑡 𝑞𝑡𝐵 in period 𝑡 after banking or borrowing. The banking and

borrowing constraint is ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑞𝑡 = ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑞𝑡𝐵 . Obviously the firm will choose to earn all revenue in

the period with the highest price; let 𝑝̃ = max{𝑝̃1 , … , 𝑝̃𝑇 }, then 𝑞𝑡𝐵 = ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑞𝑡 and 𝑞𝑠𝐵 = 0 ∀𝑠 ≠ 𝑡.

                                            𝑝̃−𝑐1 −𝜃𝑡
This yields the firm's solution 𝑞𝑡 = 𝑞̂ +      𝑐2
                                                        .

        Given the firm's solution, the planner will choose a 𝑝̃ in the final period, after observing

all of the shock values except for the final period's 𝜂𝑇 and 𝜃𝑇 , to maximize expected welfare. As

with the solution for the optimal bankable quantity policy, the solution here is generally

intractable.

        Though closed-form solutions are not presented here for bankable policies in the 𝑇 > 2

case, the intuition from the two-period model remains. With policy updating possible, the
                                                        29


planner will wait until the last period to use all available information before setting the binding

policy variable.10



III. Simulations

        I provide numerical simulations of the analytical results presented from scenario D to

assist in the interpretation of the effects that have been identified. Several parameter values are

taken from the previous literature when applying the model to the case of regulating carbon

dioxide to combat climate change. From Pizer and Prest (2016), I set the marginal benefit slope

𝑏2 = 0 $/𝑡𝑜𝑛2 and the marginal cost slope 𝑐2 = 1.6 × 10−7 $/𝑡𝑜𝑛2 . Pizer and Prest (2016) use

56 ($/𝑡𝑜𝑛)2 as the variance of the benefit shock 𝜎𝜂2 . For the variance of the cost shock 𝜎𝜃2 , I use

169 ($/𝑡𝑜𝑛)2 , which was used by Newell and Pizer (2003). Finally, Newell and Pizer (2003)

set the persistence of the cost shock 𝜌𝜃 = 0.8. All of these parameter values are the base-case

values. I could not find a source for the persistence of the benefit shock 𝜌𝜂 , which is absent in

Newell and Pizer's (2003) model.

        Regardless of the value of 𝜌𝜂 , at these base-case values the results from scenario D

demonstrate that a bankable price policy always dominates the other three policies. Because

𝑐2 > 𝑏2 , prices dominate quantities, and equation 26 demonstrates that bankable prices always

dominate non-bankable prices. I use equation 26 (or equation 25) to evaluate the dollar value of

the expected gain from bankable prices relative to non-bankable prices. This value depends on

𝜌𝜂 and is higher with a higher value of 𝜌𝜂 . It ranges from $88 million when 𝜌𝜂 = 0 to $175

million when 𝜌𝜂 = 1. Since this is a two-period model, and that is the total expected welfare



10
  A model with infinite periods may produce more complications – in particular a lack of an equilibrium due to the
fact that the firm may keep putting off paying any taxes indefinitely.
                                                 30


benefit over both period, the annual welfare gain of a bankable price policy relative to a non-

bankable price policy ranges from $44 million to $88 million. By comparison, the annual

welfare gain of a non-bankable price policy relative to a non-bankable quantity policy is $528

million (independent of 𝜌𝜂 ). Thus, the gain in adding bankability to a price policy is about an

order of magnitude smaller than the gain in moving from a quantity to a price policy.

       While this holds for the base case, for other parameter values the gain in moving from

non-bankable prices to bankable prices can be even larger than the gain in moving from non-

bankable quantities to non-bankable prices. For instance, when the variances of the cost and

benefit shock are switched for each other compared to the base case (so that 𝜎𝜂2 = 169 ($/𝑡𝑜𝑛)2,

greater than 𝜎𝜃2 = 56 ($/𝑡𝑜𝑛)2 ), then the annual welfare gain of a bankable price policy relative

to a non-bankable price policy ranges from $132 million to $264 million; the annual welfare gain

of a non-bankable price policy relative to a non-bankable quantity policy is $175 million.

       The base-case parameters provide an unambiguous dominance of bankable prices, so I

consider an alternate parameterization in which this is not so. I assume that all the parameters

are identical to the base case except that I allow the marginal benefit slope 𝑏2 to vary from 0 (the

base case) to 3.2 × 10−7 $/𝑡𝑜𝑛2 , which is twice the marginal cost slope 𝑐2 (ensuring a region

where prices dominate and a region where quantities dominate). I also allow the persistence of

the benefit shock 𝜌𝜂 , for which there is no base-case value, to vary from 0 to 1.

       Figure 1 presents simulation results from this alternative parameterization. The two

parameters 𝜌𝜂 and 𝑏2 are varied along the two dimensions. The figure displays which of the

policy options dominates: red when bankable prices dominates, blue when bankable quantities

dominates, and green when non-bankable quantities dominates.

           Whenever 𝑏2 < 𝑐2 = 1.6 × 10−7 $/𝑡𝑜𝑛2 , bankable prices strictly dominates. When

𝑏2 > 𝑐2 , quantities dominate prices, but the ranking between bankable and non-bankable

quantities can vary. In fact, the figure demonstrates that non-bankable quantities dominate only

for the highest values of 𝑏2 (at least 2.88 × 10−7 $/𝑡𝑜𝑛2 , almost double 𝑐2 ). This corresponds

to the fact that the second term in equation 23 is strictly positive, so must be kept small in

magnitude for non-bankable quantities to dominate.



IV. Conclusion

           I extend the literature comparing prices, quantities, and bankable quantities by

developing a model that allows also for bankable prices. The advantage that bankability offers to

a quantity policy can also be extended to a price policy. Whether or not bankability offers an

advantage depends on both the relative slopes of the marginal cost and benefit curves and on the

correlation across periods between the shock values. All else equal, bankability tends to offer an

advantage, but that advantage may be dominated by another effect favoring non-bankability.

           While the model is very simple, it confirms the intuition that the advantage afforded by

banking is not unique to quantity instruments. Several assumptions can be dropped to see how

bankable and non-bankable prices and quantities compare under alternative scenarios. For

example, the social benefit of the output can be a stock rather than a flow, as would be the case

for a stock pollutant like carbon dioxide.11 Uncertainty could be added on the firm's part – for

example, the firm might only observe its second-period shock values after the first period. The

policymaker may be allowed to modify the trading ratio between periods, or be allowed to set

nonlinear policies. The model could be extended to consider policies that combine a price and

quantity instrument (Pizer 2002, Burtraw et al. 2018) or political economy frictions (Weitzman

2017).

           The policy implications of this paper are in a sense obvious – I identify cases in which

allowing bankable prices can be welfare-improving. However, the real-world application may be

questionable: is a bankable price policy feasible? Bankable quantity policies have been proven

feasible, since most existing cap-and-trade markets have some provisions for intertemporal

trading.12 I am not aware of any emissions tax policies that offer any form of intertemporal

trading, but intertemporal trading is allowed for other types of taxes. For example, with a

traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA), earnings and gains are taxed not when earned

but when distributed – the taxpayer gets to defer payment to a later period, with limits. A tax

loss carryforward is a tax policy that allows capital losses to be carried forward to future tax

years to offset capital gains in those years. Shon and Veliotis (2010) find evidence that

individuals strategically pre-pay deductible state income taxes to reduce their federal tax liability

– what is called "the December effect." Corporations have the option of accelerated depreciation

for their fixed assets, to reduce their tax liability. Given these real-world examples of bankable

taxes, it seems feasible that a provision for bankability could be worked in to an emissions

pricing policy. This paper demonstrates when it would be efficient to do so.

A.1 Proofs of results in text

A.1.a Scenario A

First Best

            The first-best outcome is the solution to

                                max 𝐵(𝑞̃1 , 𝜂) − 𝐶(𝑞̃1 , 𝜃) + 𝐵(𝑞̃2 , 𝜂) − 𝐶(𝑞̃2 , 𝜃),
                                𝑞1 ,𝑞2


that is,

                                         𝑏2                                      𝑐2
   max 𝑏0 + (𝑏1 + 𝜂)(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) −             (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃)(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 + 𝑏0
   𝑞1 ,𝑞2                                2                                       2

                                                 𝑏2                                      𝑐2
                         + (𝑏1 + 𝜂)(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) −      (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃)(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2
                                                 2                                       2

The derivative with respect to 𝑞1 is

                               (𝑏1 + 𝜂) − 𝑏2 (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑐1 + 𝜃) − 𝑐2 (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂).

Setting this equal to zero (noting that 𝑏1 = 𝑐1) and solving for 𝑞1 yields the solution 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +

𝜂−𝜃
         . The derivative with respect to 𝑞2 is identical except that 𝑞2 appears in it, therefore 𝑞2 =
𝑏2 +𝑐2

Non-bankable quantity

            Under the non-bankable quantity policy, the planner's problem is to maximize expected

utility, not knowing the values of the shocks:

                                            𝑏2                                      𝑐2
  max 𝐸 [𝑏0 + (𝑏1 + 𝜂)(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) −              (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃)(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 + 𝑏0
  𝑞1 ,𝑞2                                    2                                       2

                                                 𝑏2                                      𝑐2
                         + (𝑏1 + 𝜂)(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) −      (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃)(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 ]
                                                 2                                       2

This becomes

                                   𝑏2                                 𝑐2
   max 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) −            (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − 𝑐1 (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 + 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)
   𝑞1 ,𝑞2                          2                                  2

                           𝑏2                                 𝑐2
                       −      (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − 𝑐1 (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2
                           2                                  2

Taking the first-order condition with respect to 𝑞1 yields 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂, and likewise for 𝑞2 : 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂.

Given this policy, the expected welfare is expected net benefits evaluated at 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂.

Expected welfare is

                                      𝑏2                                      𝑐2
  𝐸 [𝑏0 + (𝑏1 + 𝜂)(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) −            (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃)(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 + 𝑏0
                                      2                                       2

                                                𝑏2                                      𝑐2
                      + (𝑏1 + 𝜂)(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) −        (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃)(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 ]
                                                2                                       2
                                                                        𝐴
In this expression, all terms with 𝑞1 − 𝑞̂ or 𝑞2 − 𝑞̂ become zero, so 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ).

Non-bankable price

            Next consider the non-bankable price policy. Given a set of policies {𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 }, the firm's

problem is

The first-order condition with respect to 𝑞̃ yields 𝑞̃ = 2𝑞̂. Given these policies, the firm will

choose to produce 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ in each period, from the solution to its maximization problem

found above. Since the quantity produced in each period here is same as under the non-bankable
                                                            𝐴      𝐴
quantity policy, the expected welfare will also be equal: 𝐸𝑊𝐵𝑄 = 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ).

Bankable price

       The firm faces prices in each period 𝑝̃1 and 𝑝̃2 . It is able to bank some of its output (or

emissions) 𝐵 and pay the price in the following period. Alternatively, if 𝐵 < 0, it borrows

forward some of its output from the second period and pays for it at the first-period price. The

firm's problem thus is

                       max 𝑝̃1 (𝑞1 − 𝐵) − 𝐶(𝑞1 , 𝜃) + 𝑝̃2 (𝑞2 + 𝐵) − 𝐶(𝑞2 , 𝜃)

                                    𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑞1 − 𝐵 ≥ 0, 𝑞2 + 𝐵 ≥ 0

The non-negativity constraints come from the fact that the total amount banked cannot be

negative in any period. I use the Kuhn-Tucker method to solve this optimization problem with

inequality constraints.

Consider four cases regarding the sign of the non-negativity multipliers 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 .

Case 1: 𝝀𝟏 = 𝝀𝟐 = 𝟎

Using (3): 𝑝̃1 = 𝑝̃2

Using (1) and (2): 𝑝̃1 = 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃) and 𝑝̃2 = 𝐶′(𝑞2 , 𝜃)

Therefore, 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃) = 𝐶′(𝑞2 , 𝜃)  q1 = q2

Using (4): 𝑞1  𝐵; and Using (5): 𝑞2  –B,

q1 = q2  𝑞1  𝐵 and 𝑞1  –B  B  [−𝑞1 , 𝑞1 ]

Now, 𝑝̃1 = 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃) = (𝑐1 + 𝜃) + 𝑐2 (𝑞̃1 − 𝐵 − 𝑞̂)

                        𝑝̃1 − 𝑐1 −𝜃
This gives 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +                  = 𝑞2 (by symmetry). Case 1 holds only when the two period's
                              𝑐2


prices are equal to each other.

Case 2: 𝝀𝟏 = 𝟎, 𝝀𝟐 > 𝟎

                                                 ̃1 − c1 −θ
                                                 p
Using (1): p̃1 = C′(q1 , θ)  q1 = q̂ +             c2


Using (3): λ2 = p̃1 − p̃2 > 0  p̃1 > p̃2
                                                     43

                                                                                       p
Using (2): p̃2 − C′(q 2 , θ)+ p̃1 − p̃2 = 0  p̃1 = C′(q 2 , θ)  q 2 = q1 = q̂ +         c2

                               ̃1 − c1 −θ
                               p
Using (5): B = −q 2 = −q̂ −       c2


Using (4): q1 − B  0  q1 − (−q 2 )  0  q1 + q 2  0 which is true.

Case 2 represents the case where 𝑝̃1 > 𝑝̃2 , so that the firm borrows forward all of its second-

period output (𝐵 = −𝑞2) to get paid the higher period-1 price.

Case 3: 𝝀𝟏 > 𝟎, 𝝀𝟐 = 𝟎

                                            ̃2 − c1 −θ
                                            p
Using (2): 𝑝̃2 = 𝐶′(𝑞2 , 𝜃)  q 2 = q̂ +        c2


Using (3): λ1 = p̃2 − p̃1 > 0  p̃2 > p̃1

                                                                                      ̃2 − c1 −θ
                                                                                      p
Using (1): 𝑝̃1 − 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃)+ p̃2 − p̃1 = 0  p̃2 = C′(q1 , θ)  q1 = q 2 = q̂ +           c2


Using (4): q1 = B

Case 3 represents the case where 𝑝̃2 > 𝑝̃1 , so that the firm banks all of its first-period output

(𝐵 = 𝑞1) to get paid the higher period-2 price.

Case 4: 𝝀𝟏 > 𝟎, 𝝀𝟐 > 𝟎

Using (4): q1 = B

Using (5): q 2 = −B  q 2 = − q1  q 2 + q1 = 0

Using (1): 𝑝̃1 − 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃)+ λ1 = 0

Using λ2 from (3) and substituting in (2) yields: 𝑝̃1 − 𝐶′(𝑞2 , 𝜃)+ λ1 = 0

 𝑝̃1 − 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃)+ λ1 = 𝑝̃1 − 𝐶′(𝑞2 , 𝜃)+ λ1

 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃) = 𝐶′(𝑞2 , 𝜃)

 𝐶′(𝑞1 , 𝜃) = 𝐶′(−𝑞1 , 𝜃) since q 2 = − q1

 q1 = − q1
                                                    44


 q1 = 0

 q 2 = q1 = 0 = 𝐵

Using (1): λ1 = −p̃1 + (𝑐1 + 𝜃 + 𝑐2 (−𝑞̂)) > 0

Using (2): λ2 = −p̃2 + (𝑐2 + 𝜃 + 𝑐2 (−𝑞̂)) > 0

Case 4 is thus the trivial case where the both prices are so low that the firm chooses to produce

nothing in either period; I ignore this case.

Collecting the results from all four cases yields

                                                max{𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 } − 𝑐1 − 𝜃
                               𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +
                                                            𝑐2

The quantity produced in each period here is same as under the non-bankable price policy. So,

the expected net benefits will also be equal.

Identical to scenario A, ex-post first-best output level is 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏       .

Non-bankable quantity

       The firm has no choice but to produce {𝑞̃1 , 𝑞̃2 }. The planner's problem is now a two-

period problem, since it can update its quantity policy after the first period. The second-period

problem is:

                                       𝑏2                                        𝑐2
     max [𝑏0 + (𝑏1 + 𝜂)(𝑞̃2 − 𝑞̂) −       (𝑞̃2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃)(𝑞̃2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞̃2 − 𝑞̂)2 ]

The first-order condition yields:

Therefore,

Substituting these two solutions for 𝑞̃1 and 𝑞̃2 into the expresstion for expected welfare (note that

Non-bankable price

           Given a set of policies {𝑝̃1 , 𝑝̃2 }, the firm's problem is same as in scenario A. Thus, 𝑞1 =

       𝑝̃1 −𝑐1 −𝜃                   𝑝̃2 −𝑐1 −𝜃
𝑞̂ +                and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +                . Given this response, the planner’s second-period problem is
          𝑐2                           𝑐2


as follows:

The first-order condition is

Solving this expression gives

                                                                     𝜃𝑏2 + 𝜂𝑐2

This implies that the firm's chosen 𝑞2 is

Therefore, 𝑞1 = 𝑞̃1 − 𝐵 =               . Similarly, 𝑞2 = 𝑞̃2 + 𝐵 =              . Let 𝑞̃1 + 𝑞̃2 ≡ 𝑞̃. Given this

The first-order condition with respect to 𝑝̃2 yields

                                                      𝑏2 𝜃 + 𝑐2 𝜂
                                         𝑝̃2 = 𝑐1 +
                                                       𝑏2 + 𝑐2

Substituting this 𝑝̃2 into the firm's choice for 𝑞2 yields

                                                     𝜂−𝜃
                                        𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ +           = 𝑞1
                                                    𝑏2 + 𝑐2

The first-period price can be anything arbitrary low enough to ensure that it is always lower than

the first-period price. Thus, the planner knows that the firm will actually face the second-period

price, and it knows that by the second period it will have enough information to set that price to

achieve the first-best.

         The resulting quantities are identical to those under the bankable price policy, and thus

the expected welfare is identical to the expected welfare under that policy.



A.1.C Scenario C

         In this scenario:

                                            𝜃2 = 𝜌𝜃 𝜃1 + 𝜀𝜃

                                              𝜂2 = 𝜌𝜂 𝜂1 + 𝜀𝜂

and,

                𝐸[𝜃1 ] = 𝐸[𝜃2 ] = 𝐸[𝜂1 ] = 𝐸[𝜂2 ] = 𝐸[𝜃𝑙 𝜂𝑚 ] = 0, 𝐸[𝜃12 ] = 𝜎𝜃2 , 𝐸[𝜂12 ] = 𝜎𝜂2 ,

                𝐸[𝜃22 ] = 𝜎𝜃2 (𝜌𝜃2 + 1), 𝐸[𝜃1 𝜃2 ] = 𝜌𝜃 𝜎𝜃2 , 𝐸[𝜂22 ] = 𝜎𝜂2 (𝜌𝜂2 + 1), 𝐸[𝜂1 𝜂2 ] = 𝜌𝜂 𝜎𝜂2

In this scenario, as calculated above in scenarios A and B, the ex-post first-best outcome will be

            𝜂 −𝜃                   𝜂 −𝜃
𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏1 +𝑐 1 and 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂ + 𝑏2 +𝑐 2. (This is the same as in the previous scenarios, except noting
             2   2                  2   2


that the shock values differ across periods.)

Non-bankable quantity

The planner's problem here is:

                                            𝑏2                                        𝑐2
 max 𝐸 [𝑏0 + (𝑏1 + 𝜂1 )(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) −             (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃1 )(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 + 𝑏0
 𝑞1 ,𝑞2                                     2                                         2

                                               𝑏2                                        𝑐2
                     + (𝑏1 + 𝜂2 )(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) −      (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃2 )(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 ]
                                               2                                         2

This becomes

                                𝑏2                                 𝑐2
   max 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) −         (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − 𝑐1 (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 + 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)
   𝑞1 ,𝑞2                       2                                  2

                          𝑏2                                 𝑐2
                      −      (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − 𝑐1 (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2
                          2                                  2

Taking the first-order condition with respect to 𝑞1 yields 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂, and likewise for 𝑞2 : 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂.

Given this policy, the expected welfare is expected net benefits evaluated at 𝑞1 = 𝑞2 = 𝑞̂.

Expected welfare is

                                    𝑏2                                        𝑐2
 𝐸 [𝑏0 + (𝑏1 + 𝜂1 )(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) −         (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃1 )(𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂)2 + 𝑏0
                                    2                                         2

                                               𝑏2                                        𝑐2
                     + (𝑏1 + 𝜂2 )(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) −      (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 − 𝑐0 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃2 )(𝑞2 − 𝑞̂) − (𝑞2 − 𝑞̂)2 ]
                                               2                                         2
                                                                        𝐶
In this expression, all terms with 𝑞1 − 𝑞̂ or 𝑞2 − 𝑞̂ become zero, so 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑄 = 2(𝑏0 − 𝑐0 ).

The first-order condition with respect to 𝑞1 is

                                                    𝑝̃1 − (𝑐1 + 𝜃1 ) − 𝑐2 (𝑞1 − 𝑞̂) = 0

Solving this for 𝑞1 yields 𝑞1 = 𝑞̂ +                                  . The first-order condition with respect to 𝑞2 yields

Bankable price

The firm faces prices in each period 𝑝̃1 and 𝑝̃2 . The firm's problem is:

Solving this gives 𝑝̃2 > 𝑝̃1 and

Case 4: 𝝀𝟏 > 𝟎, 𝝀𝟐 > 𝟎

This is the trivial case in which both periods' prices are so low as to make the firm never produce

in either period, so this case is ignored as in Scenario A.

       The planner needs to only choose any one price, say 𝑝̃, and the other (lower) price

becomes irrelevant. So, the expected net benefits will be:

The first-order condition with respect to 𝑞̃1 is

Therefore,

Substituting these two solutions for 𝑞̃1 and 𝑞̃2 into the expresstion for expected welfare (note that

all of the first-period terms with 𝑞̃1 − 𝑞̂ become zero) yields

Using 𝐸[𝜂2 𝜃2 | 𝜂1 , 𝜃1 ] = 𝜌𝜃 𝜃1 𝜌𝜂 𝜂1 and 𝐸[𝜃2 2 | 𝜂1 , 𝜃1 ] = 𝜌𝜃 𝜃12 + 𝜎𝜃2 ; and solving for the first-

Using these expectation expressions to simplify the planner’s optimization problem and then

taking the first-order condition yields:

This implies:

          The firm's response to this policy is the same as its response under scenario C:

Assuming that 𝑝̃2 is the binding price, the planner's second-period problem is

Planner will choose 𝑝̃ to maximize sum of welfare of both periods. This implies:

Using these above expressions and the optimal quantities, we can solve for planner’s maximized

For our considered parametric values, we can check that −1 + 𝜌𝜃2 − 2𝜌𝜃 < 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 1 − 𝜌𝜂2 +

2𝜌𝜂 > 0. Therefore, this above expression is positive, i.e.,

                                  Δ𝐷          𝐷      𝐷
                                   𝐵𝑃,𝑁𝐵𝑃 = 𝐸𝑊𝐵𝑃 − 𝐸𝑊𝑁𝐵𝑃 > 0


So, BP always dominates NBP irrespective of the parametric values.
