                                         ABSTRACT

Aiming to reduce the gender wage gap, several states and cities have recently adopted legislation
that prohibits employers from asking about previously earned salaries. The advocates of these
salary history bans (SHBs) have suggested pay history perpetuates past discrimination. We study
the early net impact of the first state-wide SHBs. Using both difference-in-difference and
synthetic control approaches, we find the gender earnings ratio increased by 1 percent in states
with SHBs. We find these population wide increases are driven by an increase of the gender
earnings ratio for households with all children over 5 years old, by workers over 35, and are
principally driven by those who have recently switched jobs.

1         Introduction

While researchers have debated the underlying causes of the gender wage gap for decades,

recently it has attracted mainstream political attention. With that attention, cities and states

have begun to experiment with "Salary History Bans" (SHB). Proponents of these laws have

been fairly agnostic about what the deeper causes of the gender wage gap may be. Instead,

they have concluded that whatever has caused discrimination in the past continues to be

perpetuated by questions about current salaries that are commonplace for job applicants in

today's labor markets (Barach & Horton (2017) find over 80% of respondents to a nationally

representative Google Survey were asked by their employer about past wages). This paper

offers quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of statewide salary history bans, primarily

using a synthetic control. We particularly focus on California, a large state and prominent

economic region that enacted a state-wide salary history ban on January 1, 2018. We also

study the aggregation of all states and cities that enacted SHBs through January of 2019.

        Banning questions on salary history is a blunt instrument to a seemingly complex prob-

lem. While this may have seemed natural to policy makers given questions on salary history

are ubiquitous for job seekers, the natural reaction of probably every economist is to con-

sider the unintended consequences. Indeed, Agan & Starr (2018) and Doleac & Hansen (2020)

provide evidence limiting information on criminal history in labor markets resulted in de-

creased labor market opportunities for black men due to statistical discrimination.1 Likewise

restricting drug tests resulted in lower employment for black men (Wozniak, 2015). How-

ever, while concerns about blunt policy instruments are warranted, even blunt policies can

sometimes on net have their intended effects. For instance, Cengiz et al. (2019) find min-

imum wages have decreased poverty and increased earnings for low-skill workers (footnote

about debate surrounding minimum wages). This paper provides early quasi-experimental

evidence regarding SHBs. Are they closing the gender wage gap? If so, for which workers and

industries? Naturally we expect an avalanche of new papers in coming years to investigate

how these bans may distort labor markets in unexpected ways. Those negative impacts and

labor market distortions, whatever they may be, should be weighed against whether SHBs

have their intended benefit.

   While policy makers have only proactively taken actions aimed at the gender wage gap

recently, researchers have probed potential underlying causes for decades. Despite a massive

surge in female college attainment, the convergence of the gender gap has slowed recently

(Goldin et al., 2006; Goldin, 2014). Researchers have investigated the role of occupational

sorting given recent trends towards a long-hours premium Blau & Kahn (2000); Goldin

(2014) and gender-specific preferences regarding the competitiveness of the work environ-

ment Niederle & Vesterlund (2007); Buser et al. (2014). Other approaches have sought to

measure whether productivity differentials could explain part of the gap(Blau & Kahn, 2017).

However, Sarsons (2017a,b) and have found evidence of discrimination against female work-

ers in male-dominated labor markets. Goldin (2014) explores the role of long-hours premiums

in the origin of the gender wage gap. Recent event-study approaches by Chung et al. (2017)

in the United States, and Kleven et al. (2019) in Denmark echo this potential mechanism.

They both find evidence the gender earnings gap widens at the birth of a first child, and the

gap remains throughout the next two decades. So while there is compelling evidence that the

gender wage gap expands at childbirth, current research is inconclusive that policies tied to

                                             2
children can ameliorate the situation. For instance, Bailey et al. (2019) finds that parental

leave results in decreased female labor participation, while (Nix et al., 2019) find access to

childcare may increase reentry into the labor force.

   Given the complex issues factoring into the gender earnings gap, its unclear whether a

blunt policy like a SHB would be effective in reducing the gender wage gap, or affecting

salaries at all. Indeed, in the simplest of labor market models, perfect competition, workers

are paid according to the marginal revenue product, and past salary does not factor into

this at all. However, it could be that absent full-information, salary history sends strong

signals about productivity (Kotlikoff & Gokhale, 1992; Altonji & Pierret, 2001; Oyer et al.,

2011; Lange, 2007). Other models of labor markets such as job posting or wage bargaining

raise more questions instead of provide simple answers about the predicted effects of salary

history bans. In a job posting world, the question comes back to whether SHBs change

the information firms post about jobs. In a wage bargaining world, its unclear how a SHB

affects wage bargaining. Moreover, Exley et al. (2020) find evidence that women are more

effective negotiators when they choose to negotiate. We discuss details of the laws more

in the background section, but SHBs vary in whether they legally allow firms to consider

salaries if they are volunteered by a worker. If a past salary is a strong signal of both

productivity and their reservation wage, we might expect all workers to reveal their salary

to avoid being lumped in with workers with lower prior earnings Agan et al. (2020b). If

firms have some level of monopsony power, its unclear exactly how a SHB changes the

relative power of firms. Indeed, recent research on pay transparency finds in some settings

it could increase compression (Mas, 2017), while in others it could decrease the gender

pay gap through increases in female earnings(Baker et al., 2019). Ultimately, from a policy

                                              3
perspective, whether SHBs affect labor market outcomes is an empirical question which we

aim to answer.

       To estimate whether SHBs affect labor markets, we focus on a synthetic control ap-

proach using labor market outcomes from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Abadie

et al. (2010).2 With this approach we consider the net impact of SHBs on the gender earn-

ings ratio in both CA, and the aggregation of treated units based on Appendix Table A.2.

This approach is well suited to the nature of this policy change. The policy is implemented

at the state level, with (currently) very few treated units and a relatively short after pe-

riod. Given we were in the middle of a large expansionary economic period through the end

of 2019, we also might be concerned that the common trends assumption a difference-in-

difference design would be violated. We construct our synthetic comparison with this critical

assumption in mind by matching on the lagged values of the dependent variable and using

both level and demeaned data to confirm the robustness of our results (Botosaru & Ferman,

2019; Ferman & Pinto, 2019).

       We find early evidence female earnings have increased relative to male earnings in states

passing SHBs. The estimated effects on the overall population are small and we fail to reject

that the impact is zero. However, subgroup analyses based on the age of workers, the age

of their children and job changers reveal strong heterogeneity. When we focus on CA's SHB

alone, we estimate that women over 35 see 2.3 percentage point increase in their earnings
   2
     We also find similar, albeit much larger results using a standard generalized difference-in-difference
models. Moreover, when we use a Goodman-Bacon (2018) decomposition, we find the estimated coefficients
in the difference-in-difference models are largely driven by the comparison of treated to untreated units. This
is not surprising given that the there is little variation in the timing of adoption given the recent passage of
SHBs. This makes construction of counterfactuals of treated units of first order to draw appropriate causal
inference. Moreover, Californias population represents over share of the population of treated units. The
weight OLS gives to CA is even larger given it was one of the first states to adopt a SHB. These issues
motivate our primary approach based on synthetic controls.

ratio relative to males, and that married women with all of their children over 5 see a 4.7

percentage point increase in their relative earnings ratio. Moreover, although the information

on job-switchers is limited in the CPS, our point estimates suggest that the SHB could close

the gender earnings gap by over 20 percent for those switching jobs. We find similar evidence

when using the aggregation of all treated states.3

       Our findings contribute to a growing literature about the role of information in labor

markets. Barach & Horton (2017) find evidence wage history affects hiring patterns in on-

line labor markets. They find reducing information on salary history resulting in employers

screening more applicants and hiring applicants with lower salaries at previous positions.

Agan et al. (2020a) use a field experiment to test how hiring managers respond to salary

history bans, finding that hiring professionals responses to a lack of salary information vary

by the gender of the applicant and the amount being disclosed. Thus, we have some reasons

to be concerned about unintended consequences, such as statistical discrimination, or that

salary history bans might affect the ability of firms to match with workers. However, our

findings suggest at least on net, SHBs appear to be having their intended impact, increasing

the earnings for women, particularly at an age where they likely experienced an earnings

penalty due to childbirth.4

       In Section 2, we discuss SHBs and their short history. In Section 3, we discuss our data

and methodology. In Section 4 we review our results and in Section 5 we conclude.
   3
     In this approach, we are by design assuming a common treatment date, 1/1/2018 for all regions. Given
some states began their policies either later in 2018 or the beginning of 2019, this approach should be biased
towards zero. Generally, these estimates are all qualitatively similar to those form focusing on CA alone,
albeit slightly smaller in magnitude which should be expected.
   4
     Our results are also similar to another recent working paper by Sinha (2019) that replicated most of our
key findings using generalized difference-in-difference models. However, we generally find smaller and more
reasonable estimates using synthetic controls.

2         Background

Salary history bans (SHBs) prohibit employers from inquiring about a candidates former or

current compensation. Currently, SHBs have been adopted by a growing number of cities

and states as a new tool to address potential discrimination in labor markets. Some affect

the entire population, some only state employees, and some only city employees. The rapid

uptake of SHBs suggest that many policy makers believe SHBs will improve gender pay

inequalities. Figure 1 and Appendix Tables A.2 and A.3 summarize different cities and states

with SHB laws.

        California's SHB became effective January 1, 2018. Under California's SHB employers

are prevented from seeking compensation history directly or through an agent. Applicants

may volunteer, without prompting, their own salary history. However, California restricts

employers from basing salary solely on the grounds of prior salary. That is, even if salary

history is voluntarily provided, employers may not use this information alone to determine a

workers' salary 5 . Most SHBs also require employers to provide a salary range at the request

of the applicant. In some cases, after an offer has been extended, employers may seek the

applicant's compensation history.

        Each SHB adopting entity has publicly stated that they have adopted the SHB to pro-

mote pay equality. However, the cities and states adopting SHBs have tended to be more

progressive on the other laws policies pay equality. Thus we might expect naive comparisons

between treated and untreated regions to arrive at estimated impacts that may be upwardly

biased. Indeed, with the recent uptake of SHBs, other more conserative leaning states have
    5
        Oregon's SHB also prevents employers from using voluntarily provided salary information.




                                                      6
implemented laws that prevent SHBs from being passed. These states include Michigan, Wis-

consin, Iowa, and Tennessee. Philadelphia prevented the implementation of a SHB when a

district judge found the SHB to be in violation of the First Amendment's free-speech clause.

Generally, states preventing the adoption of SHBs have done so with employer compliance in

mind. They argue that allowing employment law to change across regions is costly for small

business owners.

        This policy has a potential to be binding on multiple margins. In a wage bargaining

world, removing past salary from early question may change the bargaining process Exley &

Kessler (2019). In a model of wage posting, does a SHB change how employers post salaries or

how they screen for applicants (Agan et al., 2020b)? However, on net, it could be that firms

change which workers they hire when salary history is removed Barach & Horton (2017).

Given the numerous channels through which salary history bans can affect the process of

hiring in labor markets, the net impact of SHB ban is at its core empirical question.




3         Data and Methods

We use data from the Basic Monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). Earnings data are

collected from the outgoing rotation group of monthly CPS, also referred to as the earner

study. The CPS is a comprehensive survey containing monthly labor force statistics. Other

potential useful data sources for employment measures include the American Community

Survey, the Quarterly Workforce Indicators, and the Current Employment Statistics, but

each of these alternative data sources have a delayed release schedule.6 The CPS is published
    6
     Even thought the 2018 ACS recently became available, the earnings question focus on earnings over the
last calendar year, conflating earnings from 2017 and 2018.


                                                    7
roughly 10 days after each month's end. This makes it particularly useful given that the roll-

out of SHBs is so recent 7 . It samples roughly 60,000 households each month using a rotating

panel design and has a response rate averaging around 90 percent. We use the micro-level

data, which has responses by all household members as reported by the call recipient. Our

sample includes data from 2006 to the end of 2019. We restrict our sample to prime working

age individuals between the ages of 25 and 54.8

       Figure 1 illustrates the roll-out of SHB policies9 .

       We create statewide average weekly earnings ratios of female to male earnings by state (or

the aggregation of all treated regions). Additionally, we calculate earnings ratios by age, and

by industry of employment. We also calculate employment and the likelihood of beginning

work at a new job in the last month.

       We use the synthetic control method introduced by Abadie et al. (2010) to infer the causal

impact of SHBs. This method uses pretreatment data to create a counterfactual group sim-

ilar in outcomes to entities experiencing a discrete change in policy. This approach has been

used to study many different policy changes including decriminalization of prostitution (Cun-

ningham & Shah, 2017), highway police budget cuts (DeAngelo & Hansen, 2014), economic

liberalization (Billmeier & Nannicini, 2013), and increases in minimum wage (Jardim et al.,

2017). We follow the work of Botosaru & Ferman (2019) and create synthetic control groups

matching on outcomes only for each treated entity, both constraining ourselves to avoid

     We obtained these data using the lowdown package for R. The data are available for download almost
immediately after the end of a month.

     The CPS is administered by the Census Bureau through personal and telephone interviews. Individuals
must be 15 years of age or over and not in the Armed Forces. The person who responds to the phone
call is the reference person. They answer questions about all persons in the household. In the case that
the reference person is not knowledgeable, the Census Bureau attempts to contact those individuals in the
household directly.

'p-hacking' to avoid biasing our estimates and our hypothesis testing.

      Consider an outcome of interest Yit that is measured over T years, where t indexes the

time and the state is indexed by i if its treated and j if its not treated, among I treated

states and J untreated states. The synthetic control approach aims to estimate the treatment

effect, which is the difference between the treated state, and the unobserved counterfactual.

The estimate for the unobserved counterfactual for state i in time period t is         j   wj Yjt , where

wj is the weight assigned to donor state j . The donor states chosen belong to the donor pool

                                                 
of potential control states. The chosen weights wj minimize the distance between Yit and

  j   wj Yjt for all pretreatment time periods. For treatment in period  , the treatment effect

                                                                        
i for state i in time period t is estimated as it = Yit -          j   wj Yjt for t  [, T ]. For each

treated state, We create a synthetic control using lagged values of the dependent variable

from 2006 to 2018.

      To conduct hypothesis tests, we run a set of placebo tests following the method suggested

by Abadie et al. (2010). We apply the same synthetic control method with the donor state

removed, and the treated states added to the donor pool to create Synthjt for each donor

state j and time period t. We compare the pre-treatment and post-treatment mean squared

prediction error (MSPE) for each state. We calculate the MSPE ratio as follows:

                                                T
                                                     (Yjt - Synthjt )2
                                               t=
                             M SP E ratioj =    -1
                                                                           .
                                                                       2
                                                     (Yjt - Synthjt )
                                               t=1



The MSPE measures a relative goodness of fit of the synthetic outcome generated for each

state. It provides a metric of pre-treatment fit relative to post treatment fit for each state.



                                                9
A high MSPE ratio can be interpreted as poor post-treatment fit relative to pre-treatment

fit. The ranking of the treated states relative to the placebo states provides a permutation

based p-value.

   We include a relatively long pre-treatment window from 2006 to 2017. This allows us to

match on pre-treatment outcomes only and capture the average labor market dynamics of

states heading into and out of the Great Recession. Botosaru & Ferman (2019) show that

matching on covariates is not necessary if the match is made on a long set of pre-treatment

outcomes. All states that adopt a SHB prior to 2020 are excluded from the donor pool. The

donor pool consists of 36 possible states and Washington D.C.

   The synthetic control approach creates an estimate of the counterfactual for each of the

treated states. Absent treatment, the predicted synthetic outcome should match the actual

outcome. We test the ability of the synthetic control approach to forecast in the windows

prior to treatment actually beginning. We do this by progressively rolling back a placebo

treatment, matching on fewer and fewer years. Cross validation exercises are provided for

each outcome in the appendix.

   The composition of the synthetic controls chosen for California and all treated states can

be seen in Appendix Figures B.1a and B.1d. States are shaded according to the amount they

contribute to the synthetic outcome. All other donor states are assigned a weight of zero.

   Using the detailed industry codes, we classify each industry in the CPS as male or female

dominated. We use the industry gender compositions reported by the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission in Cartwright et al. (2011) to classify each industry as male or

female dominated. Male dominated industries are those with more than 50% male workers

and those industries with more than 50% female workers are female dominated. Female

                                             10
dominated industries are in the service producing domain and male dominated industries

tend to be in the goods producing domain.




4     Results

4.1    California

Figure 2 panel (a) illustrates the female to male earnings ratio for California and its synthetic

counterpart. The actual earnings ratio is represented by the solid line and the synthetic

counterpart is represented by the dashed line. The point estimate and permutation based

p-value are reported in Table 1. The first two columns represent the point estimates using

only CA, and the right columns are the point estimates for aggregation of all treated states.

For first two years after the SHB the female to male earnings ratio increases an average

of 0.0099 from its synthetic counterpart. A decrease in the gap of 0.01 from a base if 0.21

yields and effect size of 4.7 % of the prior gender pay gap. The permutation of placebo

states is illustrated in Appendix Figure B.1b. The MSPE ratio distribution is illustrated in

Appendix Figure B.1c. The permutation based p-value of 0.45 indicates the point estimate

is not statistically different from zero.

    Figure 3 panels (a) through (d) compares the trends for the gender earning ratio based on

gender composition of the industry, or the age of workers. While the synthetic controls closely

parallel California prior the SHB, the only meaningful divergence in the post period is for

either male dominated industries or workers over 35. The distribution of MSPE for hypothesis

testing for these figures and the weights for their averages are provided in Appendix Figures

B.3, B.4, B.7, and B.8.

   In Table 1 we reported estimates based on by industry type, and demographics. Among

male-dominated industries the point estimate is 0.031 with an empirical p-value of 0.225.

Among female-dominated industries we find point estimate is 0.0095 with an empirical p-

value in 0.325. These differences could reflect that the effects might be heterogeneous based

on the gender balance in an industry.

   When we focus the age of children in married households, stark differences emerge. We

split household into those with at least 1 child under 5, and households with all children

over 5 due to the profound effects public school enrollment can have on labor supply due to

childcare costs (Blau & Robins, 1988; Gelbach, 2002). For households that have any children

under five we estimate the gender earnings ratio changes by 0.0024 with a p-value of [1.000].

For those with all of their children over 5, we find the earnings ratio increases by 0.0471, a

15.1 percent shift, with a p-value of 0.025.

   It could be SHBs affect salaries among women more generally who have faced past earn-

ings penalties due to the birth of previous children, or past discrimination. We explore this

by using splitting the age distribution of workers into those 35 and under (down to 25), and

those older than 35 (up to 54 year given that we focus on prime age workers). We find for

workers under 35, the gender earnings ratio falls by -0.023 with an empirical p-value of 0.650.

For workers over 35, the gender earnings ratio increases by 0.023, a 9.5 percent shift, with

an empirical p-value of [0.075]. In the next row, when we split the workers by education,

those with a high school degree or less and those with at least a BA, the precision of the

point estimates do not suggest meaningful differences, while the estimates are more precise

for college-educated workers.

                                               12
       In the final row, we investigate whether or not the estimate effects of SHBs vary by recent

job changes, focusing the sample of workers over 35. Not however, while we expect the effect

to be higher for those who have switched jobs, the question in the CPS is unfortunately

too imprecise to make sharper predictions, as it focuses on starting a new job in the last

month.10 . Thus some of the individuals we classify as "same job" workers may may have

switched jobs sometime earlier and could have also been directly affected by the SHB during

the post-treatment window. While the sample of job switchers is smaller (only 2 percent

of workers start a new job in most months), we estimate that for job switchers the gender

earnings ratio as increased by .20, closing the gap by 99.9 percent. This point estimate has

an empirical p-value of 0.150. For individuals above 35 at the same job, we estimate the

gender earnings ratio increased by .035 with an empirical p-value of 0.025, suggesting their

earnings gap closed by 14.3 percent.

       In Table 2 we estimate the effect of SHB's on a variety of labor market outcomes directly

related to the gender earnings ratio. The two columns on the left focus on California for

Female and Male prime age workers. We find little evidence the employment has shifted.

Because the rate of monthly turnover is so small (0.02 percent on average each month), we

multiple monthly turnover levels by 12 to approximate annual turnover. Generally there's

little evidence of a change in the labor market participation or turnover. In the other rows

of the table we report the impact on wages, hours worked, weekly earnings. Generally the

point estimates are small and noisy much like the effect on the overall gender earnings ratio.

When we focus on households with all children over 5, individuals over 35, and those starting

   The wording on turnover asks "Last month, it was reported that you worked for employer. Do you still
work for employer as your main job?"

new jobs we find estimates in line with Table 1. The point estimates are more noisy which

might be because the gender earnings ratio by construction adjusts for fixed state level

differences in absolute pay. In the robustness section, we explore this further demeaning

the data. Regardless, the point estimates are consistent with larger effects for individuals

starting new jobs, who are over 35, and have all of their children older than 5.



4.2    All States

As mentioned earlier, the Abadie et al. (2010) approach only works when there is a single

treated unit. That leaves two approaches to deal with multiple treated units. If there are

similar treatment begin dates, the multiple treated units can be aggregated into a single

treated entity. Xu (2017) also offers an alternative approach, which counterfactuals for each

of the treated units using a linear interactive fixed effects approach. We use both of these

approaches. The generalized synthetic control results are discussed in the robustness section.

   Figure 2 panel (b) illustrates the female to male earnings ratio for the average and its

synthetic counterpart. The actual earnings ratio is represented by the solid line and the

synthetic counterpart is represented by the dashed line. The point estimate and permutation

based p-value are reported in the first row of Table 1. For first year after the SHB the

female to male earnings ratio increases an average of 0.0151 from its synthetic counterpart.

A decrease in the gap of 0.0151 from a base if 0.23 yields and effect size of 6.6% of the prior

gender pay gap. The permutation of placebo states is illustrated in Appendix Figure B.1e.

The MSPE ratio distribution is illustrated in Appendix Figure B.1f. The permutation based

p-value is 0.500.



                                              14
   Figure 3 panels (e) through (h) compares the trends for the gender earning ratio based

on gender composition of the industry, or the age of workers. Again, the largest increases in

the gender earnings ratio emerge for male dominated industries and workers over 35. The

right columns of Tables 1 and 2 present the estimated effect of SHBs on the gender earnings

ratio, and the labor market outcomes which determine the gender earnings ratio. Generally

when using the aggregation of all treated units, we find very similar estimates to those we

get when using California alone.



4.3    Robustness

In the Appendix we explore the robustness of our estimates to two primary changes.

   In the Appendix Section A.4. we explore the sensitivity of the estimated effects to de-

meaning the data. In Appendix Tables A.5 and A.6 we demean the state level averages.

Ferman & Pinto (2019) also discuss demeaning as an option to help improve match quality

and reduce convex hull violations (increasing the likelihood that a linear combination of con-

trol states matches with the treatment state). Generally the point estimates are similar in

magnitude and often are more precise using this approach. This is particularly true for the

labor market absolute earnings, where we find evidence that absolute earnings have increase

for women over 35, or who have all of their children older than 5, and who started new jobs

in the last month.

   In the Appendix Section A.5. we explore the sensitivity of the estimated effects to ag-

gregating the data using CPS weights. Appendix Tables A.7, A.9 report the estimates using

level data aggregated with CPS weights respectively for earnings ratios and labor market



                                             15
outcomes. Appendix Tables A.8, and A.10 report the estimates using demeaned data aggre-

gated with CPS weights respectively for earnings ratios and labor market outcomes. Again

the estimates are similar in magnitude and often more precise. They suggest SHBs may

increase female earnings relative to men, particularly for women over 35, those starting new

jobs, and those with all of their children over 5.

    In Appendix Table A.4 we utilize the generalized synthetic control approach of Xu (2017).

We replicate our earlier Table 1. The left panel aggregates data without CPS weights while

the right panel uses CPS weights. Importantly, instead of empirical p-values, this approach

provides standard errors which we report in parentheses. Generally most of the point esti-

mates are qualitative similar, although slightly smaller in magnitude. Again, there are much

larger effects for those starting new jobs early than those who have switched jobs in the last

month.

    We also perform basic diff-in-diff models fully explained in Appendix Section A.1. Gen-

erally these estimates are much larger, but lead to similar policy conclusions. Moreover, the

Goodman-Bacon (2018) decomposition suggest the diff-in-diff estimates are larger driven by

the comparison between treated and untreated units. This is not too surprising given the

fairly tight windows in which these policies have rolled out.




5     Conclusions and Policy Implications

In this paper we provide early evidence on whether SHBs are having their intended goal of

increasing female earnings. The point estimates from generalized diff-in-diff models suggest

female earnings are increasing relative to male earnings in states adopting SHBs. These


                                              16
estimated increase in earnings is larger for those who have switched jobs recently. However,

this approach heavily weights CA given its size and that it was a relatively early adopter.11

Our synthetic control approach also offers evidence SHB's are associated with increases in

the gender earnings ratio. This is particularly true for women beyond peak fertility years

(over 35) and those in married households with all of their children older than 5.

       While this early evidence on SHBs suggests they may be a promising intervention on at

least one dimension, many questions remain. For instance, exactly how are SHBs affecting

the labor market? The primary mechanism could be happening through changes in the wage

bargaining process (Exley et al., 2020). However, it could also change how employees are

screened and chosen (Barach & Horton, 2017; Agan et al., 2020a). Future research should

investigate these mechanisms. Moreover, it is still possible and even likely that a blunt in-

strument that profoundly changes how firms recruit and screen employees will also have

unintended effects, which will prove an important area for future research in the years to

come. Indeed, another question considering is whether full public transparency is reason-

able alternative to salary history bans. The recent research on this alternative information

public policy innovation is mixed. Mas (2017) find pay transparency for municipal managers

increases pay compression, while Baker et al. (2019) find that pay transparency in Canada

decreases the gender pay gap, chiefly through female earnings increases. Perhaps this suggests

providing full information can help workers in the bargaining process. But if the informa-

tion is particularly one sided, with employers asking for information but not providing it

themselves, employers may use that asymmetry to increase their monopsonistic power.
  11
    Moreover, a Goodman-Bacon (2018) decomposition suggests that most of the generalized diff-in-diff
models essentially is driven by a comparison between states that have passed laws and those that have not
(as opposed to comparing states that just vary in their timing). This is not surprising given that most these
laws are relatively new, so there is not much variation in the timing of laws at this point.


                                                     17
   However, the period in which SHBs have been implemented now intersects with the

SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the resulting economic shutdown and all but guaranteed eco-

nomic recession. We do not yet know how firms and hiring will respond in the future, and

if SHBs will further close the gender pay gap for individuals returning to work. It's possible

that firms may now begin to engage in statistical discrimination, similar to BTB policies,

as gender may be more correlated with decreases in the ability of individuals to work from

home in a new environment where this work is more valuable (Agan & Starr, 2018; Doleac &

Hansen, 2020). This could emerge if markets place increased weight on the ability of workers

to work remotely and if female workers are less productive due to school closures (Houghton,

2020), as markets adapt to life of prolonged closures or social distancing is required (Fauci

et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). However in incredibly loose labor markets, it could be that firm

owners or managers engage in more bias in who they hire (Zeltzer, 2020) or are biased in

how they interpret labor market signals of productivity (Sarsons, 2017a), which makes it

difficult to forecast the longer term effects of SHBs and whether these short-term effects on

closing the gender wage gap will persist.

 N otes: This table provides point estimates to the synthetic control estimates illustrated
 in Figures 2 and 3. The placebo based p-values are included in brackets below each point
 estimate. The data used to create these estimates are annual state averages of the female to
 male earnings ratio taken from the monthly CPS files. The synthetic control matches on pre-
 treatment outcomes only. The composition of each synthetic state is illustrated in Appendix
 Figures B.1a and B.1d.

N otes: This table provides point estimates to the synthetic control estimates for various
labor market outcomes. The permutation based p-values are included in brackets below each
point estimate. The data used to create these estimates are annual state averages of male
and female labor market outcomes taken from the monthly CPS files. The synthetic control
matches on pre-treatment outcomes only.

Appendix A
A.1       Differences in Differences Approaches
We exploit the micro-data using a differences in differences strategy. Our analysis suggests
identification is coming from the difference between treated and untreated states. However,
majority of treated observations stem from one state alone, California, which motivates
using a synthetic control approach so that the treated and untreated states look as similar
as possible absent treatment. Our base equation estimates the effect of a SHB for males, and
then interacts a dummy variable for SHB with an indicator for female, while controlling for
state fixed effects and year fixed effects.


 ln(earnings)ist = 0 + 1  SHBst + 2  f emaleist + 3  SHBst  f emaleist + Ss + tt +    ist   (A.1)


   In Table A.1, we report the point estimates based on generalized difference-in-difference
models as discussed above, similar to those estimated by Sinha (2019). In these models three
parameters are of interest. The coefficient on female is the average wage or earnings penalties
for female workers. The coefficient on SHB is the average estimated impact of a SHB on
male wages or earnings, while the coefficient on the interaction between female and SHB
informs about the effect of SHBs on the gender wage or earnings ratio.
   First we focus on all workers. Not surprisingly, female workers always both a wage and
earnings penalty. In only one of the models do we find evidence that SHBs reduce male
earnings. However, in each model the point estimates suggest that SHBs increase female
earnings and wages relative to males. In the models using log(earnings) and log(wages), the
estimates are more precise. Taken at face value they would suggest a SHB closes more than
26 of the wage gap and 35 percent of the earnings gap. While this is evidence supportive
of SHBs having their intended effect, we also might be worried about the magnitude of the
estimates. If we consider the likely impact of SHB should happen when individuals change
jobs, then you should scale up this point estimates by annual turnover rates, which are


                                              28
usually close to 20 percent. This back of the envelope calculation would suggest SHBs might
entirely be closing the gender wage gap for those changing jobs and perhaps reversing the
gap the other direction.
   While the CPS does not record employment histories for all participants, it does ask
individuals on whether they changed jobs in the last month. We use this restriction in
the lower panel to see if SHBs are associated with larger changes in earnings among those
switching jobs. Again, we find consistent earnings and wage penalties for those switching
jobs. The point estimates provide little evidence SHB are negatively affecting men in this
smaller subsample. Moreover, the point estimates are all positive for the interaction between
female and SHB. Although the point estimates are noisier for this smaller sample, they
suggest a SHB is associated with a 25 percent increase in female wage ratio. Moreover, the
estimates on the interactions suggest female earnings ratio increase by 29 to 52 percent in
states adopting SHBs.
   These point estimates are large, and suggestive SHBs may be improving female labor
market outcomes. However, given the number of states passing SHBs is limited, the estimates
are largely driven by CA (which represents 45 percent of observations among the treated
units). Moreover, Goodman-Bacon (2018) shows this weight is increased if treatment effects
are heterogenous as California was an earlier adopter. We report the results of the Goodman-
Bacon decomposition in Figure A.1. This decomposition reports the point estimates resulting
if the late adopters are the control units for the earlier adopting states, if the early adopters
are the control units for the late adopters, and if the never treated states are the control for
either the early or late adopting states. It shows the overall generalized diff-in-diff estimate is
closest to the diff-in-diff models comparing either the early or late adopters to the units that
are never treated. Moreover, this decomposition suggests the generalized diff-in-diff attaches
96 percent of the weight to the treated vs. never treated comparisons. This implies it is of
first order important to ensure the control units are similar to the treated units. In turn it
also motivates our next approach: synthetic controls.

Notes: This figure illustrates the point estimates provided by the Goodman-Bacon decomposition (2018). This approach
compares the point estimates produces using the late adopters as controls for the early adopters, the early adopters as
controls for the late adopters, the never treated as controls for the early adopters, and the never treated as controls for the
late adopters. This approach suggests the treated vs. never treated comparison received 96.1 percent of the weight in a
generalized diff-in-diff model.

Notes: Panels (a) and (d) of this figure illustrate the composition of synthetic California and all treated states respectively.
Each donor state is highlighted in grey and shaded by its contribution to the synthetic control. Panels (b) and (e) illustrate the
difference between each treated state and its synthetic counterpart (red) compared to the each control states deviation from
it's own synthetic counterpart (grey). Panels (c) and (f) illustrate the distributions of mean square prediction error ratio for
each state.
