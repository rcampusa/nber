                                         ABSTRACT

We construct longitudinal data from the U.S. Census records to study migration patterns of those
affected by the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Our focus is on the famous "Okie" migration of the
Southern Great Plains. We find that migration rates were much higher in the Dust Bowl than
elsewhere in the U.S. This difference is due to the fact that individuals who were typically
unlikely to move (e.g., those with young children, those living in their birth state) were equally
likely to move in the Dust Bowl. While this result of elevated mobility conforms to long-standing
perceptions of the Dust Bowl, our other principal findings contradict conventional wisdom. First,
relative to other occupations, farmers in the Dust Bowl were the least likely to move; this
relationship between mobility and occupation was unique to that region. Second, out-migration
rates from the Dust Bowl region were only slightly higher than they were in the 1920s. Hence, the
depopulation of the Dust Bowl was due largely to a sharp drop in migration inflows. Dust Bowl
migrants were no more likely to move to California than migrants from other parts of the U.S., or
those from the same region ten years prior. In this sense, the westward push from the Dust Bowl
to California was unexceptional. Finally, migration from the Dust Bowl was not associated with
long-lasting negative labor market effects, and for farmers, the effects were positive.

1        Introduction

The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was one of the greatest environmental and economic catastrophes
in U.S. history. The severity of its environmental degradation, farm failure, and economic
dislocation have cemented the episode’s place in the mythology of the American experience.
Perhaps the most enduring image of the Dust Bowl is the exodus of destitute farmers and other
“Okies” from the Southern Great Plains, one of the most famous episodes of internal migration
in American history. However, little systematic evidence has been brought to bear on even the
basic contours of this migration episode. This research represents the first attempt to quantify
and analyze gross migration flows associated with this event.
        The Dust Bowl occurred as the confluence of drought, erosion, and economic depression
throughout the Great Plains. The drought began in the winter of 1931; throughout most of
the 1930s, and especially mid-decade, minimal precipitation, high winds, and pestilence led to
widespread crop failure. While the effects were widespread, matters were most severe in the
Southern Plains states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas (see Joel (1937), Cunfer
(2011)), and the out-migration from this region looms largest in the formation of the Dust Bowl
narrative.
        Poor seasons were not new to the Plains in the 1930s. Yet in many ways the decade was
unprecedented. One fundamental difference from previous droughts was the number of people
affected. Between 1890 and 1930, the population of the Southern Plains states had increased
from 4,496,000 to 11,561,000. In the counties most greatly affected by the Dust Bowl (as defined
below), the population had increased from 14,000 to 121,000. Most striking was the severity
of the drought, the worst in over a hundred years of formal meteorological record keeping.1
Dust storms, like the famous Black Sunday storm of April 1935, were also more frequent and
damaging. Severe wind erosion and occasional water erosion resulted in widespread loss of topsoil
and declining agricultural productivity. These problems were exacerbated by the externalities
associated with small-scale Plains agriculture, which dis-incentivized farmers from engaging in
basic erosion prevention measures (see Hansen and Libecap (2004)).
        The environmental calamity coincided with the U.S. and international Great Depression. To-
gether, these shocks amplified long term structural change in agriculture, due to mechanization
and consolidation, and falling agricultural prices since the end of the First World War. Prices
fell precipitously in the early 1930s, severely impacting farm incomes. Wheat prices fell from
$1.18 per bushel in 1928 to 38 cents per bushel in 1932 and 1933; cotton prices fell from 19 cents
to 6 cents per pound during the same period.2 Falling incomes, coupled with farmers’ declining
access to credit due to the financial sector crisis, led to foreclosure and farm loss.

       As a result, the region experienced marked depopulation. During the Dust Bowl decade,
the most greatly affected counties shrank by 20 percent. More broadly, Hornbeck (2012) shows
that population declined by 12 percent in those Great Plains counties that experienced the
highest levels of erosion relative to counties with less erosion. This trend was long-lasting as the
bulk of long-run reallocation of productive factors away from agriculture was achieved through
population decline as opposed to adjustments in land use.
       This displacement led to much public hand-wringing and anger in places receiving the “tide
of migration. . . sweeping over the country” (see U.S. House (1941), page 68), and gave rise to
derogatory terms such as Okies and “Dust Bowl refugees.” Perhaps the most vivid example
is that of the Los Angeles Police sending officers to patrol the California borders in order to
stem the immigration (see Los Angeles Herald-Express, Feb 4, 1936). No doubt, the “transient
problem” was more general in scope, due to the joblessness created by the Great Depression.
But in the 74th Congress’ Senate Resolution 298 to investigate “the social and economic needs
of laborers migrating across state lines,” and the establishment of the select committee by the
76th Congress to “investigate the interstate migration of destitute citizens,” it is clear that one
of the primary concerns was the issue of those fleeing the Dust Bowl. (see, for instance, the
Introductory Statement to U.S. House (1941).)
       These factors came together to cement the Dust Bowl’s place in American myth, and to
make the exodus from the Southern Great Plains one of the most famous episodes of internal
migration in U.S. history. The Dust Bowl loomed large in literature, art, and music—from the
iconic images of the Farm Security Administration photography corps documenting the plight of
Plains farmers and its migrants, to the folk songs of Woody Guthrie, to films like Pare Lorentz’s
The Plow that Broke the Plains. Certainly the most enduring depiction in this regard remains
John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, whose portrayal of the Joad family’s move to California
has done so much to shape popular perception of Dust Bowl migration. Finally, the high-profile
New Deal agencies and programs aimed at ameliorating the agricultural problems of the Dust
Bowl drew attention to the region and its difficulties.
       While much attention has been paid to the Dust Bowl and its depopulation, much remains
unknown with respect to the relevant migration dynamics and the migrants themselves. To
date, we lack systematic, representative data on individuals residing in the relevant Southern
Great Plains counties before the Dust Bowl occurred, their characteristics, and how their lives
were affected after the crisis abated.3 This research represents the first attempt to measure gross
migration associated with this event by assembling and analyzing just such data. We document
   3
     See, for instance, Ferrie (2003) who discusses the lack of migration data prior to the 1940 census. Prior to
this study, nationally representative data on gross migration has been available from the Census Bureau only for
the period 1935-1940. Analysis of that data has also been at a much coarser (state and/or census division) level
than that considered here, and includes little information on the characteristics of migrants; see U.S. Bureau of
the Census (1946).



                                                       3
migration among the Okies of the Southern Plains—those at the heart of the exodus mythology.
We document where residents of these counties in 1930 moved to and resided in 1940. We
also discuss how migration probabilities covaried by individual- and county-level characteristics.
Finally, we study the economic effects of migration from the Dust Bowl.
    In order to study migration phenomena, we construct new longitudinal data at the individual
level for the decade between 1930 and 1940, and for the decade between 1920 and 1930. We do
this by linking individuals across U.S. Decennial Censuses.
    We find that inter-county and inter-state migration rates were much higher in the Dust Bowl
counties than elsewhere in the U.S. during the 1930s. This difference is due to the fact that
individual-level characteristics that were negatively associated with mobility elsewhere (e.g.,
being married, having young children, living in one’s birth state), were unrelated to migration
probability within the Dust Bowl. While this result conforms to long-standing perceptions of
the Dust Bowl, our other principal findings contradict conventional wisdom. First, relative to
other occupational groups, farmers in the Dust Bowl were the least likely to move; by contrast,
no such relationship existed between migration probability and occupation outside of the Dust
Bowl. Second, while the out-migration rate from the Dust Bowl was high (relative to other parts
of the country), it was not much higher than from the same region in the 1920s. Hence, the
depopulation of the Dust Bowl was due principally to a sharp drop in in-migration during the
1930s. Migrants from the Dust Bowl were no more likely to move to California than migrants
from any other part of the country. Instead, Dust Bowl migrants made relatively “local” moves,
tending to remain in a Dust Bowl-affected state. Finally, we find that migrants from the Dust
Bowl did not experience long-lasting negative labor market outcomes relative to those who
stayed; for farmers, migration effects were positive. These findings hold both in terms of reduced-
form correlation, and within the context of a structural model accounting for migrant selection.



2    Methodology and Data

We use two sources to construct our longitudinal data: a computerized five percent sample
of the 1930 census, made available by IPUMS (see Ruggles et al. (2010)), and the complete
count 1920, 1930 and 1940 censuses, accessible through Ancestry.com, a web-based genealogical
research service.
    With these sources we construct three datasets: (i) 4,210 individuals living in a “Dust Bowl
county” (as defined below) in 1930, linked to the 1940 census, (ii) 2,090 individuals living in those
same counties in 1920, linked to the 1930 census, and (iii) a nationally-representative sample of
4,335 individuals linked between the 1930 and 1940 censuses. All of our linked individuals are
male household heads (simply referred to as heads hereafter), between 16 and 60 years of age in
the relevant source year census. Our definition of a head includes individuals designated as the

                                                 4
“head of the family” by census enumerators, as well as non-family males (e.g., boarders, lodgers,
hired men) residing in group quarters or in homes where a family head is present.
       Individuals were linked based on given name(s), last name, race, state of birth, and year of
birth—information that should, barring error, remain constant across censuses. The linkages
were constructed manually by trained researchers. Automated linkage was unsuitable for this
project for two reasons. First, a digitized version of the 1940 census was not available when
the research project was begun. Second, constructing the datasets for the Dust Bowl counties
required many more men living in those counties in the source years of 1920 and 1930 than are
available from the IPUMS census samples. For these counties, it was necessary to draw both the
pool of target individuals from the source year census and their linked record from the terminal
year census from Ancestry.com.
       Some leeway in the matching algorithm was allowed for small discrepancies in reporting
personal information across census surveys. Given names were allowed to vary slightly as long
as they matched phonetically and last names matched identically; last names were allowed to
vary by one letter as long as they matched phonetically and given name(s) matched. Reported
age in the terminal year census was allowed to deviate by up to three years from the value
reported in the source year.4
       This linkage procedure produced datasets that are well representative of the target popula-
tions. Table 11 in Appendix A provides a summary of the data constructed and analyzed in the
rest of this paper. Table 12 in Appendix A presents the same summary statistics for a random
sample of heads drawn from IPUMS, indicating the representativeness of our matched sample.
       Though varying degrees of drought and erosion were experienced throughout the Plains
states (see, for instance, Hansen and Libecap (2004) and Hornbeck (2012)), we chose to focus
our attention on the Dust Bowl of the Southern Great Plains for two reasons. First, this is the
region at the heart of the exodus mythology as typified by the famous Okie migrants. Second, it
is consistent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Soil Conservation Service (SCS) contem-
poraneous definition of the areas most severely affected by the Dust Bowl. Beginning in August
of 1934, the Soil Erosion Service (which became the SCS in 1935) began an extensive survey
of soil type, land use, wind erosion, and soil accumulation throughout every state in the U.S.
(see Cunfer (2011) for details). By 1936, the SCS had identified the single worst wind-eroded
area in the country: a cluster of contiguous counties centered around the Oklahoma and Texas
panhandles. This covered sixteen million acres of land, and comprised the twenty counties of:
Baca, Bent, and Prowers in Colorado; Grant, Hamilton, Morton, Seward, Stanton, and Stevens
   4
    Complete details of the data construction process, including specific training protocols for manual linkage,
are available from the authors upon request. Similar procedures have been used to construct longitudinal data
from various national censuses. See, for instance, Long (2005), Abramitzky et al. (2012), and Long and Ferrie
(2013). See Ferrie (2003) for a general discussion on the use of linked census data, and other data sources, in the
study of internal migration.

in Kansas; Beaver, Cimarron, Texas in Oklahoma; and Dallam, Deaf Smith, Hansford, Hartley,
Moore, Ochiltree, Oldham, and Sherman in Texas. These counties are plotted in Figure 1.
       We follow the SCS by defining the Dust Bowl counties as these twenty counties in Colorado,
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.5 The 4,210 observations in our Dust Bowl dataset constitute
an 11% sample of heads most severely affected by the Dust Bowl. In comparing the population
of these twenty counties between the 1930 and 1940 censuses, this region experienced a sharp
19.2% drop, from 120,859 to 97,606. This compares with population growth of 4.8% experienced
by the same four states as a whole, during the same decade.
   5
    In 1937, the SCS added six additional counties in New Mexico to the list; see Joel (1937) for details. Because
of the costly nature of the linkage procedure, we focus our attention to the original twenty counties, to ensure a
rich density of observations within the region of analysis.

3        Migration Rates

3.1       Inter-County and Inter-State Migration

The first question we address is how geographic mobility differed in the Dust Bowl region from
elsewhere. Did residents of the most drought-affected and wind-eroded counties move at a higher
rate than elsewhere? To answer this question we compute the fraction of residents in 1930 who
were no longer living in the same place when surveyed in the 1940 census. In what follows,
“place” will refer alternately to the geographic region of county and state.6
        Table 1 summarizes these results. The first row presents the fraction of heads who migrated
across counties between 1930 and 1940. The first column presents results for those living in a
Dust Bowl county in 1930, the second column for those originating from all other counties in the
U.S.7 As is obvious, the rate of inter-county migration was very high in the Dust Bowl: more
than half (51.6%) of all heads originating from such counties were residing in a different county
in 1940. This was approximately 1.8 times that of the inter-county migration rate (28.9%)
observed in non-Dust Bowl counties.
        This stark difference in mobility could simply reflect differences in rural/urban composition
between the Dust Bowl region and elsewhere. While the Dust Bowl counties were largely rural,
the U.S. population as a whole was split much more evenly between rural and urban locales.8
The third column of Table 1 presents statistics for non-Dust Bowl heads residing in rural areas
in 1930. As indicated in the first row, only 28.3% of such individuals moved across county lines
during the decade, a rate very similar to those from non-Dust Bowl counties as a whole. Hence,
the high migration rates observed in the Dust Bowl were not shared by other rural populations.
        While drought and erosion were experienced throughout the Great Plains, conditions were
not as uniform in their severity when compared to our Dust Bowl region. Migration rates were
also not as high. Of the 4335 observations in our non-Dust Bowl sample, 540 were residing in
the Plains states (of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas—but outside of the twenty Dust Bowl counties) in
1930. Though not presented in Table 1, the inter-county migration rate between 1930 and 1940
for this subsample was 36.8%, a value closer to those observed outside of the Dust Bowl than
within it.
    6
     The 1940 census also asked individuals of their place of residence in 1935, allowing us to consider geographic
mobility at the 5-year frequency; see below for analysis. However, given the nature of the data, we are unable to
observe multiple moves within 5-year time intervals.
   7
     The Non-Dust Bowl sample, in fact, refers to the nationally-representative sample. In 1930, the population of
the Dust Bowl counties represented 0.1% of the total U.S. population. The construction of the 4,335 observations
in the national sample yielded two observations from the Dust Bowl, which were removed from the analysis.
   8
     In the 1930 Census, 56.1% of the population resided in urban areas; within our sample of heads in Non-Dust
Bowl counties, the urban share is 53.3%.

counties in 1930 and 1920 (cols. 1 and 4) and all other U.S. counties in 1930 (cols. 2 and 3). See text for details.


   The fourth column presents statistics for heads in the same twenty counties as in column
1, but residing there in 1920. Though wheat prices had fallen from their peak during the
First World War, the 1920s was a period of expansion in the Southern Plains, as good growing
conditions and increasing mechanization led to higher yields and agricultural output (see, for
instance, Worster (1979)). This led to a population boom during the 1920s: in the counties most
severely affected by the Dust Bowl a decade later, the population had grown from 97,473 in 1920
to 120,859 in 1930. During this period of extraordinary population growth, the region exhibited
an inter-county migration rate of 47.2%. Hence, the high rates of mobility in the Dust Bowl
relative to the rest of the U.S. was characteristic of the region, and not necessarily symptomatic
of the hardships experienced in the 1930s.
   The second row of Table 1 presents the inter-state migration rate. Given data limitations of
previous studies, this coarser measure of geographic mobility has been the subject of analysis
in other work (see, for example, Rosenbloom and Sundstrom (2004)). As with inter-county
migration, inter-state migration was much higher in the Dust Bowl. Approximately 33.5% of
heads originating from a Dust Bowl county in 1930 had moved to a different state by 1940, a
rate nearly 2.5 times that of heads in all other counties, rural or otherwise. In the 1920s, the
inter-state migration rate in this region was, again, similarly high (31.2%).


3.2     Where Did They Move?

Given the high rates of mobility, where did Dust Bowl migrants go? Did their migration patterns
differ from those originating elsewhere? Did they differ from those originating from the same
place a decade earlier? What was the role of out-migration in the depopulation of the Dust
Bowl?
   To make progress on these questions, Table 2 presents the fraction of inter-county migrants
residing in specific locations in the terminal year census. The first row of column 1 indicates,
perhaps surprisingly, that of the Dust Bowlers who made an inter-county move, 11.6% simply

moved to one of the other Dust Bowl counties. The first row of the second column presents
the same statistic for migrants from the region, ten years prior. Of all inter-county migrants in
the 1920s, 18.6% moved to one of the other nineteen counties. Hence, compared to the 1930s,
a greater fraction of the mobility represented “churning” or turnover within the region during
the 1920s. By contrast, more of the mobility represented “exodus” or out-migration from the
region during the Dust Bowl.
       Nonetheless, the depopulation of the Dust Bowl was not due to an extraordinary exodus
relative to historical norms. Between 1930 and 1940, given the inter-county migration rate of
51.6%, the out-migration rate from the Dust Bowl was 0.516×(1−0.116) = 45.6%. Between 1920
and 1930, the out-migration rate from the same region was only slightly lower at 38.4%. As such,
the Dust Bowl depopulation was due largely to a sharp fall in the flow of in-migrants. Given
these out-migration rates, and the Census Bureau’s data on fertility and mortality, we are able to
provide estimates on in-migration to the region (see Appendix B for details). Expressed relative
to the source year population of the twenty counties in question, the in-migration rate between
1920 and 1930 was approximately 47.3%; during the 1930s, the in-migration rate plummeted to
about 15.5%.
       A simple counterfactual exercise puts these numbers in perspective. The population of the
Dust Bowl fell from 120,859 in 1930 to 97,606 in 1940. Holding constant the number of births,
deaths, and in-migrants at their observed 1930s values, if the out-migration rate from the Dust
Bowl had equaled its 1920s value, the population in 1940 would have been 106,308. Lowering
out-migration to its rate in the previous decade would not have prevented a population decline.
By contrast, holding the number of births, deaths, and out-migrants constant at 1930s values,
had the in-migration rate equaled its 1920s value, the population in 1940 would have increased to
136,079. Hence, the depopulation of the Dust Bowl was due primarily to the fall in in-migration.9
   9
    Prior to this study, representative data allowing for the decomposition of the role of in- and out-migration to
the 1930s depopulation did not exist. Nevertheless, the historian James C. Malin had conjectured that population
decline experienced in Kansas between 1930 and 1935 was due to a fall in in-migration. In particular, Malin (1935)
and Malin (1961) find a decrease in the turnover of farm operators in 1930-35, relative to 1925-30, in a sample of
48 Kansas townships, as documented in the state census farm schedule records (see also Geoff Cunfer’s summary


                                                        9

       Notes: Distances measured in miles “as the crow flies” from respective county centroids. See text
       for details.


    Returning to Table 2, taking the first two rows together, 62.9% of the Dust Bowl migrants
were still residing in one of the Dust Bowl states (of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas) in
1940. Only 37.1% of all migrants left those four states. This indicates that Dust Bowl movers
did not move “too far.”10 During the 1920s, 30.7% of inter-county migrants left the four Dust
Bowl states. Hence, the probability of leaving the Southern Plains was only slightly higher
during Dust Bowl.
    To better quantify the proximity of Dust Bowl relocations, we calculate the physical distance
of moves for inter-county migrants. We measure this “as the crow flies,” from the centroids of
the county of residence in the source year and terminal year censuses. Figure 2 presents the
histogram of migration distances for both decades.
    Inter-county migrants from the Dust Bowl tended to make slightly longer moves, relative
of Malin’s work in EH.net). Malin’s conjecture was based on an extrapolation of the patterns in farm operator
turnover as representative of population out-migration. Our findings confirm this conjecture for a comprehensive,
random-sample of individuals for the Dust Bowl region, for the entire 1930s decade.
  10
     Citing data from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1946), Worster (1979) also noted that, at the state level, a
large fraction (46%) of inter-state migrants from Oklahoma between 1935 and 1940 moved to a contiguous state.
This is consistent with other evidence from the 1930s that farmers, in general, tended not to move too far; see
Kraenzel (1939) for evidence from Montana, and Barton and McNeely (1939) for evidence from Arkansas. See also
Taeuber and Hoffman (1937) on the prevalence of local moves on the Great Plains, gleaned from Farm Security
Administration and other “scattered reports.”

to their regional counterparts from the previous decade. The median migration distance in the
1930s was 300 miles; in the 1920s, the median distance was 205 miles. By way of comparison,
this difference is less than the 166 mile width (measured east-to-west) of the Oklahoma and
Texas panhandles.
       The tendency for longer moves in the 1930s is evident essentially throughout the distance
distribution. The interquartile range during the Dust Bowl was 130–600 miles, compared to
70–500 miles during the 1920s. At the 90th percentile, the distances converge at approximately
1000 miles; this is the distance required, for example, to move from the centroid of the Dust
Bowl region to Kern County, California, at the southern tip of the agriculturally-intensive San
Joaquin Valley.
       To visualize this, Figure 3 displays a heat map of the terminal year county of residence for
inter-county migrants from the region. The top panel displays the 1940 location data for the Dust
Bowl migrants, while the bottom panel displays the 1930 location data for the 1920s migrants.
Darker colors indicate locations of greater migration incidence, lighter colors the opposite.
       Migrants in the 1920s tended to move to counties within, or very close to, the Dust Bowl
region: destination locations are concentrated in southeastern Colorado, southern Kansas, and
the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas. Migration destinations were more dispersed in the
1930s, with noticeably lower concentration within the Dust Bowl counties. Instead, migrants
moved to western portions of Colorado, central Oklahoma, south of the Texas panhandle, as well
as New Mexico and Missouri with greater frequency.11 This corroborates the results presented
in Table 2 and Figure 2: while the median migrant moved approximately 100 miles further in
the 1930s compared to the 1920s, this additional distance did not translate into moves outside
of the Dust Bowl states or their adjacent states with much greater frequency.
       A widely held perception—made popular, in part, by Steinbeck’s Joad Family—is that Dust
Bowl migrants moved to California en masse. While a powerful image, it is far from accurate.
The results presented in Figures 2 and 3 indicate that relatively few made such a drastic move.12
  11
     Figure 4 in Appendix A “zooms in” on the states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico to
make these points more visually apparent. See also Lane (1938) and McMillan (1936) for discussion of migration
to western Colorado and central Oklahoma, respectively; while these authors noted the arrival of Dust Bowlers
to these regions, data were not available to them to document its prevalence or importance.
  12
     Despite the intense interest in the topic, data on migration from the Dust Bowl to California was severely
lacking prior to this study, and perhaps best expressed by Worster (1979) in his summary that “exact numbers
are not wholly reliable.” Research by the U.S. Resettlement Administration analyzed reports from the California
Department of Agriculture, whose quarantine inspectors took note of vehicles entering the state whose occupants
were “persons in need of manual employment” during 1935-36 (see Taylor and Vasey (1936) and Rowell (1936)).
Based on license plate counts, a large fraction of in-migrants to California arrived from Southern drought states.
Using survey data elicited from children enrolling in public schools for the first time, Hoffman (1938) and Janow
(1940) also found that migrants to Oregon and California, respectively, were disproportionately from the Plains
states. Such data, of course, could not determine the probability that a migrant moved to California, from the
perspective of the source location, and hence does not shed light on the propensity of migrants to choose California
over other destinations. Webb and Brown (1938) provide evidence on this propensity, but for the highly selected
group of inter-state migrants receiving assistance from the transient bureaus of the Federal Emergency Relief

Notes: Destinations probabilities represent fraction of inter-county migrants residing in each location category
in terminal year, except as noted in second row. See text for details.


    Table 3 provides greater context. As indicated in the first row, less than ten percent of inter-
county migrants moved to California. Dust Bowl migrants were in fact more likely to move to
another Dust Bowl county. Moreover, the rate at which the Okies moved to California (9.82%)
was largely similar to that of migrants from elsewhere in the country (7.54%) during the 1930s
(the latter statistic excludes those living in California in 1930). The second row illustrates this
from a slightly different perspective: it indicates the fraction of movers who went to California,
conditional on an inter-state move. This probability was virtually identical for those from the
Dust Bowl and everywhere else. This is true despite the fact that the vast majority of non-Dust
Bowl migrants originated from places substantially further to the east and/or north.
    Comparing the first and fourth columns of Table 3 indicate that migration to California from
the Dust Bowl was also similar to that experienced from the region in the 1920s. The probability
of moving to California, given either an inter-county or an inter-state move, was actually greater
in the previous decade. In results not reported in Table 3, we find that, conditional on an
inter-county move, the fraction of Dust Bowl migrants who moved to any of the west coast
states of California, Oregon, and Washington was 14.9%; in the 1920s, the fraction of migrants
moving to the west coast was 13.9%. Finally, we compute the longitudinal direction of moves
using the centroids of the county of residence in the source and terminal year censuses. In the
1930s, 45.9% of migrants from the Dust Bowl moved in a westerly direction relative to their
1930 location. This compares with 45.6% in the previous decade. As such, our data indicate
that the “westward push” from the Dust Bowl was unexceptional during the 1930s.

Administration during 1934-1935. Of the approximately 5500 migrant families in their sample, 20% moved to
California. FERA data specific to the Dust Bowl is not available, but of the migrant families from the four Dust
Bowl states, 31% moved to California. The Census Bureau’s previously released data are also incomplete, as
they cover only the period 1935-1940; with respect to their published reports, U.S. Bureau of the Census (1946)
provides only migration flows for source states to the various census divisions (e.g., from Oklahoma to the Pacific
division), without any information on migration destination at the state- or county-level.

3.3   When Did They Move?

The 1940 Census was the first U.S. census to ask respondents of their location of residence five
years ago, in 1935. Given that this information was self-reported, it is less accurate relative to
the respondents’ information for 1930 or 1940 along two key dimensions: (i) whether the “five
years ago” information pertained precisely to the year 1935, and (ii) whether the name and
spelling of the county of residence were reported and recorded correctly.
   Nonetheless, this information allows us to determine how geographic mobility in the Dust
Bowl was approximately distributed across the early and latter parts of the decade. This is of
interest, given that the economic and environmental effects of the Dust Bowl were felt throughout
the 1930s, with many of the agriculture-related New Deal programs—the Emergency Farm
Mortgage Act, Farm Credit Act, and Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1933; establishment of the
Resettlement Administration (later the Farm Security Administration) and Soil Conservation
Service in 1935—initiated in the early-to-mid portions of the decade.
   Table 4 indicates the location patterns of Dust Bowl migrants between 1930 and 1940, for
those whose location of residence in 1935 could be accurately discerned. In the table, we denote
the county of origin in 1930 by the letter A, and the destination county in 1940 by the letter B.
The first row indicates that approximately one quarter of Dust Bowl migrants were still living in
their county of origin in 1935. By contrast, 52.8% had already moved to their destination county
by 1935. Rows three and four indicate the fraction of migrants who were in a third location,
C, in 1935 (that was neither their 1930 nor 1940 residence). A non-negligible fraction (21.8%)
made an “indirect” move between points A and B during the decade. Hence, the vast majority
of Dust Bowl migrants had already moved by mid-decade.
   This fact is particularly interesting, given that prior to this study, data on migration spanning


                                                    14
the entire decade was unavailable. Indeed, the literature’s conclusions on Dust Bowl migration
are based largely on the 1935 and 1940 location data obtained from the 1940 Census (see, for
instance, Worster (1979)). The results in Table 4 indicate that 52.8 + 18.1 = 70.9% of the
observations on inter-county migration that we identify through census linkage would have been
missed by simply using the 1935 location of residence information from the 1940 Census.13



4         Who Moved and Why?

As documented in Section 3, migration rates were much higher among Dust Bowlers compared
to other Americans. In this section, we investigate the determinants of mobility using data on
individual-level and county-level characteristics available from the census and other sources.14
We also use standard decomposition techniques to determine the extent to which differences in
mobility across Dust Bowl and other regions were due to differences in demographic character-
istics or differences in propensities for migration.


4.1        Determinants of Geographic Mobility

4.1.1        Inter-County and Inter-State Migration

We begin by analyzing how inter-county migration probabilities covaried with individual char-
acteristics. Let πi be a dummy variable that takes on the value of 1 if individual i moves across
counties between 1930 and 1940, and a value of 0 otherwise. To begin, we consider a simple
linear probability model for migration:

                                                πi = Xi β + i ,                                             (1)

where, Xi denotes characteristics of individual i in 1930.
         Included in Xi are standard demographic controls for age, marital status, and years of
schooling.15 The 1930 Census also allows us to determine whether an individual: is a “head of
family” or “other household head” (e.g., boarder, lodger); owns or rents his home; is living in his
    13
     Of course, our linkage methodology misses migrants who were not living in the Dust Bowl in 1930, moved
there by 1935, and moved again by 1940. Given the low rate of in-migration that is necessary to account for the
region’s depopulation, the number of such observations is likely to be small relative to those that we capture.
  14
     For analysis of individual-level determinants of migration in the modern-day (1981–2010) context, see Molloy
et al. (2011), and the references therein.
  15
     We do not include information on race in our analysis, since there exists almost no variation in race in the
Dust Bowl counties. Of the Dust Bowl heads enumerated by the census in 1930, 99.6% were white. Information on
education was obtained from the 1940 census, so our assumption is that education observed in 1940 was attained
prior to 1930. Given that our sample includes heads aged 16 − 60 in 1930, we drop individuals for which (years
of schooling + 5) > (age in 1930) from our regression analysis. We use this information to generate a categorical
variable for whether an individual has attended: less than 8 years of school, exactly 8 years (primary school
graduate), high school (9-12 years), or at least one year of post-secondary education (13+ years).


                                                       15
birth state or not. In terms of parental information, we can determine the number of children,
and the age of each child belonging to the head. In our benchmark specification, we include a
dummy variable for whether a child under the age of 5 years is present in the household; based
on our analysis of various ways to control for parenthood, this contained the most explanatory
power. We also include the individual’s 1930 occupational information. Not surprisingly, the
distribution of occupations in the Dust Bowl differs quite dramatically from that of our non-Dust
Bowl sample, and in particular, from the distribution observed in urban areas. For purposes
of comparison, we choose to summarize the occupational information into four broad, mutually
exclusive categories: farmers who are, by definition, self-employed; farm laborers who are, by
definition, wage workers; non-farm self-employed ; and non-farm wage workers.16
       The first column of Table 5 presents results for the representative sample of heads residing
in non-Dust Bowl counties in 1930. The excluded group in the regression are heads who are:
46-60 years old, single, with no children under 5, not living in their state of birth, with fewer
than 8 years of (primary) schooling, not a family head, renters, and farmers.
       The estimated coefficients are all of the expected sign and relative magnitudes. For instance,
there is a strong negative relationship between age and mobility, with 16-25 year olds 17.4
percentage points more likely, and 26-35 year olds 5.1 pp more likely (both significant at the
1% level) to move counties relative to 46-60 year olds.17 Not surprisingly, being the head of
a family, being married, and having young children—covariates that we refer to as “family
structure” hereafter—have very strong and statistically significant negative effects on migration
probability. Home owners and those living in their state of birth are less likely to move, and all
of these effects are significant at the 1% level. There is no statistically significant relationship
between occupational group and inter-county migration probability. Finally, mobility tends to
be increasing in education when one compares the lowest to the highest attainment level.18
       The second column of Table 5 presents the results for the Dust Bowl counties. Qualitatively,
the results are similar to those for the non-Dust Bowl sample. There are, however, important dif-
ferences. First, there is no statistically significant relationship between education and mobility;
if anything, the probability of migration falls with greater levels of attainment.
       Second, the effects of the family structure covariates are substantially weaker in the Dust
Bowl. The point estimate for being married is near zero; the point estimate is actually positive
for having young children (both are statistically insignificant). By contrast, these variables are
associated with significantly lower migration probabilities elsewhere. These family structure
  16
     See Section 5 for analysis that uses the occupational information in a much richer manner.
  17
     In analysis not presented here, we further split the 46-60 year old group into 46-55 year olds and 56-60 year
olds. Because none of the estimated coefficients were statistically distinguishable between these two groups, we
chose the more parsimonious specification presented here.
  18
     In Census data from 1940 onward, Rosenbloom and Sundstrom (2004) also find a positive relationship between
education and mobility.

covariates measure costs of migration. Under this interpretation, these costs were viewed as less
relevant—compared to the benefit of moving—for those living in the Dust Bowl.
   Similarly, one can view the variable indicating whether one is living in his state of birth as
measuring a cost of migration. Living in one’s birth state likely means having greater family
and/or economic ties to the place of residence. While living in one’s birth state has a strong neg-
ative effect on migration probability outside of the Dust Bowl, it has no effect in the Dust Bowl.
This indicates that Dust Bowl residents viewed this cost as being of no relevance, compared to
the benefit of moving.
   By contrast, there are a number of covariates that have stronger effects in the sample of Dust
Bowl heads. Being a home-owner has a much stronger negative effect on mobility. Relative to
all other occupations, the (excluded group of) farmers have a lower probability of moving.
These effects are large and statistically significant at either the 1% or 5% level. Hence, of
all occupations, farmers were the least likely to move from the Dust Bowl. This may seem
unsurprising if farmers are those who possess the most location-specific human and physical
capital. However, to the extent that this is true, this effect is not borne out for farmers anywhere
else in the country: as evidenced in columns 1 and 3 (to be discussed below), all occupation
groups have statistically indistinguishable probabilities of migration outside of the Dust Bowl.
The relative immobility of farmers is unique to the Dust Bowl region. This finding is surprising
given our cultural notion of the migrant Dust Bowl farmer expelled from the land, as portrayed
in literature, art, and music.
   In the third column of Table 5, we consider the sample of heads in rural, non-Dust Bowl
counties. As discussed in Section 3, the high rates of migration observed in the Dust Bowl were
not shared by other rural areas. In the context of this regression analysis, the objective is to
determine whether the differences in the effects of various covariates across samples are also
evident when comparing the Dust Bowl with other rural areas.
   Indeed, we find that the estimated differences remain. The regression results for the rural
non-Dust Bowl sample are largely the same as the non-Dust Bowl sample that includes both
urban and rural heads. Hence, the differences in the determinants of migration observed in the
Dust Bowl relative to outside the Dust Bowl are not shared by other rural populations.
   In the three rightmost columns of Table 5, we consider robustness of our results by extending
the set of individual-level covariates included in our migration probability model. The 1930
Census includes information on the birth state of an individual’s parents. With this, we construct
a dummy variable for whether the head’s birth state differs from that of both parents. We view
this as a measure of “inherited family mobility.” The 1930 Census also contains information on
whether a head owned a radio set. We include this information in the extended specification as
both a proxy for wealth and access to news/information.



                                                18
       Comparing column 1 to 4 (and 2 to 5, and 3 to 6), the results for the variables included
in the benchmark specification are extremely robust to this modification, as the coefficient
estimates and their significance are essentially unchanged. Regarding the additional variables
themselves, being born in a state different from both parents’ birth state has no additional
predictive power. By contrast, columns 4 and 5 indicate a strong negative relationship between
radio set ownership and mobility for both the Dust Bowl and non-Dust Bowl samples. If one
were to interpret owning a radio as a proxy for wealth, it is interesting that a similar relationship
emerges for home ownership: both variables exhibit a negative effect on migration, with the effect
being nearly twice as strong in the Dust Bowl.19 Radio set ownership could also measure access
to information about economic conditions.20 Under this interpretation, the negative effect of
ownership could indicate that those more informed about the wide-reach of the Dust Bowl and
Great Depression were less likely to believe migration would improve well-being.


4.1.2      Additional Results

We conduct a series of robustness checks which, for the sake of brevity, we present in Ap-
pendices C and D. First, we repeat the analysis on inter-county migration replacing the linear
probability model, equation (1), with a probit model. In Table 13, we report the marginal effects
estimated from this specification. Not surprisingly, the results are essentially identical to those
generated from the linear specification. We also extend our analysis of inter-county migration
by augmenting the individual-level covariates with a number of variables at the county-level,
as considered in Fishback et al. (2006).21 This allows for an additional robustness check, and
comparison of our results on gross migration (at the individual level) with their results on net
migration (at the county level). This is discussed in Appendix D. In Table 14, we repeat the
analysis of Table 5, this time considering the determinants of inter-state migration. Overall,
the results for inter-state migration are similar to those for inter-county migration. The salient
differences between Dust Bowl and non-Dust Bowl counties remain intact.
       In Section 3, we document how inter-county and inter-state migration rates in the Dust
Bowl region were similar when comparing the 1930s and 1920s decades. In this sense, the high
mobility rates in the Dust Bowl relative to the rest of the U.S. was characteristic of the region.
Here, we determine whether the influence of observables on migration choices were similar for
inhabitants of the region across decades, or whether the estimated effects from Tables 5 and 14
were unique to the Dust Bowl episode.
       Table 6 presents the results from the estimation of equation (1) on the Dust Bowl samples
  19
     While owning relative to renting is a clear indication of wealth, home ownership is very likely associated with
mobility through other channels. Transaction costs associated with selling a home is an obvious example.

     See, for instance, Ziebarth (2013) for evidence on the importance of radio set ownership on information
dissemination during the Great Depression.

of the 1920s and 1930s. For the 1920s regression, πi obviously indicates whether individual i
moved between 1920 and 1930, and Xi denotes individual-level characteristics in 1920. Since
information on education is not available for the 1920s sample, we omit these variables from the
regression specification.
       Comparing columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 reveals a large degree of similarity across decades in
the estimated coefficients on inter-county migration.22 A couple of differences are worth noting.
First, living in one’s birth state has no effect on migration probability in the 1930s. By contrast,
birth state has a strong negative effect in the 1920s, just as it does for the rest of the U.S. in the
1930s. Hence, the fact that individuals viewed the cost of leaving one’s birth state as negligible,
relative to the benefit of moving, is unique to the Dust Bowl experience. Second, wage workers
(either farm or non-farm) from the Dust Bowl region in the 1920s have a higher probability of
moving relative to the self-employed. This pattern is similar to the rest of the U.S. in the 1930s
(though the effects of occupation are not statistically significant in columns 1 and 3 of Table 5).
Hence, the fact that farmers were the least likely to move is also unique to the Dust Bowl, and
not a feature of residents of the region in a broader sense.
       For brevity, we do not discuss the remaining results in Table 6 in detail. In columns 3 and
4, we present the case of inter-state migration. Again, the result that Dust Bowl farmers were
least likely to move across state lines is not shared by residents of the region in the 1920s. As
documented in Subsection 3.2, a greater fraction of inter-county migration represented exodus
from the region during the Dust Bowl compared to the 1920s. In columns 5 and 6, we present
estimates of equation (1) where the dependent variable is an indicator for leaving the set of
twenty Dust Bowl counties. The results are largely unchanged relative to those for inter-county
migration presented in columns 1 and 2.
       As discussed in Subsection 3.3, the majority of Dust Bowl migrants moved prior to 1935.
We also investigate whether early-decade and late-decade migrants differ systematically in terms
of observable characteristics. Briefly, we find such evidence; detailed results are presented and
discussed in Appendix D. Finally, we analyze the determinants of moving to California during
the 1930s, and how these differed for Dust Bowl migrants compared to others. Perhaps most
interestingly, those working in agriculture were no more likely to move to California than others.
This contrasts with the popular notion that those who went west were displaced farmers and
farm laborers seeking agricultural work in California’s produce fields and orchards. Again, we
refer the reader to Appendix D for details.
  22
    Though not directly relevant for the analysis of the 1920s versus the 1930s, consider the comparison of columns
2 and 4 in Table 6 with column 2 in Tables 5 and 14, respectively. This demonstrates, again, the robustness of
our regression results on Dust Bowl migration, this time to the exclusion of the education measure: the coefficient
estimates on the remaining variables are substantively unchanged.

4.2   Decomposing Dust Bowl Differences

Section 3 documents large differences in inter-county and inter-state migration rates between the
Dust Bowl and elsewhere in the U.S. In this subsection, we use the results from Subsection 4.1
to decompose the differences in migration rates into explained and unexplained effects.
   Let π̄ 1 denote the migration rate observed within the sample of heads in the Dust Bowl
counties, and π̄ 0 be the migration rate observed within the sample of heads elsewhere in the
U.S. Clearly, the migration rates are related to the individual-level migration indicators, πi , of
equation (1) via π̄ J = (1/N ) N    J
                              P
                               i=1 πi , for J = {0, 1}.

   Following Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973), we decompose the difference in migration rates
across Dust Bowl and non-Dust Bowl regions as:

                            π̄ 1 − π̄ 0 = X̄ 1 β̂ 1 − X̄ 0 β̂ 0
                                                                            

the ones predicted by differences in the composition of individual-level characteristics across Dust
Bowl and non-Dust Bowl regions.
                                  The second part is the component attributable to differences
in the estimated coefficients, β̂ − β̂ 0 . These are effects that are unexplained by covariates,

driven by differences in the propensity to move for individuals of particular characteristics.
   Table 7 presents the results from the OB decomposition. For the sake of space and exposition,
the detailed decomposition effects of certain covariates have been grouped together. The effect
of the age dummies (relative to the excluded age) have been grouped together under “age.” The
same has been done for the dummies for “schooling” and “occupation.” Finally, the dummy
variables for family head, marital status, and having young children have been grouped together
under “family structure.”
   The first column considers the difference in the inter-county migration rate between the Dust
Bowl and all non-Dust Bowl counties for the benchmark specification of the linear probability
model, equation (1), as presented in the leftmost columns of Table 5. The first row indicates
large differences in mobility: the inter-county migration rate was 22.3 percentage points higher
in the Dust Bowl. The next row indicates that relatively little of this difference—specifically,
(0.0420 ÷ 0.223) = 18.8%—is explained by differences in the composition of individual-level
characteristics. Essentially all of the explained effect is due to the fact that a smaller fraction of
heads in the Dust Bowl were residing in their birth state in 1930. According to the coefficient

estimates for the non-Dust Bowl reference group, this predicts higher migration.
   Hence, the preponderance of the difference in migration rates across Dust Bowl counties and
elsewhere is due to differences in the propensities for migration. Of the 22.3 percentage point
difference in the inter-county migration rate, 81.2% is due to the unexplained effect.
   In terms of the detailed decomposition, the most important difference is due to the group
of covariates summarizing family structure. Differences in the propensity of family heads, the
married, and those with young children to move collectively predict 18.6 percentage points
higher migration from the Dust Bowl than elsewhere. Recalling the results of Table 5, while
these characteristics were associated with a lower likelihood of moving for those outside the Dust
Bowl, they had either no effect or substantially muted effects on migration within the Dust Bowl.
   Occupational differences in migration propensities are also important in accounting for ob-
served migration differences. As evidenced in Table 5, the likelihood of migration was much
higher for all occupation groups—relative to farmers—in the Dust Bowl than they were else-
where. Finally, the behavioral differences of Dust Bowlers residing in their state of birth con-
tribute to the difference in migration rates. While those in their birth state were much less likely
to move in the non-Dust Bowl sample, this effect was essentially nonexistent in the Dust Bowl
sample. As discussed in Subsection 4.1, these occupational and birth state effects are unique to
the Dust Bowl, not shared by either the non-Dust Bowl or the 1920s regional samples. As such,
the differences accounted for by these factors may reasonably be attributed to the environmental
and economic consequences of the Dust Bowl itself.
   The second column of Table 7 decomposes the difference in migration rate between the Dust
Bowl and rural non-Dust Bowl counties. Given the similarity in regression results for the “rural”
and “total” samples for those outside of the Dust Bowl in Subsection 4.1, it is not surprising
that the OB results are also very similar here. Migration rates were higher in the Dust Bowl
relative to other rural areas because of higher propensities to move.
   The last two columns consider robustness of the OB exercise; this is done by extending the
baseline migration model to include the additional regressors of radio set ownership and being
born in a different state than one’s parents. The detailed decomposition effects of these variables
are grouped together under the label “additional.” Again, the large differences in migration rates
are driven by factors unexplained by differences in covariates across Dust Bowl and non-Dust
Bowl regions.
   As an additional robustness check, Appendix C presents the analogous results of the Fairlie
(1999) decomposition using the Probit specification. Not surprisingly, the results are essentially
identical to those from the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition in Table 7. Table 16 in Appendix C
repeats the OB decomposition analysis, this time examining inter-state migration. For brevity,
we do not discuss the results in detail. The primary findings are similar to the case of inter-


                                                24
county migration. Explained factors account for little of the elevated migration rates in the
Dust Bowl; higher inter-state migration was due primarily to a greater propensity to move.
    Finally, we have also conducted the OB decomposition for mobility rates between the 1920s
and 1930s for residents of the Dust Bowl region. For brevity, we do not display these results
and make them available upon request. To briefly summarize, Table 1 indicates that the inter-
county migration rate was about 4 percentage points higher in the 1930s compared to the
previous decade. Essentially all of this difference is due to compositional differences, specifically,
the lower homeownership rate and larger fraction of non-farm wage workers in the 1930s (both
factors correlate with greater mobility; see Table 6).



5     Economic Effect of Migration

The nature of our linked data is well suited to assessing the impact of migration on individuals’
economic outcomes during the 1930s decade. Because we observe location and occupation in
both 1930 and 1940, it is straightforward to estimate the effect of the decision to leave or remain
in the Dust Bowl region on one’s occupational earnings. We estimate this effect in two ways.
We first consider a reduced form analysis of the association between migration and earnings via
OLS. We also study a structural treatment effects model to identify the causal effect of migration
on earnings.
    Both results are of interest, for slightly different reasons. The OLS estimate reveals the cor-
relation between migration choice and occupational earnings at the end of the decade, answering
the historical question of what happened to the Dust Bowl migrants relative to those who chose
to remain. This is a fundamental question with regard to the Dust Bowl, and one that has not
been addressed systematically before. The structural estimate of the treatment effect informs
us of the causal impact of moving. This is of economic interest in understanding how this mass
migration episode compares to other notable historical episodes and adds to our knowledge of
how individuals optimize over location in an attempt to mitigate the impact of economic shocks.


5.1   What Happened to the Migrants?

To estimate the association between the migration decision and subsequent economic outcome
for the individual, we estimate via OLS a simple, reduced-form specification:

                                yi,1940 = τ πi + αyi,1930 + Xi β + υi .                           (3)

Here, yi is an economic outcome variable (that we discuss shortly) for individual i in 1930 and
1940, πi takes on the value of 1 if the individual leaves the Dust Bowl region and 0 otherwise,

and Xi is a vector of controls.23 Because the choice of whether to remain in the Dust Bowl region
or leave is endogenous, τ is simply how migrants’ earnings in 1940 differed from observationally
similar non-migrants (“persisters,” hereafter).
       Unfortunately, the 1930 census contains no information on income or earnings, and the
1940 census includes income only for wage and salary earners (earnings for employers and the
self-employed, including farmers, are not recorded). Both censuses do contain information on
occupation. Therefore, our primary economic outcome variable is log earnings imputed on
the basis of occupation.24 This allows for the measure of median earnings differences across
occupations, but not differences within occupation. We also generate results using the direct
income measure from the 1940 census, but because of the large number of selected individuals
for whom this information is missing, we consider this for robustness purposes only.
       The results are displayed in Table 8. Estimating equation (3) on all individuals in our sample

      Note that the definition of πi differs from the bulk of the previous analysis, where it was typically an indicator
of inter-county or inter-state migration. In the context of the outcome effect of migration, leaving the Dust Bowl
is the more natural measure. Not surprisingly, given that approximately 90% of inter-county migrants left the
Dust Bowl (see Table 2) region, the results are not sensitive to this choice. Finally, Xi includes age, education,
the set of “family structure” variables, homeownership, living in birthstate, and a state-level dummy variable.
   24
      This is the “OCCSCORE” variable from IPUMS, generated by crosswalking the 1930 occupations to 1950
occupation codes, then assigning observations the median income level for workers in each occupation in 1950.
For more on the usage of this occupational earnings measure in similar settings, see Abramitzky et al. (2012) and
Collins and Wanamaker (2014).

indicates a statistically significant, but economically small increase in occupational earnings for
migrants. This is presented in the first column. Those who left the Dust Bowl experienced
occupational changes that translated to a 3.5 percent increase in earnings on average. This
result, however, masks important differences between the roughly half of our sample who were
farmers in 1930 and the half who were not. This is shown in columns 3 and 5. Conditional on
being a farmer in 1930, migrants had 1940 occupational earnings on average 9.5 percent greater
than those who stayed in the region; this is significant at the 1% level. By contrast, non-farmer
migrants experienced a 5.6 percent decline in earnings relative to persisters.
    Columns 2, 4, and 6 of Table 8 repeats the analysis, replacing the state fixed effect with a
county fixed effect in the set of regressors. The results are largely unchanged. Finally, we have
conducted the same analysis for the subsample of wage and salary earners in 1940 with reported
income. We find that the same pattern emerges: small gains to migrants in the aggregate,
masking large gains for farmers and moderate losses for non-farmers.25
    To shed light on these results, Table 9 displays transition matrices across broad occupational
groups for migrants and persisters. Occupations are grouped based on their earnings. Farmers
in 1930 who left the Dust Bowl were more likely than persisters to experience downward occu-
pational moves, becoming laborers in 1940 (21.6 versus 8.6 percent). However, this tendency
for greater downward mobility was more than offset by their greater likelihood of experiencing
upward moves toward semi-skilled or high-skilled occupations (39.0 percent for migrants versus
19.0 percent for persisters). The negative migration effect for non-farmers is driven primarily by
the greater tendency of high-skilled migrants to transition into semi-skilled occupations relative
to persisters (who were more likely to remain in a high-skill occupation).26
    Clearly, contrary to long-standing popular perception, the typical Dust Bowl migrant was not
destined for economic hardship and loss. Migrant farmers—far from ending up as marginalized,
poorly paid agricultural laborers—enjoyed better occupational outcomes than did those who
persisted. Also, the most typical downward occupational move associated with migration was
a greater tendency for high-skilled migrants to transition to semi-skilled occupations, a move
that, while associated with a loss in earnings on average, was not associated with falling into
poverty. Two caveats apply. First, since we only observe individuals in 1930 and 1940, we
cannot rule out the possibility that migrants experienced significant hardship between the time
of migration and 1940. We can only rule out the prevalence of negative outcomes that persisted
until 1940. Second, because we observe only occupation and impute earnings, it is possible
that some individuals who made upward occupational moves earned less in 1940 than in 1930
(and, of course, vice versa). The potential error associated with using imputed rather than
  25
     Given the highly selected nature of this subsample, and for the sake of brevity, we do not present them here
and make them available upon request.
  26
     This more than offsets the effect of greater tendency among migrant laborers to move up the occupational
ladder, relative to their counterparts who stayed.

observed earnings could be more acute for farmers, for whom there was large variance in earnings
nationally. However, the likelihood that we are significantly understating earnings losses of
migrants who transitioned out of farming is mitigated in this specific case by the fact that
high-earning, large landholding farms were uncommon in the Dust Bowl region in the 1930s.


5.2       Selection and Treatment Effect of Migration

While equation (3) is a straightforward means of assessing the economic outcomes of Dust
Bowl migration, it is not appropriate for assessing the causal treatment effect of the migration,
as individuals self-selected as migrants or persisters. Failing to account for possible migrant
selectivity could result in τ being a biased estimate of the treatment effect. Theories of migration
choice allow for either positive or negative selection, so the nature of selection in a particular
case is an empirical question.
       Following McKenzie et al. (2010) and Collins and Wanamaker (2014), a simple measure of
migrant selectivity can be obtained by estimating the relationship between earnings in 1930 and
the subsequent migration decision:

                                         πi = θyi,1930 + Xi β + i .                                        (4)

When the individual-level controls Xi are omitted from equation (4), θ is a simple measure of
migrant selectivity; with Xi included, θ measures “selection on unobservables.” In either case,
θ > 0 indicates that migrants were positively selected, and θ < 0 that they were negatively
selected.
       For brevity, we summarize here and make details of our results available upon request.
Estimating equation (4), there is evidence of mild positive selection on unobservables (θ =
0.0482, s.e. = 0.0182); this is balanced by mild negative selection on certain observables (such
as family headship and home ownership). As a result, estimating equation (4) without controlling
for Xi , we find no appreciable evidence of selection among the Dust Bowl migrants (θ = 0.0198,
s.e. = 0.0178).
       It is instructive to put this finding in context with other migration episodes. One straightfor-
ward comparison is with out-migration from this same region in the 1920s (a period when gross
migration rates were high, as documented in Section 3). Estimating equation (4) on the 1920s
sample without controlling for Xi , we find stronger evidence of positive selection: migrants’
earnings were 5.7 log points greater than non-migrants, and this difference is statistically signif-
icant at the 5% level.27 Migrant selectivity during the Dust Bowl was also small relative to two
other important U.S. migration episodes. African-American participants in the Great Migra-
tion of the early twentieth century had pre-migration earnings 10 to 15 log points higher than
  27
    Controlling for Xi , we also find positive selection on unobservables. However, it should be noted that data
on educational attainment, an important determinant of earnings, is not available for the 1920s sample.


                                                      29
non-migrants (see Collins and Wanamaker (2014)). And while differing methodologies prevent
direct comparison, Abramitzky et al. (2012) find strong evidence of negative selection among
urban Norwegian migrants to the U.S. during the age of mass migration in the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries.
      A complementary approach to accounting for possible migrant selectivity is to explicitly
model the migration choice along with the determination of earnings in 1940. We consider a
treatment effects model that identifies the causal effect of migration on earnings. The earnings
equation is simply (3) from above. However, πi is now modeled as an observed binary decision
to leave or remain in the Dust Bowl region, driven by an unobserved latent variable:

                                           πi∗ = γ1 yi,1930 + Zi γ2 + i ,                                     (5)

that represents the net benefit of migration. Consequently:
                                          (
                                             1 if πi∗ > 0
                                     πi =                 ,                                                    (6)
                                             0 otherwise

where υ and  are assumed to be distributed bivariate normal with mean zero. The model—
equations (3), (5), and (6)—is estimated via maximum likelihood.28
      If Zi contains at least one variable that is excluded from Xi , then τ is identified without
reliance on the precise functional form of the model. In this case, a feature of the 1930 census
provides a plausible exclusion restriction. Respondents were asked whether they owned a “radio
set,” the only time the census has asked about a consumer good in the main questionnaire.
Households with radios would likely have been more informed than those without, particularly
with respect to economic conditions beyond the local area. This information would have been
pertinent to migration choice. But given the nature of information dissemination, even house-
holds without radios would have been informed if they were in contact with those who did own
radios. To capture the effect of information acquired via radio (both directly and by word-of-
mouth), we use the share of households in the county with radio sets, and include this measure
in Zi but not in Xi . Using county-level radio penetration rather than individual-level radio
ownership has the added benefit of avoiding the possible correlation between ownership and
household wealth, which would argue against exclusion from Xi .29
      One potential weakness of this method is that, even at the county level, prevalence of ra-
dio ownership in 1930 could be correlated with 1940 earnings, perhaps being related to local
economic development in a way that mattered to individuals’ 1940 occupation. To account for
this, we include in Xi and Zi several county-level controls for economic development and/or
job opportunity alongside our individual-level controls. The county-level controls are per capita

tional earnings in 1930, and New Deal spending on public works/relief grants and AAA benefits
from 1933-39.30 The individual-level controls are the same as those in the regression analysis of
equation (3) in Subsection 5.1.
       Table 10 presents the results of maximum likelihood estimation of the treatment effects
model. Column 2 indicates that individuals who lived in counties with greater radio ownership
were significantly less likely to leave the Dust Bowl region. The coefficient estimate of -0.0293
implies that a one standard deviation increase in radio penetration led to a 12 pp reduction in
out-migration probability, relative to a baseline probability of 46 percent. Column 4 indicates
that this affect was stronger for farmers, for whom a one standard deviation increase decreased
out-migration by 23 percentage points.31 One plausible interpretation is that those with access

     If the migration equation is estimated via OLS, as if it were the first stage in an instrumental variables

                                                         31
to information via radio better understood that economic conditions and labor market prospects
were poor not only in one’s own Dust Bowl-affected county, but throughout the Great Plains and
nation as a whole. To the extent that individuals perceived economic distress to be a macroe-
conomic phenomenon, they may have been less inclined to move to seek better opportunity
elsewhere.
    Turning to the treatment effect estimates, we see a pattern that is similar to the simple
OLS results. Column 1 of Table 10 indicates a small effect of migration on earnings for the
whole sample, in this case negative and statistically insignificant. Column 3, on the other hand,
indicates a significant positive effect for those who were farmers in 1930. Leaving the Dust Bowl
resulted in an approximate 9 log point increase in occupational earnings, an effect very similar
to the one found in Subsection 5.1.32 This similarity between the reduced-form estimate and the
structural estimate of the causal effect is consistent with negligible migrant selectivity (either
positive or negative), corroborating the results from the analysis of selectivity via equation (4)
above.
    Perhaps this is not surprising for the Dust Bowl migration, given the environmental catastro-
phe. In contrast to other notable historical episodes, such as 19th and early-20th century mass
European migration to the U.S. and the 20th century Great Migration of African Americans
from the South to the North, Dust Bowl migrants were perhaps driven to a greater extent by
necessity or desperation, relative to a more calculated weighing of costs and benefits of location
choice. In this sense, migration from the Dust Bowl would have been closer to a randomly
assigned treatment than is typical. Regardless, both the structural and reduced-form estimates
indicate that migration from the Dust Bowl was not associated with long-lasting negative labor
market effects; for farmers, the effects were positive on average.



6     Conclusion

This research represents the first attempt to systematically measure and analyze gross migration
flows associated with the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. We construct longitudinal data from the U.S.
Census records to study migration patterns and their outcomes for those most greatly affected
by the economic and environmental crisis. A number of novel findings emerge.
    First, migration rates were much higher in the Dust Bowl compared to everywhere else in the
U.S. This excess migration is due to the fact that individual-level characteristics that were neg-
1.3 for non-farmers. With standard errors clustered at the county level, those F -statistics are 6.7, 39.9, and 0.7
respectively. Because of the low F -statistic for non-farmers, we are reluctant to draw inference from the results
for that subsample.
  32
     Note also that Table 10 indicates a negative effect for non-farmers. Relative to the OLS results, the effect is
much stronger. But as discussed above, the weak association between radio penetration and migration probability
makes the results for the non-farmer subsample suspect.



                                                        32
atively associated with mobility elsewhere (those related to family structure and local/regional
ties) were unrelated to migration probability within the Dust Bowl. Second, relative to other
occupational groups, farmers in the Dust Bowl were the least likely to move; by contrast, no
relationship existed between migration probability and occupation outside of the Dust Bowl.
This is surprising, given the cultural notion of the migrant Dust Bowl farmer expelled from the
land. Third, out-migration rates from the Dust Bowl were not much higher than they were
from the same region in the 1920s. Hence, the depopulation of the Dust Bowl was due largely
to a sharp drop in migrant inflows during the 1930s. Fourth, the westward exodus from the
Dust Bowl to California was unexceptional; migrants from the Dust Bowl were no more likely
to move to California than migrants from any other part of the country. Instead, Dust Bowl
migrants made relatively local moves, tending to remain in one of the Dust Bowl affected states.
Finally, there is no appreciable evidence of selection (either positive or negative) among the Dust
Bowl migrants. As a result, reduced-form estimates and structural estimates of the causal effect
of leaving the Dust Bowl are similar: migration was not associated with long-lasting negative
earnings effects on the whole, whereas for farmers, the effects were positive.

B     Imputing In-Migration

The population of the twenty Dust Bowl counties in 1920, 1930, and 1940 are available from the
Census.
    For the 1930s, data on the number of births and deaths are available annually, at the county-
level. These are from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Birth, Stillbirth, and Infant Mortality
Statistics for the Continental United States, the Territory of Hawaii, the Virgin Islands and
Mortality Statistics for 1930-36, and Vital Statistics of the United States for 1937-39. The
exception to this are the eight counties in Texas, where fertility and mortality statistics are
available beginning only in 1933. As such, the data for Texas, 1930-32, are imputing using the
birth and death rates from the six counties in Kansas.
    Using these vital statistics data, and assuming that the out-migration rate that we have
derived on heads applies to all individuals, the implied number of in-migrants to the Dust Bowl
region during the 1930s was 18,694. Expressed relative to the population in 1930, this translates
into an in-migration rate of 15.5%. For robustness, we have also imputed the 1930-32 statistics
for Texas using the birth and death rates from all of the other Dust Bowl counties (in Colorado,
Kansas, and Oklahoma), and obtain very similar results. Doing so implies 18,826 in-migrants
to the Dust Bowl, or an in-migration rate of 15.6%.
    For the 1920s, vital statistics at the county-level are available only for Kansas for the entire
decade. Data for the Colorado and Oklahoma counties are available only for 1928-29. These
are from Birth, Stillbirth, and Infant Mortality Statistics for the Continental United States, the
Territory of Hawaii, the Virgin Islands and Mortality Statistics. No data are available for Texas.
As such, the missing data are imputing using the birth and death rates from the six counties in
Kansas, in the same manner as done for the 1930s.
    Using these data, and assuming that the out-migration rate for heads applies to all individ-
uals, the implied number of in-migrants to the region during the 1920s was 46,134. Expressed
relative to the population in 1920, this is in-migration rate of 47.3%. For robustness, we have
also imputed the missing vital statistics using the birth and death rates for the rural white
population of the geographically similar states of Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming; again, we
obtain similar results. Doing so implies 45,605 in-migrants during the 1920s, or an in-migration
rate of 46.8%.

D.1     County-Level Determinants of Migration

Here, we include a number of county-level variables in the linear probability model for migra-
tion, equation (1). Specifically, we include measures of the average per capita level of New
Deal spending during the 1930s: (i) spending on non-repayable relief grants (e.g., through the
Federal Emergency Relief Administration) and public works grants (e.g., through the Works
Progress Administration), and (ii) benefit payments to farmers made through the Agricultural
Adjustment Administration. We also consider two measures of climactic conditions experienced
in the county, all taken from Fishback et al. (2006).
    Columns 1 and 4 of Table 17 present the results for the non-Dust Bowl sample. Living in
a county with greater spending on relief and public works grants decreased one’s probability of
moving. Fishback et al. (2006) find that increased spending resulted in positive net migration
into such counties, as these funds were associated with WPA employment opportunities and
temporary relief for the unemployed. Qualitatively, our results are consistent with this: all else
equal (in particular, holding gross in-migration equal), lower migration rates at the individual
level would result in less out-migration and, hence, positive net migration.
    For the non-Dust Bowl sample, increased spending on AAA benefits increased the probability
of migration; this is significant at the 5% level. Fishback et al. (2006) find that AAA spending
was associated with negative net migration. Since these funds were paid to farmers in exchange
for culling livestock and removing land from production, this likely sped the transition of labor
out of agriculture. Again, our results are consistent with this as higher individual-level migration
rates in a county are associated with higher out-migration and, hence, negative net migration.
     The three leftmost columns of Table 17 (Version 1) include a variable for the county’s average
annual precipitation during the decade, as a measure of drought and poor seasons. As column
1 indicates, the amount of precipitation has no discernible effect on an individual’s probability
of migration in the non-Dust Bowl sample. In our view, this is not surprising given that the
normal level of precipitation varies widely with geography; as such, average annual precipitation
is likely a poor measure of severe or atypical climate for the country as a whole. By contrast,
our Dust Bowl sample comes from a small geographic region where normal precipitation varies
little across county. As column 2 indicates, variation from the mean precipitation experienced
during the 1930s is a strong predictor of mobility within the Dust Bowl: those living in counties
with greater precipitation were much less likely to move. This is significant at the 5% level.
    In the rightmost columns (Version 2), we replace the average annual precipitation measure
with the number of months of extreme drought in the county during the 1930s. The same
relationship between climate and mobility emerges for the Dust Bowl: as indicated in column 5,
a greater incidence of drought is associated with higher probabilities of inter-county migration.
Despite this being a better measure of climate extremes at the national level, we again find no
significant relationship between weather and mobility outside of the Dust Bowl.
   Finally, columns 2 and 5 indicate that within the Dust Bowl, increased relief/public works
spending and AAA spending at the county level are both associated with higher migration
probabilities. In all cases, this finding is statistically significant at the 1% level.33

    We note the potential endogeneity of New Deal spending with migration, making inference problematic. As
such, we view the sign (as opposed to the magnitude) of the coefficient estimates as informative, and note the

D.2     Early-Decade versus Late-Decade Migrants

To study difference between early- versus late-decade movers, we let πi in regression equation
(1) take the value 1 if individual i made an inter-county move between 1935 and 1940, and a
value of 0 if he moved between 1930 and 1935.34 Column 1 of Table 18 presents the result of
this analysis.
    A number of interesting relationships emerge between the covariates and the timing of mi-
gration. The rightmost columns of Table 18 summarize the variation in covariates across early
and late movers, presenting the fraction of individuals satisfying each characteristic. Being the
head of a family and owning one’s home are associated with moving late in the decade. For
instance, of those who moved between 1930-35, only 28% were home owners; of the late-decade
movers, 48% were. The coefficient estimates in column 1 indicate that being a homeowner and
family head are economically and statistically significantly, even after controlling for each other
and other correlated factors (such as marital status and age). Hence, there is selection on certain
observables among migrants from the first and second half of the decade.
    Finally, recall that farmers were the least likely occupational group to move from the Dust
Bowl. Table 18 indicates that among those that moved, farmers had a greater tendency to move
late in the decade.35 However, after controlling for other individual-level characteristics, this
tendency is not statistically significant. This fact is made more clearly when we consider an
alternative regression specification (not reported in the table) in which the three occupational
dummies are replaced by a single dummy variable for farmers; in this case, the point estimate
on farmer is 0.0154 with a standard error of 0.0272.


D.3     Moving to California

The methodology we pursue is identical to that of Section 4.1. We analyze the regression model
of equation (1), and restrict our attention to inter-county migrants. The outcome variable, πi ,
now takes on a value of 1 if inter-county migrant i moved to a county in California; it takes on a
value of 0 if he moved to any other county (obviously, migrants who originated from California
in 1930 are excluded from this analysis). The explanatory variables, Xi , are the same as those
in Section 4.1, except that we include an additional age dummy for 46-55 year olds; we do so
because we find statistically significant differences in migration probabilities for this age group
relative to 56-60 year olds.
    The regression results are presented in Table 19.36 The leftmost columns present the re-
sults for the benchmark specification. The rightmost columns present results when the dummy
variable for whether the head’s birth state differs from both parents is included; we found that
robustness of the results for the individual-level variables relative to Table 5. Isolating exogenous variation in
spending is beyond the scope of this paper; see Fishback et al. (2006) where this issue is addressed comprehensively.
   34
      Note that our sample is restricted, obviously, to inter-county migrants for whom the 1935 location information
is discernible. Also, in this early- versus late-decade analysis, we limit attention to migrants who made only one
(observable) move; those who moved both between 1930-35 and 1935-40 are excluded.
   35
      This is consistent with the finding reported in Larson (1940) that, from estimates made by the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, the farm population in the Southern Great Plains experienced larger declines during
1935-38 than during 1930-35.
   36
      Note that comparisons of these results with those from Section 4.1 should not be made, given the very different
nature of the selected samples. In Section 4.1, the samples are representative of the resident populations, while
here, the analysis conditions on those who have chosen to make an inter-county move.

owning a radio had no explanatory power, so that variable has been omitted here. A number of
interesting differences are apparent between Dust Bowl migrants and those from elsewhere.
    The most obvious is the very different age profile of movers to California. For migrants
outside the Dust Bowl, the excluded age group of 55-60 year olds was least likely to move
to California; the most likely was the youngest, aged 16-25. By contrast, among Dust Bowl
migrants, it is the oldest group of 55-60 year olds that was most likely to move there; while only
the estimated age dummy for 36-45 year olds is statistically significant, all four age dummies
are negative and economically significant.
    Second, conditional on moving counties, residing in one’s birth state in 1930 has strong
negative predictive power outside the Dust Bowl with respect to California migration. The
results for the extended specification indicate that this is also true for those born outside of
their parents’ birth state. Hence, for non-Dust Bowl migrants, those with a history of personal
mobility or “inherited family mobility” are more likely to move to California. By contrast,
neither of these results bear out among the Dust Bowl migrants.
    Within the Dust Bowl sample, of the four occupational groups, it is the non-farm self-
employed who were most likely to move to California. It is interesting to note that this contrasts
with the popular notion that those who went west were displaced farmers and farm laborers
seeking agricultural work in California’s produce fields and orchards. The fact that the self-
employed and home owners (as opposed to renters) were more likely to move to California
suggests that a degree of personal wealth was relevant for such a move. By contrast, no clear or
statistically significant relationship exists between occupation or home-ownership and California
migration outside of the Dust Bowl.
    Finally, we have conducted this regression analysis for the 1920s sample of migrants from the
Dust Bowl region. For brevity, we do not display the results here and make them available upon
request. We briefly note two findings. First, the age profile of movers to California in the 1920s
is decreasing, as is the case in the non-Dust Bowl samples of the 1930s. That the 55-60 year
olds were most likely to move to California is unique to the Dust Bowl migrants. And finally, as
with the non-Dust Bowlers of the 1930s, residing in one’s birth state in 1920 is a strong negative
predictor of California migration in the 1920s sample. Hence, the fact that living in one’s birth
state is unrelated to moving to California in the 1930s is, again, unique to the Dust Bowl.
