This paper investigates the ways in which the network of relationships between dealers shapes
their trading behavior in the corporate bond market. They charge lower spreads to dealers with
whom they have the strongest ties, and this effect is all the more pronounced at times of market
turmoil. Moreover, highly connected and systemically important dealers exploit their connections
at the expense of peripheral dealers as well as clients, charging higher markups than to other core
dealers, especially during periods of uncertainty. We show that following the collapse of a
flagship dealer in 2008, trading chains lengthened by almost 20 percent and that the increase was
even greater for the institutions that had the closest ties with the defaulted dealer. Finally, we find
evidence that dealers drastically reduced their inventory during the financial crisis. These results
can help inform the debate on the risks posed by the interconnectedness of the financial system,
showing how this could be a source of market fragility and illiquidity.

1        Introduction

The global …nancial crisis of 2008 highlighted the key role of the intertwined nature of …nancial

markets in shaping the transmission of risk and the buildup of fragility throughout the system.

At the same time, the growing importance of o¤-exchange trading, with many securities traded in

opaque OTC markets (corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, etc.), has

been blamed for the persistent illiquidity of these markets. Even the new regulatory frameworks

adopted in the aftermath of the crisis, from the proposal that clearing houses serve as central

counterparties to the de…nition of systemically important …nancial institutions, have incorporated

these views. Yet exactly what role is played by …nancial system interconnectedness and the ways

in which large …nancial institutions may a¤ect OTC market liquidity remain at best imperfectly

understood.

        This paper investigates dealers’ trading behavior and pricing strategy in the corporate bond

market to shed new light on the role of the network of existing relationships among dealers in

shaping the transmission of risk and in‡uencing market liquidity. The corporate bond market is

one of the world’s largest and most important sources of capital for …rms, with outstanding debt

now of about $8 trillion.1 Daily trading volume in the U.S. averages $20 billion, virtually all

between broker-dealers and large institutions in a decentralized OTC market.2 Hence, this market

is ideal for studying how the network of dealer relationships shapes trading behavior and liquidity

provision, and investigating how dealers responded during the crisis.3

        We start by showing that the inter-dealer corporate bond market has a de…nite, persistent core-

periphery network structure. In other words, there are only a few highly interconnected dealers,

the core dealers, which intermediate most of the transactions with other dealers and with clients

    2
      In the last few years, investors have been attracted to …xed income securities, and bond issuers have taken
advantage of the low interest rate environment. For instance, FINRA reports that in 2012 issuers borrowed a record
$1.54 trillion, up 29% from 2011, owing chie‡y to a shift in retail portfolio composition from equities to …xed-income
instruments.
    3
      As we make clear in the next section, our empirical …ndings are informed and guided by the burgeoning theoretical
literature on networks and o¤-exchange markets. Following the seminal articles of Allen and Gale (2000) and Freixas
et al. (2000), a growing body of work has considered …nancial networks as a possible mechanism for shock propagation
and ampli…cation. For instance, Acemoglu et al. (2015) characterize the extent of contagion when …nancial institutions
are linked via unsecured debt contracts, and Elliott et al. (2015) study cascading failures in a model of equity cross-
holdings. In a similar vein, Stanton et al. (2014) develops a network model in which heterogeneous …nancial norms and
systemic vulnerabilities are endogenous and tests its implications with data on …nancial intermediaries’securitization
network.



                                                          1
(retail investors, insurance companies, mutual and hedge funds, etc.) and many sparsely connected

ones transacting less frequently, i.e. the peripheral dealers.4 Given this structure, we analyze

how dealers’markups and trading behavior di¤er according to their counterparties’position in the

network, and how their previous relationships with counterparties a¤ect trading outcomes.5 The

…rst result is that when dealers trade with clients rather than other dealers, they pro…t signi…cantly

more. On average, similar bonds in the same industry traded by the same dealer go at a signi…cantly

higher price to non-dealer clients, an extra markup of about 50 basis points. We also show that more

central dealers pay lower spreads while charging signi…cantly higher spreads to their counterparties.6

       Importantly, we also …nd signi…cantly lower spreads between dealers with stronger prior rela-

tionships, as proxied by the fraction of bonds exchanged between two counterparties in the previous

quarter. Here the results do not depend on di¤erences in the type, volume or quality of the trans-

actions of more or less connected dealers, because these characteristics are controlled for. The

magnitude of the e¤ects, moreover, is economically signi…cant: the di¤erence in the terms of trade

between the bottom and the top decile of relationship strength comes to about 20 basis points.

And the results hold even in the most conservative speci…cation, where we control for seller- and

buyer-month …xed e¤ects, to o¤set time-varying shocks at dealer level that could a¤ect trading

behavior. Overall, our …ndings constitute evidence that existing trading relationships, which most

of the theoretical literature abstracts from, are crucial in determining trading behavior, at least on

a par with network centrality.

       Now we can answer the main questions we want to pose. Does the importance of these prior

relationships vary over time? And do dealers tend to provide liquidity to their counterparties

in times of market turmoil? We capture periods of …nancial market stress in two ways. One

is a simple volatility index (VIX or MOVE). The second splits the full sample into three sub-

periods, January 2005-December 2006, January 2007-August 2008, and September 2008-July 2009.
   4
     This network structure has been the subject of recent theoretical studies on the risks created by highly intercon-
nected institutions (see for instance Babus (2016), Farboodi (2014) and Atkeson et al. (2015)).
   5
     Our main dependent variable is the di¤erence between the price at which a dealer sells a bond and his previous
buying price. We call this the spread, pro…t margin or markup. We provide results for two di¤erent measures. The
more conservative approach considers only trades in which the dealer buys a bond and then sells it within an hour.
However, we also provide consistent evidence in which the benchmark buy price is the average at which other dealers
buy the same bond during the same week.
   6
     Given these results, our paper is related to empirical studies on OTC market transaction costs and price discovery,
such as Bessembinder et al. (2006), Schultz (2001) Edwards et al. (2007), Green et al. (2007b), and Green et al.
(2010). In other related works, Biais (1993) and ?) consider the comparative advantages of bilateral and electronic
trading. Our own focus is on how relationships shape dealers’liquidity provision during periods of uncertainty.


                                                           2
The …rst period represents normal times, the second corresponds to the run-up to crisis, and the

third is the peak of the crisis following the default of Lehman Brothers. We …nd that having

stronger relationships and being a more central dealer are all the more important during periods

of high uncertainty. Speci…cally, during periods of stress dealers provide less liquidity to clients

and peripheral dealers (than to other core dealers), charging them signi…cantly higher markups.

In other words, at times of market turmoil dealers tend to rely even more heavily on their central

position in the network, as more connected institutions can impose higher spreads and purchase at

signi…cantly lower prices. The results are further con…rmed when we split the sample over time:

markups charged are signi…cantly larger for the more central dealers during the run-up and even

more so at the peak of the crisis. In contrast, dealers did provide liquidity to the other institutions

with which they had the strongest relationships, in fact, existing trading relationships drive a

signi…cant portion of the variation in spreads during the peak of the crisis. This implies that in

turmoil dealers rely more heavily on their closest counterparties, as is suggested by Glode and Opp

(2016). Our results carry important implications for the theoretical models of trading in OTC

markets. Essentially, the common random-matching framework, which ignores bilateral trading

relationships, de facto, by assuming that traders interact only in anonymous spot transactions,

misses an important feature of o¤-exchange markets.

      Also, we examine how dealers’trading behavior reacted to the collapse of a ‡agship dealer that

defaulted in September 2008. We code this dealer as Dealer D.7 First of all, after the failure of Dealer

D the intermediation chains between buyers and sellers lengthened signi…cantly. Since longer chains

are associated with higher spreads, they also have adverse e¤ects on the clients who are seeking

liquidity. Second, we test whether dealers tend to lean against the wind, i.e. accumulating bond

inventories during periods of turmoil. We compute dealers’ inventories in the weeks before and

after Dealer D’s collapse, excluding new issuance and maturing bonds, and …nd that they shrank

signi…cantly more for the bonds that clients were selling more vigorously. In fact, dealers decreased

their holdings of the bonds that other market participants were selling most intensely by at least

20%. This is strongly suggestive that one of the main factors in the increase in intermediation costs

and market illiquidity was dealers’ inability (or unwillingness) to expand inventories. As further

evidence of this channel, we also show that inventories shrank most for the bonds in whose regard
  7
      Under an agreement with the FINRA, we are not allowed to disclose dealer identities.


                                                          3
the intermediation chain lengthened the most. These results can inform the debate on dealers’role

during the crisis and how signi…cantly they aggravated the market disruption.

      Finally, if these existing trading relationships are readily replaceable among dealers, then the

failure of Dealer D should not impact on its counterparties. Instead, we …nd that the dealers most

closely connected with Dealer D reduced their markups signi…cantly after September 2008. One

possible explanatory factor could be a di¤erence in the composition of the bonds traded after the

collapse. Alternatively, the results might also be driven by endogenous matching between more

fragile counterparties. In reality, however, we show that these results persist over time and are

not driven by these factors, by comparing the same bond traded by the same counterparties in

the same week, the only di¤erence being sellers’relative exposure to Dealer D. This suggests that

having lost their main counterparty, dealers had to form new trading relationships, but that these

were signi…cantly less pro…table.

      Overall, our …ndings contribute to improving our understanding of the role of …nancial system

interconnectedness, which has become a theme of policy debate. In the words of Donald Kohn,

the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board: “Supervisors need to enhance their under-

standing of the direct and indirect relationships among markets and market participants, and the

associated impact on the system. Supervisors must also be even more keenly aware of the manner in

which those relationships [...] can change over time and how those relationships behave in times of

stress.”8 These results shed new light on the way in which these prior relationships may sometimes

act as a bu¤er in periods of distress, but they also show that they accentuate systemic fragility, as

connections with vulnerable dealers might a¤ect trading outcomes even for sound dealers.

      For the most part the literature on the role of the network is theoretical, but there are exceptions,

such as Li and Schürho¤ (2014), Holli…eld et al. (2012), Choi and Shachar (2013), Afonso et al.

(2013) and Hendershott et al. (2016).9 Li and Schürho¤ (2014) show that the municipal bond

market has a persistent core-periphery structure, with a trade-o¤ between execution costs (lower

in the periphery) and speed (faster in the core). A similar network structure is uncovered by

Holli…eld et al. (2012) in the securitization market. Choi and Shachar (2013) inquire into the

misalignment between corporate bond and CDS spreads during the …nancial crisis. Afonso et al.

(2013), study the overnight interbank market, …nding that borrowers that have more concentrated

lenders may pay higher rates and that banks get lower interest rates from their most important

lenders.10 Finally, Hendershott et al. (2016) use data on insurers’transactions with corporate bond

dealers to document a trade-o¤ between order ‡ow concentration and dealer competition for best

execution. We complement these existing studies by highlighting the time-varying importance of

the relationships between dealers and the role played by the network in the propagation of shocks

such as Dealer D’s collapse.11

       Further, cooperation and reputation have been shown to a¤ect liquidity costs in exchange

markets by Battalio et al. (2007), who document an increase in liquidity costs in the trading days

surrounding a stock’s relocation to the ‡oor of the exchange, while Pagano and Röell (1992) and

Benveniste et al. (1992) demonstrate that reputation attenuate the repercussions of information

asymmetries in trading and liquidity provision.12 We complement this strand of the literature with

our evidence that existing relationships are at least as important as bargaining power in explaining

dealers’behavior.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the data sources and

summary statistics and Section 3 develops, in relation to the theoretical literature, the empirical

hypotheses that we test and outlines our empirical strategy. Section 4 demonstrates the clear

core-periphery structure of the corporate bond market, which shapes trading behavior. Section

5 describes the main results on the importance of the trading relationships at times of market

turmoil and presents evidence on how the failure of Dealer D a¤ected its trading partners and how

the shock was propagated. Section 6 examines the changes in dealers’ inventories to test if they

provided liquidity during bad times. Section 7 concludes and the online appendix presents further

robustness checks.

2         Data and Summary Statistics

We collect information on corporate bonds and transactions in them from an enhanced version of

the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE). For each trade the dealer reports: the

date, the terms and the counterparty identi…er. The enhanced TRACE data provided by FINRA

(not publicly available) has several advantages. First, we can observe whether the trade is between

two dealers or with a customer. And we can distinguish buyers and sellers. Thus we can trace the

chains of intermediation; that is, we can see whether a dealer who has gotten a buy order from a

client has then gone to another dealer or another client to acquire the bond demanded. For our

analysis, the most important feature of this proprietary dataset is that we can observe the identity

of the dealers, which allows us not only to construct a panel of dealer-speci…c variables but also

to measure the existing trading relationships between various dealers and Dealer D and study how

Dealer D’s collapse a¤ected trading in the network.

         Table 1 presents the summary statistics. Panel A refers to the bonds and the trades we observe.

Columns (1) and (2) are for the entire dataset, Columns (3) and (4) for our most restrictive sample,

i.e. trades concluded within an hour of their initiation. Finally, Columns (5) and (6) report the

statistics for a less restrictive sample, for which we compute the markup as the di¤erence between

the ask price and the average price at which other dealers have bought the same bond during

the week. We use this broader sample in the appendix to perform robustness checks. Our data

runs from 2005 to 2011, covering more than 56,000 bonds traded and 52 million transactions. Due

to computing limitations, our main analysis and the samples in Columns (3)-(6) relate to a 10%

random sample of the entire TRACE database, reducing the sample from 52 million to about 5

million trades.13 Our principal measure of the spread, which refers to buy and sell transactions

that occur within one hour of each other, further restricts the sample to some 700,000 trades.

         Most of these bonds, about 85 percent of all the bonds, are investment-grade, while 15 percent

are high-yield or unrated. The average issue volume is $21 million (85 percent of the issues are

smaller than $100 million), maturity 10 years and rating BBB+. There is no signi…cant di¤erence

in the distribution of bond characteristics between the full sample and our main sample.

         Panel B reports the statistics on the main variables. These include dealers’ spread, i.e. the
    13
    The random sample consists of trades whose last CUSIP digit is 0. As Table 1 shows, the sample so reduced
looks very similar to the full sample.


                                                      6
di¤erence between the price at which they buy a bond (from another dealer or a client) and

their resale price. The spread averages between 40 and 60 basis points. Our main measure of

network centrality is the eigenvector centrality. This takes account of all direct and indirect trading

partners and is computed by assigning scores to all dealers in the network; connections to more-

connected dealers increase the score more than similar connections to less-connected dealers. In

other words, what counts is not only the number of connections, but with whom they are connected.

However, our qualitative results are robust to alternative measures of centrality, such as the degree

of centrality, between-ness and closeness. We also report statistics on the number of transactions

between core dealers (about 30% of total trades), between peripheral dealers (25%), and between

a core and a peripheral dealer, which account for the remaining 45%.



3         The Empirical Framework

Our paper is informed by recent theoretical work on trading in OTC markets, starting with the

seminal work of Du¢ e et al. (2005) and Du¢ e et al. (2007) on the asset pricing implications of

OTC trading. Our empirical investigation of the dealers’ trading strategy in the OTC corporate

bond market could prove valuable to this literature by showing what types of strategic interaction

are the result of the relationships formed among dealers, and how these relationships a¤ect not

only asset prices but also dealers’response to shocks.

         We develop and test four main hypotheses inspired by recent developments in this strand of the

literature.

Hypothesis I: Bilateral inter-dealer existing relationships signi…cantly a¤ect markups.

         Formally, we estimate the following speci…cation


Spreadi;j;k;t =           1 F raction   Selling to Counterpartyi;j +       2 F raction   Buying f rom Counterpartyi;j

                         + Xi;j;k +     t   +   k   +   i   + "i;j;k;t ;


where Spreadi;j;k;t is the di¤erence between the price at which dealer i sold bond k to counterparty j

at time t and the price at which he had bought it.14 The main independent variables considered are
    14
         We compute the spread in two di¤erent ways. First, we refer only to trades concluded within an hour of their


                                                                     7
the fraction sold by dealer i to dealer j and the fraction of bonds purchased by dealer i from dealer j

in the previous quarter. To make sure we are comparing similar transactions, the vector X includes

as controls the log of trade size, the bond’s rating and the fraction of bond k held in inventory by

seller i, normalized by the volume outstanding, which proxies for the seller’s market share of this

market segment. We also control for week ( t ), CUSIP (              k)   and seller ( i ) …xed e¤ects. To capture

possible industry-level shocks, in the most conservative speci…cation, we also include industry-

month …xed e¤ects. This ensures that our results are not driven by purchases of bonds in some

particular industry, say energy, that is hit by a common shock, say oil price changes. Throughout,

in computing standard errors we take the most conservative approach, double-clustering them at

both CUSIP and week level. This procedure allows for arbitrary correlation across time and across

bonds.15

    If    1   and   2   are negative, this suggests that counterparties bene…t from repeated transactions,

as their stronger ties tend to predict lower markups. This possibility is of special interest in that to

date the theoretical literature has generally adopted a random-matching framework, which ignores

bilateral trading relationships, de facto, by assuming that traders interact only in anonymous spot

transactions. Our results might well motivate new theoretical work to accommodate this important

feature of the data.

    We can also test if the price discrimination proposed in Hypothesis I becomes even more pro-

nounced at times of market turmoil.


Hypothesis II: Dealers exploit their position in the network more forcefully in times of market

         turmoil.


    Formally, we test whether during spike periods of the CBOE Volatility Index, dealers take

greater advantage of their position in the network to trade at better terms than in normal times.16
initiation, meaning that we observe both the purchase and the sale by the same dealer i in the same hour. This
narrows the …eld to transactions in which the spread precisely measures the dealer markup. However, the bonds in
these transactions could have special characteristics, such as a particularly high degree of liquidity. To address this
concern, in robustness checks (in the appendix) we also consider transactions in which the dealer sells directly from
his inventory, where we do not necessarily observe the previous purchase price. We overcome this limitation by using
the average price of the bond bought by other dealers in the same week, as a proxy of its actual value. The two
measures yield similar results.
  15
     Single clustering on either of these two dimensions produces smaller standard errors (results available from the
authors).
  16
     We also …nd very similar results using the MOVE index.



                                                          8
If con…rmed, this hypothesis would relate to Carlin et al. (2007), who describes an equilibrium in

which traders cooperate most of the time through repeated interactions, providing liquidity to one

another. However, cooperation breaks down when the stakes are high, leading to predatory trading

and episodic illiquidity.

   We can also test whether dealers actually performed their expected role of liquidity providers

during the crisis. Theoretically, Weill (2007) has examined the conditions under which dealers might

provide liquidity by "leaning against the wind", i.e. accumulating bond inventories in bad times. It

is still being debated whether dealers coped successfully with the increased selling pressure at the

height of the crisis, because as Mitchell and Pulvino (2012) documents, the deleveraging of other

institutions, such as highly leveraged hedge funds, after the Lehman Brothers default signi…cantly

increased the demand for liquidity in the corporate bond market. And adverse shocks may well

induce dealers too to unload their bond positions in periods of distress. This suggests the following

hypothesis:


Hypothesis III: During …nancial disruptions, market-makers provide liquidity by absorbing ex-

      ternal selling pressure.


   To test this hypothesis, we use transaction data to construct a measure that captures dealers’

inventory, sorting bonds into three bins depending on the intensity of clients’ selling pressure,

de…ned as the amount sold by clients to dealers normalized by the amount outstanding; we then

estimate the following speci…cation:


           Inventoryi;t =         1 T op   T ercile   P ost +   2 M id   T ercile         P ost + P ost +

                                 T op T ercile + M id T ercile +     i   +   t   + "i;t


   where we have three observations for dealer i’s inventory in each week, one for each tercile. We

interact our main independent variable with P ost, a dummy equal to 1 after the collapse of Dealer

D, and the omitted category is the identi…er for the bonds in the lowest tercile of selling pressure

(de…ned as the amount sold by clients to dealers normalized by the amount outstanding). To be

sure that the inventory variations captured are due to the intensi…ed demand for liquidity and not

to some general trend, we estimate this speci…cation in a narrow window around Dealer D’s default


                                                       9
and only for investment-grade bonds. If            1   and    2   are negative, this strongly suggests that dealers

ran down their inventories especially for the bonds that their clients were selling most intensely, by

reselling them immediately. In other words, dealers’unwinding of corporate bond positions might

have exerted heavy selling pressure precisely during the period when many market participants

were selling and demanding liquidity.17

         Finally, the data also allows us to trace the trades that involve several layers of intermediation.

Glode and Opp (2016) argue that given asymmetric information, trading an asset through several

heterogeneously informed intermediaries can reduce adverse selection between counterparties and

so preserve the trade e¢ ciency.18 This result suggests the following testable hypothesis:


Hypothesis IV: The length of the trading chain increases with adverse selection in the market.


         We can test this hypothesis by examining the length of the trading chain during periods of

market turmoil, when adverse selection should be more pronounced, for instance, by comparing

lengths before and after the collapse of Dealer D.



4         The Trading Network of in the Corporate Bond Market

Before testing our main hypotheses, let us analyze the type of network that came into being in the

corporate bond market and its persistency. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of all trades

as a function of the seller’s centrality measure. The top 50 dealers account for some 80 percent of

all transactions, suggesting a de…nite core-periphery structure in the interdealer market. This is

con…rmed by Figure 2, which plots the intermediation network using transaction data: each red

circle represents a dealer, the center of the network is occupied by clients, and the links connecting

participants are more intense as the volume of the transactions increases. The network consists of

a few top dealers at the core, carrying out a high volume of trades among themselves and with

clients, and a larger number of peripheral dealers making fewer trades.19
    17
      If dealers do not lean against the wind but instead sell during periods of market turmoil, bond prices will drop
signi…cantly. This is one possible reason for the large negative basis of non-AAA bonds during the …nancial crisis.
   18
      The recent literature has also suggested a few other reasons for the emergence of intermediation chains: Afonso
and Lagos (2015) focuses on heterogeneity of banks’reserves, Atkeson et al. (2015) considers the banks’exposure to
aggregate default risk, and Hugonnier et al. (2014) and Shen et al. (2015) show how search costs and heterogeneous
asset valuations might lead traders with intermediate valuation to act as intermediaries.
   19
      In unreported results, we …nd that this structure is also highly persistent, with the probability of switching from
the core to the periphery, or viceversa, being negligible.


                                                             10
    Accordingly, we begin by di¤erentiating three types of market participants: core dealers, pe-

ripheral dealers and clients. The …rst question is whether core dealers are able to charge other

participants higher prices for the assets they sell.20 Columns (1)-(5) of Table 2 (Panel A) consider

the entire sample of transactions, where the relevant coe¢ cient is that of the indicator variable

"Client Buyer". Column (1), controlling only for week …xed e¤ects in order to absorb changes in

the average cost of intermediation, shows that on average dealers charge clients 50 basis points

more than they charge other dealers. In Columns (2) and (3) we control for transaction volume,

rating, dealer’s market share and the bond …xed e¤ect (CUSIP); the results are similar. In Column

(4) we also include seller …xed e¤ects, and the results remain una¤ected. Finally, in Column (5)

we saturate the model with industry-month …xed e¤ects, so that we exploit variation only for the

bonds in the same industry traded in the same month; again, the results are una¤ected. In Column

(6) we restrict the sample to investment-grade bonds and in column (7) to non-investment-grade.

The data show that dealers charge similar prices for the two grades. Columns (8) and (9), instead,

show that both core and peripheral dealers charge their clients about 50 basis points more than

they do other dealers, even controlling for week and bond …xed e¤ects. That is, clients’transaction

costs appear to be about the same regardless of whether their counterparty is a core or a peripheral

dealer. Panel B shows the same regression estimates, but now the markup is related to transaction

size; we …nd that markups decline with the size of the trade, suggesting that for small trades the

client does not search for the best deal, while for larger transactions there is more competition

among dealers, resulting in reductions in the spread of as much as 60 basis points.

    So far we have compared transactions among dealers with those between dealers and clients.

However, Figures 3 and 4 show that even among interdealer transactions there is signi…cant hetero-

geneity. The trades with the lowest spreads are those between core dealers and peripheral-to-core

dealer transactions; core-peripheral dealer and core-client transactions show signi…cantly higher

spreads, and these increase signi…cantly during the crisis that began in the …rst quarter of 2008. So

we explore these …ndings further by analyzing interdealer transactions in Table 3. The comparison

group is inter-core-dealer transactions, i.e. trades in which both seller and buyer have a network
  20
     Theoretical support for this hypothesis is provided by Babus and Kondor (2013), and Farboodi (2014). Babus
and Kondor (2013) shows that more central dealers can learn faster from the prices of the transactions they execute,
increasing their trading gains. Similarly, in the context of an endogenous network formation model, Farboodi (2014)
shows that core dealers charge higher average prices to the peripheral dealers than to other core ones.



                                                        11
centrality measure in the top 30.21 Column (1) shows a clear ranking among di¤erent types of trades

as far as the spread is concerned. Speci…cally, core-core transactions are the cheapest, periphery-

core trades are slightly more costly, periphery-periphery are about 20 basis points more expensive

than core-core, and core-periphery transactions are the most expensive by almost 30 bp. Columns

(2)-(4) show that these results remain both statistically and economically signi…cant even when we

include controls. Columns (5) and (6) show that core dealers charge the peripheral dealers about

10 basis points more for non-investment-grade than for investment grade bond trades. However,

there is no signi…cant di¤erence by bond rating when peripheral sellers are dealing with core buyers.

It would thus appear that the core dealers can indeed pro…t more from riskier investments when

they transact with marginal dealers than with other core dealers. Transactions between peripheral

dealers show a similar pattern, with non-investment-grade bond trades exhibiting higher margins.

These results are consistent with the …ndings of Green et al. (2007a), Green (2007), and Li and

Schürho¤ (2014) for other o¤-exchange markets.

         In short, these results establish a very signi…cant relationship between a dealer’s position in the

network and the pro…ts captured in trades with clients or other dealers. Of course, our measure of

network centrality could be proxying for the dealer’s bargaining power, one of the main parameters

common to the theoretical literature on OTC trading. However, we can now show that the prior

bilateral relationships among dealers, which are usually left unmodelled, are at least as important

as bargaining power in predicting spreads.



5         The Main Results

Let us start by analyzing how existing bilateral trading relationships among dealers a¤ect spreads,

especially in times of market turmoil. We then investigate how the network reacts when a core

dealer defaults.


5.1         Trading Relationships

To this point we have considered only position in the network, core versus periphery, as a fac-

tor potentially a¤ecting pro…t margins. We now turn to a more in-depth analysis of the role of
    21
         The results are qualitatively the same if the sample is narrowed to the top 20 or broadened to the top 40 dealers.



                                                              12
prior bilateral relationships in the OTC corporate bond market. We compute the fraction of sales

that seller s had with buyer b in the previous quarter, normalized by the s’s total sales (Fraction

Saless;b /Total Saless ), which we label "Fraction Selling to Counterparty". We also compute the

fraction of trades in which buyer b bought bonds from seller s, normalized by b’s total purchases in

the previous quarter (Fraction Purchasess;b /Total Purchasesb ), designated "Fraction Buying from

Counterparty".

   Table 4 reports the estimation results from our formal test of Hypothesis I. Column (1) shows the

e¤ect of “Fraction Selling to Counterparty” and “Fraction buying from Counterparty” on seller’s

spread controlling for week …xed e¤ects, the volume of the trade, market share and the bond’s

rating. On average a higher fraction of past sales to the buyer predicts signi…cantly lower pro…t

margins. Similarly, a higher fraction of purchases by the buyer from the same seller, compared

to his total purchases, predicts signi…cantly lower pro…t margins. The data also con…rms that in

general higher transaction volume corresponds to lower pro…t margins and lower-rated bonds are

associated with higher pro…t margins.

   Column (2) con…rms these results by controlling for the bond …xed e¤ects. The coe¢ cient is

quite similar and both economically and statistically signi…cant. In other words, comparing the

same bond traded between two di¤erent pairs of counterparties in the same week, those with the

stronger past tie have lower spreads. Column (3) adds industry-month …xed e¤ects, to make sure

that the result is not driven by unobserved heterogeneity in the type of bonds traded by some

counterparties and not others. The results are economically signi…cant. There is a di¤erence

in the markup of about 20 basis points between the bottom and the top decile of relationship

strength. The results hold even in our most conservative speci…cation, where we control for seller-

and buyer-month …xed e¤ects, which neutralize any time-varying shocks at dealer level that could

a¤ect trading behavior.

   Thus the results show the importance of the existing relationships between counterparties. Now

Column (4) focuses on the positions of the seller and buyer in the network, controlling for week and

bond …xed e¤ects. In this way we test whether or not the importance of bilateral relationships is

subsumed by relative centrality in the network. We …nd in fact that a more central buyer can get a

lower price from his counterparties than a more peripheral one, while the results for the seller are

weaker, both statistically and economically. Let us emphasize that although this shows that dealer

                                                13
centrality is important in explaining markups (central sellers buy at lower prices), it also shows

that network centrality does not explain the importance of prior bilateral relationships away.

    Finally, Columns (5) and (6) demonstrate that the importance of existing bilateral relationships

remains even including seller- and buyer-month …xed e¤ects, thus controlling for time-varying

heterogeneity at dealer level. Overall, there is evidence that existing trading relationships play a

major role in shaping trading behavior, at least as important as the dealer’s degree of network

centrality.


5.2       Dealer Network and Trading Relationships in Times of Market Turmoil

Now we are in a position to address one of our main questions: When are these prior relationships

most valuable? And do dealers demand higher spreads during periods of high uncertainty, especially

from the counterparties that are most dependent on them? In answering we exploit the time series

dimension of our data to test Hypothesis II. Speci…cally, our dataset covers the …nancial crisis, so

we can investigate dealers’trading behavior as a function of their existing relationships during the

crisis.

    Table 5 shows the results. We take two di¤erent approaches. First we interact our measures

of prior trading relationships and of network centrality with the volatility index (VIX). Second,

we split the sample into three periods to capture the di¤erent phases of the crisis. We begin, in

Columns (1)-(2), by interacting the intensity of the relationship between seller and buyer with the

volatility index controlling for week and bond …xed e¤ects. Interestingly, if the two parties have a

strong tie the incidence of the trading relationship on the spreads becomes even more pronounced

in periods of intense uncertainty. It is particularly important to hold the bond constant, because

changes in the spreads could be due to a change in the composition of the bonds traded at the peak

of the crisis, as dealers might well be reducing inventories by getting rid of their riskier holdings.

Speci…cally, comparing the same bond, traded in the same week among di¤erent counterparties, we

…nd that dealers who had previously done a signi…cant fraction of their corporate bond business

with the same counterparties were able to strike a better deal, and that pro…t margins were lower in

correspondence with spikes in market uncertainty. In terms of magnitude, a one-standard-deviation

increase in the VIX reduces margins by 35 basis points. At the worst of the crisis, the VIX increased

by about three standard deviations, which makes these results economically signi…cant indeed. The

                                                 14
results are very similar when we control for industry-month …xed e¤ects. That is, in times of market

distress dealers tended to be liquidity providers for their closest counterparties.

   Did dealers also serve as liquidity providers for market participants in general? Columns (4)-

(6) address this issue by testing whether the degree of network centrality becomes more important

during periods of market turmoil. Interacting our centrality measure for buyer and seller with the

volatility index, we …nd that more central sellers pro…t even more from their position during periods

of stress, and central buyers too have greater bargaining power, concluding transactions at lower

prices. This means that a core dealer can capture even higher rents by trading with peripheral

dealers in bad times, but peripheral dealers cannot do the same when selling to a core dealer. Thus

the gap between core and peripheral dealers is accentuated in crisis periods, as only the former

can take advantage of their position. This supports the thesis that in bad times dealers provide

liquidity selectively to their closest counterparties only, while exploiting their centrality with other

market participants.

   As a complementary strategy, in Panel B of Table 5 we split the sample into three sub-periods,

January 2005-December 2006, January 2007-August 2008, and September 2008-July 2009. The

…rst period represents normal times, the second the run-up to the …nancial crisis, and the third the

crisis peak after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Comparing the results in the three columns, we

see that relative to other traders central sellers and buyers capture a signi…cantly larger fraction

of the trading pro…ts during the crisis than in normal times, even controlling for week and bond

…xed e¤ects. The di¤erence is signi…cant statistically as well as economically: sellers charge six

times more during the crisis than during the run-up, and buyers get discounts four times larger.

Speci…cally, buyers in the top decile of centrality purchase at spreads 50 basis points narrower than

those charged to buyers in the bottom decile, while the markups of the most central sellers are 40

bp higher.

   The comparison further con…rms that the role of existing relationships was even more important

than in normal times. At the height of the crisis, the presence of a repeated seller or buyer rela-

tionship with a given counterparty led to lower margins than in normal times. Unlike the centrality

measure, whose coe¢ cient increases monotonically as the market turmoil intensi…es, the bilateral

relationships have the same impact on spread in Columns (1) and (2): their importance only in-

creases signi…cantly at the peak of the crisis (Column 3). The economic e¤ect too is important:

                                                  15
the gap between the markups of dealers in the top and in the bottom decile of our measure of

relationship is about 40 bp between the pre-crisis and crisis period. Thus, this analysis con…rms

the time-varying role of bilateral relationships in turbulent times and their importance, on a par

with the network centrality.

       Figure 3 suggests that all spreads increase signi…cantly around the Lehman Brothers’collapse,

but with considerable heterogeneity across transactions among the di¤erent types of market par-

ticipant. This heterogeneity could be due to a variety of factors, such as a change in the pool

of bonds traded by di¤erent counterparties, or shocks to speci…c dealers. We address this issue

formally in Table 6, splitting the transactions between dealer types as in Table 3 and interacting

the main indicator variables with the VIX (Columns (1)-(4)). We also split the sample into our

three periods (Columns (5)-(7)). Interestingly, core dealers are able to extract even higher rents

from peripheral dealers in periods of high volatility, but peripheral dealers are not able to do the

same when selling to core dealers; and transactions at the periphery tend to exhibit higher pro…t

margins in turbulent times. Comparing Column (3) with Column (4), we can see that core dealers

pro…t even more at times of greater uncertainty in trading with peripheral dealers when the bond

is non-investment-grade. The results are robust to controls for trade characteristics interacted with

the VIX, as well as week-, bond- and industry-month …xed e¤ects. When transactions are compared

over time (Columns (5)-(7)) the results are very similar, with core dealers pro…ting about three

times more from peripheral dealers at the peak of the crisis.

       These results highlight the main …nding of this section: existing relationships are good predictors

of pro…t margins, and they become even more important under market turmoil. This contrasts with

the theoretical literature on OTC markets, which generally – with the exceptions of Seppi (1990)

and Glode and Opp (2016) –posits that interactions between buyers and sellers are anonymous and

price dispersion is not a¤ected by the parties’transaction history.22 A further original feature of

our study is the discovery that the importance of existing relationships is time-varying. In addition,

relationship-based trading behavior bene…ts core at the expense of peripheral dealers.
  22
   The models proposed by Seppi (1990) and Glode and Opp (2016) highlight how the identity of the counterparty
might signi…cantly shape the trading process.

5.3   Default of a Core Dealer

Having established that prior trading relationships and network centrality shape dealers’rent shares

and liquidity provision, and that their importance is heightened in crisis, we now investigate the

impact on a dealer’s behavior of losing a major trading partner. The question, that is, is whether

these relationships are easily substitutable. If there are no frictions – i.e. if dealers can readily

locate new counterparties and new relationships can be easily formed –losing a tie with a speci…c

dealer should not a¤ect pro…tability or transaction costs. We test this hypothesis formally using

the information on dealer identities contained in our regulatory data. In particular, we want to see

how the network reacts to the shock of Dealer D’s default and how this a¤ected the dealers who

had prior relationships with Dealer D.

   Table 7 reports the regressions that relate the strength of the relationship with Dealer D with

other dealers’ pro…t margins after the collapse. For each dealer we compute the fraction of all

bonds sold to Dealer D as the average for the year 2007. This is to make sure we capture a stable

relationship with Dealer D, rather than deleveraging on the eve of the bankruptcy. We consider the

fractions of securities both bought from and sold to Dealer D, but in fact the two are very closely

correlated. Formally, we estimate the following regressions:


              Spreadi;j;k;t =    1 F raction    of P urchase T ransactionsi;D     P ost +

                                 2 F raction    of P urchase T ransactionsi;D +

                                 Xi;j;k +   t   + "i;j;k;t


   where i and j denote the two counterparties, k indexes the bond and t the week. "Frac-

tion of Purchase Transactionsi;D " proxies the intensity of the relationship between dealer i and

Dealer D in the pre-period. "P ost" is a dummy equal to 1 in the period after the default. We

include several controls in the vector Xi;j;k to capture heterogeneity across dealers and bonds, and

all speci…cations include week …xed e¤ects. The relevant coe¢ cient is   1   on the interaction between

the intensity of the pre-default trading relationship with Dealer D and the indicator for the post-

default period. Column (1), controlling for week and CUSIP …xed e¤ects, shows that the dealers

that were buying the most from Dealer D su¤ered a signi…cant decline in pro…t margins. The e¤ect



                                                     17
is both statistically and economically signi…cant: a one-standard-deviation increase in the fraction

of assets bought from Dealer D narrows the spread by an average of 14 basis points.

         This result is robust to the inclusion of trade characteristics (volume and bond rating) and

of our measure of the strength of the relationship (Column 2). Columns (3) and (4) further test

the sensitivity of the result by including in turn the seller and the buyer …xed e¤ects to control

for possible unobserved heterogeneity across dealers more or less closely connected to Dealer D.

Column (5) is our most restrictive speci…cation, controlling also for seller- and buyer-month …xed

e¤ects. This means that comparing transactions in the same period, in the same bond, and by

similar dealers, the dealers who were relying more heavily on Dealer D su¤ered the most with its

collapse.

         Columns (6)-(10) complement these results by studying how the dealers who were selling more

of their assets to Dealer D responded. As before, the main coe¢ cient is the interaction between

the dummy Post (equal to 1 after the default), and the average fraction of assets sold to Dealer

D in 2007. As above, we …nd that dealers more exposed to Dealer D experienced a signi…cant

reduction in pro…t margins after the default. However, statistical signi…cance is reduced: it is

signi…cant at the 10% level only when seller- and buyer-month …xed e¤ects are included, in Column

(10). Presumably this is because the fractions of sale and purchase transactions are very closely

correlated.



6         Dealers’Inventories in Bad Times

As is discussed in section 3, theoretical work considers whether and how dealers may be able to "lean

against the wind" by expanding inventories at times of distress (see, for instance, Weill (2007)).

We test Hypothesis III by addressing the following question: Were the dealers able to absorb the

selling pressure of other market participants? We can employ transaction data to compute dealers’

inventory around the collapse of Dealer D.23 One problem with calculating inventories from trade

data is that we do not observe the primary market, so our measure necessarily excludes newly issued

bonds. To avoid bias in our computation, we use a very narrow time window around the failure

and exclude both new issues and those maturing within that time. Moreover, the primary market
    23
   To make sure our results are not driven by smaller broker-dealers, we focus on the top 100 by transaction volume.
We also ran the same analysis with the top 30 only, with highly similar results.


                                                        18
was signi…cantly less active during our period than ordinarily, so our measure can be considered a

good proxy for the dealers’actual inventory in this brief period.

   We start by plotting, in Figure 5, the dealers’inventory of bonds characterized by di¤erential

selling pressure, de…ned as the volume sold by clients to dealers normalized by the amount out-

standing. The idea is that if the dealers are providing liquidity by ful…lling sell orders without

immediately unloading the bonds in order to avoid further price declines, then we should observe

an expansion of inventories of the bonds subject to the most intense selling pressure. Instead, we

…nd that around the peak of the crisis dealers reduced their inventories most sharply precisely for

these bonds.

   Table 8 formally tests and quanti…es this hypothesis, dividing bonds into terciles of selling

pressure. The regressions are normalized by dividing the inventory for each dealer for each tercile

by the standard deviation of inventory for that dealer and tercile. Columns (1) and (2) are for a

three-month window around the failure of Dealer D, while Column (3) restricts the sample to a

four-week window. The …rst two columns show that dealers reduced their inventory of bonds in the

top two terciles of selling pressure signi…cantly, by 25%-30% of 1 standard deviation. The result

holds also for the shorter window in Column (3), which shows a reduction of 20% of 1 standard

deviation for the bonds in the top tercile. These results strongly suggest that in the midst of the

market turmoil dealers did not readily provide liquidity to clients. We can now seek to determine

whether their behavior also increased transaction costs. One possible source of such an increase is

a lengthening of the intermediation chain owing to dealers’inability to increase their inventories.

   The prevalence of transactions among intermediaries along intermediation chains has been re-

cently highlighted by Li and Schürho¤ (2014) for the municipal bond market, Holli…eld et al. (2012)

for securitized products and Weller (2014) for metals futures. However, there is no study of the

way in which these intermediation chains respond to shocks. Speci…cally, one possible reason why

spreads might have widened following the default of Dealer D could be the lengthening of the

chains, as in Hypothesis IV. To test this hypothesis, Figure 6 plots the estimated week …xed e¤ects

for a regression whose dependent variable is trading chain length. After the failure of Dealer D,

intermediation chains between seller and buyer lengthened signi…cantly. This suggests that with

the disappearance of a major counterparty, dealers had to form new trading relationships, and as

Table 7 has shown these were signi…cantly less pro…table than their predecessors. We can also

                                                19
con…rm this result in Table 9 by estimating a regression of chain length over the Post indicator

(equal to 1 after the bankruptcy). Even controlling for bond- and industry-month …xed e¤ects and

other trade characteristics, we …nd that on average the intermediation chain becomes signi…cantly

longer, and the e¤ect appears to be more pronounced when the seller is core rather than peripheral.

   This increase in the intermediation length matters because it might increase the overall inter-

mediation cost. Table 10 shows how the spread is allocated among intermediaries along the chain;

we …nd that being closer to the client yields higher pro…ts. Moreover, since the average spread is

about 60 bps, and the intermediaries other than the one closest to the client charge about 20-30

bps less than the average spread, we have that intermediation costs increases with the length of

the chain.

   Is there a relationship between the change in length documented in Table 9 and the change

in dealers’ inventory? On this question, Figure 7 plots our measure of inventory for bonds that

underwent changes in average intermediation chain length above and below the median. By this

measure, inventory shrinks most markedly for the bonds whose chains lengthened, suggesting that

dealers were not providing liquidity, because they were diminishing their inventories, making it

harder to accommodate clients’order requests and thus requiring a longer intermediation chain.

   Formally, Table 11 reports the results of the following regression:


         Inventoryi;j;t =     1 Above       M ediani;D    P ost +   2 Above   M ediani;D + P ost +

                              i   +   t   + "i;j;t


   where i is the dealer, j is the bond and t is the week. Above M ediani;D equals one for the

bonds whose intermediation chain lengthened by more than the median. P ost equals one after the

Dealer D’s default. We control for dealers’( i ) and time …xed e¤ects ( t ). Since we cannot observe

the issuance of new bonds, our measure of inventory excludes them. Given the especially turbulent

period covered, however, we are convinced that this does not signi…cantly a¤ect our estimates.

However, to alleviate such concerns, in Columns (1) and (2) we take a three-month window around

the default and in Column (3) a more restrictive four-week window. To simplify interpretation, we

normalize our measure of inventory by dividing the inventory for each dealer above and below the

median by the standard deviation in that dealer’s inventory. In the most restrictive speci…cation,


                                                     20
we …nd a reduction of 20% of inventory for the bonds whose intermediation chain lengthened. This

result does not appear to be driven by di¤erences across dealers or by common shocks to the bond

market, as we control for dealer and time …xed e¤ects. The evidence is that intermediation costs

increased because dealers were deleveraging and holding smaller inventories at the peak of the crisis.

    Overall, our results o¤er new insights into dealers’ behavior during one of the most severe

episodes of …nancial market turmoil in recent times. Rather than provide price support by absorbing

the excess supply from other market participants, dealers tried to unload these bonds immediately.

And by reducing inventories they also made the market more illiquid, as the average length of the

intermediation chain increased signi…cantly, which means higher transaction costs for clients.



7    Concluding Remarks

The recent crisis has spotlighted the issue of how governments should handle complex …nancial

institutions that are "too connected to fail". Theoretical contributions have shown how connec-

tions between …nancial institutions, stemming both from correlation in asset holdings and from an

intricate system of cross-liabilities, could potentially trigger a cascade of bank failures. However,

there is little if any evidence on the role played by existing bilateral relationships among …nancial

institutions.

    This paper focuses on a crucial over-the-counter market, that in corporate bonds, inquiring

into the way in which the network of relationships between dealers shapes trading behavior and

liquidity provision both in normal times and in periods of turmoil. We start by showing the clear

core-periphery structure of the market, in which a few highly interconnected dealers intermediate

most of the trades with other dealers and with clients and many sparsely connected ones trade

less frequently. This structure is highly stable over time. Next we show that the dealers’bilateral

relationships and their degree of network centrality are quite reliable predictors of their transaction

costs, the more central dealers taking advantage of their connections to get better deals. More

important, during periods of distress dealers tend to provide liquidity to the counterparties with

whom they have the strongest ties. But core dealers exploit their connections at the expense of

peripheral dealers and of clients, increasing the spreads they charge to them. In the same vein, the

value of being highly connected and systemically important increases when uncertainty is high.


                                                  21
   In contrast to most of the empirical studies of the corporate bond market, we are able to learn

the identity of each dealer, and so to see how the network responded to a large shock such as the

failure of Dealer D. We …nd that Dealer D’s main counterparties had to narrow their spreads after

September 2008, by comparison with other, similar dealers trading the same bonds in the same

period.

   To conclude, our results shed new light on the way in which prior bilateral relationships between

…nancial institutions sometimes serve as a bu¤er in times of stress, but also reveal that they

heighten the fragility of the system, insofar as connection to more fragile dealers may worsen

trading outcomes even for healthy dealers.

The table reports descriptive statistics for the main variables employed in our analysis. In the Panel A, we present the main bond characteristics: the number of bonds and the number of trade,
the bonds' credit quality, issue size and maturity, as provided by a confidential version of TRACE for the period 2005-2011. The first two columns report the statistics for the full data sample.
Due to computing limitations, we focus on a random 10% sample (the draw is based on the last digit of the CUSIP being equal to zero). The remaining columns report the summary statistics for
the main estimation sample which restricts attention to buy and sell transactions observed within an hour from each other, and for the sample used in the robustness checks in the appendix.
Panel B provides summary statistics for these characteristics and for the transactions, such as the bilateral relationships, the profit margins and the seller's centrality measure for the main results.

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spread (difference between sell and buy price) with the type of counterparty. The sample includes bond transactions for the period 2005-2011 as reported in
an enhanced version of TRACE. "Client Buyer" is a dummy equal to one if the buyer is a client. "Log(Transaction Volume)" is the size of the transaction. "Rating" captures the numerical equivalent of the bond
rating, with higher number capturing riskier bonds. "Market Share" is the fraction of bond i held in inventory by seller s in the previous quarter normalized by the bond outstanding. Columns (6) and (7) divide
the sample between investment grade and non-investment grade bonds, whereas Columns (8) and (9) differentiate between sellers in the core or in the periphery. Column (5) shows the most conservative
specification in which we control for week, bond, seller and industry×month fixed effects. Panel B reports the results for different samples based on the size of the transaction. Robust standard errors double
clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spreads with the type of counterparty. The sample includes bond transactions for the period 2005-
2011 as reported in an enhanced version of TRACE. "Core-Periphery" is a dummy equal to one if the seller is a core dealer and the buyer is a peripheral
dealer, while "Periphery-Periphery" identifies transactions between dealers in the periphery, and "Periphery-Core" is a dummy equal to one for transactions
where the seller is in the periphery and the buyer is in the core. The comparison group are interdealer transactions between core dealers. "Log(Transaction
Volume)" is the size of the transaction. "Rating" captures the numerical equivalent of the bond rating, with higher number capturing riskier bonds. "Market
Share" is the fraction of bond i held in inventory by seller s in the previous quarter normalized by the bond outstanding. Column (4) shows the most
conservative specification in which we control for week, bond, and industry×month fixed effects. Columns (5) and (6) divide the sample between investment
grade and non-investment grade bonds. Robust standard errors double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in parenthesis. Asterisks
denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spread with the existing of bilateral relationships between seller and buyer and to their network centrality.
The sample includes bond transactions for the period 2005-2011 as reported in an enhanced version of TRACE. "Fraction Selling to Counterparty" is the fraction
of sales of this seller to this buyer computed in the previous quarter. Similarly for the "Fraction Buying from Counterparty". VIX is the volatility index as provided
by CBOE. We also control for the bond rating, the market share and the log of the transaction size interacted with the VIX. The centrality measures are computed
using the eigenvector centrality measure in the previous quarter. Panel B reports the coefficient estimates relating the spread with the existing of bilateral
relationships between seller and buyer and to their network centrality for three time periods: January 2005-December 2006 (Column 1), January 2007-August 2008
(Column 2) and September 2008-July 2009 (Column 3). Robust standard errors double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in
parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spreads with the type of counterparty. The sample in Columns (1)-(4) includes bond transactions for the period 2005-2011 as reported
in an enhanced version of TRACE. "Core-Periphery" is a dummy equal to one if the seller is a core dealer and the buyer is a peripheral dealer, while "Periphery-Periphery" identifies
transactions between dealers in the periphery, and "Periphery-Core" is a dummy equal to one for transactions where the seller is in the periphery and the buyer is in the core. The
comparison group are interdealer transactions between core dealers. VIX is the volatility index as provided by CBOE. We also control for the the log of the transaction size, the bond rating
and the market share interacted with the VIX. Columns (5)-(7) reports the coefficient estimates relating the spread with the type of counterparty for three distinct time periods: January 2005-
December 2006 (Column 5), January 2007-August 2008 (Column 6) and September 2008-July 2009 (Column 7). Robust standard errors double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week
level are reported in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spread with the existing of bilateral relationships between seller and Dealer D. The sample period is the third and fourth quarter of 2008. "Fraction of Purchase Transactions with Dealer
D" is the fraction of bonds purchased by seller i from Dealer D averaged over 2007. "Post" is a dummy equal to one after the Dealer D' default. We control for the log of the size of the transaction, the bond rating, and the fraction of bond i
held in inventory by seller s in the previous quarter normalized by the bond outstanding. All columns include both week and bond fixed effects. Seller and buyer fixed effects are sequentially included in Columns (3) and (4). Columns (5) is the
most conservative specification which includes seller×month and buyer×month fixed effects. "Fraction of Sale Transactions with Dealer D" is the fraction of sales of this seller to this buyer in 2007 and its interaction with Post is included in
columns (6)-(10). Robust standard errors double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

This table investigates how the dealers' inventory changes around the collapse of Dealer D for bonds that
experience different degree of selling pressure by the clients, which is defined as the amount sold by
clients to dealers normalized by the amount outstanding. The sample period in Columns (1) and (2) is a
three-month window aroung Dealer D's collapse, while in Column (3) it is a one-month before and after
this event. The dependent variable is the dealer's inventory normalized by the standard deviation of the
inventory for each dealer. "Post" is a dummy equal to one after the Dealer D' default. "Top Tercile
Selling Pressure" is a dummy variable equal to one for the bonds that experience the highest selling
pressure by the clients. "Middle Tercile Selling Pressure" is a dummy variable equal to one for the bonds
that experience an intermediate selling pressure by the clients.The omitted category is the indicator for
the bonds in the bottom tercile. All specifications include dealer and week fixed effects. Robust standard
errors clustered at the dealer level in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%,

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the lenght of the trading chain with Dealer D's default. The
sample period is the third and fourth quarter of 2008. "Post" is a dummy equal to one after the Dealer D'
default. "Log(Transaction Volume)" is the size of the transaction. "Rating" captures the numerical equivalent of
the bond rating, with higher number capturing riskier bonds. "Market Share" is the fraction of bond i held in
inventory by seller s in the previous quarter normalized by the bond outstanding. All columns include both bond
and week fixed effects. Column (2) includes also industry×month fixed effects. Column (3) focus on
transactions where the seller is in the core (top 30 dealers), while Column (4) focus on transactions where the
seller is in the periphery. Robust standard errors double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are
reported in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

                                                  Spreads over Trading Chains

This table investigates how the spread charged over the intermediation chain depending on the position of the dealer in the chain. The
first position is always captured by the buyer, who is the client. The benchmark is then the spread charged by the intermediary in the
second position. The sample period is the third and fourth quarter of 2008. Transaction controls include the size of the transaction, as
well as the numerical equivalent of the bond rating, the market share and the type of transaction, i.e. if it is a core-core, core-periphery
or periphery-core transaction. Robust standard errors double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in
parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

                       Dealers' Inventory and Change in Trading Chains


This table investigates how the dealers' inventory changes around the collapse of Dealer D for bonds for
which the change in trading chain is above or below the median change. The sample period in Columns (1)
and (2) is a three-month window aroung Dealer D's collapse, while in Column (3) it is a one-month before
and after this event. The dependent variable is the dealer's inventory normalized by the standard deviation of
the inventory for each dealer. "Post" is a dummy equal to one after the Dealer D' default. All specifications
include dealer and week fixed effects. Robust standard errors clustered at the dealer level in parenthesis.
Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

The table reports additional descriptive statistics for the main variables employed in our analysis. In the Panel A, we present the main bond characteristics: the
bonds' credit quality, issue size, age and maturity, as provided by a confidential version of TRACE for the period 2005-2011 for the three different samples.
The first set report the statistics for the full data sample. The remaining two sets of rows report the summary statistics for the main estimation sample which
restricts attention to buy and sell transactions observed within an hour from each other, and for the sample used in the robustness checks in the appendix.
Panel B provides summary statistics for these characteristics and for the transactions, such as the profit margins, the volume, the holding period and the seller's
centrality measure.

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spread (defined as the difference between sell and average buy price by other dealers in the same week for the same bond) with the type of buyer. The
sample includes bond transactions for the period 2005-2011 as reported in an enhanced version of TRACE. "Client Buyer" is a dummy equal to one if the buyer is a client. "Log(Transaction Volume)" is
the size of the transaction. "Rating" captures the numerical equivalent of the bond rating, with higher number capturing riskier bonds. "Market Share" is the fraction of bond i held in inventory by seller s in
the previous quarter normalized by the bond outstanding. Columns (6) and (7) divide the sample between investment grade and non-investment grade bonds, whereas Columns (8) and (9) differentiate
between sellers in the core or in the periphery. Column (5) shows the most conservative specification in which we control for week, bond, seller and industry×month fixed effects. Robust standard errors
double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spreads (defined as the difference between sell and average buy price by other dealers in the same week for the same bond) with the type of
counterparty. The sample includes bond transactions for the period 2005-2011 as reported in an enhanced version of TRACE. "Core-Periphery" is a dummy equal to one if the seller is a core dealer and the
buyer is a peripheral dealer, while "Periphery-Periphery" identifies transactions between dealers in the periphery, and "Periphery-Core" is a dummy equal to one for transactions where the seller is in the
periphery and the buyer is in the core. The comparison group are interdealer transactions between core dealers. Controls include: "Log(Transaction Volume)" which is the size of the transaction, "Rating"
which captures the numerical equivalent of the bond rating, and "Market Share" which is the fraction of bond i held in inventory by seller s in the previous quarter normalized by the bond outstanding.
Column (4) shows the most conservative specification in which we control for week, bond, and industry×month fixed effects. Columns (5) and (6) divide the sample between investment grade and non-
investment grade bonds. Columns (7)-(9) perform a similar analysis but controlling for the interaction between the type of transaction (i.e. Core-Periphery, Periphery-Periphery and Periphery-Core) with the
volatility index VIX as provided by CBOE. In these columns we also control for the the log of the transaction size, the bond rating and the market share interacted with the VIX. Robust standard errors
double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

This table reports the coefficient estimates relating the spreads (defined as the difference between sell and average buy price by other dealers in the same week for the same bond) with the existing of bilateral relationships
between seller and buyer and to their network centrality. The sample includes bond transactions for the period 2005-2011 as reported in an enhanced version of TRACE. "Fraction Selling to Counterparty" is the fraction
of sales of this seller to this buyer computed in the previous quarter. Similarly for the "Fraction Buying from Counterparty". "Log(Transaction Volume)" is the size of the transaction. "Rating" captures the numerical
equivalent of the bond rating, with higher number capturing riskier bonds. "Market Share" is the fraction of bond i held in inventory by seller s in the previous quarter normalized by the bond outstanding. The centrality
measures are computed using the eigenvector centrality measure in the previous quarter. VIX is the volatility index as provided by CBOE. We also control for the bond rating, the market share and the log of the
transaction size interacted with the VIX. Robust standard errors double clustered at both the CUSIP and the week level are reported in parenthesis. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).
