The Decline and Rise of Agricultural Productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa Since 1961
Steven Block
NBER Working Paper No. 16481
October 2010
JEL No. O13,O4,Q16

                                              ABSTRACT

Agricultural productivity growth in sub-Saharan Africa has been a qualified success. Total factor
productivity growth has increased rapidly since the early 1980s. By the early 2000s, average annual
TFP growth was roughly four times faster than it had been 25 years earlier. This period of accelerated
growth, however, followed nearly 20 years of declining rates of TFP growth subsequent to independence
in the early 1960s. Average agricultural TFP growth for sub-Saharan Africa was 0.14% per year during
1960 – 84, and increased to 1.24% per year from 1985 – 2002. The average over this period was approximately
0.6% per year, which accounts for 36% of the increase in total crop output over this period. These
highly aggregated results conceal substantial regional and country-level variation. Expenditures on
agricultural R&D, along with the reform of macroeconomic and sectoral policies shaping agricultural
incentives, have played a substantial role in explaining both the decline and the rise in agricultural
productivity. The case study of Ghana clearly reflects these broader findings.

   1. Introduction

       Agricultural productivity is central to the lives of most Africans. Two-thirds of the

population of sub-Saharan Africa is rural, and the FAO counts nearly half of sub-Saharan

Africa's rural population as "economically active" in agriculture. For some countries, such as

Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burkina Faso, the rural population share approaches 85-90%,

with 45-50% the total population counted as economically active in agriculture. Even among the

most urbanized countries of sub-Saharan Africa, such as South Africa, one-third of the

population remains rural. In addition, up to 80% of Africa's poor live in rural areas, nearly all of

whom work primarily in agriculture (World Bank, 2000). For these producer groups,

agricultural productivity is the key determinant of welfare, and agricultural productivity growth

is the key hope for poverty reduction (at least in the short- to medium-term). Non-farm rural

employment, too, is often closely linked to agriculture -- either directly (as in the marketing of

agricultural inputs and outputs), or indirectly (as in the provision of other services in rural

markets). The indirect benefits of agricultural productivity growth, in the form of lower food

prices, are also critical to the welfare of Africa's rapidly expanding urban populations, the

poorest of whom devote 60-70% of total expenditures to food (Sahn, et. al., 1997).


        From a macroeconomic perspective, as well, agriculture continues to play a central role

in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 15% of total value added (20%, excluding South Africa).

Of course, every generalization about sub-Saharan Africa and masks the region’s vast

                                                                                                     2
heterogeneity. In Liberia, for example, agriculture accounts for 66% of total value added, while

in other countries, such as oil-rich Angola, agriculture accounts for only 10% of the value added

(World Bank, 2010).


       African organizations, themselves, highlight these issues. The Comprehensive Africa

Agriculture Development Program of the New Partnership for Africa's Development has stated

that, "High and sustained rates of agricultural growth, largely driven by productivity growth, will

be necessary if African countries are to accelerate poverty reduction. This is because agricultural

growth has powerful leverage effects on the rest of the economy...The poor performance of the

agricultural sector explains much of the slow progress towards reducing poverty and hunger in

Africa." (CAADP, 2006) Current efforts to promote a "new Green Revolution" in Africa face

myriad environmental, institutional, and physical challenges in their quest to promote

agricultural productivity growth in the region.


       This paper provides new estimates of cross-country agricultural productivity growth in

sub-Saharan Africa. The resulting picture is one of qualified success. Total factor productivity

growth in African agriculture has accelerated dramatically since the early 1980s. By the early

2000s, average annual total factor productivity growth in African agriculture was over four times

faster than it had been 25 years earlier. The success is qualified by the finding that much of this

acceleration represents a recovery from the substantial decline in TFP growth rates during the

1960s and early 1970s. In addition, levels of output per hectare and per worker in African

agriculture remain low by global standards. Among a range of potential explanations for

agricultural productivity growth in agriculture, expenditures on agricultural R&D play a

dominant role, followed by policy distortions at both the macroeconomic and sectoral levels.



                                                                                                      3
Improvements in the quality of the labor force, as indicated by average years of schooling, have

also played a central role in driving productivity growth in African agriculture.


       Many of these findings gleaned from cross-country analysis, are also evident in this

paper's more detailed examination of agricultural productivity in Ghana.


       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related studies. Section 3

describes data used in the cross-country analysis, as well as the approach used to aggregate

agricultural output across multiple commodities. Section 4 provides a preliminary perspective

on agricultural productivity trends in the form of partial productivity ratios (output per worker

and per hectare). Sections 5 and 6 describe, respectively, my methodology for estimating total

factor productivity growth and my results. Section 7 explores various explanations for the

productivity results presented in the previous section. Section 8 presents a brief case study of

agricultural productivity in Ghana, while Section 9 concludes.


   2. Related Studies

       Within the broader literature on cross-country agricultural productivity, relatively few

papers have focused specifically on sub-Saharan Africa. Block (1994) was the first to report a

recovery of aggregate agricultural TFP in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s, a result

confirmed by a number of subsequent studies. Block attributed up to two-thirds of this recovery

to investments in agricultural R&D and to macroeconomic policy reform. Frisvold and Ingram

(1995) provide an early growth accounting exercise for land productivity, concluding that most

of it (up to 1985) resulted from increased input use (labor, in particular). Thirtle, Hadley, and

Townsend (1995) highlight the role of policy choices, finding that an index of real agricultural

protection played a significant role in explaining TFP growth in African agriculture for the

                                                                                                    4
period 1971-86. Lusigi and Thirtle (1997) highlight the role of agricultural R&D in explaining

TFP growth in Africa. They also highlight the role of increasing population pressure in driving

increased agricultural productivity in Africa. Chan-Kang, et. al. (1999) focus on the

determinants of labor productivity in a cross-country African setting. They, too, find land per

unit of labor to be an important determinant of labor productivity.


        Fulginiti, Perrin, and Yu (2004) estimate agricultural TFP growth for 41 sub-Saharan

African countries from 1960 to 1999, finding an average TFP growth rate of 0.83% per year, and

confirming the finding from Block (1994) of an acceleration of the agricultural TFP growth since

the mid-1980s. Their analysis concentrates on the role of institutions in explaining this growth.

They conclude that former British colonies experienced greater rates of TFP growth, while

former Portuguese colonies experienced lower rates. They also found negative effects for

political conflicts and wars, and positive effects resulting from political rights and civil liberties.

Three more recent papers conclude this review.


        Nin-Pratt and Yu (2008) reconfirm the acceleration of African agricultural TFP growth

since the mid-1980s. They find, however, a negative average growth rate of agricultural TFP (-

0.15% per year) from 1964 to 2003, casting the recovery period as making up for negative

productivity growth during the 1960s and 70s. Specifically, Nin-Pratt and Yu find that average

TFP growth fell at the rate of -2% per year from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, then grew by

1.7% per year between 1985 and 2003. They, too, highlight the role policy change in explaining

this reversal in performance. In particular, they find that an indicator of reforms associated with

structural adjustment played a positive role. In addition, they find that agricultural productivity

in East and Southern Africa benefited from the end of internal conflicts, and that agriculture in



                                                                                                          5
West Africa benefited from the devaluation of the CFA franc. They also provide suggestive

evidence of the positive effect of investments in agricultural R&D.


       Alene (2010) also focuses on the contributions of R&D expenditures to productivity

growth in African agriculture. In contrast to the average TFP growth rate reported by Nin-Pratt

and Yu (2008), Alene finds an average TFP growth rate of 1.8% per year for the period 1970-

2004 (a difference that he attributes to an improved estimation technique). Alene finds strong

positive effects of lagged R&D expenditure on agricultural productivity growth, arguing that

rapid growth in R&D expenditures during the 1970s helped to explain strong productivity

growth after the mid-1980s, while slower growth of R&D expenditures in the 1980s and early

1990s led to slower productivity growth since 2000. Alene (2010) also notes a 33% annual rate

of return on investments in agricultural R&D in Africa.


       Most recently, Fuglie (2010) examines agricultural productivity growth in sub-Saharan

Africa from 1961 to 2006. His findings are mixed. While he reports an increased rate of growth

in agricultural output during the 1990s and early 2000s, Fuglie finds that most of this growth in

output is explained by expanding crop land rather than improved productivity. Fuglie (2010)

stands out in this literature for his critical assessment of the standard data sources, for which he

proposes various corrections. In contrast to previous studies, Fuglie does not find a general

recovery of agricultural productivity in recent decades. For the period 1961-2006, he reports an

average TFP growth rate of 0.58% per year, with the lowest rate occurring during the 1970s (-

0.18% per year), and the highest rate occurring during the 1990s (1.17% per year).


       Thus, recent estimates of the rate of agricultural TFP growth in Africa differ widely,

though there is a general consensus surrounding a decline in productivity during the first two


                                                                                                       6
decades following independence and a recovery during the past two decades. These studies

applied different methodologies to essentially the same data set, which may explain some of the

conflicting findings cited above. As described below, the methodology applied in the present

study differs from all of the studies cited above.


    3. Data and Output Aggregation

        This study combines data from a variety of sources. The core data on agricultural outputs

and inputs are drawn from the FAO online database. While often regarded as being of limited

quality, these data are ubiquitous in studies of international agricultural productivity, as they are

the only comprehensive and detailed source of cross-country data over a long period of time.

The central challenge in constructing a data set suitable for estimating a cross-country

agricultural production function lies in aggregating the output of multiple agricultural

commodities in a way that is comparable across both time and space. The fact that national-level

data on key agricultural inputs -- land, labor, fertilizer, tractors, and livestock -- are provided as

national totals, and not disaggregated by the crops to which they are applied, requires that

agricultural output also be aggregated to the national level.


        The most comprehensive discussion of agricultural output aggregation for international

comparison is Craig, Pardey, and Roseboom (1991). Drawing on index number theory, they note

that the ideal approach to aggregating multiple commodities for a given country and year would

be to multiply a vector of base-year local commodity prices expressed in dollars by a vector of

quantities of individual commodities. In particular, they specify that the best price weights

would be those most specific to the economic activity and agents in question. Yet, even in the

absence of data constraints, there is no perfect way to implement this ideal. The key dimensions


                                                                                                         7
of the problem, in practice, lie in choosing appropriate deflator's for comparisons over time, and

in choosing appropriate exchange rates for comparisons across countries. Severe constraints on

the availability of commodity-specific price data over time for each country in sub-Saharan

Africa add to these challenges of constructing internationally and inter-temporally comparable

agricultural output aggregates.


        Given the availability of commodity-specific local currency-denominated prices over

time, the standard approach for converting aggregate output in a given year into internationally

comparable units of measure is to select a numeraire currency, and to use Purchasing Power

Parity exchange rates for conversion.1 For its global agricultural data set, the FAO has

calculated "agricultural exchange rates," or agricultural PPPs, that it applies in creating

internationally comparable aggregates of agricultural output. In practice, virtually every study of

international agricultural productivity (whether global or region-specific) simply uses these FAO

data, based on PPP prices calculated from the global data set. In theory, however, as noted

above, the best price weights to use in aggregating output are those that are most specific to the

particular setting of concern.


The present study thus departs from standard practice by calculating a unique set of

international commodity prices and PPP exchange rates specific to African agriculture.


        In order to calculate the Africa-specific international prices and PPP exchange rates used

to construct the data set for this study, I applied the Geary-Khamis method summarized by Rao

(1993). This method requires calculating both a reference set of international commodity prices

based on relevant PPP exchange rates, and calculating the PPP exchange rates based on the

and then converting each year aggregate output versus first converting in any deflating.

                                                                                                                    8
reference set of international commodity prices. This problem is described by a system of two

simultaneous equations. In the first equation, the international reference price for commodity i is

calculated as a function of its local currency price in each country j = 1,…,m converted by the

PPP exchange rate for country j. In the second equation, the PPP exchange rate for country j is

calculated as a function of the quantities and international reference prices for each commodity i

= 1,…,n in country j. This is done for a given base year. These two equations can be solved

iteratively, ultimately converging on a unique set of reference prices and PPP exchange rates for

the specific countries and commodities to be studied. For purposes of this study, I calculated

international prices and PPP exchange rates using prices and quantities for the n = 35

commodities in the m = 27 sub-Saharan African countries for which data were available from the

FAO.2 I then applied these reference prices in aggregating output across these commodities for

the full set of 44 sub-Saharan African countries for which commodity-specific output data were

available. Output data for each commodity are net of quantities used for seed and feed.


         The base year for these reference prices was 2006. I then created a Paasche-type output

index, applying the 2006 prices to aggregate the commodity output data in each country for each

year going back to 1961. The rationale for applying the Paasche approach was that the range

and, in particular, the quality of the price data has tended to improve over time, and that the best

data would thus be the most recent.3


         Data for the other standard inputs to be used in estimating the agricultural production

function are also drawn from the FAO database. The land measure is hectares of permanent and

arable crop land; the labor measure is the number of economically active males and females in

prices. Resulting output data for each country-year are available on request from the author.

  I am grateful to Philip Pardey for suggesting this approach.

                                                                                                                    9
agriculture; capital is represented by the number of tractors; fertilizer is measured in tons of

inorganic plant nutrient; and, livestock is measured as the number of “cattle equivalents” held on

farms for productive use.4


        Each of these indicators of agricultural inputs falls short of the ideal data for measuring

agricultural productivity. In discussing the measurement problems generically associated

productivity analysis, Griliches (1960, 1987) has noted that proper estimation of production

functions should be based the flow of services of capital (accounting for vintage) in constant

prices, as well as on the flow of labor services (e.g., hours worked) weighting different types of

labor by their marginal prices. Clearly, the input data available for African agriculture,

consisting of counts of the number of tractors and the number of agricultural workers (issues of

data quality aside), fall far short of this ideal. In particular, the assumption in the data that all of

what is counted as agricultural labor is specifically on-farm labor contradicts micro-based

evidence of significant non-farm rural activity (Liedholm, McPherson, and Chuta, 1994). Over-

counting labor in this way may impose a downward bias on estimated TFP growth. There must

also be substantial measurement error in fertilizer data that capture only inorganic fertilizer in a

setting where manure is the primary source of added soil nutrients.


        In short, the methodological tradeoffs and measurement errors inevitably associated with

constructing both the output and the input data for African agriculture are substantial, and

suggest the potential for significant noise and bias in estimates of total factor productivity. Yet,

as demonstrated in the seminal work of Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), it is possible to mitigate

these problems by introducing explicit controls for the quality of inputs.

 Craig, Pardey, and Roseboom (1997) note, for example, that up to 70% of total horsepower traction in
African agriculture is provided by livestock.

                                                                                                        10
         As described below, the quality of inputs differs across countries and over time within

countries. To the limited extent possible, it is important to control for these differences by

including input quality adjustments in productivity estimates. Data used here to adjust for

variations in land quality include the proportion of permanent and arable crop land that is

irrigated, and annual rainfall. The former are drawn from data compiled by Sebastion (2007).

The annual rainfall data used in this study are drawn from Mitchell, et. al. (2003) and Jefferson

and O’Connell (2004), based on the crop-weighting scheme of Ramankutty and Foley (1998).5

Quality adjustments to the agricultural labor force generally rely on literacy rates. This study

takes advantage of newly-released data on average years of schooling from Barro and Lee

(2010). Additional data used in trying to decompose the productivity residual are described

below.


    4. Partial Productivity Ratios

         Partial productivity ratios (output per worker, and output per hectare) provide a useful

initial overview of both the level and growth rate of agricultural productivity. While these ratios

share the analytical limitation of not controlling for changes in other inputs, they have the virtue

of reflecting the general nature of technical change and agriculture as being predominantly either

land- or labor-saving. The simplicity of partial productivity ratios may also be a benefit in a

preliminary analysis of noisy and often low-quality data.


         Hayami and Ruttan (1985) present a useful and intuitive conceptual approach for

analyzing joint trends in partial productivity ratios, based on the simple identity

                                                                                                    11

where Y is output, A is area, and L is labor. Taking logarithms of this identity facilitates thinking

in terms of relative changes, as in

         The welfare of Africa's agricultural labor force ultimately depends on increasing output

per worker. Equation (2) illustrates the challenge to that process in an environment characterized

by rapid population growth and limited land area. To the extent that population growth outpaces

the rate of expansion of agricultural area, area per worker (A/L) declines, thus increasing the

challenge of raising average labor productivity (Y/L) by means of increasing average yield (Y/A).

This dynamic has been a major obstacle to agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa.


         Table 1 presents the growth rates of partial productivity ratios for sub-Saharan Africa and

its sub-regions by decade from 1961 to 2007. For the region as a whole over this entire period

the average annual growth rate of output per worker has been only 0.41%, despite an average

annual growth rate of 1.24% in output per hectare. As suggested by equation (2), the limited

ability of yield growth in African agriculture to drive growth in average labor productivity has

been driven by the increasing population density of rural Africa, where the annual growth of the

agricultural labor force has outpaced area expansion by 0.83% per year from 1961 to 2007. Yet,

recent years demonstrate a more optimistic trend. For the period 2001 to 2007, the growth rate

of average labor productivity in African agriculture has increased dramatically (to over 2% per

year) relative to previous periods -- an advance aided by a reversal of the historical trend towards

declining area per worker.


                                                                                                    12
        In their seminal study of agricultural development, Hayami and Ruttan (1985) also

developed a useful and intuitive graphical presentation of partial productivity ratios. Their

graphical representation of equation (2) simultaneously relates changes over time in average land

and labor productivity by measuring average land productivity along the vertical axis and

average labor productivity along the horizontal axis. Changes in output per hectare and output

per worker over a given period can be illustrated by drawing an arrow between the relevant

beginning and ending coordinates in that space. Scaling the axes in logarithms conveniently

implies that movements along any 45° line represent equal rates of change in both land and labor

productivity. From equation (2), it follows that such equal rates of change imply a constant level

of area per worker. Thus, each 45° line in this space represents a unique and constant level of

A/L. Partial productivity paths steeper than 45° reflect increased rural population density over

time.


        Timmer (1988) provides various interpretations of movements over time in this space.

He notes, for example that a movement due north (indicating growth in yield with no growth in

average output per worker) may indicate population growth matched by increased yields through

higher labor inputs and technical change, but no improvement in rural living standards.

Movements to the northwest might suggest population growth faster than technical change in

raising yields, with a consequent deterioration in rural living standards. In contrast, movements

due east in this space might reflect a declining agricultural workforce with no changes in yields,

but with new mechanical technologies needed to maintain output with fewer workers, hence

increasing average labor productivity and rural welfare.


        Figure 1 implements this framework, placing African agriculture in a global context. The

partial productivity paths depicted in Figure 1 illustrate changes from 1961/65 (period average)

                                                                                                   13
to 2001/05, distinguishing the coordinates also at 1981/85 for sub-Saharan Africa and other

middle-income and advanced economies. The positions of these paths reflect different levels of

land and labor productivity, while their lengths indicate rates of change. It is clear from Figure 1

that Africa begins and ends this period with levels of land and labor productivity that are quite

low in comparison with those found in more advanced economies, as well as in comparison with

the world averages. Stated differently, African agriculture falls well within the meta-production

frontier defined here by Japan, Germany, USA, and Australia. Productivity growth in African

agriculture, as reflected in these partial productivity ratios, has been driven almost entirely by

increased yields per hectare, with little growth of output per worker. This results in a path

substantially steeper than the 45° line, indicating that rural Africa has grown increasingly

crowded.


         While during the second half of this period sub-Saharan Africa reflects a slightly

increased rate of growth in average labor productivity, that progress remains quite small by

comparison with the other countries illustrated in Figure 1. Note as well, that those countries

with the most rapid increases in agricultural labor productivity have followed paths shallower

than the 45° lines, indicating increases in area per worker over time.


         Figure 2 intensifies the focus on partial productivity ratios in Africa, disaggregating by

five sub-regions and the averages of successive five-year periods.6 Consistent with the data

presented in Table 1, no region of sub-Saharan Africa experienced continuous growth in both

land and labor productivity, though some regions were clearly more successful than others.

Southern Africa, for example, began in the early 1960s at a relatively low level of output per

worker, yet experienced the fastest rate of subsequent growth (averaging 1.24% per year, per

Table 1), though with a significant setback between 1986/90 and 1991/95. West Africa, too,

made substantial progress in increasing agricultural labor productivity beginning in the early

1980s. In contrast, Sahelian countries began with the lowest level of average labor productivity

in 1961/65, and saw that level decline consistently (along with yields) until at least the early

1980s. Similarly, countries in Middle Africa experienced slow declines in agricultural labor

productivity until the early 1990s, while countries in Eastern Africa experienced consistent but

relatively slow increases in both land and labor productivity over most of the period.7 These

contrasting experiences, even at the regional level, illustrate the great heterogeneity of African

agriculture. This heterogeneity pertains both to conditions and to rates of progress over time.

(Note, for example, the substantially greater level of average area per worker in southern Africa

as compared with Eastern Africa.)


         Figures 3 (a – d) underscore this country-level heterogeneity. Figure 3a presents country-

level partial productivity paths for Western Africa over the period 1961/65 to 2001/05. Some

countries, such as Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, and Benin experienced significant growth in average

labor productivity accompanied by moderate growth in crop yield, while other countries, such as

Togo, Niger, and Liberia experienced gains in crop yield accompanied by small reductions in

average labor productivity. At the same time, Figure 3a depicts rapid declines in agricultural

labor productivity in Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau. Among countries in Eastern Africa

(Figure 3b), there was the predominant tendency towards moderate gains in crop yield

accompanied by slow growth in output per worker. Figures 3c and 3d depict a similar

their position along a higher 45° line) follow a relatively steep path over time, indicating a tendency towards land-
saving technical change. This is consistent with the Induced Innovation Hypothesis, associated with Hayami and
Ruttan (1985).

       In general, these patterns (particularly at the level of regional disaggregation) conform to

what is known of events on the ground. Gabre-Mahdin and Haggblade (2004) provide an

interesting perspective on successes in African agriculture. They conducted a survey of over 100

experts working in various areas related to African agriculture (two-thirds of whom were

Africans), asking them to identify the most important factors in advancing African agriculture.

The majority (62%) pointed to successes tied to specific commodities; 21% identified activities

such as policy reform and enhancement of soil fertility; and, 16% cited successful institution-

building efforts as the primary drivers of African agriculture. Maize breeding (followed by

cassava breeding) was the most widely-cited contributor. Byerlee and Jewell (1997) report that

most of the successes in breeding, releasing, in adopting improved maize varieties was in East

and Southern Africa. Between 1966 and 1990, Byerlee and Jewell note the release of over 300

improved varieties and hybrids by national maize research programs.


       The release of hybrid maize in Africa dates back to the early 1930s in Zimbabwe (then

Southren Rhodesia), though there were no major successes until the release in Zimbabwe of the

variety SR52 in 1960. Successful hybrid maize releases followed shortly thereafter in Kenya.

Byerlee and Jewell (1997) report widely varying results for the adoption of maize hybrids and

improved open-pollinated varieties. By 1990, nearly all of Zimbabwe's maize area was planted

to hybrids, as was 70% of Kenya's maize area, and 77% of Zambia's maize area. At the same

time however, Malawian farmers had planted only 14% of maize area to improve varieties,

similar to the 18% of Mozambique's maize area, and 13-29% of Ethiopia's maize area under

                                                                                                  16
improve varieties. Byerlee and Jewell also note that even in countries with substantial areas

devoted to improved maize varieties, yield gains were often moderated by declining soil fertility

combined with extremely limited application of chemical fertilizer. Kumwenda, et. al. (1997)

cite declining soil fertility as the most widespread limitation on both yield improvement in the

sustainability of the maize-based production systems in Southern and Eastern Africa.


       Gabre-Madhin and Haggblade’s (2004) survey reinforces the specific success of maize

breeding programs in East and Southern Africa, where by the turn of the century, they reported

that 58% of maize area planted to improved hybrids with yields gains of about 40% over local

varieties. In contrast, only about 20% of total maize area in West and Central Africa were

planted to improve varieties. Those regions were more dominated by improved open-pollinating

varieties, with output gains of 15-45% over local varieties.


       Evenson and Gollin (2003) track the annual rate of varietal releases for all improved crop

varieties. While not disaggregating by regions within Africa, they do report a near doubling of

the number of average annual releases between 1976-80 and 1981-85, from 23 to 43.2 (and to 50

per year by the early 1990s). This accelerated release of improved crop varieties coincides with

the acceleration in the growth of both partial productivity ratios reported in Table 1.


       Other important sources of success in African agriculture cited in the survey included

breeding to combat mosaic virus in cassava, as well as improvements in the yield and drought-

resistance of that crop (which is particularly important in West and Central Africa); expansion of

horticultural and flower exports from East and Southern Africa; rapid growth of cotton

production and exports from West Africa (the Sahelian countries in particular); and, improved

breeding of bananas in Central Africa. Among activity-led successes, Gabre-Madhin and


                                                                                                   17
Haggblade’s survey noted soil fertility enhancement, such as alley cropping in West Africa and

improved water management techniques in Southern Africa. Respondents also noted the positive

effects of market reforms, currency devaluation, and improved institutions as contributors to

Africa's improved agricultural performance.


         Partial productivity ratios, while indicative of broad trends in the rate and nature of

productivity growth, are limited by their lack of control for potentially confounding changes in

other inputs. The remaining sections of this paper thus turn to the estimation of total factor

productivity growth in African agriculture.


    5. Measuring Total Factor Productivity Growth in Agriculture:

         Methodology

         The rate of growth of total factor productivity (TFP) is conventionally defined as the

difference between the rate of growth of real product and the rate of growth of real factor input.

Assuming, as in Solow (1957), competitive factor markets and constant returns to scale in the

aggregate production function, a change in total factor productivity can be measured as a vertical

shift in the production function. A variety of methodological approaches have evolved for

estimating total factor productivity growth, including the construction of TFP indices (such as

the Tornquist-Theil), data envelopment analysis (based on the non-parametric Malmquist index),

and stochastic frontier analysis, in addition to the econometric estimation of the aggregate

production function. TFP estimation in the present study is based on the latter approach of

estimating the aggregate agricultural production function for a panel of African countries.8 One


8
  Tornquist-Theil indices require detailed factor price data that are unavailable for African agriculture. Stochastic
frontier approaches derive their results entirely by imposing very strong conditions on the error structure of the
estimated production function -- an approach that seems particularly ill-suited to the present setting, which is

                                                                                                                        18
key benefit of a parametric approach is that it helps to impose order in an otherwise noisy data

set.


         Specifying the aggregate agricultural production function requires numerous choices,

beginning with functional form. I adopt the Cobb-Douglas functional form, which has been

repeatedly validated in agricultural studies (Griliches, 1964; Hayami and Ruttan, 1985), as has

been the assumption of constant returns to scale (Hayami and Ruttan, 1985). The "traditional"

inputs included in virtually every cross-country study of agricultural productivity include: land,

labor, fertilizer, tractors, and livestock. As noted above, available data for each of these inputs

almost certainly include significant measurement error. In addition, as emphasized in the early

studies of US agriculture by Griliches (1963, 1964), and for the US economy as a whole by

Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), much of what might mistakenly be attributed to TFP growth

may in reality be changes over time in the quality of inputs.


         Whether one puts such adjustments for input quality in the production function or in the

residual is an interesting question. Griliches (1960) takes an agnostic approach, suggesting

"Whether or not we want the input measures to cover all possible quality changes is a semantic

rather than a substantive issue. Hybrid seed corn can be viewed either as improvement in the

quality of seed or as ‘technical change.’ Since we are interested in explaining the growth of

agricultural output, it does not matter much whether we put it into the ‘input change’ category or

the ‘productivity change’ category as long as we put it somewhere and know where it is."


characterized by low quality and quite noisy data. The data envelopment analysis approach, while often used in
recent studies of agricultural productivity (Lusigi and Thirtle, 1997; Fulginiti, Perrin, and Yu, 2004; and Nin-Pratt
and Yu, 2008; and Alene, 2010, among others), is also problematic. Heady, Alauddin, and Prasada Rao (2010),
along with Nin-Pratt, et. al. (2003), note that DEA studies of agricultural TFP often produce anomalous and
implausible results. The DEA approach measures countries' progress relative to a productivity frontier, which
depends arbitrarily on the number and selection of countries included in the sample, and which is poorly suited to
distinguish between TFP growth, noisy data, and measurement error. Coelli, Prasada Rao, O’Donnell, and Battese
(2005) discuss the relative merits of these approaches.

                                                                                                                    19
Specification


       The dependent variable in my aggregate production function is crop output aggregated

(as described above) based on the Africa-specific international commodity prices and PPP

exchange rates calculated for this study. The resulting TFP estimates are thus limited to crop

agriculture. This, too, reflects a departure from most of the literature, which typically includes

both crop and livestock output (summed) for aggregate output. The median share by value of

livestock output in total agricultural output over the entire sample is 0.21, though this share

varies by region and country. The mean livestock share in total agricultural output is highest in

the five countries included from southern Africa (0.48), and lowest among the ten included (non-

Sahelian) countries of western Africa (0.17). For certain countries, including Botswana, Sudan,

Mali, Mauritania, and Namibia, livestock output accounts for greater than half of the value of

total agricultural output. For such countries, excluding livestock is a potentially significant

omission. Yet, that omission brings with it the broader benefit of more accurate aggregation of

output (based on Africa-specific data, which are not available for livestock output). On average

this omission is relatively small. (Appendix 2 demonstrates the robustness of my main results

compared against those derived from using a broader output aggregate that includes livestock.)


       There is also a more theoretical reason for excluding livestock from the output aggregate,

arising largely from the construction and interpretation of the production function itself. As

typically specified, with inputs including tractors, fertilizer, livestock (used both for traction and

as a source of manure), the production function conceptually describes specifically crop output.

The estimated coefficients on these inputs are interpreted as production elasticities and serve as

input weights for productivity measurement. This interpretation of estimated coefficients for

tractors and fertilizer in particular is clouded by the inclusion of livestock in the dependent

                                                                                                     20
variable. Indeed, by comparison with crop agriculture, livestock production is less labor

intensive and more land intensive, thus blurring the interpretation of those coefficients, as well.

Yet, excluding livestock from the dependent variable does come at the cost of under-

emphasizing integrated crop-livestock production systems that have become increasingly

common in Africa. Available cross-country data on inputs and output in agriculture provide no

perfect match between what is included on the left- and right-hand sides of the production

function. For instance, while I can (and do) eliminate permanent pasture from my measure of

land, the labor variable still includes labor applied to livestock production.9


        Prior to specifying and estimating the cross-country production function, it is useful to

present the growth rates of output and inputs. Table 3 presents these growth rates, distinguishing

the periods before and after 1985. Crop output for the entire period 1961 to 2007 grew at an

average rate of just over 2% per year, accelerating post-1985. Growth of the agricultural labor

force was also stable, at about 1.65% per year. Agricultural area also expanded at a relatively

stable 0.85% per year. What is striking, however, is the dramatic reversal in the growth rates of

the number of tractors and tons of chemical fertilizers pre- and post-1985, a break-point that may

reflect the widespread onset of structural adjustment and related reforms. From 1961 to 1984,

the average growth rate for tractors and fertilizer were just over 7% and 6%, respectively; yet,

post-1985, consumption of both fell at an average rate of 0.5% per year.


        Loosely borrowing notation from Craig, Pardey, and Roseboom (1997), I specify the

initial production function for country i at time t with k conventional inputs                   , and a

country-invariant temporal shift of variable A(t) as:

9
 Even if the FAO labor data were to distinguish between crop and livestock labor, they would likely grow at the
same rate in any given country and year. As it is ultimately the growth rate of inputs that matters for TFP
estimation, over-stating the level of labor may have little effect on estimated TFP growth.

                                                                                                                  21

The presence of both quality change and measurement error in the inputs creates a divergence

between observed inputs and effective inputs. We can separate out measurable country-specific

(but time-varying) quality shifters in input j,              , and country-specific but time-invariant

measurement error in input j,          . In this case, Craig, Pardey, and Roseboom (1997) note that the

relationship between observed input                 and effective input             is given by


     (4)


Substituting equation (4) into equation (3) and scaling the production function by dividing by

input          yields



     (5)                                     ∏                    ∏


This production function imposes constant returns to scale across the conventional inputs. The

production elasticity for variable X1 can be recovered in estimation as                    1    ∑        . In

practice, the scaling variable will be labor.10 Equation (5) provides the basic production

function to be estimated in measuring TFP growth, where TFP growth is captured by the

intertemporal shifts in the production function measured by A(t). Once having estimated the rate

of TFP growth, the second stage of the analysis will be to explain that growth. Towards that end,

I add to the production function in equation (5) a vector of m potential explanations,                       , for

the observed productivity growth in African agriculture.


     The final production function can thus be written as
10
  Scaling the production function substantially eliminates the heteroskedasticity that would otherwise result from
combining countries of greatly differing size.

                                                                                                                     22

Following Craig, Pardey, and Roseboom (1997), in the empirical representation of equation (6) I

replace A(t) with time period dummies, TD(s). These time dummies track vertical shifts of the

production function over time, and thus provide a basis for estimating the rate of TFP growth. I

also aggregate the input- and country-specific measurement error into composite time-invariant

country-specific dummies, CDh . Expressing all but the dummy variables in natural logs (as

lower-case letters) in per worker terms leads to the estimating equation:


     (7)                          ∑                   ∑                   ∑                   ∑

                         ∑


           In practice, data constraints limit the number of input quality adjusting variables to fewer

than the number of inputs. Thus, the Z variables to be used include two adjustments for land

quality (annual rainfall and percentage of land equipped for irrigation), and one variable to adjust

for the quality of the labor force (average years of schooling, from Barro and Lee, 2010).


Estimation Strategy


           I implement two different econometric approaches to deriving the rate of TFP growth

from the estimation of equation (7).11 The strategy will be first to estimate the production

function including only conventional inputs and the country and period dummy variables (that is,

imposing the constraints                   0). I then derive the input quality-adjusted estimates of TFP


11
  In theory there is some risk of endogeneity in estimating production functions if for example farmers choose
observed inputs as a function of unobserved inputs. Estimating fixed effects models, such as that proposed here,
helps to the extent that these unobserved effects are constant over time. Fuglie (2010) estimates a cross-country
agricultural production function both with and without instrumental variables, but finds little difference between the
two approaches.

                                                                                                                    23
growth by re-estimating equation (7), this time including the Z variables (relaxing the constraint

that      0). The resulting quality-adjusted TFP estimates provide the baseline against which I

decompose this productivity residual into various explanations for productivity growth.


       A key practical consideration in deriving TFP growth estimates from equation (7) is to

distinguish trends in true productivity from the substantial noise inherent in these data.

Productivity growth is ultimately measured as a reflection of the deeper process of technical

change, which in principle does not fluctuate dramatically from year to year (Griliches, 1987).

Given the heavy reliance of African agriculture on rainfall in particular, some form of smoothing

is essential. This study applies two alternative econometric approaches to address this problem.


       The most common approach for addressing this problem, given the availability of panel

data, has been to collapse the annual cross sections into successive five-year averages. While

somewhat ad hoc and potentially sensitive to the starting and ending years chosen, this approach

is effective in smoothing out annual fluctuations. In deriving TFP measures from the estimation

of equation (7), I begin with this approach. Having annual data from 1961 – 2007 permits the

creation of nine full cross sections of five-year averages. I then introduce a novel approach to

deriving TFP estimates from annual data, based on semi-parametric estimation of the production

function. The core idea shared by both approaches is that one can estimate the rate of TFP

growth directly from vertical shifts in the production function.


       The first approach applies seemingly unrelated regression (SURE) to a panel data set

consisting of sequential five-year averages of the annual data. The strategy here is to specify the

same production function for each cross section in the panel, using the SURE estimator to apply

appropriate cross-equation constraints on the parameter estimates for conventional agricultural


                                                                                                   24
inputs, leaving the intercept terms unconstrained. Constraining similar slope terms to be equal

across pairs of adjacent production functions ensures that the change in the intercepts of the

production functions between periods reflects vertical shifts of the same production function over

time.12 In this case, we can derive estimates of TFP growth directly from changes in the

intercept terms of adjacent production functions. My SURE system of production functions thus

takes the form:


     ,    /           /       ,   /       ,   /       ,   /     ,   /         ,   /   ,       /       ,   /   ,   /     ,   /


     ,    /           /       ,   /       ,   /       ,   /     ,   /         ,   /   ,       /       ,   /   ,   /     ,   /


     ,    /           /       ,   /       ,   /       ,   /     ,   /         ,   /   ,       /       ,   /   ,   /     ,   /



where (in logs) y is crop output per worker, a is area per worker, tr is tractors per worker, f is

fertilizer per worker, and lv is livestock per worker.


               Estimating the rate of TFP growth between 1961/65 and 1966/70 first requires imposing

(and testing) the constraint          ,       /   ,       /   jointly for all of the conventional inputs. The rate

of TFP growth between these periods can then be calculated as


         (8)                                                              /               /       ,


where (given this panel structure) T = 5. This econometric approach is not common in the

literature, but was used in Block (1994, 1995).




12
  Pair-wise equality constraints of the slope terms in adjacent production functions (e.g., the first two five-year
periods out of nine, then the second and third periods, etc.) is the minimal requirement for this approach. The
maximal approach would be to constrain the slope coefficients for a given inputs to be equal across all time periods
simultaneously. Wald tests reject this maximal constraint, yet, as reported in the text, tend not to reject pair-wise
constraints across adjacent periods.

                                                                                                                      25
             I also introduce in this paper a novel approach to estimating TFP growth from annual

panel data. As noted above, a key concern in estimating TFP growth is to distinguish

productivity trends from noise. For this purpose, I propose a semi-parametric approach to

estimating the production function in equation (7). This approach controls linearly for the

conventional inputs while allowing the residual relationship between output and time to take an

undefined functional form. This revised production function is thus


       (9)




             The difference between equation (7) and equation (9) lies in the specified functional

relationship between output, yi(t), and the year dummies, TD(s). Equation (7) is fully parametric

and thus imposes a linear relationship between output and time, estimation of which would

provide a basis for calculating a single average rate of TFP growth for the period. In contrast,

equation (9) retains the linear parametric relationship between output and all other variables

included in the production function with the exception of the year dummies. Rather than

imposing linearity on the relationship between output and the year dummies, the semi-parametric

specification of equation (9) allows this relationship to take an undefined functional form          · .13

This approach allows the estimated rate of TFP growth to vary freely over time, as defined by the

data themselves, rather than imposing linearity (or any other pre-defined parametric

specification).

matrix x, and write the semi-parametric regression as,


     (10)


Yatchew (2003) describes that when the data are sorted by z in increasing order of size (and

assuming that g is a smooth function), then first differencing the data tends to eliminate the

nonparametric term, g(zi), since the first difference,                                 0 as the sample size

increases.14 In this case, after first differencing, one can consistently estimate             by OLS.

Then, subtracting the estimated parametric portion of the model from both sides of (10) (as

Lokshin, 2006, shows), one is left with


     (11)


since        converges to β. What remains is a two-dimensional purely non-parametric

relationship between yi and zi, which is estimated by a locally-weighted kernel density smoother

(using Stata’s lowess command).


        Thus, estimation of equation (9) effectively partials out the linear effects of the

conventional inputs and country dummies, leaving a non-parametric kernel regression of output

on the annual time dummies. The resulting estimated function,                       , is a smoothed non-

parametric representation of annual shifts in the production function, controlling linearly for all

other variables in equation (9).




14
  Also see M. Lokshin (2006) for a detailed exposition of the plreg Stata command commonly used to implement
this estimator.

                                                                                                               27
       Transforming this continuous function into estimates of the instantaneous rate of TFP

growth requires a calculation analogous to that described by equation (8). Equation (8) converts

discrete shifts over time in the intercept of the production function into a rate of change – an

estimate of the average rate of TFP growth during the period of estimation. In the semi-

parametric case, the analogous task is to convert the estimated non-parametric effect of time on

output into rates of change (or estimates of the growth rate of TFP). In this case,                is a

non-parametrically smoothed representation of the annual shifts of the production function,

estimated from the year dummies. For arbitrarily small changes in time, the analogy to equation

(8) is implemented by differentiating             with respect to time:


   (12)


That is, the slope of           with respect to time provides a point estimate of the instantaneous

rate of TFP growth. Taking this derivative at every point of              thus results in a smoothed

non-parametric path that describes the rate of TFP growth as a continuous function of time.


       The following section presents estimates of TFP growth rates derived from both the

SURE and semi-parametric approaches described above.


   6. Measuring Total Factor Productivity Growth in Agriculture: Results

       An African success emerges from Figure 4, which presents the rates of TFP growth in

African crop agriculture, averaged over successive five-year periods from 1961/65 to 2001/06.




                                                                                                      28
These results reflect vertical shifts in the successive production functions based on five-year

averages of annual panel data, estimated by the SURE regression procedure described above.15

Thus, for example, the first bar in Figure 4, marked 63-68 describes the average rate of TFP

growth between "1963" (designating data averaged over the period 1961-65) and "1968"

(designating data averaged over the period 1966-70). These baseline results control only for the

conventional inputs, unadjusted for quality.


         These preliminary results are encouraging in their reflection of a broad recovery of

productivity growth in African crop agriculture beginning in the mid-1980s, re-confirming the

results by Block (1994). Figure 4 depicts a history in which the early years of independence

were characterized, on average, by a slow yet positive rate of productivity growth in African

crop agriculture. This relatively auspicious start, however, was followed by 15 years of

stagnation and decline, as TFP growth rates became increasingly negative on average from the

late 1960s through the early 1980s. In contrast, TFP growth rates since the mid-1980s, at least in

this preliminary view, reflect a substantial turnaround, approaching 2.8% per year on average

between the five-year periods centered around 1998 and 2003. The challenge, then, is to explain

this reversal of fortune for African agriculture. I begin by examining the effect of changes in the

quality of inputs, in particular land and labor. First, however, it is useful to review estimates of

the underlying production function.


         Table 4 presents estimates of the basic production function for African crop agriculture

described by equation (7). The estimates in column (1) include only the conventional inputs.

15
  Estimating TFP growth based on vertical shifts of the production function, as noted above, requires equality of the
production elasticities for given conventional inputs across the production functions for the beginning and ending of
the period being measured. Joint tests of the quality of the estimated coefficients on conventional inputs,
implemented pair-wise for each of the eight sets of adjacent production functions failed to reject the equality of the
production functions for all but one period (1968-73), and in that case the rejection was only at the .10-level. These
tests are thus highly supportive of this SURE approach to TFP estimation.

                                                                                                                   29
Column (2) adds controls for annual rainfall and the share of land equipped for irrigation to

adjust for differences in land quality; and column (3) adds average years of schooling to control

for changes in the quality of labor. In keeping with the inclusion of country dummies in equation

(7) to control for, among other things, time-invariant measurement error, the production

functions in Table 4 are estimated as fixed-effects models.


       The coefficient estimates in column (1) are all statistically significant and have the

expected signs. By comparison with estimates in other studies of African agriculture (such as

Fuglie, 2010), the production elasticity of land is quite high (and by implication, that of labor,

quite low). The higher estimate for land in the present study may reflect in part the exclusion of

livestock production from the output aggregate (described above). Historically, much of the

increase in African crop output has been the result of land extensification. The implication that a

10% increase in land area per worker would result in a roughly 8% increase in crop output is thus

plausible. Rainfall and share of land equipped for irrigation (which often differs from the share

of land actually irrigated in any given year due to water constraints), both present significant

positive effects on per capita output (column (2)). In addition, column (3) demonstrates the

significant positive effect of average years of schooling of the labor force on agricultural output,

suggesting that improvements in the quality of the labor force has been an important positive

factor for African agriculture.


       Figure 5 illustrates the non-parametric pattern of TFP growth rates over time, estimated

from annual data and controlling linearly for (only) the five conventional inputs. These

smoothed continuous results are consistent with the initial results presented in Figure 4 in

suggesting that the stagnation and decline of African crop productivity of the late 1960s through

the early 1980s has been followed by two decades of substantial recovery and progress. While

                                                                                                     30
that progress appears to have stalled during the early and mid-1990s, average TFP growth rates

for African crop agriculture have trended steeply upwards since the late 1990s. By 2005, this

growth rate exceeded 2% per year.


       The average TFP growth rate of the path illustrated in Figure 5 is 0.97% per year. This

measurement is based on the period 1961 – 2000 for 29 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It is not

adjusted for differences in the quality of inputs. Over this same period and set of countries, crop

output grew at the average rate of 1.68% per year. As a first cut, then, TFP appears to explain

58% of the growth in Africa’s crop output (though this estimate will be revised downward with

the incorporation of adjustments for input quality).


       Is interesting, as well, to disaggregate this average SSA result to the regional level (as

presented above in Figures 3a-d for the partial productivity analysis). Here too, Figure 6

demonstrates substantial heterogeneity across the regions of sub-Saharan Africa, though with a

trend towards convergence in growth rates. Southern Africa has maintained a consistently high

rate of TFP growth throughout this period, though the TFP growth rate for West Africa

(excluding the Sahel) turned positive around 1975 and surpassed the growth rate for Southern

Africa between 1980 and 1995. On the low end, Sahelian and Middle African countries began

the post-independence period with negative rates of TFP growth, which turned positive only in

the early and late 1980s, respectively. These results, summarized in Table 5, are consistent with

those of the partial productivity analysis presented above. Comparing, in Table 5, the regional

average TFP growth rates for the periods 1961-84 and 1985-2002, it is clear that every region

except East Africa enjoyed a substantially greater rate of TFP growth in the later period.




                                                                                                    31
         Returning to the SSA average, the next step is to measure the contributions of changes in

input quality to these initial estimates of TFP growth. Figure 7 repeats the semi-parametric

procedure underlying Figure 5, adjusting first for changes in land quality, and then adjusting for

labor quality as well.16 Changes in the quality of land and labor emerge as significant

contributors to TFP growth.


         Table 6 quantifies these contributions by calculating the percentage change in the mean

TFP growth rate over the entire period resulting from the inclusion of these additional

explanatory variables. The mean TFP growth rate for the baseline estimates illustrated in Figure

5 (and in the highest path in Figure 7) for the period 1961 to 2000 was 0.97% per year.17 After

adjusting for land quality, this estimate falls to 0.87% per year. (This difference is significant at

the .10-level in a one-sided t-test.) That is, adjustments for land quality explain just over 10% of

the baseline growth rate of agricultural TFP. The non-parametric approach reveals that most of

this difference has occurred since the mid-1980s, reflecting, in part, expansion of irrigation.

Controlling in addition for improvements in the quality of the agricultural labor force reduces the

mean TFP residual to 0.59% per year. Together, adjusting for changes in the quality of land and

labor inputs thus account for 0.38 percentage points difference in, or 39% of, the baseline growth

rate of agricultural TFP.




16
   Note that the baseline (unadjusted) TFP growth path depicted in Figure 7 is shifted up relative to the baseline
growth TFP path depicted in Figure 5. This difference results from the loss of observations, given the availability of
data for the adjustments to land and labor. Figures 4 and 5 use the same set of all available observations; whereas
the three TFP growth paths presented in Figure 7 all use the same, but more limited, sample of observations.
17
   Note that this growth is greater than the unadjusted growth rate reported in Table 5. This higher rate was
estimated over a sample that was limited by the availability of data for land and labor quality adjustments, while the
rate reported in Table 5 was for the largest possible sample.

                                                                                                                   32
           In terms of the broader growth accounting, this adjusted baseline TFP growth rate

estimate of 0.59% per year accounts for 36% of the 1.68% per year growth rate of aggregate crop

output.


           Even net of these adjustments, however, it is clear from Figure 7 that TFP growth in

African crop agriculture has generally accelerated since reaching its nadir in the late 1970s.

Despite a modest deceleration in TFP growth during the early and mid-1990s, aggregate TFP

growth for African crop agriculture in 2000 was 4 to 5 times greater than it had been 25 years

earlier.


           The following section continues the task of decomposing and explaining the TFP residual

measured here, expanding that task to consider a wider range of potential explanations. My

starting point for these additional decompositions is the TFP residual estimated net of

adjustments for input quality.


    7. Explanations for Total Factor Productivity Growth in Agriculture


           This section considers several potential explanations for productivity growth in African

crop agriculture, including: expenditures on agricultural research and development,

infrastructure (roads), the effects of civil war, and incentives (agricultural and macroeconomic

policy distortions). Severe data constraints, however, preclude a complete decomposition in

which all of these potential explanations are considered together. The best one can do, then, is to

compare the baseline TFP residual (net of adjustments for input quality) individually against

each of these potential explanations. In each case, it is necessary to re-estimate the "baseline"

TFP growth rate based on the sample of observations available for each potential explanation of

productivity growth. This approach provides estimates of the share of TFP growth explained by

                                                                                                      33
each of these factors; yet, these results will not be strictly additive across the potential

explanations (as the explanatory variables are not orthogonal to one another), and the

generalizability of these results must be qualified (as each decomposition must be estimated over

a slightly different sub-sample of the full data set). It may be reasonable, then, to think of the

following results as reflecting upper-bounds on the role of any individual explanation for

productivity growth.


           As in my previous accounting for input quality adjustments, my approach to measuring

the contribution of a given explanatory variable to TFP growth is first to estimate the quality-

adjusted production function with and without the additional variable, and then to calculate the

percentage difference in the means of the resulting non-parametric TFP growth paths as the

contribution of that variable to TFP growth.


Agricultural R&D


           Ultimately, measured productivity growth is intended to reflect a deeper process of

technological change. Expenditures on agricultural R&D are thus a potentially important driver

of productivity growth, as numerous studies have shown for Africa and for other developing and

developed regions (most recently for Africa, Alene, 2010). Data on agricultural research

expenditures for 27 sub-Saharan African countries since 1971 have been collected by the

Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) Initiative, housed at the International

Food Policy Research Institute.18 Beintema and Stads (2006) describe the rapid post-

independence growth in funding for agricultural R&D in Africa, followed by slower growth in

research expenditures during the 1980s, and near stagnation during 1990s. Table 7, from


18
     The ASTI data are available for download at http://www.asti.cgiar.org/data/.

                                                                                                     34
Beintema and Stads (2006, p. 4), disaggregates agricultural R&D expenditures in Africa by

region and decade. By region, the average growth rate of R&D expenditures from 1971 to 2000

has been greatest in East Africa -- exceeding the growth rate of expenditures in West Africa by a

factor of nearly eight. These are annual expenditures by governments in each country. They thus

reflect a flow of inputs into R&D. While much of the national funding for agricultural R&D in

Africa is donor-funded, these data do not include the benefits for any given country of

expenditures by the international agricultural research centers. Thus, to the extent that national

funding and the benefits of international research are correlated, the present estimates may be

biased upwards.


       Substantial lags exist between the time expenditures on R&D occur and the time they

affect productivity. Alene (2010) examines alternative lag structures on R&D expenditures, with

lags ranging from 2 to 16 years. His finding that the maximum effect of agricultural R&D

occurs around lag 10 leads him to conclude that the slowdown in agricultural TFP growth during

the 1990s is partially explained by the reduced growth rate of agricultural R&D expenditures in

the 1980s. This is consistent with the prediction by Block (1995), which also found that

agricultural research expenditures, lagged by ten years, were significant in explaining the

recovery of African agricultural productivity during the 1980s (but which expressed concern for

the future impact of reduced R&D expenditures by the late 1980s).


       Adding the 10-year lag of log agricultural R&D expenditures to the production function

estimated above (net of input quality adjustments) results in a production elasticity of

approximately 0.2 (P = 0.000), suggesting that doubling the level of agricultural R&D

expenditures at time t would boost agricultural output per worker by 20% at time t+10 -- a

substantial effect, and one that is consistent with studies that find high rates of return to

                                                                                                  35
agricultural research expenditures in Africa (Alene, 2010).19 Including the 10-year lag of R&D

expenditures limits the estimation period to1981-2000. For that period, the 10-year lag of R&D

expenditures explains 75% of estimated TFP growth. Extending the estimation period back to

1976-2000 by including only the 5-year lag of R&D expenditures results in only a small

reduction in the estimated production elasticity (to 0.18). In this case, agricultural R&D

expenditures still explain 45% of estimated TFP growth.


Roads


         The potential benefits of increased road density for agricultural productivity have been

explored in a variety of developing-country settings. These benefits, according to Zhang and

Fan (2004) include: increased profitability of farming resulting from reduced transportation

costs; greater purchases of inputs and marketing of output resulting from reduced transportation

costs; and, the potential to shift land from low-value cereals to higher-value horticulture with

reduced risks of perishability. Zhang and Fan (2004) demonstrate significant contributions of

roads to crop TFP in rural India, as do Mendes, Teixeira, and Salvato (2009) for Brazil, and

Suphannachart and Warr (2009) for Thailand, among many others. In a simulation model of

Uganda, Gollin and Rogerson (2010) also find significant complementarities between road

density and agricultural TFP. Most recently, Dorosh, et. al. (2010) provide evidence from sub-

Saharan Africa that agricultural production is higher in areas with lower travel times to urban

markets, and that adoption of modern technologies is negatively correlated with travel time to

urban centers.




19
  Including R&D expenditures in the production function required excluding the country dummies, as virtually all
of the variation in R&D expenditure is in the cross-section dimension of the data (rendering the “within” estimator
impractical).

                                                                                                                  36
        Such findings are consistent with both intuition and with the broadly held presumption

that roads are a critical ingredient for growth in agricultural productivity in Africa. For instance,

in its Framework for African Agricultural Productivity, the Comprehensive African Agriculture

Development Program (2006, p. 16) presents it as a given that, "... investment in infrastructure,

particularly rural feeder roads, can also lead to large productivity growth and poverty reduction

efforts." It is difficult, however, to demonstrate this contribution with available cross-country

country data.


        To account for the potential contributions of roads to agricultural TFP in Africa, I re-

estimate my baseline semi-parametric production function to include countries' share of paved

roads as a proportion of total roads. These roads data, drawn from the World Bank's World

Development Indicators, are quite limited in their country coverage and only begin in 1990. The

median paved road share for 1990-2007 was 16%. Perhaps owing to either the small sample size

or to the general lack of paved roads, the estimated production elasticity for paved road share is

effectively zero, and its inclusion makes virtually no difference to the estimated rate of TFP

growth. Replacing the paved road share of total roads with the ratio of road kilometers to arable

land does not change this result. One cannot conclude from this that the broad intuition

regarding roads' potential contribution to agricultural TFP is wrong. Rather, available cross-

country data and historical experience in Africa do not yet provide the expected statistical

support for that intuition.


Civil War


        Civil conflict has been endemic in much of sub-Saharan Africa in the post-independence

period. Sambanis and Elbadawi (2000) report that between 1960 and 2000, 40% of sub-Saharan


                                                                                                    37
African countries had experienced at least one period of civil war, and that in the year 2000 alone

20% of sub-Saharan Africa's population lived in countries that were formally at war (with

endemic low-intensity conflict in any other countries). They attributed this problem to high

levels of poverty, failed political institutions, and economic dependence on natural resources. It

is reasonable to suppose that endemic civil war (and perhaps even the expectation of civil war)

could negatively affect agricultural productivity. Physical destruction of crops, damaged

infrastructure inhibiting both the purchase of inputs and the marketing of outputs, the diversion

and destruction of human capital, and the potential reticence of households to invest in

agricultural improvement given the threat of these disruptions, could all lead to reductions in

agricultural productivity. I test this hypothesis by including in the production function data on

the incidence of civil wars, carefully constructed by Sambanis (2006).20


           A dummy variable equal to one during years of civil war enters the production function

negatively, with a coefficient equal to -.04 (P = 0.11), suggesting that average crop output across

the sample falls by 4% during years of civil war. Its effect on productivity is greater.

Comparing the averages of the non-parametric TFP growth paths with and without the incidence

of civil wars suggest that average TFP growth in African crop agriculture for the period 1960 to

2000 would have been over 11% greater in the absence of civil wars. This is the average effect

based on the occurrence of civil war in 13% of the country-year observations included in the

regression. A cautious interpretation of this result might consider the possibility that the

incidence of civil war acts as a proxy for broader (and excluded) institutional failures.


           Given this qualification, one can gain additional insight into the effect of civil war on

agricultural productivity in Africa by dividing the sample into observations with and without

20
     I am grateful to Nicholas Sambanis and to Robert Bates for making these civil war data available.

                                                                                                         38
civil war, observing their distinct experiences over time as opposed to the average effect of civil

war across the entire sample. This approach reveals that the average rate of agricultural TFP

growth was 0.74 percentage points lower (and negative on average) in the presence of civil war.

Figure 8 illustrates these differences, which (given the inclusion of country fixed effects) are

identified by countries moving in or out of the state of civil war.21


Macroeconomic Policy Distortions (Black Market Premium)


         It is well-documented that African economies have historically experienced high degrees

of distortion in macroeconomic policy. It has also been documented, first by Krueger, Schiff,

and Valdes (1988), that macroeconomic distortions in developing countries have often imposed

indirect taxes on agricultural producers in excess of their rates of direct taxation. That story

highlighted the role of real exchange rates, which were often overvalued to the detriment of

African farmers (who tended to produce import-competing tradables or exportables). By

undermining agricultural incentives, macroeconomic policy distortions might also have affected

agricultural productivity. To test that hypothesis, I use data on the black market premium for

foreign currency, often employed as a proxy for such distortions. Over the period 1961-2004,

the mean black market premium for sub-Saharan Africa was approximately 66% (though this

mean falls to 30% if one excludes as outliers observations with black market premia greater than

500%).


         The estimated coefficient on the log black market premium in the production function is

not statistically different from zero, indicating that this proxy for macroeconomic distortions did



21
  It is possible that this over-estimates the difference between settings with and without civil war if TFP is under-
estimated during civil wars. This could be the case if the data simply count the number of workers in the sector,
some of whom are prevented from working by war. The author is grateful to Keith Fuglie for noting this.

                                                                                                                        39
not affect crop output, per se.22 Yet, including the log black market premium in the specification

accounts for 29% of measured TFP growth. Figure 9 illustrates this result. It is interesting to

note that the productivity cost of this macroeconomic distortion diminishes over time relative to

the baseline TFP growth path, given that black-market currency premia in Africa over this period

fell on average by 12% per year (and was half the level post-1990 that had pertained pre-1990).


Agricultural Policy Distortions (Relative Rate of Assistance)


        Producer incentives might also exert a substantial effect on agricultural productivity,

particularly as regards farmers' choices on production intensity, crop mix, and input use. In a

recent and major update to the earlier work by Krueger, Schiff, and Valdes (1988), the World

Bank has released an extensive data set on trade-based agricultural price distortions (Anderson

and Valenzuela, 2008). This data set provides commodity-specific indicators of the policy-

induced divergence between domestic and international prices, covering 30 different

commodities in 68 countries (including 13 countries from sub-Saharan Africa) since 1955. The

key analytical building block of this data set is the nominal rate of assistance (NRA) for each

commodity-year observation, essentially measuring the rate of tax or subsidy at the border.

Anderson and Valenzuela (2008) also aggregate these nominal rates of assistance into

agricultural and non-agricultural categories. By calculating the ratio of the rate of assistance to

agricultural versus non-agricultural commodities, they create a relative rate of assistance (RRA)

indicator, which measures the extent to which agriculture is either favored or disfavored by trade

policy.23 Historically, African governments have discriminated heavily against their agricultural

subsequent years of structural adjustment, was still present in 2005 (Masters and Garcia, 2010;

Bates and Block, 2010).


        Figure 10 juxtaposes the TFP growth paths (with and without controlling for RRA) with

the nonparametric time path of the RRA, itself. The similarity of these patterns is striking. The

RRA is negative throughout this period. The fact that TFP growth rates and the RRA decline

and then rise together suggests the possibility that it is the first-difference (rather than the level)

of the RRA that drives TFP growth. With this motivation, I include the first-difference of RRA

in the semi-parametric production function. The RRA, however, is a policy choice and thus

potentially vulnerable to reverse causation. This would require that governments choose to

discriminate more heavily against sectors that perform worse over time, and discriminate less

heavily against sectors as their performance improves. Such a perspective runs contrary to the

logic found in much of the political economy literature on this subject (Bates, 1981), and ignores

the external pressures for reform that characterized much of the 1980s and 1990s in Africa.

Nonetheless, to provide at least some degree of protection against the potential for reverse

causation, I specify the production function to include the lagged first-difference of the RRA.

The point estimate (as expected) is positive, yet not statistically different from zero (0.037, P =

.62).


        The effect of RRA on TFP growth, however, is statistically significant (P = .016), as the

lagged first-difference of RRA explains 16% of TFP growth over this period (as illustrated in

Figure 10).24, 25



24
  Headey, Alauddin, and Prasada Rao (2010) find positive contributions to agricultural TFP growth with the same
RRA indicator in a broader sample of mostly non-African developing countries. This is consistent, as well, with
earlier evidence based on the use of the nominal protection coefficient in a small sample of non-African developing
countries by Fulginiti and Perrin (1999).

                                                                                                                 41
        Table 8 summarizes the results described in this section. This list of potential

explanations for agricultural productivity growth in Africa is far from comprehensive, yet it

represents the broad categories that have been addressed in the literature. Ideally, one would

incorporate all of these potential explanations into a single decomposition. In practice, data

constraints preclude such a comprehensive approach, requiring instead the pair-wise

comparisons presented above. I take at least a small step towards that ideal by estimating the

contributions of each potential explanation for productivity growth against baseline estimates

that are adjusted for variations in the quality of land and labor. Nonetheless, this approach

supports only broad statements regarding the relative importance of various explanations for

productivity growth. As Table 8 reflects, expenditures on agricultural R&D, albeit with

substantial lags, play the largest role in explaining agricultural TFP growth. Policy distortions,

both at the macroeconomic and sectoral level, have also played an important, though smaller,

role. Africa's agricultural TFP growth, on average, would have been 11% faster in the absence

of civil wars (though the difference is much greater in the specific comparison of country-year

observations with and without civil wars). And, contrary to expectations, available data suggest

that infrastructure as represented by paved roads has contributed little to Africa's agricultural

TFP growth.


        Ghana, in many ways, reflects the experience of sub-Saharan Africa over this period.

The following section draws on the broader cross-country analysis to highlight key aspects and

determinants of Ghana’s agricultural productivity.




25
  The black market premium and the first difference of the RRA are only loosely correlated (ρ = -0.11). While this
negative correlation suggests that countries with distorted currency regimes also tended to discriminate against
agriculture, the small magnitude of this correlation suggests that these two indicators do indeed reflect different
impacts on agricultural productivity.

                                                                                                                 42
   8. The Case of Ghana


       This brief review is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of Ghana’s agricultural

productivity experience. Rather, the primary objective is to explore in greater detail key findings

from the cross-country analysis regarding the drivers of productivity growth. A secondary

objective of this brief review of Ghana is to highlight some the issues that arise in country-level

analysis – issues that are generally invisible at the cross-country level, but which may suggest

caution in interpreting of cross-country findings.


Partial & Total Factor Productivity in Ghana


       Ghana typifies the decline and rise pattern of agricultural productivity seen in the broader

African sample. Figure 11 summarizes Ghana’s experience as reflected in the time path of its

partial productivity ratios. The first decade of independence saw small gains in crop yield

combined with declining output per worker. The country’s decline into economic chaos during

the 1970s is reflected in the rapid deterioration of both land and labor productivity depicted in

Figure 11. For agriculture, the country’s economic nadir in 1983 was exacerbated by severe

drought (starting in 1981), widespread bushfires, and the forced repatriation of one million

Ghanaians from Nigeria.


       These negative trends were strikingly reversed in the early 1980s, leading to a sustained

(and continuing) period of growth in the productivity of both land and labor. Clearly, looking

only at a path connecting the first and last periods (from which we would conclude that the

annual growth rates of average land and labor productivity were 1.35% and 0.6%, respectively)

would obscure the dramatic decline and resurgence seen by tracing out successive 5-year period

averages. The narrative of Ghana’s agricultural productivity is thus much more complex than

                                                                                                    43
would be implied by the moderate rates of growth in land and labor productivity observed on

average over the period 1961 – 2007. The challenge is to explain the decline and rise.


       The semi-parametric estimation approach developed above is not well-applied to a single

country time series of only 40 observations. The estimated (input quality-adjusted) production

elasticities are not statistically significant. Yet, controlling linearly for the conventional inputs

results in a TFP growth path, depicted in Figure 12, which is statistically different from zero and

suggests an average rate of crop TFP growth of 1.03% per year from 1961 – 2000. This pattern

of TFP growth rates is also consistent with the pattern of partial productivity ratios for Ghana

shown in Figure 11.


       For the period 1961 – 2000, aggregate crop output in Ghana grew at the average annual

rate of 2.37%. Growth accounting thus suggests that a TFP growth rate of 1.03% accounts for

approximately 43% of the growth in crop output.


       One way to summarize the current levels of crop productivity is to compare current yields

against potential yields. Such analysis by Ghana’s Ministry of Agriculture (2007) suggests that

the yields gaps remain substantial. For example, average maize yield of 1.5 MT/Ha is reported

to be 40% short of the achievable yield. Yield gaps calculated for other staple grains are

reported on the same order of magnitude, while the yield gap for cassava in Ghana is reported to

be 57.5% (Breisinger, et. al., 2008). The challenge is to identify the constraints to reducing these

yield gaps.


       One critical constraint to reducing the yield gap is the great heterogeneity of conditions

that characterize agriculture in Ghana (and virtually every other country in sub-Saharan Africa).

Figure 13 shows that Ghanaian agriculture is spread across six distinct agro-ecological zones,


                                                                                                        44
each listed here with its mean annual rainfall in millimeters: Rain Forest (2,200), Deciduous

Forest (1,500), Transitional (1,300), Coastal (800), Guinea Savanna (1,100), and Sudan Savanna

(1,000). These zones differ in their average annual rainfall by a factor of nearly four (Figure 14);

unlike the first four zones, which have two growing seasons, the two Savanna zones have only

one. Ghana’s agro-ecological zones also differ in their soil types and in the length of their

growing seasons, as a result of which they also differ widely in the mix of crops produced. In

addition, the productivity levels and growth rates for individual crops also vary widely across

agro-ecological zones.


       Figures 15 (a – d) illustrate this diversity for maize, cassava, sorghum, and plantains.

Maize is grown widely across Ghana, yet maize yields also vary widely across agro-ecological

zones. The greatest concentration of relatively high-yield maize production is in the southern

Guinea savanna in transitional zones, while the greatest concentration of relatively low-yield

maize production lies just south of there in the forest zone. Average yields in the former are

approximately twice those of the latter. Cassava production is similarly widespread (with the

exception of the northernmost savanna areas), with a spatial distribution of yields similar to that

of maize. In contrast, sorghum is grown exclusively in the Guinea and Sudan savanna zones,

and districts with vastly different yields border one another; while plantain is grown exclusively

in the forest and coastal zones, with somewhat less spatial variation in yields.


R&D


       The cross-country analysis identified expenditure on agricultural R&D as a key

determinant of productivity growth. The diversity of agricultural conditions within Ghana

multiplies the technical challenges to increasing agricultural productivity. Broadly, however, the


                                                                                                  45
relationship between R&D expenditures and TFP growth in Ghana is consistent with the cross-

country evidence.


        While the poor estimation of the underlying production function renders the estimated

TFP growth rates for Ghana as merely suggestive, their conformity with a 10-year lag of

expenditures on agricultural R&D is striking.26 Figure 12 juxtaposes the growth path of crop

TFP with R&D expenditures. The transition to positive rates of TFP growth in the early 1980s

follows by roughly 10 years the increased expenditures on agricultural R&D of the early 1970s;

the peak in TFP growth rates seen in the mid-1990s similarly follows the peak of R&D

expenditures of the mid-1980s; and, the decline in TFP growth rates in the late 1990s also lags

by approximately 10 years the reduced R&D expenditures of the late 1980s. The main anomaly

to this pattern is that the reduced expenditures of the late 1970s and early 1980s are not reflected

in the estimated TFP growth path.


        R&D expenditure is a blunt proxy for specific research outputs. The main research

output of interest here is improved varieties of staple grains. As Figure 15a demonstrates, maize

is grown is all of Ghana’s agro-ecological zones. The diversity of growing conditions, however,

implies that improved maize varieties must be adapted to specific settings. Ghana’s Crop

Research Institute takes the lead in developing and releasing improved varieties. During the

critical period of reversal in crop productivity trends, the Crop Research Institute, in

collaboration with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), the

International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), and the Canadian International

Development Agency (CIDA) implemented the Ghana Grains Development Project. Between


26
  The TFP growth path for Ghana is not statistically different from zero when lagged R&D expenditures are
included in the production function (though the sample falls to 19 years).

                                                                                                            46
1984 and 1996, this project developed and released twelve improved varieties of maize (Morris,

Tripp, and Dankyi, 1999). The project also promoted use of chemical fertilizers to complement

these improved varieties, and recommended new planting strategies.


        While these research advances created the potential for improved maize productivity, the

real benefits came only with their widespread adoption. By 1997, a nation-wide survey found

that 54% of farmers planted modern varieties of maize, though adoption rates varied widely

across agro-ecological zones (the highest adoption rate, 69%, was in the coastal savanna, while

the lowest rate, 38%, was in the Forest zone). Adoption of recommended planting strategies

followed a similar pattern. Yet, only 21% of farmers adopted the recommended fertilizers

(ranging from 36% in the Guinea Savanna to 9% in the Forest zone), and only 26% of the

national maize crop (by area) received fertilizer. (Morris, Tripp, and Dankyi, 1999.) In 1997,

approximately half of Ghana’s maize area was planted to modern varieties (ranging from 75% in

the Coastal Savanna, to 33% in the Forest).27


        Adoption of improved maize was thus reasonably widespread, if unevenly so, across the

country. On the supply side, one constraint to more widespread adoption of improved maize

varieties was an inability of the Ghana Seed Company (a government entity) to multiply the

improved seeds in sufficient quantity (Morris, et. al., 1999). On the demand side, Doss and

Morris (2001) found that the key constraints to adoption were lack of access to land, labor, and

credit. Jatoe, Al-Hassan, and Abatania (2005) found similar constraints to the adoption of

improved sorghum varieties in northern Ghana, where 40% of farmers had adopted improved

sorghum, but only 0.1% of total sorghum area was planted to modern varieties.

27
  The survey also found that 9% of farmers who adopted modern varieties subsequently “disadopted” them, along
with nearly one-third of those who had tried fertilizer, and 13% of those who had adopted recommended
management techniques.

                                                                                                            47
       More recently, Kwadzo, Ansah, Kuwornu, and Amegashie (2010) surveyed farmers in

Ghana’s Eastern Region. They found that 83% of farmers had adopted improved maize, which

covered 78% of maize area planted in the region. Yet, they also found that the yield potential of

this adoption was not maximized because only 34% of farmers had also adopted nitrogen

fertilizer, and that only 30% of maize area received fertilizer. They also found that the likelihood

of adoption of improved maize was a positive function of both road access by farmers and the

number of visits by extension agents.


Policy Interventions


       Policy interventions – both macroeconomic and sectoral – were also found to play

important roles in shaping agricultural productivity patterns in the African cross-section. In this

regard, too, Ghana is representative.


       Ghana’s post-independence economic and policy experience is divided into two distinct

periods. Following its auspicious emergence into independence in 1957 as an essentially middle-

income country, Ghana’s economy spiraled gradually downward into chaos, reaching its nadir in

the crisis of 1983. With the adoption of its well-known Economic Recovery Program in that

year, the country entered an extended (and continuing) period of stable growth. The

macroeconomic environment that ended in crisis was characterized by high inflation, large fiscal

deficits, declining exports, and a black market premium on its currency that grew from 35% in

the early 1970s to 367% in the late 1970s, to nearly 1300% in the early 1980s (World Bank data

cited in Brooks, Croppenstedt, and Aggrey-Fynn, 2009).


       This history coincides cleanly with the sharp reversal of the partial productivity path

depicted in Figure 11, as well as with the transition to positive rates of TFP growth depicted in


                                                                                                    48
Figure 15. The potential connections between macroeconomic distortions and agricultural

productivity are direct. The dramatically overvalued exchange rates that characterized the late

1970s and early 1980s in Ghana directly undermined incentives for domestic producers of

import-competing crops (such as maize and rice), as well as for export-crop producers (cocoa).

The 90% real depreciation of the cedi between 1983 and 1987 helped to relieve prior

macroeconomic discrimination against agriculture, improving incentive on the output side, yet

also increasing the cost of imported inputs. In addition, economic reform included the

elimination of numerous input subsidies that had contributed to the unsustainable fiscal deficits.

Thus, for example, the removal of fertilizer subsidies in 1990 led to a 36% increase in the real

price of fertilizer, while the prices of insecticides and fungicides tripled in real terms with the

removal of their subsidies (Seini, 2002).


       Policy reforms at the sectoral level were less ambiguous in their benefits for Ghana’s

farmers. The period from independence to 1983 was characterized by high rates of agricultural

taxation – both indirect (arising largely from the overvalued exchange rate), and direct.

Subsequent to the liberalization of Ghana’s foreign exchange market and the devaluation of the

cedi in 1984, agricultural taxation was primarily direct taxation. The example of cocoa taxation

is notorious. The combination of an overvalued exchange rate and direct taxation in the form of

low producer prices paid by the monopsonistic Ghana Cocoa Board was such that by 1983,

farmers received about one-fifth of the FOB price of cocoa (Seini, 2002). With the subsequent

devaluation and the reform of agricultural policies that accompanied the Economic Reform

Program, cocoa farmers’ share of the FOB price had increased to 40% by 1995, and to 50% by

2001 (Brooks, Croppenstedt, and Aggrey-Fynn, 2009).




                                                                                                      49
       The nominal and relative rates of assistance (described above) provide a more general

indicator of agricultural policy in Ghana. Average rates of taxation (measured relative to

international prices) for agricultural tradables increased from approximately 17% in the early

1960s to 50% by the late 1970s. With the period of reform, these rates of taxation fell back to

17% by the late 1980s, and averaged just over 3% for 2000-04 (Brooks, Croppenstedt, and

Aggrey-Fynn, 2009). Comparing this indicator to similar measures for non-agriculture provides

an indicator of price discrimination of agriculture relative to non-agriculture (the “relative rate of

assistance”). From this broader perspective, as well, one finds substantial and increasing

discrimination against agriculture in the pre-reform period, with declining but persistent

discrimination against agriculture in the post-reform period. Relative discrimination against

agriculture averaged just over 6% in the early 1960s, increasing to approximately 25% in the late

1970s. While falling substantially during the period of economic reform, this indicator of

relative discrimination was still 8% for 2000-04.


       Figure 16 highlights the close association between the TFP growth path for Ghana’s crop

agriculture with the (non-parametrically smoothed) path of the relative rate of assistance for

agriculture versus non-agriculture in Ghana. As in the broader cross-section, the RRA remains

negative throughout the period (indicating relative discrimination against agriculture); yet, it is

clear from Figure 16 that reductions in this rate of discrimination were associated with increases

in the rate of TFP growth. The potential for this association to be explained by reverse

causation, in which improved TFP growth led to reduced discrimination against agriculture, is

strongly limited by the fact that the severity of Ghana’s economic crisis (and its multiple sectoral

and macroeconomic adjustment agreements with the IMF and World Bank) left the government

no choice but to implement its broad program of economic reforms.


                                                                                                      50
           This brief review demonstrates that agricultural productivity growth in Ghana broadly

reflects the cross-country experience of sub-Saharan Africa. The general pattern of post-

independence decline followed by renewed productivity growth since the 1980s is clear in

Ghana. The important roles of agricultural R&D expenditure and policy interventions seen in

the broader cross-section are also clear in Ghana.


Cautionary Note


           Even a brief country case study can serve the purpose of providing a cautionary note for

the interpretation of cross-country findings. In particular, Ghana’s agro-ecological diversity is

common in sub-Saharan Africa. From a technological perspective, this diversity greatly

complicates current efforts to promote a new green revolution for Africa. As seen in Figure 14(a

– d), different crops are specific to different agro-ecological zones; and for ubiquitous crops such

as maize, an improved variety that thrives in humid Evergreen zones of south-western Ghana

may be inappropriate for planting in the arid zones of the northern savanna. An analysis that

explains aggregate agricultural productivity at the country level based on total expenditures on

agricultural R&D inevitably obscures the fact that both expenditures and productivity growth are

likely to be quite unevenly distributed across the country.28 This diversity is even more obscured

when that aggregate country-level analysis is merely part of a broader cross-country panel data

set.


           Looking within a particular country also enables a closer examination of the sources and

quality of agricultural data. In the case of Ghana, Obirih-Opareh (2004) provides a critical

examination of the methods applied by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture in compiling its


28
     Indeed, regional disparities between Ghana’s northern and southern zones are a source of considerable tension.

                                                                                                                      51
national area and production data. He notes, for example, that most Ghanaian farmers do not

keep their own records of area and production. In addition, Obirih-Opareh notes that most

farmers mix numerous crops in a single field, further complicating the calculation of area and

yield of individual crops, and that many farms are not accessible by road. As a result, production

and area surveys must rely on limited and potentially poorly-measured samples. For export

crops, such as cocoa, the situation is better. Similarly, consumption data for imported inputs

such as chemical fertilizer, are also more reliable. Yet, Obirih-Opareh in general finds that the

limited ability of the Government to undertake annual nation-wide surveys of complex and

remote production systems often leads to statistical anomalies in the published data. He also

notes that different international and national sources of published data on agricultural area and

production in Ghana provide conflicting information. In this respect, too, Ghana is undoubtedly

not unique in sub-Saharan Africa.


   9. Conclusions
       Agricultural productivity growth in sub-Saharan Africa has been a qualified success.

Total factor productivity growth has increased rapidly since the early 1980s. By the early 2000s,

average annual TFP growth was roughly four times faster than it had been 25 years earlier. This

period of accelerated growth, however, followed nearly 20 years of declining rates of TFP

growth subsequent to independence in the early 1960s. Average agricultural TFP growth for

sub-Saharan Africa was 0.14% per year during 1960 – 84, and increased to 1.24% per year from

1985 – 2002. The average over this period was approximately 0.6% per year, which accounts for

36% of the increase in total crop output over this period.


       These highly aggregated results conceal substantial regional and country-level variation.

While regional TFP growth rates have tended to converge over time, and most rapid rate of TFP

                                                                                                    52
agricultural growth over the entire period 1960 – 2002 was in Southern Africa (1.25% per year),

while the slowest rate was in the Sahel (-1.17%). With the exception of East Africa, every

region’s TFP growth rate was higher between the years1985 – 2002 than it had been during 1960

– 1984.


       From among the long list of potential explanations for these trends, this paper considers

several leading contenders. Data constraints on individual explanations preclude a unified and

comprehensive decomposition of the productivity residual. It is clear, however, that

expenditures on agricultural R&D, along with the reform of macroeconomic and sectoral policies

shaping agricultural incentives have played a substantial role in explaining both the decline and

the rise in agricultural productivity found in this paper.


          The case study of Ghana clearly reflects these broader findings, and permits a more

nuanced view of their effects. The case study also provides a brief window into the vast

complexity of agricultural development in any single country, and in doing so, provides a

cautionary note for the interpretation of aggregate cross-country results.

Appendix 2 – Comparison of Baseline TFP Growth Rates with Alternative
Output Aggregates
       The main results presented in the paper are based on an output aggregate that includes

only crops, and that uses international prices that were calculated specifically for this African

sample to aggregate those crops. This appendix compares the baseline TFP growth rate

estimates derived from that crop aggregate output with two alternative output aggregates – one

using only crop output but using the FAOs global international prices for aggregation, and

another using total agricultural output (from FAO) – the sum of crop and livestock output –

aggregated with global FAO international prices. In the latter case, I include permanent pasture

land in the measure of land input.


       As Figure A1 illustrates, the resulting sets of TFP growth paths tell a broadly similar

story, though with different average TFP growth over the period.


Mean TFP Growth Rate Estimates:


      crop output with African international prices = 0.61%/yr

      crop output with FAO global international prices = 0.52%/yr

      total agricultural output with FAO global international prices = 0.74%/yr
