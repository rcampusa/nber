                                       ABSTRACT

In the U.S., Great Britain, and in many other countries, the gap between the demand and the supply

of human organs for transplantation is on the rise, despite the efforts of governments and health

agencies to promote donor registration. In some countries of continental Europe, however, cadaveric

organ procurement is based on the principle of presumed consent. Under presumed consent

legislation, a deceased individual is classified as a potential donor in absence of explicit opposition

to donation before death. This article analyzes the impact of presumed consent laws on donation

rates. For this purpose, we construct a dataset on organ donation rates and potential factors affecting

organ donation for 22 countries over a 10-year period. We find that while differences in other

determinants of organ donation explain much of the variation in donation rates, after controlling for

those determinants presumed consent legislation has a positive and sizeable effect on organ donation

rates.

I. Introduction

Chronic shortage of human organs for transplantation is one of the most pressing health

policy issues in many developed countries, including the U.S. and Great Britain. In recent

years, the persistent scarcity of organs for transplantation has invigorated the controversy

about the determinants of organ donation rates and the magnitude of their effects. With a

few exceptions, however, this debate has not been informed by systematic empirical

studies.1

           A particularly heated debate has arisen on the matter of legislative defaults on

cadaveric organ donation. In many countries, including the U.S., Great Britain, Germany

and Australia, cadaveric organ procurement is carried out under the informed consent

principle. Under an informed consent law, cadaveric organ extraction requires the explicit

consent of the donor before death, which is usually reflected on a donor registration card.

In contrast, in most of continental Europe, cadaveric organ procurement is based on the

principle of presumed consent. Under presumed consent legislation, a deceased

individual is classified as a potential donor in absence of explicit opposition to donation

before death. In practice, regardless of the type of legislation and of whether a deceased

individual is registered as a donor (or as a non-donor), in most countries families are

allowed to have the last word on whether organs will be donated. It has been argued,

however, that legislative defaults affect the decisions of potential donors and families.2

This article uses a panel of 22 countries over a 10-year period to analyze the impact of

presumed consent laws on donation rates. After controlling for other determinants of

cadaveric organ donation, we find that countries with presumed consent legislation have

higher organ donation rates. Moreover, we use the panel structure of our database to test

and reject the hypothesis that unmeasured (additive) determinants of organ donation rates

confound our empirical results.

         The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the main

facts highlighted in the previous literature on organ donation. Section III presents a

simple model that illustrates a way in which legislative defaults may affect organ

donation rates. The main empirical results of the article are given in section IV. Section V

concludes. Data sources and technical details are reported in the appendices.



II. The Organ Shortage Problem

In 2002, 6,679 patients died on the U.S. organ waiting lists before an organ became

available, roughly 18 per day (OPTN, 2003). In spite of media campaigns and other

attempts to promote donation, the supply of organs cannot keep up with the demand, and

the number of patients on waiting lists has been growing steadily during the last decade

(see Figure 1). One of the most frequently quoted explanations of the gap between the

supply and demand of organs is that the number of families that refuse to grant consent to

donation is still large. Approximately half of the families that are approached to request

donation refuse it in the U.S. and Great Britain, compared to around 20% in Spain and

around 30% in France.3 The U.S. and Great Britain are informed consent countries; Spain

and France are presumed consent countries.

         From an economist’s point of view, the shortage of cadaveric organs for

transplantation is an intriguing phenomenon. First, from a purely utilitarian perspective, it

represents the routine disposal of a highly valuable commodity, with the potential to save
3
  The figure for the U.S. comes from Nathan et al (2003) where it is taken from a variety of sources. For
Great Britain, this information appears in Barber et al (2003), it refers to the period of April 2003 to June
2003, and it was conveyed to us in personal communication by Phil Pocock from UK Transplant. For
Spain, we obtained the figure from ONT (2003) for the year 2002. Finally, for France, the figure comes
from EFG (2003); it refers to the year 2002 and to potential donors deceased from encephalic death.
                                                       2
lives. Moreover, survey data indicate a significant disagreement between preferences for

donation and donor card registration. In particular, results from a well-known survey

(Gallup, 1993) indicate that while most Americans favor organ donation (85%), and

would like to donate their organs after death (69%), only a few grant permission for

organ extraction on their driver’s license or an organ donor card (28%). Finally, in recent

years the question of how defaults influence economic choices has become an issue of

great interest among economists.4

         The severe shortage of human organs for transplantation in the U.S. has prompted

numerous proposals to alleviate this problem. In addition to presumed consent legislation,

proposals include financial incentives for donors (Becker and Elias, 2003),

xenotransplantation (transplantation of organs from a different species, usually pigs),

educational campaigns, organ exchange mechanisms for living donors with incompatible

recipients (Roth, Sonmez, and Unver, 2004), and preferential assignment of organs to

registered donors.5

         However, increasing donation consent rates from families is still viewed as the

most promising route to increase organ donation (UNOS, 2002). Many analysts and

health professionals believe that presumed consent legislation may play an important role

in shaping the decision of the families. In an international survey of transplant

professionals, 75% of the respondents supported presumed consent legislation, and 39%

identified this type of legislation as the most effective measure to increase donation rates,




4
  In a very influential study, Madrian and Shea (2001) found that for workers at a certain large U.S.
corporation the participation rate in the firm’s 401(k) retirement plan was higher under default enrollment
and many of the workers retained the default contribution rate and fund allocation. On the impact of
defaults on economic behavior, see also Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988), Choi et al (2003) and Thaler
and Sunstein (2003).

  See Oz et al (2003). In addition, Votruba (2001) has studied the efficient allocation of cadaveric organs.

the highest percentage among all measures considered in the survey, followed by

improved education with 18% (Oz et al, 2003).

        Several factors, beyond legislative defaults, have been hypothesized to affect

cadaveric donation rates in the medical literature. These factors include the level of

wealth, religious beliefs and social norms, education, and medical infrastructure. In

addition, most deceased donors are patients who have suffered irreversible brain injury

resulting in brain-death, but whose heartbeats are maintained through artificial

ventilation. The most common causes of death of these patients are traffic accidents and

cerebro-vascular diseases. Consequently, the mortality rates for these two causes of death

have been considered important determinants of organ donation rates.6

        In this article, we analyze the impact of presumed consent legislation on cadaveric

organ donation, after controlling for other factors that affect organ donation rates. An

important consideration regarding the analysis conducted here is that the content and

enforcement of presumed consent laws vary greatly across countries. In Austria, for

example, presumed consent legislation is applied rigorously, and deceased individuals are

considered potential donors in absence of explicit opposition before death, regardless of

the will of the family. In Spain, however, as in most presumed consent countries, even

when organ removal can be carried-out by law without the consent of the family, organ

coordinators in charge of the donation process do not authorize the extraction of organs

without family approval.

        Because registration is nominally free (in all countries to our knowledge) and

because families are allowed to make the final decision on whether or not organs will be

donated, it is not obvious that legislative defaults on cadaveric organ donation should

rates.

have an effect on donation rates. In the next section, we outline a simple model of donor

registration and family consent that can sustain equilibria with higher donation rates in

presumed consent countries than in informed consent countries.


III. A Simple Model of Presumed Consent

In this section, we outline a model of organ donation. Albeit simple, the model has two

important implications: (1) even if families make the final decision on organ donation,

presumed consent laws may result in notably higher consent and donation rates; (2)

registration rates may be low even if registration costs are low (and even if preferences

for donation are high in informed consent countries and low in presumed consent

countries).

        Let u D and u N be the utility levels realized in the donation and non-donation

states, respectively. We allow u D and u N to vary across individuals. Let v = u D − u N be

the utility gain derived from donation. Individuals observe their own v ’s. Families,

however, have imperfect information about the value of v for family members. The

information of families about v is given by the mean-preserving spread z = v + ε , where

ε is independent of v and has a log-concave density.7 The distributions of v and ε are

common knowledge. Individuals pay “contemplation costs” equal to c for registering as

donors (in informed consent countries) or non-donors (in presumed consent countries).8, 9

For simplicity, we assume c to be fixed and known to everybody.


7
  Log-concavity is a non-parametric regularity condition often used in information economics. Log-
concavity is satisfied by most common distributions, such as the normal, uniform, logistic, and Laplace
distributions. See An (1998) for additional information on log-concavity.
8
  Arguably, it would be more appropriate to refer to c as “registration costs” rather than “contemplation
costs”. However, we adopt the term “contemplation costs” in accordance with the medical literature, where
the discrepancy between donation preferences and donor registration is habitually attributed to the
perception that donor registration is often avoided because it forces potential donors to confront the
prospect of their own death (see, e.g., AMA, 1994).
                                                    5
         This model can be represented as an extensive form game. First, individuals

decide whether or not to register after observing v and the type of legislation. Then,

families decide whether or not to consent to donation, after observing the type of

legislation, the registration decision of the individuals, and the value of z . Both potential

donors and families choose their actions in order to maximize the expected utility of

potential donors. Given the type of legislation, a pair of strategies in this game consists of

two functions: the first function maps v on the registration decision of potential donors;

the second function maps z and the registration decision of potential donors on the

donation consent decisions of the families.

Equilibrium in an informed consent country. Consider a solution in which individuals

register as donors if v ∈ V I , with v > 0 for all v ∈ VI . Families do not override the

decision of deceased potential donors because, conditional on registration, v > 0 .10 For

deceased potential donors who did not register, families evaluate E[v | v ∉ VI , v + ε = z ] .

Log-concavity of ε and independence between v and ε guarantee that v and z are

affiliated random variables.11 By the properties of affiliated random variables

E[v | v ∉ VI , v + ε = z ] is a non-decreasing function of z . Therefore, there exists some z I

such that families of non-registered potential donors comply with the informed consent



9
  In this model, registration can be regarded as a costly signaling device of donation preferences from the
individual to the family. Instead of (or in addition to) signing a donor card, some individuals may
communicate their preferences regarding organ donation directly to their relatives before death. However,
survey data have detected a widespread reluctance to discuss organ donation issues with family members
(see, for example, Gallup, 1993). Given that organ donor cards lack legal status and/or are not enforced in
most countries, we conjecture that the role that organ donor cards may play in practice is to provide a
channel to signal donation preferences to family members and organ procurement agencies, that does not
require engaging in an active discussion with family members about death and organ donation preferences.
See also Bryne and Thompson (2001) on the use of registration as a signal.
10
   In reality, families’ own views on organ donation may sometimes influence consent decisions. However,
it has been documented that families who know that their relatives wished to donate their organs after death
overwhelmingly consent to donation (see Siminoff et al, 2001.)
11
   See Appendix A for the proof, and Krishna (2002) for more on affiliated random variables.

default if z ≤ z I . For simplicity of the exposition, we will assume that z I is an interior

point in the support of z .

         Consequently, the expected utility of a non-registered potential donor in an

informed consent country is u N Pr( z ≤ z I | v) + u D Pr( z > z I | v) . The expected utility of a

registered donor in an informed consent country is u D − c . Therefore, an individual

becomes a registered donor if v Pr( z ≤ z I | v) > c , which is consistent with the assumption

that all the elements of VI are positive. Notice that registered donors are a subset of those

individuals with v > c .

         An equilibrium is characterized in this model by

                                    V I = { v : v Pr( z ≤ z I | v) > c },

for the registration decision of the individuals, and

                               E[ v | v Pr( z ≤ z I | v) < c, v + ε = z I ] = 0,

for the donation consent decision of the families.12

Equilibrium in a presumed consent country. Under a presumed consent default the

analysis is analogous. Consider a solution in which individuals register as non-donors if

v ∈ VP , with v < 0 for all v ∈ VP . Families do not override the decision of deceased

potential donors because, conditional on registration, v < 0 . For deceased potential

donors who did not register, families evaluate E[v | v ∉ VP , v + ε = z ] . Because this

expectation is a monotonic function of z , there exists some z P such that families of non-




12
  The concept of equilibrium is Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. For simplicity, assume that ε has full
support on the real line. Then, every information set is on the equilibrium path, and Bayes’ Rule applies
everywhere. Families update their beliefs using Bayes’ Rule, and the actions of potential donors are optimal
given families’ strategies.
                                                     7
registered potential donors comply with the presumed consent default if z ≥ z P . We will

consider the case in which z P is an interior point in the support of z .

           Using the same analysis as for the informed consent case, it is easy to show that

an individual will register as a non-donor if v Pr( z ≥ z P | v) < −c , which is consistent with

the assumption that all the elements of V P are negative. Notice that registered non-donors

are a subset of those individuals with v < −c .

           A solution to this problem is given by

                                     V P = { v : v Pr( z ≥ z P | v) < −c },

for the registration decision of the individuals, and

                               E[ v | v Pr( z ≥ z P | v) > −c, v + ε = z P ] = 0,

for the donation consent decision of the families.

Implications of the model. It can be shown that if the density of ε is log-concave, then,

for any given z I and z P , the sets VI and V P are either intervals or empty sets.13

Figure 2 shows an example of equilibrium strategies for the case when VI and V P are

non-empty intervals in equilibrium. In an informed consent country, individuals register

as donors if v ∈ V I , and families consent to donation if either the deceased potential

donor registered or if z > z I . In a presumed consent country, individuals register as non-

donors if v ∈ VP , and families consent to donation if the deceased potential donor did not

register and z ≥ z P .

           Consider first the implications of the model under informed consent legislation.

Because registration generates a contemplation cost, c > 0 , and because families have

some information about v , not all individuals with v > 0 register as donors. Individuals

13
     See Appendix A for the proof.
                                                       8
with positive but low v do not register because the contemplation cost is high relative to

the utility derived from donation. Moreover, individuals with positive but low v may not

register even if v > c , provided that the probability that z > z I is large enough.

Individuals with high v may not register either, because the probability that for them

z ≤ z I is very small. Only individuals with intermediate positive values of v , those with

v ∈ V I , will register.14, 15 In absence of registration costs, however, all the individuals with

v > 0 would register as donors. The combination of registration costs and the fact that

families have additional information about the preferences for donation of family

members reduces registration rates in informed consent countries. The same conclusion

holds also for presumed consent countries.

         A second important implication of the model is that legislative defaults on

cadaveric organ donations may influence family consent rates for non-registered potential

donors. Consider the setting in which both ε and v are symmetrically distributed with

respect to zero. Then, it is easy to prove that z P = − z I and VP = −VI . Using the fact that

z and v are affiliated, it can be easily seen that Pr( z ≥ z P | v ∉ VP ) ≥ Pr( z ≥ z I | v ∉ VI ) .

That is, under presumed consent, family consent rates for non-registered individuals are

equal to or larger than under informed consent. At an intuitive level, informed consent

laws allow individuals with strong preferences for donation to separate. As a result,

families in informed consent countries infer that non-registered individuals had weak

preferences for donation on average, and do not consent unless the indicator z is large.

14
   In this sense, the model outlined in this section is related to some recent developments regarding non-
monotonic strategies in signaling models. See, e.g., Feltovich, Harbaugh, and To (2002).
15
   If the support of v is bounded, all individuals with strong preferences for donation may register in
equilibrium. That would be the case also if individuals with strong preferences for donation derived a
sufficiently large consumption value from registration or if they incurred sufficiently lower contemplation
costs. For simplicity and because the substantive implications of the model are identical, we do not follow
these potential extensions here.
                                                     9
In contrast, in presumed consent countries, individuals with strong aversion to donation

are allowed to separate. Families in presumed consent countries infer that non-registered

individuals had strong preferences for donation on average, and consent to donation

unless the indicator z is small.16

         Higher family consent rates for non-registered potential donors in conjunction

with low registration rates tend to generate equilibria in which presumed consent

legislation produces higher donation rates than informed consent legislation. To see this,

consider the following numerical example. Let v and ε be distributed as normal

independent variables with mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1. Let c , the

registration cost, be equal to 0.25. It is easy to show that, for these values of the

parameters, z I = 0.4222 , and VI = [0.5631,1.2815] define a pair of equilibrium strategies

under informed consent legislation. Similarly, z P = −0.4222 , and VP = [−1.2815,

−0.5631] define a pair of equilibrium strategies under presumed consent legislation.17

For this example, registration rates are around 18% under either presumed or informed

legislation, even when around 40% of the individuals have v > c (or v < −c ). In addition,

the 18% registration rate is much lower than the 50% rate that would arise if the model

did not incorporate a registration cost. These equilibria generate donation rates of around

44% under informed consent legislation and around 56% under presumed consent

legislation, with a difference of around 12 percentage points.

         The model described in this section shows that, as a result of a signal-extraction

problem, presumed consent defaults may generate higher donation rates than informed

consent defaults. However, the model is not unambiguous in this conclusion: it is
16
   In reality of course, individuals are always able to separate by communicating preferences for donation
directly to their families. However, if the cost of discussing organ donation with family members is high
relative to registration costs, then the qualitative predictions of the model still apply.
17
   See Appendix A for the solution of the model under normality.
                                                    10
possible to find examples in which presumed consent laws have zero or negative effect

on donation rates.18 Moreover, signal-extraction is not the only channel through which

legislative defaults may affect organ donation.19 Ultimately, whether or not presumed

consent laws have an effect on donation rates is an empirical issue. In the next section,

we use data on organ donation rates, legislative defaults on cadaveric organ donation, as

well as other factors affecting cadaveric organ donation, for a panel of countries to

investigate the effect of presumed consent legislation on organ donation rates.



IV. Empirical Analysis

Despite the worldwide concern about organ shortage for transplantation, few empirical

studies have aimed to identify and measure the factors that influence donation rates. The

reason may be, in part, that the data required to conduct these studies are not readily

available.20 This is particularly true concerning information on legislative defaults on

organ donation for different countries.

         For the empirical analysis in this section, we collected information on legislative

defaults for a sample of 36 countries. Figure 3 shows donation rates and type of

legislation in 2002 for the 36 countries in our sample. Presumed consent countries seem

18
   For example, if most individuals have strong preferences for organ donation and families observe an
uninformative indicator of donation preferences, a presumed consent law may create a separating
equilibrium in which the few individuals with strong aversion for donation register and do not donate. In
the same scenario, an informed consent law may create a pooling equilibrium, in which individuals with
strong aversion to donation are not able to separate.
19
   Data from laboratory experiments and observational studies have provided evidence of the existence of a
preference to maintain the status-quo that influences individual decision making (see, for example,
Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988). If a preference to comply with the status-quo exists in the context of
organ donation, that by itself will create a direct link between legislative defaults on organ donations and
organ donation rates. Moreover, some authors have suggested that presumed consent laws may affect the
consent decisions of the families because they change the framing of the request of consent to the families,
by creating a strong expectation that consent will be granted (see, for example, Cameron and Forsythe,
2001.)
20
   As Cameron and Forsythe (2001) put it: “… the quantity of hard data on donation remains small, and
what is available is often not readily accessible. Neither has all the information been assembled in one
place and correlated …”
                                                    11
to have higher donation rates than informed consent countries. However, the connection

between legislative defaults and donation rates is not completely unequivocal. Figure 3

also shows that one country, Spain, has higher donation rates than any other country. This

fact is well-documented in the medical literature, where the “Spanish model” of organ

procurement has been studied extensively.21

        For 22 countries in our sample and the period 1993-2002 we obtained information

on a number of factors that are thought to affect donation rates, such as per capita GDP,

health expenditures per capita, religious beliefs, the legislative system, and the number of

deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents and cerebro-vascular diseases. We assembled

our dataset using a variety of sources, which are detailed in Appendix B.22

        In this section, we use regression analysis to study how presumed consent

legislation is related to cadaveric organ donation rates, after controlling for other

determinants of organ donation.

        Table I shows descriptive statistics for the sample of countries used for our

regression analysis. Column (1) shows means and standard deviations for the entire

sample. Fifty-six percent of the observations in our sample are for presumed consent

countries. Columns (2) and (3) show means and standard deviations for presumed

consent and informed consent countries, respectively. The last column contains the




21
   The Spanish national transplant organization (ONT) is considered the most effective organ procurement
organization in the world. Several countries, including Australia and the UK have considered adopting the
Spanish organ procurement system, often referred to as the “Spanish model”. The “Spanish model” is based
on: (i) a system of independent transplant coordination teams, which request consent from families of
potential donors so the burden of organ procurement is taken away from transplant surgeons and treating
physicians; (ii) a hospital reimbursement policy, which compensates hospitals for organ procurement costs;
and (iii) a multi-layered network at the national, regional, and hospital level, which coordinates and
manages organ procurement activities. See Matesanz (2001) for details.

   To reduce heterogeneity in social norms, we restricted our sample to Western Christian countries
(Catholic or Protestant). Appendix B describes our sample selection criteria in detail. Appendix C contains
information on legislative defaults on organ donation rates for the 36 countries considered in Figure 3.

            It has been pointed out in the medical literature that donation rates are not

markedly higher in presumed consent countries (see, e.g., Cameron and Forsythe, 2001).

Table I shows that in our sample, informed consent countries have on average 14.19

cadaveric donors per million population per year. Presumed consent countries have on

average 17.29 cadaveric donors per million population per year, 3.10 more than informed

consent countries. This difference, however, is not significant at conventional test levels.

In addition, relative to informed consent countries, presumed consent countries have

lower GDP per capita, and lower health expenditures per capita, although again none of

these differences is significant at conventional levels. Presumed consent countries are

predominantly Catholic, while informed consent laws are the rule in countries with a

legislative system based on common law. Finally, the combined mortality rate in motor

vehicle accidents (MVA) and cerebro-vascular diseases (CVD) is significantly higher in

presumed consent countries.

            Table II reports estimated coefficients for the regression of the log of cadaveric

donation rates on an indicator of a presumed consent legislative default and other

predictors of donation rates.23 Column (1) shows that, on average, donation rates are

roughly 16% higher in presumed consent countries. However, this difference is not

significant at conventional test levels. Some analysts have argued that the positive

difference in donation rates between presumed and informed consent countries may be

due to the outlier effect of Spain, which maintains presumed consent legislation. In

column (2) we repeat the regression from column (1), this time excluding Spain from our

     Standard errors are clustered at the country level. All specifications include year fixed-effects.

sample. As expected, the estimated coefficient on the presumed consent legislation

indicator decreases relative to column (2) and remains statistically indistinguishable from

zero at conventional test levels. Thus, our data support the view in the medical literature

that donation rates in presumed consent countries are not much higher on average,

relative to informed consent countries.

        However, as shown in Table I, the distributions of some potential determinants of

donation rates differ between presumed and informed consent countries. In columns (3)-

(8) of Table II, we include in the regression the other determinants of organ donation

considered in Table I. In columns (3) and (4) we include measures of wealth and medical

expenditures.24 In both cases, the coefficient on the presumed consent variable indicates

roughly 26% higher donation rates in presumed consent countries. This difference is

significant at conventional test levels. In columns (5)-(8) we report the results for

regression models that include additional variables that measure potentially relevant

country characteristics: religious beliefs, whether the country has a common law or a civil

law system, and the number of deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents and cerebro-

vascular diseases. In all cases, including these variables in the regression does not change

substantially the value of the coefficient on the presumed consent indicator. This is true

even though, as shown in column (6), the variables considered in our regression models

explain almost one-third of the variance of the dependent variable ( R 2 = .3216 ). In

column (8), we show that when other determinants of cadaveric donation rates are

accounted for, the coefficient on the presumed consent variable is still large and

significant even if we exclude Spain from the sample.



24
   The two variables are highly collinear, with health expenditures representing a roughly constant 9%-10%
fraction of GDP.
                                                   14
         On the whole, the results of Table II show that, when other determinants of

donation rates are accounted for, presumed consent countries have roughly 25%-30%

higher donation rates than informed consent countries. Moreover, this result is robust to

changes in the regression specification.25

         A potential concern about the analysis in this section is that our results will be

biased if unobserved determinants of cadaveric organ donation rates are correlated with

the passage of presumed consent laws. In particular, it could be argued that countries

where the population have a strong preference for organ donation would be inclined to

enact presumed consent laws. In that situation, societal preferences towards organ

donation would induce a positive association between presumed consent laws and organ

donation rates, and the coefficient on presumed consent in our regressions would be

biased upwards. Fixed effects estimators for panel data are often used to control for time-

invariant (additive) confounders. In our sample, legislative defaults on cadaveric organ

donation rarely change over time. Therefore, we cannot include country fixed effects in

our regression specifications and still identify the coefficient on the presumed consent

variable.26 However, the absence of time-invariant confounders can be tested in

regressions (3) to (8) of Table II, because these regressions include time-varying

variables whose coefficients are identified in a specification with country fixed effects. If

country effects are correlated with the presence of presumed consent laws, the

coefficients on all the variables in our regressions will be biased in the pooled OLS

specification, but not in the fixed-effects specification. We use the difference in the

25
   In addition to the results reported in Table II, we carried out a specification analysis in which we
considered additional variables measuring education (e.g., average years of schooling of adults) and
medical infrastructure (e.g., number of hospitals beds per capita). In all cases, the coefficients on the added
variables were not statistically significant and their inclusion left the presumed consent coefficient virtually
unchanged.
26
   The only country that experiences a change of legislation in our sample is Sweden, which goes from an
informed consent system to a presumed consent system in 1996.
                                                      15
coefficients on the time-varying regressors between the pooled OLS and the fixed-effects

specifications to test the hypothesis that country effects are uncorrelated with the

presence of presumed consent laws.27 P-values are reported in Table II for regressions (3)

to (8). Our specification test does not detect compelling evidence against the null

hypothesis of absence of confounding country effects.

        Although our specification test produces encouraging results about the validity of

our estimates, it should be clear that the statistical power of our test will be low against

deviations from the null hypothesis that affect mainly the estimated coefficient on the

presumed consent law, but not the coefficients on the time-varying regressors. An

alternative approach to the potential endogeneity of presumed consent laws is to include

in our regressions a proxy for societal preferences towards organ donation. We follow

this approach in Table III, where we use annual blood donations (per capita) as an

indicator of societal preferences towards organ donation.28 Columns (1) and (2) of Table

III reproduce the specifications in columns (6) and (7) of Table II, but this time including

the logarithm of annual blood donations per 1,000 population as an additional regressor.

As expected, donations of blood are positively associated with donations of organs.

However, the estimated coefficients on the presumed consent variable increase relative to

Table II. This is at odds with the notion that nations with stronger preferences towards

organ donation will be inclined to enact presumed consent laws. In fact, columns (3) and

(4) of Table III show that social preferences towards organ donation proxied as the log of

blood donations per 1,000 population have, if anything, a negative correlation with the

presence of presumed consent laws (although the coefficients on the log of blood

27
  This test is implemented as a generalized Hausman specification test (see White, 1996).
28
  Arguably, donations of blood are motivated by the same philanthropic considerations as organ donations.
Other indicators of the propensity to donate, like the fraction of the population who do unpaid work for
voluntary organizations, produced similar results.
                                                   16
donations per 1,000 population in columns (3) and (4) are not significant at conventional

test levels). Overall, the robustness analysis reported in Table III fails to detect any

evidence that the empirical results in Table II are confounded by cross-country

differences in social norms towards organ donation.

       On the whole, our empirical results suggest that presumed consent laws may

greatly increase the supply of cadaveric organs for transplantation. However, it would be

erroneous to interpret our results as evidence that presumed consent is the sometimes-

portrayed silver-bullet for organ shortage. First, it is unlikely that a 25% to 30% increase

in cadaveric donation would eliminate completely the organ shortage problem in some

countries, like the U.S., although it would help considerably to alleviate it. To see this

assume that percentage increases in cadaveric donations translate roughly to percentage

increases in cadaveric transplantation. Table IV in column (1) shows the range for the

number of additional transplantations that a 25% to 30% increase in cadaveric

transplantations would have represented in the U.S. for the period of 1995-2002. For the

same period, columns (2) and (3) show the yearly change in the number of patients on

waiting lists and the yearly number of deaths on the waiting list, respectively. Columns

(4) to (6) show the same variables for the U.K. and the period 1994-2001. The figures in

Table IV suggest that a 25% to 30% increase in cadaveric transplantation could

potentially close the gap between the demand and the supply of organs in the U.K., but

not in the U.S. Moreover, it seems likely that an increase in the supply of cadaveric

organs would be followed by a reduction in the supply of organs from living donors.

Substitution of organs from living donors would attenuate the effect of an increase in




                                            17
cadaveric organs on the size of the waiting lists.29 Finally, many questions remain

unanswered about how to implement a legislative change of this type. Although recent

studies have reported successful transitions to a presumed consent default (see, for

example, Michielsen, 1996), it seems likely that in some countries the imposition of a

presumed consent law, without building first sufficient social support, could generate an

adverse response towards organ procurement efforts.



V. Conclusions


Previous studies have pointed out that, on average, presumed consent countries do not

produce significantly higher organ donation rates. Moreover, several authors have

hypothesized that this lack of correlation is produced by the fact that presumed consent

laws are rarely enforced and that, in practice, family consent is always required before

organs are extracted.

         In this article, we argue that legislative defaults on organ donation may affect the

consent decisions of the families, even if they are not enforced. First, we use a simple

model to illustrate how presumed consent laws may affect organ donation rates. In

addition, using a panel of countries, we show that, once other determinants of organ

donation are accounted for, cadaveric donation rates are 25% to 30% higher in presumed

consent countries. The magnitude of this estimate does not vary much across the different

specifications of our empirical model. Furthermore, using the panel structure of our data

we are able to reject the presence of additive fixed effects.


29
  This substitution effect is difficult to quantify because, to our knowledge, there do not exist estimates of
the elasticity of substitution between living donor organs and cadaveric organs. In addition, it is possible
that a higher availability of organs would be followed by an increase in the number of referrals to the
waiting lists.
                                                      18
       Health professionals and organ donation activists in the U.S., Great Britain, and

several other countries have proposed changing legislative defaults on organ donation to

presumed consent. The results of this article suggest that presumed consent laws may

alleviate organ shortages. Further research is needed, however, to understand better how

societies perceive and respond to legislative changes of this nature.

Appendix A: Technical Details

Affiliated random variables

Lemma 1: Suppose that the density of ε is log-concave and that ε and v are
independent. Let z = v + ε . Then, z and v are affiliated, that is, for all z ≥ z and v ≥ v

                              f z ,v ( z , v) f z ,v ( z , v ) ≤ f z ,v ( z , v) f z ,v ( z , v ),

where f z ,v is the density of ( z, v) .


Proof: Because ε and v are independent, we obtain

                                         f z ,v ( z, v) = f ε ( z − v) f v (v).

Therefore, z and v are affiliated if and only if

                              f ε ( z − v) f ε ( z − v ) ≤ f ε ( z − v) f ε ( z − v ).

In other words, the density f ε is of Pólya frequency of order 2, which is equivalent to
log-concavity of f ε (see An, 1998).

Lemma 2: Suppose that z = v + ε , where ε is independent of v and has a log-concave
density. Let z I , z P , and c be real numbers with c > 0 . Then,

             VI = { v : v Pr( z ≤ z I | v) > c } and VP = { v : v Pr( z ≥ z P | v) < −c }

are either intervals or empty sets.

Proof: It can be shown that log-concave densities have convex supports (An, 1998). Let
g (v) = v Fε ( z I − v) . Notice that g (0) = 0 . In addition lim v→∞ g (v) = 0 , because log-
concave densities have at most exponential tails (An, 1998). The right-hand-side
derivative of g (v) is Fε ( z I − v) − v fε ( zI − v) . Notice that Fε ( z I − v) − v fε ( zI − v)
converges to one when v → −∞ , and it converges to zero when v → ∞ . If the support of
ε is bounded from below, Fε ( z I − v) − v fε ( z I − v) is equal to zero if z I − v is to the left
of the support of ε . If the support of ε is bounded from above, Fε ( z I − v) − v fε ( zI − v)
is equal to one if z I − v is to the right of the support of ε . If z I − v belongs to the
support of ε , then Fε ( z I − v) − v fε ( zI − v) has the same sign as Fε ( z I −v) / fε ( z I −v) − v .
By the properties of log-concave densities, the ratio Fε ( z I − v ) / fε ( z I − v) is a non-
increasing function of v . Thus, Fε ( z I − v) / fε ( z I − v) − v is decreasing, so the function


                                                             23
g (v) is quasi-concave. Now, the result for VI follows from the properties of quasi-
concave functions. The proof for VP is analogous.


Solution of the model under normality

Assume that v~N (µ v ,σ v 2 ) and ε ~N (0,σ ε 2 ) . Consider first the informed consent
scenario:

                                                           ⎛ ε  z −v ⎞         ⎛ z −v⎞

where Φ represents the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal
distribution. For this case, the set of individuals registering under informed consent

                                       f v |v + ε = z =                        f v (v ) = ε                    ,

Appendix B: Data Sources and Sample Selection

International data on cadaveric organ donation rates come from the Spanish National

Organ Transplantation Organization (ONT, 2003) and the Transplant Procurement

Management Organization (TPM, 2003). Disaggregated data for the U.K. and Ireland

were provided by Kerri Burbidge from UK Transplant. Data on organ donation for the

U.S. come from OPTN (2003). Data on organ donation rates for New Zealand come from

ANZOD (2003). For the U.S., data on cadaveric transplantation, size of waiting lists, and

number of deaths on waiting lists come from OPTN (2003). For the U.K., data on

cadaveric transplantation and size of waiting lists come from UK Transplant (2003), and

data on deaths on waiting lists was provided to us by Kerri Burbidge from UK

Transplant.

       Data on legislative defaults on cadaveric organ donations were compiled from a

variety of sources by consulting the legal literature. In some instances, when legislative

data for a particular country could not be found in the literature or the information was

ambiguous, we contacted the country agency in charge of organ donation management to

request this information. Detailed information about legislative defaults on cadaveric

organ donation is presented in Appendix C.

       We obtained data on GDP, population, health expenditures, and number of

hospital beds from the World Bank Development Indicators (World Bank, 2003a).

Schooling data appear in the World Bank Education Statistics (World Bank, 2003b). The

number of deaths caused by traffic accidents and cerebro-vascular failures were compiled

from the World Health Organization Mortality Database (World Health Organization,

2003). We obtained data on religious beliefs and legal systems from CIA (2003). Data on

blood donation refer to the year 2001. For Europe and North America these data come

                                             27
from FIODS (2004). Data on blood donation for New Zealand was provided by Paul

Hayes from the New Zealand Blood Service. Data on the fraction of the population doing

unpaid work for voluntary organizations come from the World Values Survey (Inglehart

et al, 2004).

        For the 36 countries listed in Appendix C and in Figure 3 and for the year 2002,

we obtained data on cadaveric organ donation rates and legislative defaults on cadaveric

organ donation. Fourteen of the 36 countries were discarded for the regression analysis in

section IV. Countries were discarded for several reasons. First, to reduce heterogeneity in

social norms we restricted our sample to Western Christian countries (Catholic and

Protestant). This eliminated from our sample Bulgaria, Greece, Israel, Japan, Romania,

and Turkey. Some countries, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania,

and Romania, were discarded also because of data availability problems. An additional

reason to discard Japan was that heart-beating cadaveric donation was outlawed in Japan

until recently. We also discarded small countries with less than one million population,

like Cyprus and Luxembourg. We discarded Switzerland, because, although this country

has an informed consent default at the federal level, legislation on organ donation

defaults varies by region. Finally, some countries produce extremely modest levels of

organ transplant activity, which, in some cases, may be caused by lack of transplantation

facilities. If capacity constraints limit the transplantation activity in a country at a very

low level, legislative defaults are unlikely to influence donation rates, because organs will

not be used for transplantation. Including in our sample countries with capacity

constraints on organ transplantation would bias down our estimate of the effect of

presumed consent laws in countries where capacity constraints are not binding. For this

reason, we discarded those countries which never reached a rate of 20 kidney transplants

                                             28
per million population per year. These countries are: Croatia, Greece, Slovak Republic,

Romania, and Turkey. In principle, this could create a bias in our estimates if the cause of

low transplant rates in those countries is a low cadaveric organ donation rate. However,

we chose the rate of kidney transplants to select our sample because kidneys can be

procured from living donors if transplant facilities are available. In practice, capacity, and

not cadaveric donation, is likely to be the binding constraint for countries with fewer than

20 kidney transplants per million population per year. In the U.S., for example,

transplants of kidneys procured from living donors routinely surpass the 20 pmp rate. In

Cyprus, where cadaveric donations are almost non-existent, the rate of kidney transplants

from living donors goes consistently beyond the 55 pmp mark.

       The 22 countries used in our regression analysis are: Australia, Austria, Belgium,

Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy,

The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,

United Kingdom, and the United States.

used mainly as a non-donor registry.

Switzerland: Informed consent country by Federal Order of 22 March 1996. However,
the country is divided in cantons that have their own legislation. The following cantons
have presumed consent legislation: Appenzell (laws of 1974 and 1992), Argovie (1987),
Bale-Campagne (1988), Bale-Ville (1981), Berne (1984), Geneva (1996), Grisons (1984),
Lucerne (1981), Neuchatel (1995), Nidwald (1981), St-Gall (1979), Turgovia (1985),
Valais (1996), Vaud (1985), and Zurich (1991).

Turkey: Presumed consent country by Law No 2238 of June 3, 1979. In practice, written
authorization from families has to be obtained before organ extraction.

United Kingdom: Informed consent country by The Human Tissue Act 1961 and the
The Human Organ Transplants Act 1989. Has a donor registry since 1994.

United States: Informed consent country by National Organ Transplants Act of 1984.
There are donor registries in 14 states; donor registries are being considered in other
states.
