                     Search and Deliberation in International Exchange:
                             Learning from Multinational Trade
                       About Lags, Distance Effects, and Home Bias




                          In this paper we compare the responsiveness of U.S.

        multinational enterprises’ intrafirm trade to U.S. arm’s length trade to changes

        in the real exchange rate. We do for three reasons. One aim is to shed new

        light on the long debated question of whether MNEs’ trade responses are

        stickier than arm’s length trade.1 Existing views on intrafirm trade fall in two

        camps: one that believes intrafirm trade is or ought to be no different from

        arm’s length trade,2 and one that believes that such trade is less responsive than

        arm’s length trade.3 Proponents of the latter view predict slow and small

        responses for MNEs because intrafirm behavior, they argue, reflects

        hierarchical or command behavior and is not likely to be as sensitive to market

        considerations as arm’s length transactions. In contrast, we will argue that

        MNEs ought to respond faster and more vigorously, not because of special

        access to cross-border production capacity, but rather because of information

advantages arising out of multinational operations.

(1992). Gerald Helleiner (1981: 3), has written that intrafirm trade "can and usually do[es] take place
in consequence of central commands rather than in response to price signals..." Likewise, Little
(1986: 46) has argued that "Because intra-firm trade is potentially 'managed' trade...the pace or size
of its adjustment" differs "from that of trade between unaffiliated firms." Goldsbrough (1981: 573)
argues that trade flows generated by the location decisions of a firm with large fixed investments in
several countries may not respond as rapidly to shifts in relative prices as those of an independent
producer...unconcerned with the effect of its actions on the profitability of overseas affiliates.



                                                  3
       Our second aim is to suggest some microfoundations for three extensively

documented macro patterns that have puzzled international economists. The first

puzzle pertains to the presence of long lags in trade responses to exchange rates. Even

when exchange rate changes cause large and “permanent” shifts in relative prices, the

geographic distribution of economic activity shifts only slowly and hesitatingly.

Established buyer-supplier relationships appear sticky and switching is lagged. How

might we explain these considerable lags and, moreover, why when national incomes

rise or fall, does international trade adjust both without long lags and more vigorously?

       The second puzzle pertains to the disproportionately large dampening effect

that physical distance appears to have on bilateral trade.         The puzzle, as many

observers have noted, is that distance effects appear to be far greater than what might

be explained by transport costs alone. The third puzzle, and the one that has sparked

the most interest recently, pertains to the “home bias” in international trade and

finance. One well-known study (McCallum, 1995) examined the trade effects of the

seemingly “innocuous” U.S.-Canada border on the grounds that “if borders didn’t

matter” this one must provide the prototypical case.4 But, after controlling for market

size and comparative advantage, this study found that in 1988, the year of the data,

Canadians were 22 times more likely to trade with fellow Canadians than with persons

equally distant but residing in the United States. Other studies (e.g., Wei, 1996) have

reported smaller quantitative effects, but they too support the consensus that there is a

marked home bias in economic activity.

       While these empirical quandaries have stimulated new bouts of economic

theorizing, unifying and satisfactory explanations have eluded economists. Paul R.

                                             4
Krugman and Richard Baldwin (1987) have suggested that economists’ macro models

lack plausible micro foundations. Echoing these views, trade theorist Gene Grossman

(1998: 31) avers that, “[These macro patterns lead] me to believe that something is

missing from our trade models, be they of the Hecksher-Ohlin or Dixit-Stiglitz-

Krugman variety. It seems we need models where distance (and common polity, and

common language, and common culture) play more of a role. I suspect this is a model

with imperfect information, where familiarity declines rapidly with distance...”

       In the course of addressing our first question about the relative speed and vigor

with which MNEs respond to exchange rate changes, we will, in this chapter, suggest

a tentative hypothesis that resonates with the preceding views and offers some

plausible micro foundations to the puzzling macro patterns just described.             The

hypothesis is built around a line of generalization that can be sketched as follows: In

pursuing cross-border economic opportunities, firms engage in a process of search and

deliberation. Search refers to acts involved in identifying potential exchange partners,

and deliberation refers to acts involved in assessing their reliability and trustworthiness.

Search grows more important the more spatially dispersed economic opportunities

become, and deliberation grows more important the more costly it becomes to reverse

allocative actions or their effects. In many instances, institutions--such as organized

markets and rating agencies--and innovations--such as advertising and warranties--

have emerged to relieve the problems of search and deliberation, and, in these

instances, firms can readily pursue the economic opportunities they perceive.

       However, in international trade and investment such institutions and

innovations don’t exist or don’t work well enough. Search and deliberation remain

problematic and firms, because of the resulting information insufficiency, exhibit a




                                             5
great deal of stickiness and lagged (or progressive) adjustment in responding to

apparent cross-border economic opportunities. In these circumstances, firms often

turn to their business and social networks, because, frequently, those networks can

help alleviate problems of search and deliberation and enable firms to uncover and

exploit cross-border economic opportunities.

       If this line of argumentation is valid, then, by extension, in the domain of

international economic exchange, firms that are embedded in well-elaborated social

and business networks will tend to enjoy information advantages by virtue of which

they will adapt and respond more proficiently to new economic opportunities. In

particular, relative to their purely domestic counterparts, MNEs will tend to be

embedded abroad in better-elaborated social networks. This latter characteristic ought

to provide MNEs with relative information advantages (vis-à-vis the problems of

search and deliberation), and, in turn, on the back of these information advantage

MNEs ought to exhibit speedier and more vigorous import responses.

       In the sections that follow, we will flesh out the concepts of search and

deliberation, and discuss, within that frame, multinationals’ potential network

advantages. In the subsequent section, we will contrast empirically multinational and

non-multinational enterprises’ international trade responses to exchange rate changes.

To anticipate, after controlling for industry, partner country, income effects, and

certain other variables, we find that relative to arm’s length trade, MNEs’ intrafirm

trade exhibits both speedier and larger responses to common real exchange rate

changes. In our discussion, we will consider alternative explanations for our empirical

findings.

       We will conclude by proposing some speculative micro-macro linkages

between the problems of search and deliberation, the economic behavior of firms, and


                                          6
the puzzling macro patterns we alluded to above. Our sense is that at the current pace,

the trends of regionalization and globalization will tend to “shrink the globe” and

dampen distance and border effects. Still, considering how profound cross-border

information discontinuities appear to be, we would speculate that distance, and,

particularly, border effects in economic exchange, will persist noticeably well into the

future. Of course, to the extent the proportion of multinationals in the population of

firms grows (and there are some reasons to anticipate this), information discontinuities

will be better patched and a deeper integration across distance and borders will be

fostered.



THE PROBLEMS OF SEARCH AND DELIBERATION

        By “search” we refer to acts involved in identifying potential exchange

partners.   Firms engage in search when they sense that response to a perceived

economic opportunity or threat involves action that might lie outside the pattern of

current activities and exchange relationships.          In general, search grows more

problematic the more spread out potential exchange partners are. Organized markets

exist in many undifferentiated commodities, but even there, trading companies have

had to emerge to link supply with remote demand. As for differentiated goods and

goods made to order, smaller volumes and deliberation problems have tended to keep

markets local, national, or regional.

        In any event, regardless of the nature of the commodity, search problems are

primarily a function of spatial dispersion. A corollary is that distance erodes economic

exchange; distance “always shows up as a crucial determinant of trade” (Krugman,

1995: 1273). Importantly, “shipping costs are quite small for most goods that can be

shipped at all; yet trade falls off quite strongly with distance.”


                                              7
       Let us turn now to the problem of deliberation. By “deliberation,” we refer to

acts involved in assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of potential exchange

partners. Like search, deliberation is also an information intensive process. But, if

search is aimed at reducing incomplete information about the present, deliberation is

aimed at reducing incomplete information about the present and especially the future.

Deliberation is a non-issue if actors can be certain or nearly certain about: (i) the

quality of what is to be exchanged, and (ii) the manner in which exchange partners will

discharge mutual obligations in the future. But in the absence of certainty, deliberation

enters the picture and it grows more important the more costly it becomes to reverse

allocative actions or their effects. When actors think deliberation is important but

problematic, they will tend to act reluctantly and progressively. In such circumstances,

economic actions are unlikely to be influenced by relative prices alone.

       Indeed, even in the face of changes in relative prices, buyer-supplier

relationships are often noted to be sticky. A good part of the explanation is known to

lie in the fact that in many buyer-supplier relationships switching-out and switching-in

are costly (Webster and Wind, 1972; Sheppard and Tuchinsky, 1996). As in labor

markets, assessing the reliability, timeliness, and capabilities of a new exchange partner

is a process of discovery. As this process of discovery unfolds the buying firm might

be: (i) placing in circulation a stock of inferior products that upon discovery will be

costly to recover and upgrade (e.g., the recall of vehicles fitted with defective

components); (ii) developing costly-to-reverse dependencies with the new supplier (as

might happen when a firm turns over the management of its computer and information

systems to an outside vendor); and (iii) closing-off a return to previous exchange

partners since the latter are likely to have tied up with other customers or even exited

the business altogether. These are some of the key drivers of uninsurable costs that


                                            8
firms are bound to weigh before switching or settling upon exchange partners. As

these drivers gain salience, firms will sense a greater need to obtain reliable information

about a potential exchange partner. If, however, the requisite information cannot be

assembled, firms are wont to forego potential profit opportunities.             Economic

opportunities, like proverbial “dollar bills on the sidewalk,” will lie waiting to be

picked up.

       In circumstances where search and deliberation are problematic, business and

social networks tend to assume significance in shaping and explaining economic

actions and outcomes. Gould’s (1994) study of immigrants’ trade effects provides an

illustration. Gould (pp. 302-303) notes that immigrants bring many things with them,

“perhaps key among these being...ties or links...[back] to their home country...” These

social ties, he notes, “can lower...[the] costs associated with obtaining foreign market

information and establishing trade relationships.” Gould hypothesizes that immigrants’

social ties ought to lead to a “direct increase in [trade] between the host and home

countries,” and he finds support for this view in his empirical analysis.

       Correspondingly, the information advantages posited in Granovetter’s (1985)

notion of embeddedness are especially pertinent to the problem of deliberation. Recall

that, to large extent, deliberation involves an attempt to resolve incomplete

information about the future behavior of exchange partners. In this endeavor, it is

natural that we look to exchange partners’ antecedents, because, rightly or wrongly,

we believe past behavior can offer us valuable clues about future behavior. It follows

then that embeddedness can aid deliberation because the confidence with which we can

assess the reliability and trustworthiness of a potential exchange partner tends to be

much higher when we ourselves or someone we know well has had “concrete personal




                                            9
relations” with the actor in question (see Gulati, 1995; Portes and Sensenbrenner,

1995; Uzzi, 1997).



SEARCH AND DELIBERATION IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

       For most managers around the world, family and community ties, school and

university ties, banking and boardroom ties, chamber of commerce and trade

association ties, and ties to employers and co-workers, all tend to be largely local or

national. As a result, more than distance, language, and culture separates managers

and the firms they work in from counterparts residing outside their national borders.

Indeed, distance and borders engender information discontinuities.

       By implication, the problems of search and deliberation are undoubtedly

magnified in economic exchange that must occur across national borders. Indeed,

studies on international exchange and organizational buying confirm this latter

contention (see Webster and Wind, 1972; Egan and Moody, 1992; Gulati, 1995;

Martin, Mitchell, and Swaminathan, 1995; Gordon and Bovenberg, 1996). A recent

review article (Liang and Parkhe, 1997: 510-511) notes that, “Domestic vendor

selection is more often a ‘choice’ situation... International vendor selection, on the

other hand, often is a ‘search’ situation, where the information processing load has a

higher probability of exceeding the bound of human rationality.” “Often the favored

search approach is simply to call and rely upon a known contact for a recommendation

[Liang and Stump, 1996]; objective information available in government sources is

largely ignored [Min and Galle, 1991]” (p. 509).

       Deliberation too is a problem of considerable proportions in international

exchange. U.S. importers who participated in one interview-based study expressed

that they “prefer long-term, stable, and direct relationships because [such relationships]


                                           10
‘make good business sense’” (Egan and Moody, 1992: 325). “Finding and evaluating”

new suppliers abroad is costly, buyer-supplier mutual learning (what we termed co-

specialization) is “cumulative,” and any “mutual obligation and trust develops

incrementally.” International buyers, this study noted, “are therefore reluctant to lose

this advantage and start over with new partners” (p. 325). The fingerprints of costly-

to-reverse allocative actions are clearly visible here. Further, consistent with our

embeddedness arguments, "When evaluating potential suppliers, virtually all buyers

first seek information within their own network...of product-specific buyers and

suppliers... The first source of information is the personal judgement of other buyers.”

Finally, given that both search and deliberation are problematic in international trade,

by our earlier reasoning, we would anticipate that the price mechanism does not

operate too well in economic activity that occurs across national borders. As we noted

at the top of the chapter, this contention too receives empirical support: price

dispersion, lagged adjustment, and visibly modest price elasticities have been persistent

quandaries in international trade (see Krugman and Baldwin, 1987; Lawrence, 1990;

Engel and Rogers, 1996).

       If international economic exchange is encumbered by the problems of search

and deliberation, then we would anticipate actors embedded in well-elaborated cross-

border networks to exhibit relatively greater and speedier responses to international

economic opportunities. This, in a nutshell, is why we would expect multinationals’

trade responses to exchange rate changes to be speedier and more vigorous than trade

that occurs at arm’s length.



MULTINATIONALS’ INFORMATION ADVANTAGES




                                           11
       Multinational enterprises, by virtue of the fact that they operate in two or more

countries, have the potential of being simultaneously embedded in two or more distinct

social networks (Kogut, 1983; Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1990). Most established MNEs

have actualized this potential by developing concrete relations with local suppliers,

customers, labor, and financial institutions. These external ties are supplemented to

lesser or greater extents by internal ties within the MNE (usually at least between the

headoffice and the various foreign affiliates). According to one empirical study of the

“information sources” used by U.S. MNE managers, “When a headquarters executive

in an [MNE] acquires external information, the most likely single source of this

information is the corporation’s own staff abroad (Keegan, 1974: 414).” Internal ties

among managers in an MNE emerge from both formal and informal interaction,

rotation, and other socialization processes (Edstrom and Galbraith, 1977; Prahalad and

Doz, 1987; Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989). This no doubt costly investment has long

been thought to place the MNE in an advantageous position vis-à-vis non-

multinational enterprises (Vernon, 1979; Kogut, 1983; Dunning and Rugman, 1985;

Lessard, 1986).

       The sequence of events that leads to the possession of this advantage can be

described as follows: an MNE locates and operates facilities in another advanced

country when demand for its products in that country (and the neighboring region)

grows sizable and is served best through a local facility. Routine operation of the

foreign facility generates a set of business relationships and a continually replenished

stock of information about actual prices, the existence, location, and precise needs and

capabilities of buyers and, importantly, suppliers in that region. In his early study of

U.S. multinationals’ expansion abroad, Knickerbocker (1973: 26) put it thus:




                                          12
       When firm A starts to manufacture in country X, its subsidiary management, and
       perhaps its headquarters management, are exposed to factor inputs and technologies that
       may differ in terms of type, quality, or cost from those previously encountered in the
       United States or elsewhere. In responding to this new matrix of factors, firm A may find
       that it can use new raw materials, or it may devise new manufacturing processes, or it
       may even uncover new product possibilities. Moreover, information about the
       discoveries can be transferred to other parts of A’s organization.



Of course, experiences are likely to vary quite a bit across firms and locations; it can

hardly be otherwise. But, in general, over time, there will be a tendency for the MNE

to become embedded in the host environment.

       Against this setting, imagine that in response to a change in exchange rates the

MNE’s home facility wants to explore the feasibility and economics of sourcing

intermediate inputs from the foreign country. The MNE’s home facility ought to be

able to do so relatively easily because the search and deliberation necessary to exploit

the new economic opportunity is likely to be behind it. The MNE’s purely domestic

counterparts, on the other hand, will tend to confront a more difficult situation because

information and connections required to operate at home are invariably different from

that required for buying and selling abroad. Moreover, local presence is frequently a

necessary condition for exchanging information reliably and for settling transactions

under advantageous terms (Keegan, 1974; Egan and Moody, 1992).

       This is not to say that non-multinationals working via arm’s length

relationships will have no trade responses.           On the contrary, given the growing

intensity of competition, the large size of exchange rate changes over the last years,

and the fact that international trade existed long before anyone heard of multinational

enterprises, we fully anticipate non-multinationals to respond and there is a voluminous

empirical research that tells us they do (Stern, Francis, and Schumacher, 1976). But,

relative to their purely domestic counterparts, MNEs will tend to be embedded abroad

in better-elaborated social networks.         This characteristic of better structural and


                                               13
relational embeddedness ought to provide MNEs with information advantages (vis-à-

vis the problems of search and deliberation), and, in turn, on the back of these

information advantage MNEs ought to exhibit speedier and more vigorous import

responses. The reasons for greater speed are obvious, and the reasons for greater

vigor can be stated as follows: As argued earlier, deliberation problems tend to weaken

firms’ willingness to substitute on the basis of price. Relative to non-multinational

enterprises, MNEs, for reasons just laid out, face smaller deliberation problems. Other

things equal then, MNEs ought to exhibit higher exchange rate elasticities. Further,

the costs of search and deliberation can be considered as additive to the purchase price

(Stigler, 1961). Firms that face higher net prices will tend to trade smaller volumes

than those that face lower net prices. By this logic too, MNEs ought to exhibit higher

exchange rate elasticities.



EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

        The spirit of the analysis to be conducted is as follows. Using the United

States as the focal country, let us pick an industry, partner country, and a time period.

Having done that, let us examine in the industry and period chosen the speed and

elasticity with which U.S. imports from that partner country respond to changes in the

U.S. dollar’s real exchange rate (vis-à-vis the currency of that partner country). Let us

now compare the results so obtained to estimates of the same coefficients in the same

industry, partner country, and time period, but for U.S. imports from U.S.

multinationals that have operations in that partner country. Controlling for industry,

country, and time period in this manner, we should, according to our hypothesis,

observe that U.S. imports from MNEs exhibit statistically larger elasticities (i.e.,

greater responses) and shorter lags (i.e., speedier responses) in adapting to the


                                           14
common real exchange rate changes. To be sure, any observed differences will be

consistent with our search and deliberation story only if we can rule out MNE

advantages that arise from other important sources such as their size and

sophistication. We will, therefore, attempt to control for these potentially confounding

factors.



Data Sources and Coverage

           Data used in the analysis come from three sources: the U.S. Department of

Commerce, the OECD, and the IMF. Industry by country by year U.S. import data

were obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Nominal exchange rates are

from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.        GDP data and industry-and-

country-specific producer prices (that are used to calculate industry-by-country-

specific real exchange rates) are from the OECD’s Indicators of Industrial Activity.

Data on R&D expenditure are from the OECD (1997) publication entitled Research

and Development in Industry. Estimates of U.S. importers’ employment size (used as

an indicator of U.S. importers’ firm size) are based upon employment figures reported

in the OECD (1997) publication entitled Globalisation and Small and Medium

Enterprises: Volume 2. All data pertaining to U.S. multinationals are from the U.S.

Bureau of Economic Analysis’ (BEA) annual surveys of the operations of U.S.

multinationals and their foreign affiliates. Since these latter data are available only on

an annual basis, the analysis below is conducted only on annual data (using averages in

the case of exchange rates and year-end data for all other variables).

           Coverage is guided primarily by the availability of data (particularly on the

operations of U.S. multinationals). Accordingly, the analysis below pertains to U.S.

imports between 1977 and 1994 of manufactured goods in four industries--food and


                                            15
related products, chemicals and allied products, non-electrical machinery, and electric

and electronic products, and from nine countries--Australia, Canada, France, Germany,

Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom. U.S. imports in the four

industries from the nine countries accounted in 1994 for $123 billion or a little over a

fifth of all U.S. manufacturing imports in that same year. U.S. MNEs’ intrafirm

imports accounted for a 10 to 15 percent share of that total. Depending on the

specification estimated, the number of observations range from around 300 to one

thousand. The lower limit is driven by the U.S. MNE data which frequently are

missing. In particular, between 1979-1981 the BEA did not conduct surveys of U.S.

MNEs’ foreign operations; therefore, MNE data for those three years are unavailable.

       Nevertheless, by focusing on U.S.-headquartered MNEs we gain an important

advantage deriving from the fact that by 1977, the first year covered in our study,

these entities had already established operations in Europe, Canada, Australia, and

Japan. In fact, according to the data, between 1977 and 1994, the number of U.S.

MNE parents in manufacturing actually declined slightly from 1,842 to 1,543 (perhaps

not inconsistent with the consolidation that has taken place domestically); and the

number of foreign affiliates of these parents in the nine countries of interest declined

slightly as well (mainly in Canada) going from 11,771 to 11,189 (USDIA 1977: Tables,

B and C; USDIA 1994: Tables II.A.1 and II.A.2). This relative stability in MNE

affiliates abroad ought to mitigate concerns about both shifts in the composition of the

sample and any potential simultaneity bias. Moreover, in the industries and countries

we are studying, less than 10 (typically less than 5) percent of the output of U.S. firms’

foreign affiliates is destined for shipment back to United States. The point being, these

affiliates were not set up as low-cost export platforms to serve the U.S. market, rather

their priority from the start has been to serve local and regional markets abroad. This


                                           16
assures us that our sample data are not biased in favor of the hypotheses we will be

exploring.

       It must be noted here, that although the MNE trade figures used in this study

are the only set reported on a country-by-industry basis, these data are primarily

intrafirm trade data. Of the U.S. imports originated by U.S. MNEs’ foreign affiliates

nearly 80 percent are shipped to the U.S. parent. As we mentioned above, according

to existing views, intrafirm trade ought to be no different from arm’s length trade, or it

ought to be less responsive than arm’s length trade. Yet, since MNE intrafirm trade is

likely to embody both internal and external ties and benefit from the hypothesized

information advantages, we expect U.S. intrafirm imports to be more responsive,

ceteris paribus.



Dependent Variable

       In working with international trade we have, in principle, a choice to focus on

imports or exports. Although the latter is often the focus of empirical and policy

oriented research, in our case, it is not as suitable as imports. The reason for this is

straightforward: multinational enterprises are, in a sense, identified innately with

exports and success in export markets (Vernon, 1966; Dunning, 1974; Caves, 1996).

Hence, by sticking to imports we avoid biasing the results in favor of MNEs. For

instance, in the case of imports, there is no destination-market advantage to be had by

MNEs. Purely domestic firms ought to be equally “at home” in the United States.

Further, since the United States is a more open economy than most, U.S. imports are

likely to be a better register (than exports) of responses to new international economic

opportunities. In other words, by selecting imports, variation in the dependent variable

is likely to be enhanced.


                                           17
       Accordingly, the dependent variable used in the analysis is the log of U.S.

imports from a particular country in a given industry and year. Ideally, we would want

to state imports in volume terms, however, since country and industry-specific import

prices are not available, we use nominal import value figures. Other empirical studies

(e.g., Junz and Rhomberg, 1972; Lawrence, 1990) have also employed this approach

noting that the magnitude of the reported elasticities will be greater in absolute terms.

Since we will use nominal figures for both MNEs and overall U.S. imports, this should

not throw off our comparative analysis.         Of course, transfer prices emerge as a

potential issue and we will discuss it below.



Independent Variables

       The first independent variable of interest is the real exchange rate (which is

stated in terms of foreign currency units per U.S. dollar). We want to examine both

the magnitude of the elasticity and the pattern of lags exhibited by U.S. MNEs and

average U.S. importers in responding to the level of this independent variable. While

most studies tend to use exchange rates that are simply averaged across countries, we

measure this variable in country, industry, and year specific terms. For instance, in the

case of U.S. imports of chemicals from Germany, we construct the real exchange rate

by adjusting the mark-dollar nominal rate to reflect producer prices in the U.S. and

German chemical industries. In this manner, we construct an index of real exchange

rates for the years 1977 through 1994 and use it in log terms in the analysis.

       Another independent variable of interest is the interaction term between the

real exchange rate and an MNE dummy variable. In regressions that pool MNE and

average-U.S. importer responses, we would anticipate the coefficient on this

interaction term (MNE*exchange rate) to be positive and statistically significant. That


                                           18
is, after controlling for industry, year, partner country, and other variables stated

below, MNEs, by virtue of their information advantages, ought to exhibit greater

responsiveness to the level of the exchange rate than the average (non-multinational)

U.S. importer.



Control Variables

       There are several control variables that warrant inclusion in our analysis. First,

we want to recognize that the decisions of U.S. firms to source inputs from abroad are

influenced not only by exchange rates, but also by changes in the levels of their

business activity. We, therefore, include as a control variable price-adjusted U.S.

industry-specific GDP (gross domestic product). This is an important variable in its

own right, but here it gives us added insight, because, when their activity levels

change, organizations (we assume) need to simply adjust quantities purchased up or

down, they do not switch suppliers and they do not have to search or deliberate.

       According to our hypothesis, in the absence of search and deliberation,

adjustment should be prompt and vigorous. We would anticipate, therefore, that any

lags on the activity variable would be shorter than those observed on exchange rates.

And, without ruling out other causes for this, we would also anticipate that the

coefficient on this variable to be larger than the coefficient on exchange rates.

       Importantly, to the extent that MNEs trade better internationally by virtue of

their greater experience, size, and sophistication, we should pick this up in an

MNE*GDP interaction term. By our theory, a positive coefficient on this interaction

term would suggest the presence of advantages not related to superior networks and

information. Accordingly, the MNE*GDP coefficient could serve as a crude control




                                            19
against which we can compare the MNE*exchange rate coefficient (anticipating the

latter to be larger and more significant than the former).

       To control separately for firm size, we include a firm size*exchange rate

interaction term because larger firms (read MNEs) can more readily justify the costs of

having on their staff exchange rate specialists and persons proficient in foreign

languages. Also, to the extent search and switching costs are fixed they will be more

easily borne by large rather than small firms. Finally, large firms will tend to possess

greater experience and expertise in successfully executing the logistics called for in

international trade. On the other hand, it is well known that size can be a mixed

blessing: large firms are more susceptible to “internal opportunism” and inter-divisional

“logrolling” both of which can impede flexibility and responsiveness (Williamson,

1975). Large firms are also more likely to be unionized and this may influence their

ability and willingness to substitute home content with imports. Lastly, large size

might confer scale economies that make short-run adjustments suboptimal. In any

event, we use the average number of employees per U.S. firm in a given industry and

year as an indicator of firm size. Employment figures are not available for U.S.

importers; so, instead, we use estimates based on figures for U.S. exporters. For

MNEs, the figures used are average MNE employment by industry. These data are

also entered in log terms in the firm size*exchange rate interaction term. (Note, firm

size is not entered by itself as an independent variable since it introduces perfect

collinearity with the industry dummies in any given year and industry.)

       We also enter a time trend in the regressions to account for advances in

technology, the rise in capabilities abroad and the attendant rise in competition, and

greater liberalization in the world economy.        Further, to control for unobserved

influences, we include dummy variables for eight out of the nine countries and three


                                           20
out of the four industries. In the regressions, then, the constant term stands for the

omitted country and industry, which, in our case, will be the United Kingdom and

machinery.

         Lastly, in some models (that we don’t report here) we included R&D/Sales

ratios as a control. Research intensity is believed to influence international trade--at

least exports (see Dunning, 1993; Kobrin, 1991). Since U.S. imports from country X

are country X’s exports to the U.S., we controlled for foreign (i.e., country X’s)

industry-specific R&D/Sales ratios. Since research efforts typically take time to get

reflected in new products and increased sales, we entered this variable on a two-year

lagged basis. Including this variable did not change the results (and neither did

alternative lag structures, including zero lags on R&D/Sales).



Model Estimation and Results

         Equations explaining U.S. imports are estimated as variations of the following

specification:



U. S. Imports   ijt   = α ij + β * U. S. GDP   it   + γ * Exch. Rate   ijt   + δ * Importer Firm Size          it   * Exch. Rate       ijt


                       + ε * Time t + ζ * Lagged Foreign R         & D/Sales       ijt   + η * MNE   ijt   * Exch. Rate     ijt   + θ ijt .




The subscripts i, j, and t, stand, respectively, for industry, country, and year. With the

exception of the time trend (and the R&D/Sales ratios) all variables are entered in

natural logs.           The coefficients on these latter variables, therefore, represent the

elasticity of U.S. imports to a one percent increase in the respective independent

variables. Pooling observations across industries and countries violates normal OLS

assumptions. To correct bias in parameter estimates, a least squares dummy variable



                                                              21
approach is adopted.     Such fixed-effects models constrain the coefficients on the

independent variable to be the same across observations, but they allow unobserved

cross-sectional heterogeneity to be captured in the different intercepts. This approach

is well suited to panel datasets that, like ours, are “short and wide” (Greene, 1990:

482-485).

       Tables 1 presents the first set of results. Consider the estimates under columns

1 and 2 in Table 1. These models include the GDP, exchange rate, firm size, and the

country and industry dummy variables. The first equation explains U.S. overall--

meaning MNE and non-MNE related--imports from the nine countries in the four

industries over the 1977-1994 period. The second equation explains U.S. imports

originating from U.S. MNEs’ foreign affiliates. In both equations, the coefficients on

U.S. GDP are, as anticipated, positive, relatively large (around 2), and statistically

significant. On the other hand, the coefficient on the (contemporaneous) real exchange

rate is positive but not statistically significant for U.S. overall imports; however, for

MNE imports, this coefficient is positive, significant, and larger than the coefficient on

the GDP variable. When a time trend is added to these models (not shown), the

pattern of the exchange rate coefficients remains unchanged.              However, not

surprisingly, the time trend cancels out much of the effect associated with the rise in

GDP. As indicated by the adjusted R-squares on these models--of 0.61 and 0.77--the

models explain a significant amount of the variation in the dependent variable.

       The models in the other columns in Table 1 explore the question of relative

speed of adjustment. The results in those columns suggest clearly that MNEs exhibit

speedier responses. Consider the models in columns 3 and 4 in Table 1. Both those

models contain the contemporaneous and one-year lagged exchange rates. The one-

year lagged exchange rate coefficient for U.S. overall imports now assumes statistical


                                           22
significance. This is also the case for MNE imports, although, contemporaneous

exchange rates continue to be large and statistically significant. When two-year lagged

exchange rates are introduced (in columns 5 and 6 of Table 1), their coefficients

assume significance for both U.S. overall and MNE imports. However, the sum of the

exchange rate coefficients shows a marked difference between U.S. overall and MNE

imports: for the former they sum up to 0.97, while for the latter, they sum up to 4.31.

(When a lagged GDP term was added to the models in columns 5 and 6 in Table 1, it

did not take on a statistically significant coefficient.)

        In Table 2, we pool the overall and MNE-only observations and estimate

regressions with interaction terms between the MNE dummy variable and the price and

activity variables. In this table, we also explore the robustness of our results by

running regressions on selected sub-samples of the available data. First, let us note

that the MNE*real exchange rate interaction term is positive and statistically

significant in all the models shown in Table 2. That is, MNEs with operations in the

partner country exhibit a greater responsiveness to the level of the exchange rate than

the average U.S. importer does. Also, in this pooled sample (see column 1, for

instance), the coefficient on the contemporaneous exchange rate assumes statistical

significance. The coefficients on the GDP are also significant and relatively much

larger (in the absence of the time trend), and the adjusted R-square for the model in

column 1 is (at 0.73) quite satisfactory.

        Now in many of the industry-country-years, especially for MNEs, import

values were small. Upon inspection, we discovered that out of the nine countries in

the study, three--Australia, Italy, and Switzerland--had fragmentary and relatively

small trade figures. To see whether these were driving the results, we ran a regression

excluding Australia, Italy, and Switzerland, and the results are presented in column 2


                                              23
of Table 2. As indicated in that column, the MNE*exchange rate coefficient retains

statistical significance and, in fact, rises in magnitude.

        Next, in order to further explore MNE size and sophistication as sources of

superior MNE adjustment, we included an MNE*GDP interaction variable to the

model just reviewed. As column 3 of Table 2 shows, the MNE*GDP interaction term

is positive and statistically significant. This finding supports the view that MNEs enjoy

adjustment advantages that might derive from greater international experience, and

superior communication and logistics capabilities.           Yet, the coefficient on

MNE*exchange rate interaction term is much larger than that on MNE*GDP (2.24

compared to 0.51). Further, the appropriate t- and F-tests based upon restricted and

unrestricted regressions (not shown) indicate that the coefficients are statistically

different from one another. Running the model shown in column 3 with all available

observations (see results in column 4 of Table 2) weakens the difference between the

two coefficients but does not alter the basic finding. (The same holds true for

specifications that exclude the firm size*exchange rate interaction term).

        Next we ran regressions to see whether MNEs’ information advantages were

becoming more visible over time. We present the results of those regressions in Table

3. Given that trade has liberalized quite significantly over the past two decades, one

might anticipate that multinationals have been able to better use their information

advantages over this time frame and have grown more responsive. Indeed, this view

receives mild support in the results shown in column 2 of Table 3 (see, in particular,

the coefficient on MNE*real exchange rate*time).

        Further, since technology has advanced and “selection pressures” are likely to

have ratcheted up over the past twenty years, it would appear that, notwithstanding

search and deliberation problems, the relative price (i.e., exchange rate) responsiveness


                                             24
of all firms ought to have trended up. This view too is supported by the positive and

statistically significant coefficient on the real exchange rate*time interaction term in

column 3 of Table 3. Running a model with both interaction terms (see column 4),

maintained the results but reduced to 13 percent the significance of the coefficient on

the MNE*real exchange rate*time interaction term.

        In separate industry-by-industry regressions (not reported here, see Rangan,

1998), the MNE*exchange rate interaction term was positive for all four industries and

statistically significant in three (with the exception of machinery). The unreported

results of one more set of regressions merits mention. In order to check whether the

search and deliberation hypothesis holds even in the absence of MNE-related data, we

ran regressions using only overall U.S. import data.              Reasoning that search and

deliberation ought to be relatively easier for U.S. importers when they have to switch

away from foreign suppliers back to U.S. suppliers, we examined whether the

exchange rate coefficient was larger during dollar depreciations (say during the 1986-

90 period) than dollar appreciations (say during the 1979-85 period). Not only was

the contemporaneous exchange rate coefficient larger during depreciations (1.51

compared to 0.43 during appreciations), it was also statistically significant at the 5

percent level. (The other coefficients took predictable values.)5




5         Two other points also merit mention. First, to explore the so-called “quantum effect,” we
added the absolute magnitude of the exchange rate change in some of our regressions. Consistent
with the findings summarized in Goldstein and Khan (1985: 1075), this variable did not take a
statistically significant coefficient nor did it change the results. Second, we acknowledge that
exchange rate expectations do not figure in our regressions. We assume all exchange rate changes
are “permanent.” However, we might note that to the extent expectations about exchange rate are
important, we have no reason to believe the MNEs and non-MNEs form systematically different
expectations. Further, if the “temporariness” of exchange rate changes might be gauged by the
volatility in exchange rate changes, then exchange rate changes don’t appear to have become more
temporary. Volatility (measured as the standard deviation of monthly percentage changes) in
exchange rates of G7 economies between 1980-85, 1986-89, 1990-94 was 1.7, 1.7, and 1.6



                                                25
ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS AND DISCUSSION

        We set out to understand first whether MNEs’ intrafirm trade is stickier

relative to arm’s length trade. Our empirical results clearly indicate that this is not the

case. In fact, consistent with our arguments about MNEs’ information advantages vis-

à-vis the problems of search and deliberation, the results indicate that even on imports

MNEs exhibit speedier and more vigorous responses to changes in real exchange rates.

        To be sure, MNEs tend to enjoy internalization and experience advantages,

and, indeed, we found that the MNE*GDP coefficient took positive and significant

values. But, we also found that the MNE*exchange rate interaction coefficient took

much larger values, and this would support our contention that problematic search and

deliberation and MNEs’ information advantages are key explanators here. We also

found that the average firm size*exchange rate variable took either a statistically

insignificant or a significant but negative coefficient. This finding is likely to be

explained by the presence of scale economies, but it also supports a view expressed in

a recent OECD study on globalization (1997, Vol. 1: 54): "Size does hold some

importance, especially in successfully taking the first steps to internationalisation, but

once there, it does not seem to matter much...[S]maller size can often be an

advantage."

        Of course, the internalized trade issue does raise the question of transfer prices.

Intrafirm MNE transactions are typically made at internal transfer prices and internal

exchange rates that tend to be rigid (Lessard, 1986). But if transfer prices tend to

remain stable in originating country currency terms and if company internal exchange

rates lag actual exchange rates (say because of the presence of currency hedge



respectively (see The Economist, October 7, 1995, Survey pg. 28). So volatility is unlikely to be
useful as an independent variable in our regressions.


                                               26
contracts), then, ceteris paribus, MNE import values will register smaller not bigger

changes. (In fact, in our data, the simple correlation coefficient between MNE imports

and exchange rates is close to zero.) MNE transfer pricing practices cannot, therefore,

account for our findings. Indeed, they would strengthen our findings and explanation.

       There are two other related alternative explanations that merit discussion.

First, we have not included capacity in our regressions in this chapter.        But, as

Krugman and Baldwin (1987) point out, if capacity considerations were important,

then they ought to be manifested in lags on income effects. This is not the case and we

can, hence, rule out capacity as a key explanatory variable. A related alternative

explanation might argue that although capacity constraints may not play a role, it

might be that multinationals have more compatible capacity across geographies and,

therefore, they are able to exploit relative price differences better.    But in other

research (see Rangan and Lawrence, 1999: Chapter 3), we have explored this question

of compatibility, and we found that (due to their historical local-for-local strategies)

even multinationals’ production capacities were not (over the 1977-94 period)

characterized by a high degree of cross-border compatibility.

       Last, but not least, there is a growing body of empirical work (based on data

unrelated to the MNE trade figures we have used) that is also reporting findings that

are consistent with our emphasis on the importance and advantages of business

networks in international trade (see Williamson, 1986; Gould, 1994; Rauch, 1997).

       As for the puzzling macro patterns alluded to at the top of this paper, we have

suggested that lags and progressiveness in trade responses to exchange rates emerge

from search and deliberation problems. Observed distance effects, we would argue,

are primarily a manifestation of search problems. In other words, distance tends to

make search for potential exchange partners more cumbersome. The presence of


                                          27
organized markets is likely to mitigate search problems. By implication, distance

ought to dampen relatively more trade in goods (such as differentiated manufactures)

that are not offered on organized exchanges. Physical distance is also likely to have

declined in importance over the past couple of decades since search is likely to have

become easier and less expensive over this period. These hypotheses receive support

in some recent and carefully done analysis by James E. Rauch (1997).

       As far as border and home bias effects, we view these as primarily a function of

deliberation problems (or, contrariwise, as a manifestation of a familiarity bias). Now

if it were true, as would seem plausible, that trade in differentiated products represents

economic action that is more costly to reverse than trade in commodities, then

network effects ought to be relatively greater for differentiated products. Again, we

refer the reader to Rauch (1997), wherein he reports empirical results that are

consistent with our arguments and expectations.         Rauch (1997: 28) notes, “The

coefficient on colonial ties are always positive, significant, and largest for the

differentiated commodity group in every year...”

       A last piece of interesting evidence on these matters appears in a European

Commission survey conducted in mid-to-late 1995 to assess the effect on company

strategies of the EC ‘92 Single European Market initiative. Of particular interest to us

was the response of the firms to questions on their intra-European sourcing strategies.

As shown in Table 4, with the exception of the purchase of raw materials, the vast

majority of the (13,500) responding firms did not view the removal of intra-European

border barriers as important to their sourcing strategies. Interestingly, the figures

under “very important” and “quite important” decline predictably as they go from raw

materials, to components, to business services, to financial services.    This pattern is

more or less what one would expect to see if one believed that the importance of


                                           28
deliberation rises, as we believe it does, when one goes from raw materials to

components to services. To be sure, we would anticipate that if the survey were

repeated a few years hence, the percentage of respondents selecting the very and quite

important columns would rise, but the declining pattern across the rows is likely to

persist.



CONCLUSION

           When the identification and/ or assessment of potential exchange partners is

problematic, a situation of information insufficiency obtains and firms will appear

reluctant to pursue apparent economic opportunities. These problems of search and

deliberation tend to become salient when economic opportunities are dispersed

spatially or when economic actions or their effects are perceived as costly to reverse.

           When brought into the international setting, these simple ideas can help us

understand why certain parts of our global economy (such as currency markets) appear

extremely volatile and responsive while other parts (such as trade in manufactured

goods) exhibit visible stickiness and lagged adjustment. Speculating further, we have

positioned in a search-deliberation framework the major types of economic activity

that span national borders (see Figure 1). If distance is a proxy for search problems,

and borders are a proxy for deliberation problems, then, for example, we would expect

short lags and relatively small distance effects in portfolio investment. However, we

would expect international portfolio investments to exhibit large border (or home bias)

effects. As Rauch (1997) has remarked, foreign direct investment (FDI), on the other

hand, is to portfolio investment what trade in differentiated products is to trade in

commodities.




                                            29
       What might we say about the future? In our opinion, the technology of the

Internet has the potential to significantly ameliorate search problems.      We might

therefore anticipate that distance effects will, in the future, more closely reflect

transport costs. However, we anticipate the familiarity bias to persist: Between two

trading partners equal in every respect except familiarity, firms will choose to conduct

business with the more familiar one. So border effects and path dependence are very

likely to remain visible. Again, the Internet might help deliberation problems. But, in

our opinion, it is unlikely that such amelioration will be rapid or dramatic. On the

other hand, a protracted period of trade and investment liberalization accompanied by

a rising multinationalization of firms is likely to temper cross-border deliberation

problems. To sum up, we expect that border effects and the home bias will diminish in

the future, but they will hardly disappear. Above-normal price dispersion is, therefore,

likely to persist. After all, in most markets, trust and price are likely to remain

complements and not turn into substitutes.
