                                           ABSTRACT

Using two decades of data from twelve low-income countries in West Africa, we show that dust
carried by harmattan trade winds increases infant and child mortality. Health investments respond
to dust exposure, consistent with compensating behaviors. Despite these efforts, surviving
children still exhibit negative health impacts. Our data allow us to investigate differential impacts
over time and across countries. We find declining impacts over time, suggesting adaptation.
Using national-level measures of macroeconomic conditions and health resources, we find
suggestive evidence that both economic development and public health improvements have
contributed to this adaptation, with health improvements playing a larger role.

1     Introduction

Environmental factors impact important outcomes related to economic growth and develop-
ment – including conflict, mortality, disease, and income – in profound ways (Dell et al., 2012;
Hsiang et al., 2013; Maccini and Yang, 2009). The links between environment, health, and
the ability of people to adapt are particularly salient in low-income countries. First, health
is more fragile in these contexts, implying that small changes in environmental conditions
could have large impacts on health outcomes. Second, coping mechanisms for adjusting to
extreme weather events and other environmental shocks are fewer than in other countries.
For example, while migration was a major response to the American Dust Bowl (Hornbeck,
2012), in many low-income countries, individuals do not migrate during seasonal floods de-
spite high returns to migration (Bryan et al., 2014). Third, as low-income countries raise
their standards of living, it is critical to examine whether economic growth is accompanied
by increased adaptation, mitigating the impacts of environmental shocks.1 Finally, climate
change is likely to exacerbate preexisting inequalities in income, health, and human capital.
Examining the effects of weather-related events on such outcomes is therefore crucial in the
low-income country context.
    This paper presents a large-scale empirical analysis of the impacts of in utero dust ex-
posure in Western Africa on mortality and health in early childhood. Our analysis spans
two decades, from 1986 to 2006, allowing us to examine evidence suggestive of adaptation
responses. The data cover 12 countries, allowing for an exploration of the effects of dust
exposure across countries with different economic conditions and public health systems. Our
study focuses on a specific source of dust-related pollution in the African Sahel: a yearly
trade wind that blows from the Sahara towards the Gulf of Guinea, known locally as the
harmattan. It carries with it a large amount of dust, mostly quartz, clay, colloids, and fine
mica flakes (Besancenot et al., 1997).2 Recent harmattan activity in Nigeria has sparked

enquiry into whether global warming could be partly responsible for changes in the timing
and intensity of the dust storms (Gambrell, 2010).
    Our research is aided by the availability of data on dust concentrations taken from NASA
satellite data and extrapolation verified by on-the-ground measurements. Our specific mea-
sure of dust is PM2.5, or particulate matter whose size is less than 2.5 microns. Our focus
on outcomes in early childhood is motivated by research emphasizing this critical period of
child development (Cunha and Heckman, 2007). We find compelling evidence that in utero
exposure to dust affects early life survival. Additional exposure of 10 µg/m3 of PM2.5 dur-
ing each month of gestation on average decreases infant survival by 6.45 percentage points,
which is substantial relative to the sample average infant mortality rate of 11.2%.
    However, between 1986 and 2006, the effect of PM2.5 dust on mortality shows a steady
decline; the effect more than halves during this time period. This suggests that these im-
pacts have been attenuated by adaptation, by the spread of public health services, or by
technological advances, among other potential explanations. Using national-level measures
on macroeconomic conditions and public health infrastructure, we find evidence that dust
impacts are smaller in countries with more developed economies and greater health resources,
with health improvements seemingly the more important moderator. At the individual level,
we find that non-first-born children are less susceptible to the deleterious effects of dust, and
are also more likely to receive compensatory investments at birth and in early life. These
results suggest some role for parental “experience” and investments in adaptation, in line
with recent work demonstrating that parental investments react to early childhood health
shocks (Adhvaryu and Nyshadham, 2016; Almond and Mazumder, 2013; Bharadwaj et al.,
2013). Accordingly, we interpret our main results as the effect of dust exposure net of any
compensating investments.
(5%), ferric oxide (4%), and other salts (5%). It is our understanding that the dust is composed primarily
of materials relating to the Earths crust (see e.g. Zhou et al. (2013)). It is possible that man-made forms
of pollution have become a larger component of the dust phenomenon over time. In Ibadan, for example,
Akinlade et al. (2015) find some evidence of man-made pollution as part of the overall dust composition.
However, this is unlikely to affect our main results, as we control for year-by-month fixed effects in all our
regression specifications.


                                                      3
       It should be noted that our analysis shows the reduced form relationship between the
harmattan and infant and child mortality across multiple countries and over time. We are not
able to distinguish the relative importance of various candidate mechanisms for which there
is evidence of links to the harmattan, such as damage to infrastructure, reduced rainfall, crop
output reduction, or changes to the disease environment (Adefolalu, 1984; Adetunji et al.,
1979; Archibong et al., 2017; Besancenot et al., 1997).
       Our empirical approach addresses the standard concerns faced by studies that examine
the role of pollution exposure on mortality.3 Our baseline empirical specification includes
survey cluster fixed × calendar month effects. Clusters approximate villages and are defined
uniquely for every wave of the survey. Intersecting these with calendar month dummies
means that we control flexibly for seasonal patterns that we allow to differ for every cluster in
the data. We include country × year × month fixed effects that allow for different seasonal
patterns by country, as well unobserved heterogeneity at the level of year-by-month-by-
country cells. That is to say, we compare two children from the same survey cluster exposed
to varying levels of dust by virtue of being born at different times, over and above any
unobserved shocks to mortality that vary by the intersection of country, month, and year.
We further add controls for rainfall and temperature during the in utero period to isolate
the impacts of dust exposure from the impacts of weather phenomena. Our results are
also robust to the inclusion of alternative country × month of birth × year of birth fixed
effects and dust point fixed effects, as well as an alternative mother fixed effects approach, in
which we compare siblings born at different times, and hence exposed to different dust levels,
but who otherwise share similar family and location characteristics. Finally, we check that
mother and child characteristics are not affected by dust exposure due to selective fertility.
       This paper contributes to the growing body of work in economics on the health impacts
   3
    A major concern, for example, is sorting. Individuals might sort into areas with lower dust prevalence
and characteristics that are associated with sorting could affect early childhood mortality. Similarly, fertility
in Africa is seasonal (Dorélien, 2016). Children born in different months of the year could also be exposed to
other seasonal variation or environmental agents, which could drive part of the correlation of dust exposure
with mortality. There can also be broad secular trends at the national level with declining infant mortality
that might affect our results.

of pollution exposure in the developing world (Arceo-Gomez et al., 2016; Ebenstein, 2012;
Ebenstein et al., 2017; Greenstone and Hanna, 2014; Heft-Neal et al., 2018; Jayachandran,
2009).4 Our data, across many West African countries and spanning two decades, allow
us to expand the external validity of existing findings. Similarly, our focus on a naturally
occurring source of pollution allows our results to be uncontaminated by policies that might
coincide with environmental regulations and similar sources of identifying variation.
       Another advantage of considering such a broad region over a long time period, using data
that record multiple parental investments, is that we are able to test the degree to which
people and institutions adapt to the adverse effects of dust exposure. In this regard, our
paper is related most closely to Barreca et al. (2016). Even in the case of the health effects
of environmental shocks for which there is a large literature (temperature), and in developed
country contexts where avoidance behaviors can be reliably measured, existing knowledge on
adaptation is quite limited (Deschenes, 2014). Studies on the mortality effects of pollution
in poor countries can compare impacts to those found in rich countries and identify socio-
economic gradients, but cannot track adaptation over time or measure avoidance behavior.
In other cases, diminishing mortality has not been due to better mitigation, but rather to
improved air quality (Arceo-Gomez et al., 2016). As Arceo-Gomez et al. (2016) note, the
effects of pollution may be more severe at the higher levels found in poor countries, and the
costs of avoidance behavior may be greater. This is true of many types of environmental
shocks to health (Burgess et al., 2014; Dell et al., 2014; Kudamatsu et al., 2012).
       It is not obvious, therefore, in our context that there should be diminishing effects of
shocks over time akin those found in the developed world.5 Our results show that the effects
of fetal dust exposure on the survival of West African children have weakened dramatically in
recent years. We show that economic development and health-related improvements, such as
higher immunization rates and per capita health expenditure and lower disease prevalence,

Currie and Schwandt (2016); Jia and Ku (2015).

are associated with smaller impacts of dust on infant and child mortality, suggesting potential
mechanisms for this decline.



2     Background

Broadly, the mechanisms connecting fetal dust exposure to infant and child mortality can
be classified as biological or economic. Biological mechanisms can themselves be divided
roughly into indirect effects operating through the health of the mother, direct effects while
in the womb, and greater vulnerability to later health insults. Pregnant mothers who inhale
dust are at risk of having particulate matter enter their lungs, which can affect the operation
of several organ systems (DeFranco et al., 2015). Dust inhaled during the harmattan in
particular can carry harmful elemental particles, including heavy metals and trace metals,
and can lodge deep in the lungs (Uduma and Jimoh, 2013). Pathways for direct effects in
utero include interrupted placental development, fetal growth restriction, susceptibility to
pre-term birth, heart defects, and reduced weight gain. Ritz and Wilhelm (2008) suggest
several effects of air pollution both at birth and afterwards, making children more vulnerable.
These include higher risks of: infant death; brain, respiratory, and digestive problems in early
life; and heart disease and diabetes in adulthood. It has also been noted in the literature that
the harmattan is correlated with outbreaks of meningitis (Besancenot et al., 1997). While the
mechanisms remain unclear, the seasonal dust dries the lips and irritates the nasopharyngeal
mucosa.
    West African populations are generally aware of seasonal correlations between health out-
comes and the harmattan. Eighteenth-century European observers on the Ghanaian coast
observed that fine dust would settle on the skin, giving it a whitish color. Dryness that ac-
companied the dust harmed vegetables and trees, facilitated the spread of fires, damaged fur-
niture, and irritated the eyes, nostrils, palate, and lips, though the harmattan also coincided
with declines in infections and epidemics such as smallpox (Dobson and Fothergill, 1781).



                                               6
Several studies have suggested that seasonal dust and dryness might aggravate asthma, carry
disease vectors, dry the skin, irritate the throat and eyes, produce catarrh, lead to cough-
ing and bronchitis, and even give rise to sinusitis, pneumonia, and respiratory infections
(Abdurrahman and Taqi, 1982; Adefolalu, 1984; Quagraine and Boschi, 2008). Websites
and newspapers in West Africa note the existence of these seasonal health issues, as well as
other problems such as the greater prevalence of fires, and provide tips on keeping one’s skin
hydrated.6 Experts, medical staff, and other popular sources of advice suggest individuals
take preventive measures such as wearing thick clothing, staying inside, keeping their food
covered, washing their hands more regularly, tending fires more carefully, and washing their
faces more often.7 Whether this popular knowledge translates into preventive action is less
clear; for many, the harmattan is simply thought of as a nuisance (Adefolalu, 1984), though
the seasonal cold may make business start later in the morning.8 Libraries in Nigeria cope
with the dust by closing windows, dusting library materials, and attacking the insects blown
in with the dust (Ezennia, 1989).
   Economic mechanisms are those that affect the prices, returns, or budget constraints faced
by West Africans. Dust storms may reduce incomes generally by damaging infrastructure,
disrupting flights, reducing rainfall, increasing the frequency of fires, and affecting crop
outputs (e.g. Adetunji et al. (1979); Jenik and Hall (1966)), though there is some evidence
that the harmattan aids soil fertility at the fringes of the Sahara (Adefolalu, 1984). Some of
the most well-known airplane crashes in Nigerian history have occurred during the harmattan
(Abdurrahman and Taqi, 1982). Reduced parental health may impact labor productivity,
and hence income. If infant health is initially harmed by fetal dust exposure, it may reduce
the returns to complementary parental investments or, conversely, increase the urgency of
interventions that might ameliorate these effects (Cunha et al., 2010). Seasonal increases in

patient visits may create problems of congestion and shortages in public health systems that
have limited capacity. Alternatively, dust storms may either increase the costs of accessing
health services, or may prompt a public health response that makes these services more
available.



3         Empirical strategy

To test for the effects of dust exposure during the in utero phase on neonatal, infant, and
child mortality, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the following equation:




                    M ortalityicvym = βDustcvym + x0icvym γ + δcvm + ηcym + icvym .                   (1)


        Here, M ortalityicvtm is an indicator for child i, born in month m in year y, whose mother
is surveyed in cluster v in country c. v can loosely be thought to index “villages.” Neonatal
mortality is death within the first month of life. Infant mortality is within the first twelve
months, and child mortality is within the first 60 months. In the main results, Dustcvym is
the level of dust pollution recorded at the dust point closest to v in the 9 months preceding
month m in year y. Thus, we assume a gestation period of 9 months for all births.9 We use
a cumulative exposure measure, summing the dust reading for each month during gestation.
β is the coefficient of interest, and we expect it to be positive.
        xicvym is a vector of controls. In our preferred specification, it includes average rainfall
9 months prior to birth, average temperature 9 months prior to birth, the squares of these
terms, the interaction between average rainfall and temperature, child birth order, child is
a female, child is a multiple birth, mother’s age at birth, mother’s age at birth squared,
mother’s years of education, and mother’s religion. We acknowledge the concern that dust
    9
    This is unfortunately not a directly testable assumption in our data; however, we do show robustness to
using the full year of exposure prior to birth and controlling for exposure in the year after birth.



                                                    8
pollution could itself affect levels of rainfall and temperature, and so controlling for these
could lead to overadjustment bias (Schisterman et al., 2009). Further, the data we have only
allow us to control for monthly averages, and so we cannot control for degree-day measures
that could capture more subtle nonlinearities. For these reasons, many of the results in our
paper are reported both with and without these weather controls.
   We also include two additional and important sets of fixed effects. First, cluster ×
calendar month of birth fixed effects (δcvm ) account for general seasonal variation in birth
outcomes that may vary across survey clusters. These also absorb any unobserved drivers
of mortality that happen to correlate with dust over space, since they sum to a cluster fixed
effect. Second, country × year-of-birth × month-of-birth fixed effects (ηcym ) account for
time-specific shocks such as economic crises and disease outbreaks. These also account for
other possible unobserved trending variables that may vary over time by country. These
may include, for example, supply-side health initiatives such as immunization campaigns.
   The identification in this paper is accordingly derived from variation in PM2.5 exposure
across children from the same survey cluster whose exposure to dust in utero was determined
by differential birth timing, but cannot be explained away as the effect of other country-by-
year-by-month-specific patterns of unobserved heterogeneity, by village-specific patterns of
seasonality, or by very flexible functions of rainfall and temperature. We cluster standard
errors by dust point; as a robustness exercise we show that clustering by administrative
regions has little effect on the results.
   We also estimate several alternative versions of the above model. For example, to study
heterogeneity in impacts of dust on mortality, we include interactions of dust exposure with
a dummy for the child not being the first born to the mother as a measure of parental
experience. We perform similar heterogeneity tests using a gender dummy and a wealth
index measure. Additionally, to study how the effect of dust on mortality has changed over
time, we include the interaction of time trends with the dust variables. Finally, we interact
dust with national-level measures of economic development (e.g., GNI, poverty gap, % of


                                              9
GDP derived from agriculture, tractors per land area) and health infrastructure (e.g., per
capita health expenditure, % health expenditure out of pocket, maternal mortality rates,
child anemia rates, DPT immunization rates, rural access to safe water) from the World
Bank World Development Indicators to study the degree to which these aggregate indicators
moderate the impact of dust on mortality.
    As discussed above, the physiological pathway by which dust can directly or biologi-
cally impact child health and mortality has been established; however, it is possible that
dust exposure can, in addition, affect incomes, parental investments, and other behavioral
responses, and by way of these mediative factors indirectly impact mortality outcomes fur-
ther. Accordingly, in the above models, we interpret β as the composite effect of dust on
mortality, reflecting the sum of any direct biological impacts and the impacts of any subse-
quent reinforcing or mitigating investments or behaviors on the part of the parents.
    To examine the mediating role of parental investment responses, we also estimate a
version of equation (1) in which we replace the dependent variable with measures of early-
life and at-birth investments as well as health measures later in childhood. To the extent that
we find evidence of impacts of dust on these parental investment responses, our interpretation
of the effect of dust on mortality in our main results, as well as any effect on later childhood
health among survivors, is net of these behavioral responses to dust exposure.



4     Data

In this section, we describe the data sources used in the analysis. Additionally, where
necessary, we describe the construction of the variables of interest.




                                              10
4.1       Dust

We take data on dust from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society
at Columbia University.10 These data are available for the period from August 1985 to
December 2006 at latitude-longitude intervals of 1.25◦ by 1.25◦ . These will allow us to
compute fetal dust exposure for children born between April 1986 and December 2006.
Constructed using NASA satellite measurements, the dust data report hourly concentrations
of P M2.5 , or particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers. We convert these data to
monthly format in order to merge them with the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
datasets described below. Particulate concentrations are reported in hundreds of micrograms
per cubic meter.
       These data are the result of the NMMB/BSC Dust model, which was developed at the
Barcelona Supercomputing Center in collaboration with the NASA Goddard Institute for
Space Studies and the National Centers for Environmental Protection (Pérez et al., 2011).
This model simulates soil dust aerosol emission, which has been validated using existing
satellite and in situ data over this region (Garcı́a-Pando et al., 2014; Pérez et al., 2011).11
Additional information on these data is presented in Stanley (2013). This dust model also
predicts PM10 pollution; hence, while we primarily use PM2.5 as our main dust exposure
variable, we also show our main results using PM10 as the dust variable.


4.2       Demographic and health survey data

Our principal outcomes of interest are taken from 128 DHS datasets from West Africa.
These have been collected from several West African countries since the mid-1980s. We use
all standard West African DHS surveys for which geographic coordinates are available; these
coordinates are needed for merging with the data on dust. Our sample, then, includes Benin,

   11
      The correlation between the soil dust aerosol component of this model and aerosol optical depth (AOD)
is around 0.6 (Ceccato et al., 2014; Pérez et al., 2011).

      the woman’s year of birth, her level of education, whether she lives in a rural area, her
      age, her occupation, the occupation of her partner, and her self-reported religion.

  2. The Births Recodes are complete birth histories of the women surveyed in the individual
      recodes. We use these data for our main results. In particular, we make use of the
      child’s year and month of birth, birth order, an indicator for a multiple birth, a dummy
      for female, and the length of the child’s life.

  3. The Children’s Recodes are similar to the births recodes, but contain a larger amount of
      information about a smaller number of children. Women are asked about births in the
      previous five years. In addition to controls available in the births recodes, these include
      early life investments such as vaccinations and breastfeeding. Additional prenatal
      investments are also recorded, including care from doctors and the circumstances of
      the child’s birth.

  4. The Geographic Datasets record latitude and longitude coordinates for the survey clus-
      ters in the data. We use these coordinates to merge children to the nearest point in
      the dust data, assigning each child the level of dust of the nearest point. These are
      shown in Figure 1.


4.3    Matching DHS to dust data

Figure 1 shows how DHS clusters are matched to their closest dust grid points. Shaded small
dots are DHS clusters (the variation in colors represents how much average dust exposure
these clusters have), while the black larger dots are the dust points on the grid.

 The small, square dots are DHS survey clusters. These are plotted in different shades of grey that
 represent deciles of mean dust, ranging from dark (most dust) to light (least dust). The larger, round,
 black dots are dust points.


4.4     Country-level World Bank Indicators

As discussed above, we introduce World Development Indicators from the World Bank open
access data archives to investigate the degree to which these aggregate factors moderate dust
impacts on mortality. These data are often recorded only intermittently for each country
in our primary dataset. Accordingly, we impute missing values for each variable with the
nearest future value recorded. This allows us to use as many observations as possible. We
check that all results using these data are robust to restriction to only unimputed data as well.
The indicators used fall into two broad categories: economic development (GNI, poverty gap,
% of GDP derived from agriculture, tractors per land area) and health infrastructure (per
capita health expenditure, % health expenditure out of pocket, maternal mortality rates,
child anemia rates, DPT immunization rates, rural access to safe water).

4.5    Summary statistics

Table 1 shows the summary statistics used in this paper. Infant mortality over the births in
our data during the 1986-2006 period for all the countries considered averages 11.2%. Child
mortality is relatively high in this region, even by the standard of developing countries.
However, as Figure 2 suggests, most countries in our data set have experienced substantial
declines in infant mortality over this period. Figure 2 also suggests substantial heterogeneity
in infant mortality across West African nations: some of the lowest rates are seen in Ghana
and Senegal (averages of 7.7% and 8.1% respectively), while the highest averages are seen in
Mali and Niger (13.8% and 13.3% respectively).

                                              Figure 3: PM2.5




 Graphs show PM2.5 concentrations averaged for the sample at the year x month level, showing raw
 levels as well as residuals derived from removing fixed effects as indicated in the figure.


      The average monthly PM2.5 concentration is around 44µg/m3 over the entire sample.12
To put this in perspective, the average annual PM2.5 concentration in Southern California
was 20 in 1999 (EPA), while the recent estimates from New Delhi put its annual PM2.5
concentration at 153 (WHO 2014). However, this average measure hides substantial within-
year variation in PM 2.5. As Figure 3 suggests, there are stark seasonal patterns in PM2.5,
with the highs typically observed January through April. Despite anecdotal evidence that
the harmattan is becoming more severe over time or that it now reaches parts of West Africa
that were unaffected within living memory (e.g. Abdurrahman and Taqi (1982)), Figure 3
shows that for the sample period (1986-2006) there appears to be no obvious yearly trend
 12
      That is, 4.11 × 100 (Table 1 reports 100s of µg/m3 ) × 91 (i.e. per month in utero).

in PM2.5 levels.
       Table 1 also shows some of the key characteristics of mothers in our sample. Mothers
overall have low levels of education (an average of 1.6 years), and are young. The average
age at the child’s birth is nearly 26 years, but note that the average birth order observed in
the data is 3, suggesting women typically have 3 children by age 26 in the sample. We show
robustness to controlling for these characteristics in our main results as attributes such as
maternal education and age can have associations with child health.



5        Results

Table 2 shows the effects of in utero dust exposure on neonatal (within 28 days of birth),
infant (within a year of birth), and child (within 5 years of birth) mortality. The results
indicate that there is little evidence of impacts of dust on mortality in the first month,
but there are substantial effects on both infant and child death. Comparing results across
columns, we find that including controls for rainfall and temperature exposure over the same
period increase the magnitude and significance of the impacts of dust exposure; however,
the inclusion of additional controls for child and mother characteristics has little impact on
the effect size and precision, suggesting that it is unlikely that omitted variables correlated
with dust exposure are driving our results (Altonji et al., 2005).13
       We focus our interpretation of magnitudes now on the results for infant mortality as
the interpretation of the coefficients for child mortality are similar. Column 6 of Table 2
shows that the effect of a one standard deviation increase in in utero PM2.5 leads to a 1.09
percentage point increase in infant mortality, or roughly 9.7% of the mean.14 The following
thought experiment helps to put the magnitude of the estimate impacts in perspective: con-
  13
     In additional results (not reported), we control for the number of battle deaths during the in utero period
within 100km of the child’s survey cluster as reported by the UCDP Geo-referenced Event Dataset (UCDP
GED) version 2.0. This has little effect on the results. Battle deaths data only begin in 1989, which reduces
the sample.
  14
     To see this, multiply the standard deviation of cumulative dust exposure from Table 1 (1.52) by the
coefficient (7.170) and divide by 10 to convert from deaths per 1,000 to percentage points.

sider reducing exposure to levels deemed acceptable by the EPA’s PM2.5 national standards
in the US (15µg/m3 ). This would reduce total exposure over an entire pregnancy from a
mean of 411 µg/m3 to 135 µg/m3 , reducing infant mortality by 1.98 percentage points, or
17.8% of the mean.15
       We can put these results in the context of other interventions or environmental shocks
considered in the literature as well. Our estimates are smaller than some in the literature, but
still comparable. These include the 3.27 percent decline in American infant mortality due to
reductions in the use of bituminous coal for heating (Barreca et al., 2016); the 3.5 percentage
point increase in mortality due to a six-month malaria epidemic (Kudamatsu et al., 2012);
the 1.8 percentage point effect of democratization in Africa (Kudamatsu, 2012); the elasticity
of rural infant mortality with respect to aggregate income of -0.33 in India (Bhalotra, 2010);
or the 7.3% annual mortality increase due to a one standard deviation increase in high
temperature days in India (Burgess et al., 2014).
       On the other hand, our estimates are of equal or larger magnitude to those found in
a few closely related studies. The effect we find of a one standard deviation increase in
dust exposure is similar to the 1.2 percent effect on cohort size of wildfires in Indonesia
(Jayachandran, 2009). While Arceo-Gomez et al. (2016) find that a 100 µg/m3 increase in
PM10 in Mexico City increases deaths by 0.23 per 1000, our results suggest that the same
increase in PM2.5 would increase fetal death by 7.170 per 1000. In Appendix Table A1, we
replace PM2.5 measures with PM10. We find a corresponding effect of 1.444 that compares
directly to their estimate of 0.23.16 Our effect is also larger than the 0.24 to 0.40 deaths per
thousand brought on by a 1% decline in GDP in poor countries (Baird et al., 2011) or the
insignificant effect of air regulation in India (Greenstone and Hanna, 2014).
       In the bottom panel of Table 2, we check that in utero dust exposure is indeed the

     To see this, multiply the reduced dust exposure (276) by 100 , since dust is measured in 100s of µg/m3
in the regression. Multiply this by the coefficient 7.170 and divide by 10 to convert from deaths per 1,000
to percentage points.
  16
     More precisely, they report that a 1 µg/m3 increase in PM10 in Mexico city increases deaths by 0.23
per 100,000.

driving force behind our main results and is not simply a proxy for dust experienced after
birth by including dust exposure after birth as an additional control. When using neonatal
or infant mortality as an outcome, we control for dust in the first year of life (columns 1-6).
When using child mortality as an outcome, we control for dust in the first five years of life
(column 7-9). We use fixed blocks of time to compute this exposure, even for children who
die before the block of time has ended. In both cases, the main effect of dust in utero remains
significant and of nearly identical magnitude to those in the top panel. The effect of dust
during the first year of life on infant mortality is statistically insignificant. Controlling for
PM2.5 during the first 60 months of life does not diminish the effect of in utero dust on child
mortality, but does have its own independent effect on the probability that a child dies.17


5.1       Mechanisms

While it is beyond the scope of this study, and beyond the limitations of the available data,
to disentangle all possible mechanisms, we can use heterogeneous treatment impacts and
the responses of additional outcomes to help reduce the set of plausible explanations and to
understand some possible policy implications regarding the mitigation of dust effects.


5.1.1      Heterogeneous response

Table 3 explores heterogeneity in the impacts of dust on infant and child mortality. In the
top panel, we interact dust exposure with a dummy for the child not being the first born to
the mother. This serves as a proxy for parental experience. If we believe that parents with
greater experience might be better able to respond to dust exposure with impact mitigating
behaviors, we would expect that impacts would be smaller for later born children. Indeed,
we find that impacts of dust on mortality are almost completely offset for later-born children.
       Next, we interact in utero dust exposure with gender. We find that the dust impacts are
larger for girls, but only with respect to child mortality. Given that medical research suggests
  17
    We have tested whether in utero dust exacerbates the effects of dust after birth. The interaction is
positive but insignificant (not reported).

                                                  18
that male fetuses are more fragile than females, gender heterogeneity in the biological impacts
of dust are unlikely to produce these results (Gualtieri and Hicks, 1985; Kraemer, 2000).
Gender-biased survival could be contributing to the observed heterogeneity. That is, if only
relatively healthy boys survived to birth (or past the first year of life), this could explain their
relatively better post-birth outcomes (see Dagnelie et al. (2018) for an example). However,
we find no evidence of this; we show below in Appendix Table A8 that there is no evidence
that dust impacts the gender composition of births. Finally, gender heterogeneity in child
mortality could be due to gender-biased parental investments in early-life. We show evidence
below of compensating investments that offset the effects of dust exposure, but in additional
heterogeneity results (reported in Appendix Table A9) we find no evidence of compensatory
investment responses being weaker for girls.
       In the next three panels, we include additional interaction terms with variables that
proxy for maternal experience. In particular, we include mother’s age, mother’s education,
and dust exposure of the first-born sibling. The maternal experience interpretation we give
above is supported in the sign of the interaction between maternal age and dust, which
is negative and significant. It is not, however, confirmed in the interactions of maternal
education or dust exposure of the older sibling. Both interactions are small and statistically
insignificant.
       We also report results for heterogeneity by wealth. Though we find no evidence of het-
erogeneity by wealth in infant mortality, the effect of dust on child mortality is significantly
reduced for children whose households are wealthier, according to the DHS’s wealth index.18
These results are consistent with wealthier households being more able to respond to dust
shocks with compensatory investments, with these investments more likely to be reflected in
later childhood mortality.
       Finally, we interact dust exposure with a rural dummy. We find that the response of
  18
    This index is made available in the DHS data and is not constructed by the authors. It aggregates the
assets owned by the household using factor analysis. A greater score on the index indicates ownership of
more items such as radios or motorcycles. We lose sample size in this specification because it is missing for
a large number of observations.


                                                     19
infant mortality to a given amount of dust exposure is greater in rural areas. That is,
the interaction of rural status and dust in utero is positive. This suggests that, though
urban areas might be more polluted, offsetting factors such as better access to public health
investments dominate in these places.


5.2       Behavioral responses and other outcomes

Having established a reduced form effect of PM2.5 on infant mortality and its robustness,
we next document whether this effect is mediated by behavioral responses of parents. The
top panel of Table 4 examines whether dust exposure in utero affects subsequent parental
investment choices. We find that greater dust exposure leads to greater health investments,
particularly in early life.
       Parental investment responses to dust exposure can arise from two primary sources.
First, this could be a result of greater access to health care after a high dust period. If high
dust periods are followed by government or NGO intervention to increase the availability of
services such as health centers, this could explain part of the effect. The second explanation
could arise from the idea that parents invest more in weaker children in the post natal period.
This “compensatory” or mitigating behavior contrasts with the “reinforcing” behavior of
parents found in some developing country settings where parents have limited resources and
choose to invest only in children with the highest “potential” (Adhvaryu and Nyshadham,
2016; Almond and Mazumder, 2013; Bharadwaj et al., 2017).19
       The middle panel of Table 4 examines these behavioral responses further and provides
more direct evidence about the relative importance of “access,” relative to post-birth parental
responses. We find less evidence of impacts on prenatal and at-birth investments, such as
antenatal visits for pregnancy and delivery in a hospital. We only find significant impacts on
BCG vaccination which need not be administered at birth, but rather can be administered
  19
    Our results are suggestive of compensatory investment, but our data do not allow us to evaluate whether
parents respond specifically to the shock that affects the child (in this case, dust exposure) or to revealed
child health after birth (such as low birth weight or bouts of illness).



                                                     20
up to 6 weeks after birth. Since the prenatal and at-birth investment decisions are made
before the child is born, this would capture the effect of dust events on access to health
centers that provide vaccinations and on access to doctors who can attend to the delivery.
Rather, it is postnatal investments (vaccinations) that respond in Table 4. This is suggestive
of parents undertaking compensatory investments once child quality is revealed, rather than
facing greater access to investments or anticipating health effects to which they will later
need to respond.
   Even with compensating investments after birth, it is possible that the impacts of dust
exposure will not be completely offset and will still result in lower health even if the child
survives. This is explored in the bottom panel of Table 4, where we examine the role of in
utero dust exposure on various measures of early childhood health among survivors. Many of
these measures, notably weight for height, weight for age, and height for age represent mea-
sures of nutrition and respond negatively. Birthweight responds negatively, but is estimated
less precisely due to the smaller available sample for this outcome.
   Lastly, we check whether the evidence of smaller impacts of dust on mortality among later
born children presented in Table 3 is in part driven by stronger compensatory investment
responses by these more experienced parents. Table 5 reports estimates of heterogeneous
impacts of in utero dust exposure on subsequent parental investment responses and health
measures for surviving children. Indeed, we find that compensatory investment responses
are stronger for non-first-born children. Furthermore, we find some suggestive evidence of
compensatory responses in prenatal and at-birth investments as well, consistent with parents
being more able to predict adverse impacts of dust exposure after accumulating experience
with previous children. Nevertheless, we do not find evidence that these stronger com-
pensatory responses lead to better subsequent health outcomes among later-born surviving
children.




                                             21
5.3     Effects over time and across countries

Having established the basic result that dust exposure is harmful to children and that direct
biological impacts are only partially offset by parental responses, we next exploit the fact
that our data spans 20 years between 1986-2006 to see how the impact of dust on mortality
has changed over time.

                                 Figure 4: Effects of dust over time




 Equation (2) is estimated for each year and the coefficients on dust and associated confidence intervals
 are plotted.



   Figure 4 shows estimates of the effects of dust on infant mortality for each year in our
sample. Because this prevents us from including some base controls such as year fixed effects
or trends, we estimate a more parsimonious specification:


                  M ortalityicvym = βy Dustcvym + x0icvym γ + δcm + φct + icvym .                          (2)

Each point on Figure 4 is a regression coefficient of the effect of in utero exposure on infant

                                                    22
mortality for a given year, or βy . For each estimate, the sample includes only children born
in that year. φct is a fixed effect for the DHS survey conducted in year t in country c; in our
baseline regression, this is absorbed by the fixed effects for survey clusters. Other variables
and parameters are as in our baseline specification.
      Figure 4 shows a clear pattern of a decline in the impact of dust on mortality. The impact
of dust appears to decrease by more than half over this time period. Table 6 confirms these
effects by showing an interaction of dust exposure with a linear time trend; the interaction
is negative, statistically significant, and shows a rapidly diminishing effect. This finding
suggests adaptation, other supply-side health responses, or health technology improvements
over time that have helped attenuate these negative impacts.
      A more direct test of this is in Figure 5, in which we interact dust with various country-
level World Development Indicators from the World Bank, in sequence. We investigate
the degree to which two groups of macroeconomic factors moderate the impacts of dust on
mortality: economic development (GNI, poverty gap, % of GDP derived from agriculture,
tractors per land area) and health infrastructure (per capita health expenditure, % health
expenditure out of pocket, maternal mortality rates, child anemia rates, DPT immunization
rates, rural access to safe water). Figure 5 shows that countries with higher economic de-
velopment (GNI), more mechanized agriculture (tractors), higher health expenditure, and
greater public health resources (DPT immunization) exhibit smaller impacts of dust on mor-
tality. On the other hand, countries with a higher out of pocket share of health expenditure, a
larger poverty gap, and higher child anemia rates exhibit larger impacts of dust on mortality.
The indicator variables are standardized across countries and time to make coefficients more
comparable. That is, GNI, maternal mortality, access to safe water, and health expenditure
have the strongest moderating effects for one standard deviation changes.20
      To better compare the relative importance of economic factors and health infrastructure
measures in moderating impacts of dust on mortality, we construct mean effects measures

for each group and use these in the same heterogeneity specifications. The mean effects
measures are standard normal transformations of linear indices of the variables in each set of
factors, with exacerbating measures reoriented to allow the mean effects to be interpreted as
summarily mitigating measures. That is, the economic mean effect measure is constructed
by adding GNI and tractors and subtracting poverty gap and agricultural intensity, with
all variables having been normalized to be N (0, 1) before aggregation. Table 7 shows that,
while both improvements in economic and health factors are associated with smaller impacts
of dust on mortality, health factors are more strongly mitigative. In fact, in columns 1 and 4
we see that, when including both economic and health mean effects in the same regression,



                                                                                                                  24
health factors continue to significantly mitigate dust impacts, but economic factors no longer
seem to matter. These results suggest that improvements in health infrastructure might
help to alleviate impacts of dust exposure; perhaps, more so even than general economic
development. It is possible that improvements in health infrastructure contributes to the
attenuation in dust impacts on mortality over time depicted in Figure 4 and Table 6.21
       Lastly, we demonstrate robustness of the analysis of impacts over time to functional
form, ensuring that secular trends in mortality as a whole are not driving this evidence of
adaptation. We collapse the data to the region × month of birth × year of birth level, and
construct a dependent variable equaling the natural log of the proportion of live births who
died in infancy (0-1 years) or childhood (0-5 years). We regress this variable on our regressor
of interest (in utero dust exposure) as well as the same controls used in the baseline analysis.
The coefficient on dust exposure then tells us the percent impact on mortality (as opposed to
the impact expressed in percentage points that results from the baseline specification). We
also interact the dust exposure variable with the child’s year of birth to test for differential
impacts across cohorts (i.e., across time). The main advantage of doing the time analysis in
this modified specification is that we are able to test whether the effect of dust on mortality
was changing in percentage terms. This is important because, while we know that the impact
of dust is declining over time in levels, the overall rates of infant and child mortality also
declined dramatically during this period. Thus, it is not clear that there was a percentage
decline in the impact from the baseline analysis; but the present analysis allows us to test
precisely for this differential percentage impact. Note that the year of birth is normalized to
0 for the first cohort in our sample for ease of interpretation.
       Table 8 displays the results of this analysis. With no additional controls, there is a positive
(3.8 percent) but insignificant effect of in utero dust exposure on infant mortality; the impact
on child mortality is slightly larger, about 5.5 percent, and significant at the 5 percent level.
When country by year trends are added, precision in the main effect specification diminishes,
  21
   We unfortunately cannot test for this specifically, given that we have limited data on changes in these
macroeconomic conditions over time.


                                                   25
but in specifications capturing impacts over time, for both infant and child mortality, there
is a large and significant impact (9-10 percent) on both infant and child mortality in early
cohorts. This impact declines considerably with time. The linear time interaction shown
here indicates that for each additional year, the impact on mortality declines by more than
half a percent. These results confirm the hypothesis that not only is the size of the mortality
impact declining over time, but it is declining in percentage terms as well, despite the fact
that mean infant and child mortality rates declined across most of the countries studied
during our sample period.


5.4     Additional Checks

5.4.1   Robustness checks

In Table 9, we consider alternative sets of fixed effects. Our aim is to show that restricting
identification to narrowly-defined comparison groups continues to yield our main results,
even if we change the definition of the group used. In column 1, we include fixed effects for
country × month of birth, for year of birth, and for DHS Cluster, alongside country linear
time trends. In column 2, we add country-specific quadratic time trends to this. In column
3, we add DHS survey fixed effects (specific to country and year of survey) and replace DHS
cluster × month fixed effects with dust point ID fixed effects. Column 4 adds country × year
of birth × month of birth fixed effects along with dust point ID fixed effects and DHS survey
fixed effects. In column 5, we restrict comparisons to siblings by including fixed effects for
mothers, alongside fixed effects for country × year of birth and country × month of birth.
Finally, in column 6, we add cluster × month of birth effects. Overall, the results are of the
same sign and magnitude as our main results and remain, in general, statistically significant.
   We perform several additional tests for robustness in the Appendix. The sign and sig-
nificance of our results are largely replicable when we replace PM2.5 measures with PM10
measures in Appendix Table A1. Appendix Table A1 is organized the same way as Table 2
(omitting the middle columns with weather controls but no additional controls) and shows

                                              26
that PM10 exposure in utero leads to greater infant and child mortality. The magnitudes
are smaller. This is to be expected, as PM2.5 is known to cause greater harm (Schwartz and
Neas, 2000).22
       In Appendix Table A2 we show that alternative definitions of in utero dust exposure
provide similar results. It is possible, for example, that it is the intensity of exposure rather
than its mean that matters (e.g. Hansman et al. (2015)). High dust exposure measured
instead as the number of months in which dust exposure was at least one standard deviation
above the cluster average predicts a statistically significant increase in both infant and child
mortality. Similar results are obtained if the dust level during the month of greatest exposure
during pregnancy or the log of accumulated dust are used. Controlling for dust variability
(the standard deviation of monthly dust exposure in utero) does not render our main result
on accumulated dust insignificant; nor does controlling for the dust level during the month
of greatest exposure.
       In Appendix Table A3, we account for the fact that the spatial resolution of the dust data
is more coarse than that in the DHS in two ways. First, we weight observations by the inverse
of the distance to the nearest dust point. Second, rather than joining each DHS cluster to the
nearest point in the dust data, we use bilinear interpolation to assign it a weighted average
of the dust recorded at the four dust points that surround it. Both exercises give results
very similar to our baseline.
       In Table A4, we show that our results are not dependent on a linear specification. Using
deciles of dust exposure shows that, relative to the omitted, lowest-exposure decile, higher
treatments of in utero dust raise mortality, particularly in the three greatest deciles. Ap-
pendix Table A5 explores the sensitivity of the results to excluding survey clusters in which
dust exposure is greatest or lowest. Throughout, our results remain stable. The effect is
larger in the clusters where mean dust exposure is greater, consistent with the possibility
that mothers exposed to greater dust over their lifetimes are more vulnerable to exposure in
  22
     The strong correlation between PM2.5 and PM10 dust prevents us from disentangling their relative
effects in the same empirical specification (Brook et al., 1997).


                                                 27
utero, or with the possibility that in utero dust exposure makes children more vulnerable to
later dust exposure in childhood.
   In Appendix Table A6, we disaggregate dust exposure by trimester. The magnitude and
significance of dust exposure in the first trimester are greater than exposure for the second
and third trimesters. This is consistent with other studies that have found larger effects
on mortality, birth weight, and later-life outcomes for insults occurring early in pregnancy
(Almond and Mazumder, 2011; Camacho, 2008). This also suggests that nutrition is not the
sole source of the effects we find, as fetal health is particularly sensitive to nutrition in the
final trimester (Almond et al., 2011).
   In Appendix Table A7, we show that our results are robust to clustering by administrative
region as recorded in the DHS, rather than the nearest point in the dust data. These regions
are typically second-level administrative units such as provinces and states. Indeed, standard
errors are largely indistinguishable using this approach.
   In Table A10, we replicate the main results removing one country at a time from the
sample. The coefficient estimates are fairly stable in terms of magnitude and precision, with
the exceptions of the removal of Nigeria and Niger, both of which cause the estimates to
shrink slightly (though these are not significantly different from the other estimates).
   The countries in our sample were not all surveyed the same number of times, nor were
they all surveyed in the same years. However, this creates only minor changes in sample
composition over time, because our main data consists of retrospective birth histories. A
child in our data may be born in the survey year or in any prior year. In Figure A1 in the
appendix, we show the share of births in each year that come from each of the countries in
our data. It is clear from this figure that there is not much evidence of major changes in
the sample over time. There are two minor exceptions to this. First, since the most recent
survey we can use from Togo took place in 1998, this country ceases to be a part of the
dataset after that year. Second, the most recent DHS surveys from Nigeria have had large
sample sizes, and so that country is a growing share of the sample in more recent years.


                                               28
   Because the location we code for the child is based on the mother’s location at the time of
the survey, this could introduce potential measurement error in dust exposure. In Table A13
in the appendix, we restrict the sample to mothers who have never moved from their current
place of residence – a question that is asked directly in the DHS. This restricted sample
yields similar results in magnitude to our baseline results, although with less precision. The
loss of precision is as expected, since the sample size is nearly halved. This suggests, first,
that selective out-migration or measurement error based on using current GIS data from
the DHS do not bias our results. Second, it is evident that the effect of dust exposure for
those incapable of migration as an avoidance behavior is not different from that of the whole
sample.
   While our principal specifications account for birth order, they do not account for sibship
size. In Table A14 in the appendix, we take three different approaches to address this. First,
we restrict the data to only first births, since these pose no issues with replacement fertility.
Second, we include sibship size fixed effects. Third, we add an interaction between sibship
size and dust exposure. This table broadly suggests that sibship size considerations are not a
major factor in explaining our results. Restricting the sample to first births lowers precision
due to a drastic reduction in sample size.


5.4.2     Selective fertility and survival to birth

Two forms of sample selection might be contributing to some portion of our results: selective
survival of only some fetuses to term, and selection of the types of parents whose fertility
coincides with variations in dust exposure. The DHS do not collect information on miscar-
riages in a way that would permit us to directly measure whether death in utero responds
to dust exposure. However, the fact that our estimated effects are similar when controlling
for mother fixed effects in Table A9 above suggests that selection by parental characteristics
is unlikely to explain our results.
   Further, we perform analyses similar to those in Buckles and Hungerman (2013), demon-

strating that neither parental characteristics nor child characteristics correlate with dust.
These include child gender, child birth order, whether the child is a twin or other multiple

                                                    30
birth, the mother’s age, and the mother’s education (as well as dummies for less-than-primary
school completion and less-than-university completion). In particular, we report estimates
of (1) with these variables as outcomes in Appendix Table A8, though without controlling
for individual or maternal characteristics. We find no evidence that dust exposure pre-
dicts pre-determined characteristics, making selective fertility an unlikely explanation of our
results.
    Finally, in Figure 6, we provide additional evidence that selective fertility does not explain
our results. First, we plot the relative frequency of births in each month, separately for
clusters defined by quintiles of mean dust. Second, we plot the average education of mothers
for the births recorded in each month. This too is by quintile of mean dust exposure. In the
first figure, it is clear that there is a seasonal pattern to fertility in the data, but it is not one
that differs across regions heavily affected by dust pollution and those that are not. Indeed,
the pattern in births across the year appears nearly identical for the highest and lowest
mean dust clusters with median dust clusters showing the strongest seasonality, though
largely similar to other quintiles. In the second case, though there are static differences in
education of mothers across clusters, these are netted out by geographic fixed effects in all
of our regression specifications. Importantly, there is no evidence of seasonal variations in
the characteristics of mothers, let alone any differential seasonality that might correlate with
dust.



6       Conclusion

This paper shows that PM2.5 dust in West Africa has an economically meaningful and
statistically significant impact on infant mortality during the years 1986-2006. While many
papers have studied the impacts of in utero pollution exposure on early life health, our paper
makes additional contributions to this literature.
    First, by examining these effects in the context of developing countries, we highlight



                                                 31
the greater vulnerability of people with fewer resources to adopt avoidance behavior against
dust. Second, we examine parental responses, both in the prenatal and in the post natal
stages to show evidence suggesting that dust pollution in this context can be mitigated in
part by investments shaped by compensating parental behaviors or direct access to health
centers and doctors. Third, we examine the effects of dust over time and by country-level
measures of macroeconomic conditions and public health infrastructure.
   We find a steady decline in the impacts of dust over time. In the absence of a reduction
in dust itself, this suggests that people and countries are adapting over time in some way to
attenuate the harmful effects of dust. The analysis of country-level indicators as moderators
of the dust impact suggests that this attenuation in impacts may be due to economic devel-
opment and improvements in public health infrastructure, with health-related improvements
exhibiting a stronger mitigating role. We also find evidence at the individual level that
implies some role for parental experience in behavioral adaptation. We find that children
born to more experienced parents (that is, non-first-born children) are less susceptible to the
deleterious effects of dust and are also more likely to receive compensatory investments at
birth and in early life.
