Broadening Focus: Spillovers, Complementarities and Specialization in the Hospital Industry

                                              ABSTRACT

The long-standing argument that focused operations outperform others stands in contrast to claims
about the benefits of broader operational scope. The performance benefits of focus are typically attributed
to reduced complexity, lower uncertainty, and the development of specialized expertise, while the
benefits of greater breadth are linked to the economies of scope achieved by sharing common resources,
such as advertising or production capacity, across activities. Within the literature on corporate strategy,
this tension between focus and breadth is reconciled by the concept of related diversification (i.e.,
a firm with multiple operating units, each specializing in distinct but related activities). We consider
whether there are similar benefits to related diversification within an operating unit and examine the
mechanism that generates these benefits. Using the empirical context of cardiovascular care within
hospitals, we first examine the relationship between a hospital’s level of specialization in cardiovascular
care and the quality of its clinical performance on cardiovascular patients. We find that, on average,
focus has a positive effect on quality performance. We then distinguish between positive spillovers
and complementarities to examine: (1) the extent to which a hospital’s specialization in areas related
to cardiovascular care directly impacts performance on cardiovascular patients (positive spillovers)
and (2) whether the marginal benefit of a hospital’s focus in cardiovascular care depends on the degree
to which the hospital “co-specializes” in related areas (complementarities). In our setting, we find
evidence of such complementarities in specialization.

         A key tension facing many firms concerns the optimal scope of their operations. The benefits of

operational specialization, or focus, in terms of lower cost or higher quality are widely discussed in both

manufacturing (Skinner, 1974) and service (Heskett, 1986) settings. Leveraging operational focus has

been offered as a rationale for decisions ranging from the use of contract manufacturers by consumer

electronics companies to the use of a single type of aircraft by low-cost airlines or the dedication of an

entire hospital to patients undergoing a single surgical procedure. In fact, the “law of factory focus” has

been cited as a key component of received wisdom in the field of operations management (Schmenner

and Swink, 1998). Despite this broad support for operational focus, some observers have noted that

seemingly unfocused operations perform at a high level (Ketokivi and Jokinen, 2006) and that a broader

range of activities may, in fact, increase firm value (Teece, 1980; Panzar and Willig, 1981; Teece et al.,

1994; Villalonga, 2004).

         Some reconciliation of these views may be found in the concept of related diversification, which

argues that expanding scope into related businesses increases firm value while broader diversification

into unrelated businesses may reduce it (Rumelt, 1974). The implicit assumption in this literature is that

related diversification yields a firm with multiple operating units—each specializing in a distinct set of

activities—and that the specialties of these units are related to each other. In this paper, we consider

whether the benefits of related diversification also exist within operating units themselves.1 Specifically,

we ask whether a focused operating unit can be “too focused”. To the extent that there are benefits to

related diversification within an operating unit, we offer an empirical approach for identifying the source

of those benefits.

         Studies of related diversification at the corporate level tend to attribute the benefits of

diversification to economies of scope, which Panzar and Willig (1981) define as occurring when “…it is

less costly to combine two or more product lines in one firm than to produce them separately.”

Economies of scope, however, may emerge from two sources that we aim to isolate in this study: positive

1
 Schilling et al. (2003), Boh et al. (2007), and Narayanan et al. (2009) consider whether there are benefits to
engaging in related activities at the level of small groups and individuals. We discuss this work in greater detail
below.


                                                                                                                      2
spillovers and complementarities. Roberts (2004) defines these concepts by noting, “…complementarity

is conceptually different from a positive spillover. A positive spillover occurs when the overall benefit

from some activity (rather than the returns to increasing the activity) is increasing in the level of the other

activity.” (p. 73) Because of our interest in the effects of focus, our study tests for the presence of positive

spillovers and complementarities based not on an operating unit’s absolute level of specific activities but

on its level of specialization in those activities. Despite this difference, the conceptual definitions and

intuition provided by Roberts carry through to our setting.

        A common type of positive spillover is what Markides and Williamson (1994) refer to

synonymously as the “asset amortization” or “static economies of scope” benefit of related

diversification. That is, positive spillovers may simply be economies of scale that exist across different

activities rather than within a single activity. Such economies may appear as either reductions in average

cost (due to the amortization of fixed investments) or improvements in average quality (due to leveraging

intangible assets, such as know-how). In either case, a positive spillover occurs when increased

specialization in a related business segment has a direct benefit on operational performance in a focal

business segment that is independent of the operating unit’s level of specialization in the focal segment.

        Complementarities, on the other hand, exist if increased specialization in a related business

segment has an indirect benefit on operational performance in a focal business segment by increasing the

marginal benefit of specializing more in the focal activity (Milgrom and Roberts 1990, 1994, and 1995).

Complementarity thus implies that the benefits of related diversification may not be simply due to sharing

fixed assets but also to the fact that a related activity improves performance of the focal activity at the

margin. In other words, complementarity suggests a positive interdependence between levels of

specialization in focal and related activities.

        To clarify further the distinction between these two sources of scope economies, we turn to an

example from the setting we examine in this study—hospitals. Consider a hospital that only treats

cardiovascular patients but faces declining demand for cardiovascular services. In the interest of

amortizing fixed investments that it has made in assets such as hospital beds, operating rooms, and


                                                                                                               3
diagnostic services (e.g., radiology), the hospital may decide to add other clinical service lines outside of

cardiovascular care (e.g., endocrinology or respiratory medicine). To the extent that these other service

lines directly improve the quality—or reduce the cost—of treating cardiovascular patients regardless of

the hospital’s level of specialization in cardiovascular care, they exert a positive spillover on

cardiovascular care. For example, adding these new clinical services to a cardiovascular hospital may

bring clinicians with general knowledge that can directly benefit the hospital’s performance on

cardiovascular patients (e.g., a new approach to reducing the rate of hospital-acquired infections that

benefits many types of patients, including those with cardiovascular disease).

        On the other hand, the addition of clinical specialists in these new service lines would exert a

complementarity with respect to cardiovascular care to the extent that they give cardiovascular specialists

access to new sources of knowledge and insight about related conditions (e.g., many patients with

cardiovascular illness suffer from diabetes, a key area of focus for endocrinologists). This knowledge

may help cardiovascular specialists interpret and encode their own specialized experiences with

cardiovascular patients (Levitt and March, 1988). The increased individual and organizational attention

(Ocasio, 1997) on these new service lines is likely to provide the context for greater formal and informal

interaction among clinicians in related specialties (e.g., the “curbside consultations” described extensively

in the medical literature (Manian and Janssen, 1996; Kuo, et al., 1998; Bergus, et al., 2000)). To the

extent that the presence of new service lines increases the performance associated with any given level of

cardiovascular specialization, those services exert a complementarity with respect to cardiovascular care.

In such cases, there are benefits to “co-specialization” in cardiovascular care and the new service lines.

        The empirical literature on the impact of focus on performance has considered a range of

performance measures including cost, productivity, customer satisfaction, and quality. In our context, a

critical measure of performance—and that for which we have reliable information—is quality

performance. Consistent with prior work examining focus in health care settings, we begin our inquiry by

asking whether an operating unit that is more focused on a given activity achieves higher quality

performance (i.e., higher output quality) with respect to that activity than a less-focused unit engaged in


                                                                                                                4
the same activity (e.g., Cram et al., 2005; Young et al., 2005; Greenwald et al., 2006; Kc and Terwiesch,

2009). We continue by testing for the benefits of related diversification; that is, whether the composition

of a unit's other activities (i.e., outside of the focal area) impacts quality performance in the focal area. In

so doing, we contribute to the literature on specialization and related diversification by separately

measuring the extent of positive spillovers and complementarities. This latter line of inquiry allows us to

examine whether and how the benefits of focusing on a particular activity depend on the degree to which

an organization is also relatively specialized (i.e., “co-specialized”) in related activities.

         We consider these issues by examining the delivery of cardiovascular care within hospitals. We

recognize that a hospital can be characterized as either an operating unit or a multi-unit firm.

Nevertheless, as circumscribed facilities, most hospitals can be viewed as operating units, akin to plants in

the manufacturing context. We have chosen our empirical setting for several reasons. First, hospitals

tend to provide services across a range of clinical areas (i.e., business segments) such as cardiovascular

care, cancer, orthopedics, and obstetrics. These segments appear in different proportions and

combinations across facilities. For example, a given hospital may devote a substantial share of resources

to cardiovascular care while allocating comparatively less attention or fewer resources to obstetrics.

Conversely, another hospital may be characterized by a significant focus in obstetrics with relatively little

cardiovascular care.

         Second, hospital discharge data includes information on every patient in a particular hospital.

This characteristic of the data allows us to measure the degree to which a given hospital focuses on a

clinical area (e.g., cardiovascular services) as a continuous variable based on the percentage of its total

operational activity dedicated to that clinical area.2 This continuity is particularly useful in testing for

complementarities based on the degree to which the marginal benefit of a given level of focus in one

business segment increases as the share of activity devoted to related segments increases. Third, there are


2
 Measuring focus as a continuous, rather than discrete, variable implies that an operating unit need not be dedicated
solely to one activity (or set of activities) to be considered “focused”. For example, a unit that is 40% dedicated to a
particular activity—with no other activity accounting for a similarly large portion of the unit’s effort—is relatively
focused on the first activity.


                                                                                                                       5
clear and objective measures of quality performance, specifically a hospital’s risk-adjusted mortality rate

for cardiovascular patients.

         Finally, specialization is particularly relevant in the hospital industry, where many observers have

noted the value of delivering health care through organizations focused around the needs of patients with

specific diseases (Herzlinger, 1997; Porter and Teisberg, 2006, 2007; Christensen et al., 2009). In fact, the

rise of single-specialty hospitals—a large portion of which focus on cardiovascular care—has led to

significant debate over the value of such facilities. This debate centers on whether such facilities

outperform traditional “general” hospitals (Herzlinger, 1997, 2000; Dwyer, 2000; Ginsburg, 2000).

Consistent with the spirited nature of this debate, the empirical studies on this topic offer mixed findings

(Cram et al., 2005; Schneider et al., 2005; Young et al., 2005; Greenwald et al., 2006; Barro et al., 2006;

Hwang et al., 2007; Nallamothu et al., 2007; Carey et al., 2008; Hyer et al., 2009; Kc and Terwiesch,

2009). Overall, this stream of literature highlights the importance of determining how hospitals should

balance specializing in a single clinical area with building expertise in other areas.



Theory and Hypotheses

         The idea that specialization, or focus, improves performance by reducing complexity and

leveraging task repetition dates back to Smith’s (1776) example of the pin factory and is later captured in

the work of Fayol (1916) and Taylor (1911). Though containing implications for operating units or entire

organizations, these early arguments largely center on the performance of the individual worker. March

and Simon (1958) note that lessons learned about individual specialization may not simply translate to a

higher level of organization. Nevertheless, subsequent thinking about focus at the level of the operating

unit (e.g., Skinner’s (1974) concept of the focused factory) is consistent with earlier work on specialized

labor.

         Several studies provide empirical support for the benefits of focus in the context of manufacturing

(Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Brush and Karnani, 1996; Bozarth and Edwards, 1997; Fisher and Ittner,

1999; Vokurka and Davis, 2000; Anderson, 2001). Studies in service settings likewise support the


                                                                                                               6
benefits of focus at some level (Heskett, 1986; Johnston, 1996; Lapre and Tsikriktsis, 2006; Tsikriktsis,

2007; Huckman and Zinner, 2008). Specific to the hospital context, Herzlinger (1997) identifies the

benefits of applying Skinner’s focused factory to health care delivery. Subsequent studies in the hospital

industry find benefits of focus in terms of clinical outcomes (e.g., Greenwald et al., 2006) and financial

performance (e.g., Hyer et al., 2009).

         Nevertheless, support for the benefits of focus at the level of the operating unit is not unanimous.3

Mukherjee et al. (2000) suggest that the impact of reducing focus depends on a manufacturing line’s

degree of absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) with respect to changes in manufacturing

tasks. In their study of automobile assembly plants, MacDuffie et al. (1996) find that a more complex mix

of parts negatively affects productivity while a more complex mix of models has no such effect. Further,

the negative impact of parts complexity can be offset by the adoption of lean management principles.

Other studies in manufacturing contexts suggest that more-focused operations perform no better than their

less-focused counterparts (Kekre and Srinivasan, 1990; Suarez et al., 1996; Ketokivi and Jokinen, 2006).

In the financial services industry, Siggelkow (2003) finds that mutual fund providers with a broader range

of funds (i.e., less-focused providers) have higher cash inflows than more-focused providers despite the

fact that the specific funds managed by the latter outperform similar funds managed by the former.

Finally, a few studies in the hospital industry find that hospitals that devote a majority of their activity and

resources to cardiovascular patients perform at best no better in terms of patient outcomes on

cardiovascular procedures (Young et al., 2005; Cram et al., 2005; Kc and Terwiesch, 2009).

         Despite the mixed results highlighted above, the bulk of the empirical literature suggests a

positive-to-neutral effect of focus on performance. We thus offer the following baseline hypothesis

related to an operating unit’s level of focus (i.e., specialization in a focal business segment):




3
 Even at the level of the individual, support for the benefits of specialization is not unanimous. Recent work by Boh
et al. (2007) and Narayanan et al. (2009) both highlight benefits to some degree of variety in individual work within
software development contexts.


                                                                                                                    7
Hypothesis 1: Increasing an operating unit’s level of specialization in a focal business segment improves
quality performance in that segment.


        As noted earlier, several studies at the firm level have argued that increased scope, or

diversification, may represent an efficient approach to corporate organization (Teece, 1980; Panzar and

Willig, 1981). Nevertheless, like the previously noted literature on focus at the plant or operating-unit

level, this firm-level literature offers mixed evidence regarding the impact of diversification on firm value

(Rhoades, 1974; Lang and Stulz, 1994; Berger and Ofek, 1995; Servaes, 1996; Campa and Kedia, 2002;

Villalonga, 2004). The literature on related diversification provides insight into these conflicting results

by striking a balance between claims about the benefits of focus on one hand and those of diversification

on the other. Rumelt (1974) finds the highest levels of profitability among firms that diversify into areas

that draw on some “common core skill or resource.” Subsequent work is consistent with this finding and

suggests that some level of related diversification is beneficial but that evolving into an unfocused

enterprise by diversifying into unrelated businesses may destroy value (Christensen and Montgomery,

1981; Rumelt, 1982; Paelpu, 1985).

        As suggested by Markides and Williamson (1994), the assumption—either explicit or implicit—

of the above stream of literature is “…to equate the benefits of relatedness with the static exploitation of

economies of scope.” (p. 150). That is, the literature tends to attribute the benefits of related

diversification to the simple amortization of investments in fixed assets—a positive spillover—rather than

to complementarities. We note that positive spillovers have been observed at the level of small groups in

knowledge intensive settings. Boh et al.’s (2007) analysis of productivity in software teams established

that a group’s average experience with related activities has a greater positive impact on productivity than

its average experience with a focal activity. This set-up differs from ours in two ways beyond the obvious

difference in empirical context. First, it measures the returns to absolute experience rather than to focus.

Second, it tests for positive spillovers but not for the complementarities that we measure in our study.

        In this study, we present an approach for unpacking the benefits of related diversification by

determining the extent to which they emerge from either or both of these sources. To achieve this, we first


                                                                                                               8
define the “relatedness” of an activity based on the potential for positive spillovers or complementarities

with a focal activity. Among hospital patients, disease categories that frequently co-occur in patients with

cardiovascular disease represent areas with the highest such potential. In our setting, positive spillovers

exist when the level of specialization in related segments (i.e. the share of an operating unit’s activity in

related segments) impacts performance in the focal segment independent of the unit’s level of

specialization in the latter. For example, we would predict that a hospital that is more specialized in

endocrinology would provide better outcomes for cardiovascular patients—regardless of its level of

specialization in cardiovascular care—as diabetes tends to be a common co-occurring condition for

cardiovascular patients. Our expectation here is that, in a knowledge-intensive setting such as a hospital

and because “…repetition, experience and homogeneity of tasks breed competence” (Skinner, 1974),

greater hospital specialization in endocrinology would produce deeper organizational know-how with

respect to diabetes. This know-how could be directly applied to patients hospitalized for cardiovascular

disease but who also have diabetes. As a result, the benefits of this know-how would accrue to

cardiovascular patients regardless of how specialized the hospital is in cardiovascular care. This suggests

the following hypothesis:


Hypothesis 2: Increasing an operating unit’s degree of specialization in related business segments
improves quality performance in its focal business segment (i.e., specialization in related segments has a
positive spillover on quality performance in the focal segment).


        In comparison to positive spillovers, complementarities suggest the presence of

interdependencies between focal and related activities (Tanriverdi and Venkatraman, 2005). Schilling et

al. (2003) provide experimental evidence of complementarities by demonstrating that groups learn a focal

task at a faster rate when group members are exposed to related (i.e., moderate) variety—as opposed to

no variety or unrelated (i.e., broad) variety—in tasks over time. They note that, in their experimental

setting of problem-solving games, groups exposed to variety did not exhibit sub-specialization. That is,

they did not have one member play all games of one type and another member play all games of another

type. In our setting, related diversification typically occurs by having related specialists within the same


                                                                                                                9
organization (e.g., cardiologists working in proximity to endocrinologists), not by exposing individuals or

groups to a range of related activities over time (e.g., individual physicians acting as cardiologist-

endocrinologist combinations). Our study, therefore, examines whether the complementary benefits of

relatedness identified by Schilling et al. (2003) within individuals or small groups can be extended to

interactions that tend to occur across specialized individuals or groups. To the extent that

complementarities exist in our setting, they suggest that some degree of interpersonal or intergroup

coordination is taking place.

        We test for complementarities across activities by considering whether the benefit of a given level

of focus depends upon how an operating unit’s non-focal activities are distributed in terms of their

relatedness to the focal area. As noted earlier, Milgrom and Roberts’ (1994) general definition states that

two variables are complementary if “the marginal returns to one variable are increasing in the level of the

other variable” (Milgrom and Roberts, 1994, p. 5). In our setting, the variables are the degree of

specialization in focal and related non-focal activities, respectively. We expect that if non-focal activities

are disproportionately allocated to related (rather than unrelated) categories, the marginal benefit of a

given level of specialization in the focal activity will be greater. In short, we expect that there are returns

to co-specialization in related activities.

        In the context of our earlier hospital example, complementarities in specialization would imply

that the benefits of a hospital being relatively specialized in cardiovascular care would be greater if the

hospital were also specialized in the related area of endocrinology. These complementarities could be due

to one or more of several factors. For example, cardiovascular physicians may develop better solutions to

clinical problems to the extent that they are able to draw on the knowledge of stronger diabetes specialists

through direct consultation on specific patients. That is, “co-specialized” hospitals might facilitate formal

interactions among specialists (e.g., traditional consultations or “grand rounds” (Parrino and White,




                                                                                                              10
1990)) or what the medical literature commonly refers to as informal “curbside consultations” (Manian

and Janssen, 1996; Kuo, et al., 1998; Bergus, et al., 2000).4

         Beyond direct consultation, hospitals that co-specialize in cardiovascular disease and

endocrinology may also be more likely to develop clinical centers that focus on the intersection of these

two clinical areas. That is, such hospitals may direct more cognitive attention (Simon, 1947; Ocasio,

1997) to this intersection. This point is reflected in the concepts of focused attention (Kahneman, 1973)

and situated attention (Ross and Nisbett, 1991), which collectively argue that individual behavior and

social cognition are influenced by an organization’s structures for allocating time, effort, and other

resources (Ocasio, 1997). In our setting, one might see a hospital develop a specialized program in

cardiovascular endocrinology, which would be staffed by physicians and other clinicians (e.g., nurses,

nutritionists) dedicated to this subspecialty. As this subspecialty expertise develops, one would expect

cardiovascular specialists in the hospital—either physicians or other clinical staff—to interpret and

encode more effectively the learning from their own specialized experience (Levitt and March, 1988). In

line with this logic, we propose the following hypothesis:


Hypothesis 3: Increasing an operating unit’s degree of specialization in related business segments
increases the marginal benefit (in terms of quality performance) of specialization in the focal business
segment (i.e., specialization in related segments complements specialization in the focal segment to
improve quality performance).


         To illustrate the predictions of our three hypotheses, we present a simple formalization. Assume

that a hospital is composed of three types of service lines: a focal service line f (in our case,

cardiovascular care), related service lines r, and unrelated service lines u. The quality of output in a focal

service line, qf, can be expressed as:

                     ,   ,                                                                              (1)

  An example of the content of such a consultation would be the post-operative management of patient glucose
levels following CABG surgery on a diabetic patient. This is an area where both cardiovascular specialists and
endocrinology specialists provide input into decisions and where there are nuances related to the intersection of
these two specialties that are not clearly the domain of either. This example highlights the more general coordination
challenges resulting from subspecialization in medicine (Gawande, 2009).


                                                                                                                   11
where xf and xr are the shares of a hospital’s activity dedicated to focal and related services, respectively.

We note that the remaining portion of a hospital’s activity (i.e., 1-xf-xr) is assumed to be dedicated to

unrelated services. The matrix Z includes other variables that might affect the quality of output in the

focal service. Each of our predictions can be expressed as a partial derivative of (1). Hypothesis 1 predicts

that the quality of output in the focal service is increasing in that service’s share of a hospital’s activity

(i.e.,      0). Similarly, Hypothesis 2 predicts the same relationship between focal service quality and


the share of a hospital’s activity attributed to related services (i.e.,      0). Finally, Hypothesis 3

predicts a positive cross-partial derivative of focal-service quality with respect to the shares of both the

focal service and related services (i.e.,           0).

         The predictions from Hypotheses 2 and 3 offer an important implication. Given our share-based

measure of specialization, if 100% of a unit’s activity is dedicated to a focal segment, there would, by

definition, be no room for related activities. Thus, to the extent that either positive spillovers or

complementarities exist, they provide a potential explanation for why one might observe decreasing

benefits to focus within an operating unit. In short, dedicating resources to a focal activity may be helpful

to a point but not if doing so prevents an adequate level of investment in related segments that generate

benefits from either positive spillovers or complementarities.



Setting and Data

         Our analysis considers patients receiving coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as their

primary procedure. CABG treats blockages of the coronary arteries and is an open-heart procedure in

which the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine while the heart is stopped. Access to the heart is

gained through an incision in the chest, while a blood vessel taken from either the leg or chest is used to

bypass the arterial blockage. Following surgery, patients typically spend one or two days in the intensive

care unit and five or six days in total receiving post-operative care in the hospital.




                                                                                                                 12
        We focus on CABG patients for several reasons. First, CABG patients are more homogeneous

than the entire population of cardiovascular patients. Second, one of the more reliably tracked quality

measures in hospital discharge data is in-hospital mortality—an outcome that occurs relatively frequently

in patients receiving CABG surgery compared to other clinical areas. Third, CABG patients account for a

significant portion of cardiovascular patients and, as a whole, cardiovascular patients are numerous and

tend to have several “secondary” diagnoses in non-cardiovascular areas. This tendency enables us to

identify those clinical areas from which spillovers to cardiovascular patients are likely to be greatest.

        Our empirical analysis draws on hospital discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample

(NIS), a database maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The NIS

contains patient-level data on hospital stays for approximately 1,000 hospitals in the United States each

year. These hospitals are sampled from state-level hospital discharge databases and approximate a 20

percent stratified random sample of acute-care hospitals in the United States. Data in the NIS are reported

at the level of the patient, and all patients admitted to a sampled hospital are included for the year in

question. These data include details about the hospital (e.g., urban versus rural location, teaching status

and region of the country), individual patient demographics, the status of the patient upon discharge from

the hospital, and the patient’s primary and secondary diagnoses and procedures. We estimate both

hospital- and patient-level models based on individuals who underwent CABG surgery.

        To develop our sample, we begin with the NIS for the years 1995 through 2004. During this

period, there were 661,910 discharges at 774 hospitals in the NIS data with a primary procedure of CABG

surgery. We exclude 996 observations that contain insufficient data. Additionally, to control for factors

that influence in-hospital mortality and to ensure greater homogeneity and comparability across patients,

we limit our sample to those patients who had one of three primary diagnoses consistent with a primary

procedure of CABG: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute and chronic ischemic heart disease, and




                                                                                                              13
angina pectoris.5 Of the 661,910 discharges, 16,540 had a primary diagnosis other than the three noted

above and were, therefore, excluded from our data.

        The number of states included in the NIS varies from 19 in 1995 to 37 in 2004. Given that the

NIS is a stratified random sample, hospitals do not appear in the NIS every year. Our empirical

specifications include one-year lags of certain variables, which require hospitals to appear in the data for

pairs of consecutive years. Therefore, we limit our sample to hospitals performing CABG surgery with at

least one pair of consecutive years in the NIS. Additionally, we exclude hospitals with very low volumes

of CABG procedures, following the practice of several public and private reporting organizations by

limiting our sample to facilities performing at least 30 procedures annually (e.g., Pennsylvania Health

Care Cost Containment Council, 2007). Following these exclusions, our base sample of discharges

includes 283,003 patients receiving CABG surgery in 382 hospitals (807 hospital-years) between 1996

(due to our lagged variables) and 2004.



Dependent Variable

        Our regression models capture quality performance using the dependent variable of in-hospital

mortality. We note that in-hospital mortality—while a critical measure of quality performance—

represents but one dimension of operational performance in hospitals. Unfortunately, we do not have

access in our setting to other performance measures, such as cost or longer-term measures of clinical

quality (e.g., patient quality of life or survival following hospital discharge).

        Due to heterogeneity in patient characteristics, raw mortality rates may be biased measures of

hospital performance that unfairly penalize (benefit) hospitals with a more- (less-) severe mix of patients.

We thus estimate the risk-adjusted mortality rate (RAMRjt) for each hospital j in year t using a logistic

regression. We pool all of the patient-level CABG observations in our database. The outcome variable in

this regression is MORTijt, an indicator that equals one if patient i in hospital j in year t died in the

hospital, and zero otherwise. The form of this regression is as follows:

                     pr(MORT ijt  1 xi )       
                 ln                               α  βX i

                                                                                                (2)

Xi represents a vector of patient-level risk factors, including demographic characteristics of the patient,

the patient’s primary condition, co-existing conditions, and other procedures performed during the same

hospitalization that may indicate a higher risk of death. We control for patient gender and age, with an

interaction term to capture the possibility that the effects of age may differ across gender. We categorize

the patient’s primary condition by the first three digits of the primary diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM code).

Additionally, we categorize patients with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or

heart attack, by the location of the infarction (e.g., anterior, inferior, right ventricular). We measure co-

existing conditions using the approach of Elixhauser et al. (1998), which captures the presence of

approximately 30 comorbidities using indicator variables for each.6 Finally, we include indicators for two

procedures that, if occurring with CABG, represent complicating factors: angioplasty prior to CABG and

valve replacement surgery. Though performed by a cardiologist rather than a cardiac surgeon, angioplasty

represents a primary treatment for coronary artery disease; if angioplasty is not successful, CABG is often

used as an alternative. Valve replacement surgery, like CABG, is an open-heart surgical procedure.

        To calculate hospital j’s risk-adjusted mortality rate in year t, RAMRjt, we average the predicted

values for each patient from (2) for hospital j in year t to create the predicted mortality rate PMRjt. We use

this value, along with the observed mortality rate OMRjt—defined as the total number of CABG deaths at

hospital j in year t divided by the total number of CABG patients in the hospital over the same time

period—to calculate RAMRjt:

AMR represents the observed mortality rate across all hospitals for the study period and is included simply

to normalize the risk-adjusted rate.



Independent Variables

        Though our analysis focuses on CABG patients, the NIS includes data on every patient in a

particular hospital in a given year. This feature allows us to observe a hospital’s focus on a particular

service area as a continuous variable based on the percentage of its total operational activity occurring in

that area. We measure a hospital's focus in cardiovascular services (FOCUSjt) as the percentage of

patients at that hospital in a particular year whose primary diagnosis—the principal reason for

hospitalization—falls in the area of cardiovascular disease.7 Formally,

                               n jt

                                CARDIO
                               i 1
                                             ijt
                 FOCUSjt =
                                      n jt
                                                                                                          (4)

where CARDIOijt is a binary indicator that equals one if patient i discharged from hospital j in year t had

a primary diagnosis in cardiovascular disease, and zero otherwise. The denominator njt represents the total

number of patients—cardiovascular or otherwise—discharged from hospital j during year t. We note that

cardiovascular disease includes, but is not limited to, patients receiving CABG. It also includes other

branches of cardiovascular care, such as diagnostic cardiology, interventional cardiology and angioplasty,

valve surgery, other forms of treatment for heart failure, and treatments related to cardiac rhythm

management. As a continuous, share-based measure, FOCUSjt captures operational specialization in a

more nuanced manner than studies that measure focus in a discrete way, such as a simple count of the

number of activities in which the organization participates or binary indicators for whether an

organization is involved in a particular activity (Bozarth and Edwards, 1997; Hayes and Wheelwright,

1984; Kekre and Srinivasan, 1990; Suarez and Cusumano, 1996; Villalonga, 2004, Huckman and Zinner,

2008).

         Beyond testing for returns to an operating unit’s focus on a given business segment, we also aim

to determine whether the composition of that unit’s other activities affects those returns. Specifically, our

purpose is to examine whether the impact of focus on quality performance depends on the intensity of

related services. To define related services, we identify hospital service categories with the greatest

potential for positive spillovers or complementarities with cardiovascular care. We do this by taking

advantage of data detailing secondary diagnoses (i.e., conditions that are present but not the primary

reason for the patient’s hospitalization) for each patient. We assume that the presence of these secondary

conditions suggests the need for knowledge and experience specific to treating them. The NIS database

includes information on up to 15 secondary diagnoses for each patient, which allows us to determine—

across our entire sample of cardiovascular patients—the frequency of specific secondary diagnoses. We

aggregate these secondary diagnoses into service groups using Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs).

Each MDC corresponds to a single organ system or disease category. Table 1 summarizes the frequency

with which other MDCs appear as secondary diagnosis categories in patients with a primary diagnosis in

cardiovascular disease.

         We define related service categories as those that appear as secondary diagnoses for at least 20%

of primary cardiovascular patients. The implication is that at least two of every ten cardiovascular patients

may benefit from access to expertise in these related areas through mechanisms such as knowledge

sharing (Henderson and Cockburn, 1996) among clinical specialists. Our analysis indicates that four of

the 24 non-cardiovascular MDCs meet this requirement: MDC 4 (Diseases and disorders of the

respiratory system), MDC 6 (Diseases and disorders of the digestive system), MDC 10 (Endocrine,

nutritional and metabolic diseases and disorders), and MDC 11 (Diseases and disorders of the kidney and

urinary tract). We define the degree to which hospitals are engaged in related service categories

(RELATEDjt) as follows:


                                                                                                           17
                                  n jt

                                  RELATED        ijt
                 RELATEDjt =      i1
                                         n jt                                                             (5)

RELATEDijt is an indicator equal to one if the primary diagnosis for patient i discharged from hospital j in

year t is in a service area that is related to cardiovascular care. Again, njt represents the total number of

patients discharged from hospital j in year t. RELATEDjt thus captures the extent to which a hospital

concentrates on treating patients whose primary needs fall into those areas that most commonly appear as

secondary needs for primary cardiovascular patients.

        We recognize that our choice of 20% as a cutoff for including service categories in RELATEDjt

may seem arbitrary. Accordingly, we investigate the robustness of our results to relaxing this threshold.

Moreover, in our base specification, RELATEDjt is equivalent to a combination of variables representing

the share of patients in each of several individual MDCs. To validate our decision to combine these

categories, we employ factor analysis to determine the degree to which the individual MDCs load onto a

common factor. Though we do not report the results of this analysis in detail here, we note that they

suggest that the MDCs above the 20% threshold load onto the same factor, while those below do not.8

        Though we estimate a version of our model including RELATEDjt as a continuous variable, most

of our models categorize RELATEDjt into discrete groups to facilitate the interpretation of interaction

effects. We initially split RELATEDjt at the median for each year, dividing it into

RELATEDBelowMedianjt and RELATEDAboveMedianjt. To allow additional flexibility in the

specification of interaction effects, our base model further divides relatedness into three levels

(RELATED1jt, RELATED2jt, and RELATED3jt), with cutoffs defined at the 33rd and 66th percentiles of

RELATEDjt for each year. Hospitals in the RELATED1 category thus have the lowest level of services that

are related with cardiovascular care while those in the RELATED3 category have the highest.




8
  Factor loadings for MDCs 4, 6, 10, and 11 meet a threshold of 0.70, while those for MDCs 8 and 20 are closer to
zero. Chronbach’s alpha is 0.70 for the combination of MDCs 4, 6, 10, and 11. The removal of any one of these
individual MDCs results in a slightly lower alpha.


                                                                                                                18
         Finally, we include a measure of the total volume of admissions at hospital j in year t, which

allows us to control for the impact of a hospital's overall volume, or size, on mortality rates. In our

robustness checks, we also run versions of our model that substitute cardiovascular volume or CABG

volume for total volume. Table 2 presents summary statistics and correlations for the key variables in our

analysis. We note that FOCUS and RELATED have a correlation of -0.003. This low correlation suggests

that the effects of FOCUS and RELATED can be separately identified in our sample.9



Empirical Model

         We estimate the following base model to test for the effects of focus and related service intensity

on risk-adjusted mortality rates:

RAMR jt
 α j  λt  1 RELATED2 jt 1   2 RELATED 3 jt 1  β3ln(FOCUS) jt 1*RELATED1 jt 1
                                                                                                              (6)
 β 4 ln(FOCUS) jt 1*RELATED2 jt 1  β5 ln(FOCUS) jt 1*RELATED3 jt 1
 β6 ln (VOLUME ) jt 1  β 7 X jt  ε jt

We include year fixed effects (λt) to control for unobserved factors that may drive the average trend in

CABG mortality over time. We control for overall hospital size with ln(VOLUME)jt-1 and include Xjt, a

vector of hospital characteristics including urban versus rural location, teaching status and region of the

country, to capture hospital-level factors that may be associated with mortality rates.

         We take the natural log of focus to allow for a non-linear relationship between FOCUS and

RAMR. In doing so, we note that our data include some hospitals with high values of FOCUS (e.g., >70%

of discharges in cardiovascular care). For these hospitals, a change in FOCUS of, say, five percentage

points is a less substantial shift (and is likely to have a smaller effect on RAMR) than for a hospital with a

much lower initial value of FOCUS. To examine robustness, we also estimate versions of our base model

9
 Some may find this surprising as both FOCUS and RELATED are calculated by dividing hospital volume in certain
clinical areas over total hospital volume. Thus, to the extent that FOCUS increases, one might expect RELATED to
decrease. We note that this is not necessarily the case because hospitals also engage in clinical activities, classified
as unrelated non-focal activities, that are not captured by either FOCUS or RELATED. In fact, given that the means
of FOCUS and RELATED sum to roughly 0.40, unrelated non-focal activities account for 60% of hospital activity
on average.


                                                                                                                     19
in which FOCUS enters as a linear variable. We note, however, that the R2 for our models using the log of

FOCUS are consistently higher than those for otherwise similar models using FOCUS as a linear

regressor.10 Finally, we demean our measures of FOCUS to facilitate interpretation of interaction terms.

        We lag FOCUS, RELATED, and VOLUME by one year to reduce concerns about reverse

causality in the relationship between these variables and hospital performance. We do this because it is

possible that hospitals with strong cardiovascular performance in one year may experience an increase in

their cardiovascular focus in subsequent years. To the extent that hospitals gain or lose cardiovascular

volume (and focus) based on their reputations as “good” or “bad” hospitals—reputations that plausibly

remain relatively stable over the time period we consider—we aim to control for this potential reverse

causality by including hospital random effects (αj). To examine the appropriateness of using random

effects versus fixed effects, researchers generally employ a simple Hausman test. However, our panel data

are clustered by hospital, a characteristic not permitted by the Hausman test, and thus we must rely on a

Hausman-like test of fixed versus random effects—a test of overidentifying restrictions—implemented in

Stata using the xtoverid command (Schaffer and Stillman, 2006). In our case, the xtoverid procedure

produces a test statistic that is not significant at conventional levels (p=0.203), suggesting that random

effects are both consistent and efficient. We also report the results of the fixed-effects model for

comparison.

        To the extent that our random- and fixed-effects models fail to control for any remaining, time-

varying unobservables, we supplement these models by running a reverse regression on our time-series

data to test directly for the effect of prior mortality performance on focus. For this reverse regression, we

model the current level of focus as a function of the one-year lag of a hospital’s risk-adjusted mortality

rate. The results of this analysis are discussed in our robustness section later in the paper.

        In our base regressions, we interact FOCUS with each of the categories of RELATED to

determine the degree to which the returns to focus—in terms of mortality performance—depend on the

intensity with which hospitals engage in related activities. Given the construction of our variables, the

estimate of β3 represents the total effect of focus for hospitals in RELATED1, and β4 and β5 represent

similar total effects for hospitals in RELATED2 and RELATED3, respectively. Based on our hypotheses,

we expect to find that a greater level of FOCUS leads to lower mortality (i.e., β3<0, β4<0, and β5<0 per

Hypothesis 1), that a greater level of RELATED leads to lower mortality (i.e., β2< β1<0 per Hypothesis 2),

and that the marginal effect of FOCUS becomes greater in magnitude as hospitals move from RELATED1

to RELATED2 to RELATED3 (i.e., β5< β4< β3<0 per Hypothesis 3). Put differently, this final prediction

suggests that the marginal benefit of focus in terms of quality performance should be increasing in the

hospital’s level of specialization in related activities.



Results and Discussion

Base Results

        Table 3 presents estimates for several versions of (6). In Column 1, we examine the average

effect of focus alone. Column 1 suggests that, on average, focus has a negative effect on risk-adjusted

mortality, a result that is significant at the 1% level. The estimate implies that a one-standard-deviation

increase from the mean value of FOCUS results in a reduction in the average mortality rate of 0.4

percentage points (i.e., a 14% reduction). This translates to an additional life saved for every 250 patients

treated. A similar estimate is reported in Column 2, where the logarithmic form of RELATED is added to

the model. These results support the beneficial average impact of focus on performance predicted in

Hypothesis 1. Column 3 presents the results of a model in which the continuous versions of FOCUS and

RELATED (both in logarithmic form) are interacted. Both variables have been demeaned to facilitate

interpretation. We begin by noting that specialization in related activities, in and of itself, does not have a

statistically significant effect on risk-adjusted mortality. That is, we do not find support for the positive

spillovers predicted in Hypothesis 2. The estimate on the interaction term in Column 3, however, is in the

predicted direction and statistically significant at conventional levels, suggesting that the marginal benefit




                                                                                                                21
of specializing in cardiovascular care is amplified by greater specialization in related areas. Column 3

thus provides initial support for the complementarities predicted in Hypothesis 3.

        In Columns 4 and 5, we employ various categorical forms of RELATED—first split at the median

and then into thirds—interacted with FOCUS. Our results again suggest that the marginal effect of focus

on mortality depends on the level of relatedness. In Column 4, the estimated coefficient on FOCUS is

negative (but significant only at the 10% level) for hospitals in the RELATEDBelowMedian category. For

hospitals in the RELATEDAboveMedian category, however, the estimated coefficient on FOCUS is

negative and significant at the 1% level. We note that this latter estimate is significantly different from the

estimate of FOCUS for the RELATEDBelowMedian category at the 1% level. Similarly, in Column 5, the

estimated effect of FOCUS is negative but insignificant for hospitals in RELATED1 and negative and

significant for hospitals in RELATED2 and RELATED3. These estimates indicate that a one-standard-

deviation increase from the mean value of FOCUS results in an overall reduction in mortality of 0.71

percentage points for hospitals in the RELATED2 category and 0.74 percentage points for hospitals in the

RELATED3 category. These improvements correspond to an additional life saved for approximately every

135 patients treated. We note that while the estimate on FOCUS for hospitals in RELATED3 is not

significantly different from that for RELATED2, each of these estimates is significantly different from

that for RELATED1 at the 5% level. Overall, the results in Table 3 suggest that hospitals with the

moderate-to-high levels of specialization in related services experience greater returns to focus (in terms

of quality performance) than those with lower levels of specialization in related services.

        A key implication of these findings is that, in the extreme, hospitals with 100% focus on

cardiovascular care—which do exist in practice and fall, by definition, into the RELATED1 category—

may experience lower returns to focus than a hospital that maintains a substantial focus on cardiovascular

care but also offers primary services in related areas. As such, these results provide strong support for

Hypothesis 3 and suggest the importance of complementarities in explaining the benefits of related

diversification in this setting.




                                                                                                            22
           We acknowledge that any endogeneity in our key explanatory variables may lead to biased

estimates. As noted earlier, we recognize that hospitals with higher-quality CABG programs may attract

larger absolute volumes of CABG patients, thereby increasing their level of focus on cardiovascular care.

Though we believe that the lagging of the focus variable and the inclusion of hospital random effects go a

long way in addressing potential endogeneity concerns, we are able to directly test for reverse causality

by running a reverse regression model, with the natural log of a hospital’s current focus as the dependent

variable and its lagged risk-adjusted mortality rate for CABG as the independent variable. The model

includes hospital random effects and year fixed effects.11 If focus is indeed endogenously related to

performance, we would expect to find a negative and significant relationship between the lagged risk-

adjusted mortality rate and the degree of focus in cardiovascular disease. Though we find that the

coefficient on RAMR is negative, it does not approach conventional levels of statistical significance

(p=0.878). We note that a similar result is observed if hospital random effects are replaced by hospital

fixed effects. These results are encouraging, as they mitigate concern that a hospital’s level of focus is

endogenously determined by its prior performance.



Robustness

           Our results may be sensitive to the choices we have made in generating our sample, measuring

our variables of interest, and constructing our base model. We conduct several robustness checks to

examine the extent of this potential sensitivity.

           First, our base model relies on hospital random effects, an approach supported by our test of over-

identifying restrictions. We do, however, examine the robustness of our results to the inclusion of hospital

fixed effects (Table 3, Column 6). To ensure sufficient precision in estimating hospital effects, the sample

for our fixed-effects model includes only facilities with at least three annual observations in the sample.

11
     The model is specified as follows, where, as before, αj and λt are hospital and year fixed effects, respectively:

                                      ln




                                                                                                                         23
The results in Column 6 are consistent with those reported in Column 5 and suggest that our finding of

greater benefits from focus at higher levels of specialization in related services is robust to using fixed

effects.12

         Second, our definition of related services includes the four MDCs that account for secondary

diagnoses in at least 20% of cardiovascular patients. To examine alternative definitions of related

services, we consider the impact of restricting and relaxing this threshold. Specifically, we begin by

defining RELATED to include only the most frequently occurring secondary MDC (MDC 10) and then

progressively add the next most frequent MDC, working our way down the list in Table 1. The results of

these models are presented in Table 4. The model specifications are the same as in (6) except that

RELATED1, RELATED2, and RELATED3 have been defined using the MDCs specified in each column.

Column 4 repeats our base results. The results in Columns 1, 2 and 3 suggest that as we make the

threshold more restrictive, the complementarity we see in our base results continues to hold. Columns 5

and 6 suggest that as we relax the threshold, we initially see little or no effect on our results when adding

MDC8 but begin to see complementarity dissipate as we further relax the threshold by adding MDC20.

Specifically, a test of the difference between the estimates on FOCUS for hospitals in RELATED1,

RELATED2, and RELATED3 in Column 6 suggests that they are statistically indistinguishable at

conventional levels. These results are consistent with our predictions, as one would expect

complementarities from related services to decline as the definition of relatedness is expanded to include

clinical areas that are progressively less likely to appear as secondary diagnoses for cardiovascular

patients.

         Though not presented in detail here, we perform a number of additional robustness checks. These

include: (1) running our base models at the patient-level rather than the hospital-level13; (2) defining


12
  One slight difference in these results is that in Column 5, the impact of FOCUS for RELATED2 and RELATED3
are significantly different both from zero and from the impact of FOCUS for RELATED1. Yet the impacts of
FOCUS for RELATED2 and RELATED3 are not significantly different from each other. In Column 6, the impact of
FOCUS for RELATED3 is significantly different both from zero and from the impact of FOCUS for RELATED1 and
RELATED2. In addition, the impacts of FOCUS for RELATED1 and RELATED2 are not significantly different from
each other. In both cases, however, the finding of complementarities in specialization is present.


                                                                                                              24
FOCUS at the procedure level (i.e., CABG cases as a share of total hospital volume) rather than the

disease level (i.e., cardiovascular cases as a share of total hospital volume); (3) controlling for

cardiovascular volume and CABG volume in place of total hospital volume; (4) including only patients

who actually have secondary conditions in disease areas defined as RELATED; and (5) limiting the

sample for our fixed-effects model to those hospitals with at least four (rather than at least three)

observations in the data to improve the precision in estimating our hospital fixed effects. The results of

each of these additional analyses are consistent with the results presented in Table 4. A few of these

checks, however, merit additional discussion.

         We begin by noting that our base models capture total hospital volume as part of two different

variables: ln(VOLUME) and ln(FOCUS). The coefficient on ln(FOCUS) thus represents the marginal

impact that variable has on mortality, holding ln(VOLUME) constant. An alternate specification would

replace ln(FOCUS) with logged cardiovascular volume for the hospital. We do not use this approach for

several reasons. First, we explicitly want to measure the impact of cardiovascular focus, or specialization,

rather than absolute cardiovascular volume. Second, there is a high degree of co-movement between the

logged values of cardiovascular volume and total hospital volume (correlation=0.806), so we are not able

to observe independent variation in each measure. The same is not true for ln(VOLUME) and ln(FOCUS)

(correlation=-0.192). Third, this alternate specification constrains the impact of a one-unit increase in

logged cardiovascular volume to be the same, regardless of the level of logged total hospital volume.

However, the change in ln(FOCUS) for a one-unit increase in cardiovascular volume would differ

depending on the level of ln(VOLUME), and we want to capture this difference in testing our hypotheses.

         We also note that our base model considers all CABG patients. However, one might expect the

complementary effect of specialization in related areas to be particularly beneficial for patients that

actually have secondary conditions in those areas. We thus run a version of our base model with the

sample limited to the 83% of all CABG patients who had at least one secondary diagnosis in the four


13
  These patient-level models are identical to the model presented in (6), with the exception that they also include the
patient-level covariates in the vector Xi from the regression used to risk-adjust mortality (see (2)).


                                                                                                                    25
major diagnostic categories that define RELATED in our base regressions. This analysis produces

estimates that are very similar to those presented in Table 3.



Conclusion

        Our paper examines how managers can balance the benefits of focus and diversification within

individual operating units. We begin by establishing within our setting that operational focus is, on

average, associated with better quality performance. We then examine the extent to which specialization

in related activities generates positive spillovers that impact the level of quality performance for a focal

activity; we find no evidence of such spillovers. Finally, we investigate whether there are

complementarities in specialization across related areas. We find that hospitals with greater levels of

specialization in related business segments experience a higher marginal benefit to specialization in a

focal segment. That is, there are complementarities resulting from co-specialization in focal and related

segments.

        Our study contributes to the literature on specialization in several ways. First, we find that the

benefits of related diversification—which have been identified across operating units within firms—also

exist within operating units. Like studies conducted at the firm level, our results at the level of the

operating unit suggest that related activities play an important role in the connection between focus and

performance. Our findings, however, push this analysis deeper by offering evidence that

complementarities—not just positive spillovers (e.g., simple economies of scale in shared resources)—

play a role in explaining the benefits of related diversification. These results are robust to changes in the

level of observation, definition of focus, and designation of related businesses.

        In the context of the hospital industry, our work highlights the need for a broader

conceptualization of what it means for a hospital to specialize. The model of the single-specialty hospital

has become increasingly popular in areas such as cardiovascular care, orthopedics, and obstetrics.

Nevertheless, our findings suggest that single-specialty hospitals—and multi-specialty facilities interested

in emphasizing a specific clinical service—need to look beyond their focal activity to build strong


                                                                                                               26
capabilities in complementary areas. This is consistent with the view that, to deliver value for patients

with specific diseases, health care organizations should include “all needed specialties and the prevalent

comorbidities” (Porter and Teisberg, 2007).

        Our study faces several potential limitations, and its results should be interpreted accordingly.

First, we reiterate the empirical issues regarding specification and potential endogeneity that we have

addressed with the robustness checks discussed above. Second, our study is limited to one technology

(CABG surgery) and one industry, which may limit the generalizability of its findings. Nevertheless, the

theoretical foundation of this paper has its roots in other industries. For example, the literature on focus

has largely centered on manufacturing firms (Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Brush and Karnani, 1996;

Bozarth and Edwards, 1997), while the literature on related diversification includes large samples of firms

representing a cross-section of industries (Rumelt, 1974; Christensen and Montgomery, 1981; Rumelt,

1982; Palepu, 1985).

        Third, we consider one measure of performance—quality as captured by risk-adjusted

mortality—but are not able to consider other important operational metrics, such as cost. As a result, our

paper cannot speak to the impact of focus on overall value (e.g., cost-adjusted quality). The data used in

this study do not provide information on costs. What is available is data on hospital charges, which, due

to the varied discounts offered across hospitals and across services within hospitals, are not representative

of either actual prices or costs. Despite this limitation, quality—which we are able to study—remains a

critical component in determining the value of health care provided. Examining the implications of

related diversification for overall value represents an important topic for future study.

        Fourth, our study considers the impact of focus and related diversification on the execution of an

organization’s current tasks, not on its innovative performance (i.e., its ability to develop new products or

services). The work of several authors (e.g., Abernathy and Wayne, 1974; March, 1991; and O’Reilly and

Tushman, 2004) suggests that focused organizations may face significant challenges with respect to

innovation. Examining whether our findings translate to innovation-based settings thus represents a

fruitful avenue for future research.


                                                                                                            27
        Finally, we define related areas based on the frequency with which cardiovascular patients have

secondary needs in those areas. We assume that related areas represent those most likely to generate

positive spillovers or complementarities with cardiovascular care. Unfortunately, our data does not allow

us to isolate the precise mechanism generating the complementarities we observe in our empirical results.

For example, we cannot determine whether these complementarities are due to physical proximity of

related services, direct interactions among physicians in different specialties, or the transfer of

information by specific individuals who span boundaries (Tushman, 1977; Tushman and Scanlon, 1981)

across clinical specialties (e.g., nurses working with patients in both focal and related areas).

Additionally, while interactions among individuals may be important in knowledge-intensive settings like

health care delivery, other mechanisms may be more important sources of complementarities in other

environments. Additional work is required to investigate such mechanisms.

        Despite these caveats, our study highlights the potential role of complementarities in enhancing

the benefits of focus on performance. In so doing, it emphasizes that the benefits of related diversification

may be derived from sources beyond the simple amortization or sharing of fixed assets. Specifically, our

findings suggest that the returns to an operating unit specializing in a given line of business may depend

upon the degree to which the unit “co-specializes” in related activities. Ultimately, these results provide a

potential explanation for why one might find decreasing returns to focusing an organization on a single

operating activity (or narrow set of activities), especially when it is possible to invest in other activities

that complement the organization’s area of concentration.
