The Effects of Overseas Investment on Domestic Employment

JEL No. F13, F15

                                           ABSTRACT

       In this paper, we study the effects of FDI on domestic employment by examining the data

of Taiwan’s manufacturing industry. Treating domestic production and overseas production as two

distinctive outputs from a joint production function, we may estimate the effect of overseas

production on the demand for domestic labor. We found that overseas production generally reduces

the demand for domestic labor as overseas products serve as a substitute for primary inputs in

domestic production (substitution effect). But overseas production also allows the investor to expand

its domestic output through enhanced competitiveness. The expanded domestic output leads to more

employment at home (output effect).

     The net effect of FDI on domestic employment is a combination of substitution and output

effects. For Taiwan, the net effect is positive in most cases but it differs across the labor group.

Technical workers tend to benefit most from FDI, followed by managerial workers, and blue-collar

workers benefit the least; indeed they may even be adversely affected. This suggests that after FDI,

a reconfiguration of division of labor within a firm tend to shift the domestic production toward

technology and management intensive operations.

INTRODUCTION

It has long been a concern of policymakers that foreign direct investment (FDI) may

cause job losses at home; indeed, labor unions generally consider FDI to be the

equivalent of job exporting. The logic is simple; as production lines are relocated

overseas, gone with them are the workers that served the domestic lines. This

reasoning is of course over-simplistic, because there could never be any guarantees

that the production lines that were relocated overseas would have been able to survive

the competition had they remained at home. If these production lines were to be

eliminated anyway, then their relocation does not result in any job losses.

    Conversely, there is always the possibility that overseas investment might well

enhance the overall competitiveness of the investing company and therefore boost job

opportunities at home which would otherwise have been swept away by competition.

Ku (1998), for example, found that FDI enabled Taiwanese enterprises to restructure

themselves, and therefore increase their tenacity. They showed that firms engaging in

overseas production had a better chance of survival than those that were not.

    Those who are concerned about the adverse effects of overseas investment on

domestic employment basically assume that overseas production is a substitute for

exports; hence, as exports fall, so does employment. This is a conventional argument

along the lines of Mundell (1957) who showed very elegantly, in a 2×2 model, that capital

movement is equivalent to trade. Products produced in overseas locations not only replace

exports, they may also in fact be re-imported back home to substitute the product lines

that were previously imported to serve the home market (Liu and Lin 2001). There are,

however, counter-arguments to Mundell’s ‘perfect substitution’ theory. Markusen

(1983), for example, demonstrated the theoretical possibility that FDI and trade are

complementary rather than substitutes; therefore, the relationship between FDI and

job opportunities at home is indeed an empirical question.

                                           1
    Brainard and Riker (1997a, 1997b) directly estimated the substitution elasticities

between employment in parent companies and their foreign affiliates, as well as those

between different affiliates, and found a very low degree of substitution between

parent and affiliate employment, although there was a high degree of substitution

between affiliates in developing counties. They also found that the relationship

between employment in industrialized country affiliates and in developing countries

was complementary rather than substituting.

    Slaughter (1995) had earlier found a similar low degree of substitution between

parent and affiliate employment when only production workers were considered. He

noted that the employment of production workers did not seem to be systematically

related to relative wages between the parent and the affiliate. This suggests that

overseas employment corresponds only weakly to the wage gap between home and

host countries, although it may correspond strongly to the wage gap between different

overseas locations. Hatzius (1997) and Döhrn (1997) found similar results for Sweden

with overseas employment of Swedish multinational firms corresponding to wages in

actual and potential host countries, but not to wages in Sweden. Blomstrom and

Kokko (2000) also discovered that Swedish multinationals relate to domestic policies

rather than wages in determining whether to keep production at home.

    This evidence suggests that overseas production and domestic production is

closely related, but not necessary substitutable. In fact, there must be a division of

labor between the parent and affiliates since FDI is an action taken to enhance the

competitiveness of a company. To the extent that FDI reduces the costs of the parent’s

operations, it also helps the parent to expand its level of output, which in turn,

increases employment at home. Blomstrom, et. al. (1997), for example, found that

overseas investment in developing countries by US firms did have the effect of

replacing domestic employment, but the same investment in developed countries did

                                          2
not; the replacement effect was, however, limited to production workers.

    Findings that the employment effect from FDI may differ across labor groups are

important, for this implies that FDI has important consequences for income distribution.

For example, the examination of Swedish firms by Blomstrom, et. al. (1997) found that

FDI contributes to growth in employment of unskilled labor at home because Swedish

multinationals were investing abroad to acquire skilled workers to engage in R&D and

other skills-intensive activities. Lipsey’s (1994) study of US multinationals also found

that overseas affiliates allow the parent to employ more managerial and technical staff at

the same level as in their domestic production. Feenstra (1996) showed that FDI in

Mexico by US firms increased the demand at home for skilled workers vis-à-vis unskilled

workers, thus raising the relative wage of skilled workers, and worsening income

distribution for the investing country; whereas the reverse occurred in Mexico.

    There is an indirect, but nevertheless very important, linkage between FDI and

domestic employment; that is, the effect of FDI on domestic investment. If FDI

outflows are accompanied by an equal reduction in the amount of domestic

investment, then FDI may still reduce job opportunities at home even if overseas

production is complementary to domestic production; Feldstein (1994) also seems to

suggest such a one-to-one substitution effect. Stevens and Lipsey (1992) also found a

negative relationship between FDI and domestic investment; although not as clear as

one-to-one replacement; however, Bayoumi and Lipworth’s (1997) study of the case

in Japan found no displacement effect on domestic investment from FDI. Again, the

actual relationship is therefore an empirical question.

    The purpose of this paper is therefore to examine the relationship between FDI and

domestic employment at firm level, using Taiwan’s manufacturing industry as an example.

We find that overseas production leads to an increase in the domestic employment of

managerial and technical workers, but may also reduce the employment available to

                                            3
unskilled workers. Overseas production partially replaces inputs to domestic production,

resulting in a decline in labor demand at a given output level; however, at the same time

overseas production reduces the costs of domestic production, leading to an expansion in

output. These input-replacement and output-expansion effects combine to a produce a net

effect which is positive in most cases, although the net effect differs with different labor

groups and the geographical location of overseas investment.


AN        OVERVIEW           OF      TAIWAN’S       FDI     AND       MANUFACTURING

     EMPLOYMENT

Taiwanese firms made only sporadic outward investment before 1980. Beginning in

the mid-1980s, Taiwanese firms started making more substantial foreign investment,

driven by rising wages and rising value of Taiwanese currency, NT. Between

1987-1990, Southeast Asia and USA were the major destinations of Taiwan’s foreign

investment. In the early 1990s, China emerged in the FDI map and eventually became

the most popular destination for Taiwanese investors. In the second half of the 1990s,

China took up almost a half of Taiwan’s total amount of outward investment (see

Table 1). The manufacturing sector accounted for the majority of overseas investment,

dominating the service and agriculture sectors. In the manufacturing sector, FDI is

most active in the electronics, chemical, and textile industries. FDI appears to have

important consequences on domestic employment.

      Manufacturing employment in Taiwan reached a peak in 1987 when 2.821 million

people were working in the manufacturing sector; thereafter, there was a general decline

in manufacturing employment until it hit a trough in 1994, when 2.422 million people

were working in the sector. It then started to recover through the mid- to late-1990s, with

2.655 million people being employed in the manufacturing sector by 2000 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Manufacturing employment, 1981-2000


      The available employment data suggests that the period 1987-1994 was a time

when Taiwan’s industry underwent dramatic restructuring. Whilst there were losses of

399,000 manufacturing jobs throughout that period, there was nevertheless an

increase in employment in the service sector of around 1.385 million, more than

enough to offset these losses. Thus, unemployment rates remained at low levels

throughout the 1990s.

                                                         5
    It is also worth noting that 1987 was around the time when Taiwanese firms began

to embark on the course of FDI, with more than US$43 billion being invested overseas

from 1987 to 2000. Between 1987 and 1992, FDI was concentrated in Southeast Asia

where Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia took the lion’s share of Taiwan’s overseas

investment; however, from 1992 onwards, the focus for FDI shifted to China. After the

1997 Asian financial crisis, FDI in Southeast Asia came to a virtual standstill whereas

FDI in China continued to surge. In 2001, the global recession saw Taiwan’s

unemployment rate reaching an unprecedented 4 per cent; thus there were heightened

fears that FDI may have led to rising unemployment at home.

    Beneath the surface of a relatively stable employment situation in the 1990s,

there was a rather dramatic transformation taking place in the industrial structure.

Amongst 22 two-digit industries in the manufacturing sector, 12 had increased their

employment levels whereas the remaining 10 had seen their employment levels

falling. The most rapid increase in employment occurred in the electronics industry in

which 145,748 new jobs had been generated between 1991 and 2000, representing a

24.3 per cent increase on the 1990 level. It was probably no coincidence that the

electronics industry was also the industry that was most active in undertaking outward

investment. In contrast, employment in the apparel industry recorded the largest

number of job losses, at 54,104, representing a loss of more than one-third of its initial

1991 employment level. However, FDI from the apparel industry was also substantial;

thus, the relationship between FDI and domestic employment is unclear, to say the

least. In the following section, we will examine this relationship in more detail.


THE STATISTICS ON FDI AND EMPLOYMENT

In this section, we present the employment data revealed by Taiwan’s Manufacturing

Census, and relate this to FDI. The census data are collected at plant level, but are

                                            6
then aggregated into firm-level data; all of the following statistics are reported at firm

level since it is considered that FDI is decided at firm level rather than plant level.

Changes in employment between 1993 and 200 are studied, with 1993 having been

chosen as the starting year because this was the first time that a comprehensive set of

FDI statistics was collected in the census; 2000 is chosen as the terminal year because

this was the most recent census year. A total of 75,101 firms are included in the 1993

census, of which 49,260 had survived until 2000, whilst the remaining 25,841 had

exited the market during the period under study. 27,585 new firms had entered the

market between 1993 and 2000, with these new entries during this eight-year period

representing 36.7 per cent of the stock of firms in the initial year, and the exiting firms

representing 34.4 per cent of the stock, a characteristically high turnover rate for

Taiwan’s industry (Aw, et. al., 2001). All firms that have shown up in either the 1993

census or the 2000 census come to a total of 102,686, which forms our sample for

comparison.

    We classify all sample firms into two categories, the FDI group and the non-FDI

group. The FDI group includes all firms that have undertaken overseas investment,

and the non-FDI group includes those that have not undertaken any such investment.

Although there are some missing data, the census does cover the majority of

manufacturing firms. The total employment figures in the sample were 2,155,672

persons for 1993, and 2,291,396 for 2000, representing 89.8 per cent and 92.9 per cent

respectively of the total employment estimated by the statistics authorities during the

two census years.

    We tabulate the turnover of sample firms in Table 2, which shows that there were

4,283 firms in the FDI group, and 98,403 firms in the non-FDI group. Although, in

terms of the number of firms, the FDI group accounted for just 4.3 per cent of the

manufacturing sector (ignoring the missing data), it nevertheless accounted for 28.23

                                            7
per cent of total employment within the sector, which suggests that firms engaging in

overseas investment are relatively large in size.

    Out of the 4,283 firms in the FDI group, 3,743 firms were already in existence in

1993; the remainder was made up of new firms that entered during the period under

study. From the initial 1993 cohort, 2,843 had survived the competition and remained

active within the industry in 2000, representing a 76.0 per cent survival rate.

    Meanwhile, out of the 98,403 firms in the non-FDI group, 71,358 firms were

already in existence in 1993, and 46,417 firms had survived up until 2000,

representing a 65.0 per cent survival rate. Simple statistics suggest that those firms

that were engaged in overseas investment had a higher survival rate, supporting the

findings of Ku (1998) which, in a study of Taiwan’s electronics industry, showed that

FDI did indeed increase the probability of survival.

    Within our sample, the FDI group accounted for 28.23 per cent of all

manufacturing sector employment in 1993, but by 2000, this figure had risen to 30.10

per cent. If we count only those firms that were in existence in 1993, the employment

share in 2000 was 27.28 per cent, representing only a slight fall on the 1993

proportion despite the fact that a quarter of them had been eliminated in the interim

period. In contrast, the non-FDI group accounted for 71.77 per cent of all

manufacturing sector employment in 1993, and 69.90 per cent in 2000. However, if


                                             8
new entrants are excluded, the surviving firms in the non-FDI group account for only

46.06 per cent of employment in 2000. Simple statistics again suggest that FDI

enabled investing firms to maintain more jobs at home.

    It is worth noting that firms that exited the manufacturing industry during the

period under study eliminated 478,369 jobs, or 22.2 per cent of the total employment

in 1993. These losses were more than offset by the 610,962 jobs created by new

entrants coming into the industry during the eight-year period. Total employment

provided by those firms that survived the period is virtually unchanged; however,

employment per firm increased by 12.0 per cent in the FDI group, in contrast to the

5.7 per cent decline in the non-FDI group.

As demonstrated by Lipsey (1994) and Blomstrom, et. al. (1997), the employment

effect of FDI may differ by investment location; thus, we should also examine the

data on Taiwan to see whether geographical location matters. Taiwanese FDI has been

concentrated in China since the early 1990s; however, there is one perspective which

argues that investment in China is potentially more harmful to domestic employment

than FDI in other regions. The reason for this, so the argument goes, is because of the

cultural proximity and similarity in labor skills, with production in China being likely

to duplicate what had previously been done in Taiwan and therefore exerting a strong

substitution effect on domestic employment.



    In order to examine the location effect, we classify those firms undertaking

overseas investment into four subgroups according to the location of their investment.

The first subgroup contains firms undertaking investment in China only; the second

subgroup contains firms investing in China plus other regions; the third subgroup

                                             9
contains firms investing in regions other than China; and the fourth subgroup contains

firms with unknown FDI locations. Table 3 provides details of the level of

employment for the four respective subgroups in 1993 and 2000.

      As the table shows, of the 2,843 firms that undertook overseas investment and

survived the 1993-2000 period, 1,048 had invested only in China, 630 had invested in

China and somewhere else, 692 had invested only outside of China and the remainder

had invested in unknown regions. Those investing only in China were apparently

smaller in size as their average employment was only 116.58 in 1993, substantially

lower than the average employment level for the entire FDI group; furthermore, the

average employment of this subgroup declined again, to 107.55 employees, in 2000.

In contrast, the subgroup investing only outside of China registered the highest

growth rate in employment of all the subgroups, at 33.49 per cent, whilst firms that

invested in China and other regions saw their employment rise by 16.99 per cent.

      This seems to suggest that investing only in China undermines the investor’s

capacity to maintain jobs at home; however, this conclusion is somewhat premature as

there are other factors that may affect domestic employment after an enterprise invests

abroad. Two obvious factors are firm size and industry. It is well established within

the literature that firm size is positively correlated to the ability to invest abroad

(Caves 1971; 1996). Large firms may therefore be more capable of undergoing

internal restructuring after they have invested abroad and therefore more capable of

                                                          10
maintaining jobs at home (Chen and Ku, 2000).

     Industry is also an important factor because a high-growth industry provides more

opportunities for firms to diversify after they have invested abroad. In order to test the

size and industry effects, we make a two-way classification of firms according to their

size and industry affiliations; firms that employ more than 300 persons are classified as

large firms, the rest are small firms. Industries that have grown by more than 30 per

cent in output between 1993 and 2000 are considered to be ‘high-growth’ industries,

otherwise they are ‘low-growth’ industries; the demarcation line of 30 per cent is the

average growth rate in entire manufacturing output for the period under study.

     We apply analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine how much FDI location

matters when controlling for industry and size, and vice versa; the results are shown

in Table 4 which indicates that when controlling for investment location, employment

growth is significantly affected by both industry and size. Firms in the high-growth

industries show a significantly higher employment growth rate than those in the

low-growth industries, whilst large firms show a significantly higher employment

growth rate than small firms.

     When both industry and firm size are controlled for, investment location becomes

inconsequential, except for the small-firm group where those investing in China only

registered the lowest employment growth rate, as compared to those investing outside

of China. This seems to suggest that job displacement, if there is any, may affect small


                                               11
firms that choose to invest solely in China.


ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF FDI ON EMPLOYMENT

In this section, we estimate the statistical effects of FDI on employment, using a

production function to portray the relationship between domestic and overseas

operations. We basically treat overseas operation and domestic operation as joint

production which can be portrayed by an appropriate production function. The output

from overseas production may serve as an intermediate input to domestic production,

thereby reducing the cost of domestic production; by so doing, this reduces the

demand for domestic primary inputs, including labor. The output from overseas

production may also add to the burden of domestic operations if it requires managerial

and technical support from the headquarters. Here, we treat the output from both

overseas and domestic operations as two joint outputs from centrally-managed

production aimed at minimizing overall costs.

    We employ the generalized Leontief production function developed by Diewert

(1971) and Hall (1973) to portray a cross-border operation yielding two distinctive

outputs Y1 and Y2; where Y1 is the output from domestic operations and Y2 is that from

foreign operations. There are three kinds of labor inputs to production, namely

managerial workers, technical workers and blue-collar workers. Labor is finely

classified because we are concerned about the effects of FDI on different kinds of

labor, given the complexity of the international division of labor. Three kinds of

workers constitute a composite labor input underlying which is a sub-production

function. The relationship between this composite labor input and capital is a Leontief

relationship; therefore the demand for labor can be solely determined by output levels

and wages, irrespective of capital input. We can therefore depict the cost function of

the composite labor as follows:

                                           12
C (Y 1, Y 2, W 1, W 2, W 3 ) = β 1Y 1W 1 + β 2Y 1W 2 + β 3Y 1W 3 + β 4Y 2W 1 + β 5Y 2W 2 + β 6Y 2W 3
                          + 2 β 7W 1 Y 1Y 2 + 2 β 8W 2 Y 1Y 2 + 2 β 9W 3 Y 1Y 2 + 2 β 10Y 1 W 1W 2
                          + 2 β 11Y 1 W 1W 3 + 2 β 12Y 1 W 2W 3 + 2 β 13Y 2 W 1W 2
                          + 2 β 14Y 2 W 2W 3 + 2 β 15Y 2 W 1W 3 + 4 β 16 Y 1Y 2W 1W 2
                          + 4 β 17 Y 1Y 2W 2W 3 + 4 β 18 Y 1Y 2W 1W 3


       where C is the total cost of labor; and W1, W2 and W3 are the respective unit costs

of managerial workers, technical workers and blue-collar workers. Note that outputs

Y 1 , Y 2 are measured by value-added in NT dollar terms. The sample covers firms

from various industries and value-added is the only meaningful measuring unit

common to all industries.

       Although generalized Leontief production function restricts the production

technology to be constant returns to scale, it does allow the elasticity of substitution

(or complementarity) between three kinds of labor to be flexible. The

inter-relationship between different kinds of labor in production is the focus of our

study.

       Using Shepherd’s lemma, we may derive the labor demand equation for each

kind of worker:

       ∂C
L1 =        = β 1Y 1 + β 4Y 2 + 2β 7 Y 1Y 2 + β 10Y 1 W 2 W 1 + β 11Y 1 W 3 W 1 + β 13Y 2 W 2 W 1
       ∂W 1
                                        + β 15Y 2 W 3 W 1 + 2β 16 Y 1Y 2W 2 W 1 + 2β 18 Y 1Y 2W 3 W 1

       ∂W 2
                                        + β 14Y 2 W 3 W 2 + 2β 16 Y 1Y 2W 1 W 2 + 2β 17 Y 1Y 2W 3 W 2

        ∂C
L3 =        = β 3Y 1 + β 6Y 2 + 2β 9 Y 1Y 2 + β 11Y 1 W 1 W 3 + β 12Y 1 W 2 W 3 + β 14Y 2 W 2 W 3
       ∂W 3
                                        + β 15Y 2 W 1 W 3 + 2β 17 Y 1Y 2W 2 W 3 + 2β 18 Y 1Y 2W 1 W 3

                                                                                    ……………. (1)

       where L1, L2 and L3 denote managerial, technical and blue-collar workers,


                                                  13
respectively.

    We may use seemingly unrelated regressions to estimate Equation (1), taking into

consideration the fact that disturbance terms in the three single equations may be

somehow correlated. In undertaking the regression, we should impose cross-equation

restrictions on parameters to ensure that the same estimate is produced for any parameter

that appears in more than one equation. From the parameter estimates, we can easily

measure the effects of Y1 and Y2 on each kind of labor demand, as shown in Equation (1).

    In order to measure the quantity of labor, data was drawn from the latest survey

on employment undertaken by Taiwan’s Bureau of Labor Affairs (BOLA) in 1999.

The survey classifies labor into nine categories, but these nine categories are far too

many to handle and also contain many zeros; therefore, they are combined into three

categories to suit our purposes: (i) supervisors (managers), administrative and

professional staff are classified as managerial workers; (ii) engineers, technicians and

specialists are classified as technical workers; and (iii) operators, laborers and service

workers are classified as blue-collar workers. The raw data drawn from the three

small labor categories are converted into a large category, using the Divisia index,

with each sample mean being normalized to unity. We thus obtained the measures for

L1 (managerial workers), L2 (technical workers), and L3 (blue-collar workers).

    Wage rates W1, W2, W3 are obtained by dividing the respective total wage bills by

the measures of L1, L2 and L3. The data for domestic output (Y1) and overseas output

(Y2) are obtained from the 1999 Survey on Overseas Investment by Manufacturing

Firms undertaken by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA). This survey also

provides information on investment locations, but it only covers manufacturing firms

that possess overseas affiliates. The BOLA and MOEA surveys are combined to yield

394 observations, all of which are firms engaged in FDI. We then randomly drew 140

non-FDI firms from the BOLA survey in order to supplement the observations using

                                           14
firms without overseas affiliates. The total of 140 was taken so as to make the ratio of

FDI to non-FDI firms roughly 3:1. The combined sample of 534 firms form the basis

of our regression analysis, but only 451 of them contain complete data for entry into

the regression estimation. Both MOEA and BOLA surveys covered firms of all sizes,

so there is no selection bias problem associated with size. The regression results are

shown in Table 5.

      If we fit the parameter estimates into Equations (2) and (3), we obtain the estimated

effects of Y1 and Y2 on labor demand. The values of Y1 and Y2, and W1, W2 and W3, are

taken to be the sample means. We estimate these effects for firms investing in different

locations as we did in the previous section. The results are shown in Table 6.

Note: Domestic and overseas production is estimated in NT$ billions.



      It can be seen from Table 6 that the demand for all kinds of labor increases with an

increase in domestic output. For example, for those firms investing in China only, the

demand for managerial workers increases by 0.1760 for each NT$ billion (Taiwanese

currency) increase in domestic output (as Y1 is measured in NT$ billions). Since the

Divisia index for labor has been normalized, this figure implies that in comparison with


                                                            16
the sample mean, there is an increase of 17.60 per cent in managerial workers. Similarly

for each NT$ billion increase in domestic output, the demand for technical workers

increases by 29.88 per cent, and the demand for blue-collar workers increases by 14.12

per cent. The results indicate that by 1999, the expansion in domestic production had

led to an expansion in all three kinds of labor, although technical personnel tended to

benefit the most, followed by managerial staff, and then blue-collar workers the least.

This pattern prevails across all investment locations, despite the fact that firm size

differs significantly across different subgroups. This implies that the output effect on

employment is mainly driven by the nature of technology which, as Taiwanese industry

intensifies its technology content, tends to favor technical workers.

    Table 7 lists the mean values of Y1 and Y2 for the different FDI subgroups. It can

be seen that the subgroup of firms investing in China only is the smallest of the three

groups in terms of domestic output, followed by the subgroup investing in China plus

other regions, with the subgroup investing only outside of China being the largest.

However, the subgroup investing in China and other regions also has the highest

overseas production ratio, at 0.702, followed by the ‘China only’ subgroup at 0.475,

and then the ‘outside China’ subgroup at 0.292.

    Referring back to Table 6 also shows that overseas production has exerted a

uniformly negative effect on each kind of labor, which suggests that when holding

domestic output constant, domestic employment for a firm engaging in overseas

production will decline by between 2 per cent and 8 per cent. This implies that

overseas production complements domestic production and therefore reduces the need
                                             17
for labor inputs at any given output level. However, we should not jump to the

conclusion that overseas production reduces domestic employment, because such a

complementary relationship also cuts down the cost of domestic production, thus

enhancing the competitiveness of the company as a whole, which in turn, may lead to

an expansion in domestic output. In other words, overseas production exerts a

substitution effect which reduces the demand for labor at any given domestic output,

as well as an output effect which expands domestic production. The net result has to

take both effects into account, thus, it is the output effect to which we now turn.

    We take the Manufacturers Census data, and choose the firms that have survived

throughout the period under study, to explore the effects of FDI on domestic output. A

simple regression is employed to estimate this effect:


          LY 99 = α 0 + α 1LY 93 + α 2 DFI 1 + α 3 DFI 2 + α 4 DFI 3 + α 5 DFI 4 + α 6 IND   (4)


    where the variables are as follows:

         LY 99 : logarithm of domestic output in 1999;

         LY 93 : logarithm of domestic output in 1993;

         DFI 1 : dummy variable for firms investing in China only;

         DFI 2 : dummy variable for firms investing in China and other regions;

         DFI 3 : dummy variable for firms investing only outside China;

         DFI 4 : dummy variable for firms investing in unknown regions;

         IND :     dummy variable for high-growth industries.


    In Equation (4), we use the output in the base year (i.e. 1993), to project the

output in the future year, 1999. Thus the coefficient α 1 reflects the average growth

rate between 1993 and 1999. The dummy variables, DFI1 - DFI4, capture the extra

growth attributable to overseas investments and the dummy variable, IND, captures


                                              18
the extra growth attributable to industry affiliation. Included in the regression analysis

were a total of 50,164 firms that survived the 1993-1999 period. The results are

reported in Table 8, which shows that the coefficients for dummy variables, DFI1 -

DFI4, were all positive and statistically significant. This suggests that foreign

investment does indeed contribute to extra growth in output after controlling for the

industry effect.

      Compared to non-FDI firms, firms investing only in China recorded extra growth

of 18 per cent over the 1993-1999 period; those firms that invested in China and other

regions gained an extra 51.7 per cent; and those whose investment was only outside of

China achieved 46.4 per cent growth. The gains may be different, but other things

being equal, FDI has indeed expanded their domestic output.

      We can therefore estimate the output effect of FDI on domestic production, using

these estimates; that is, our aim is to estimate the additional domestic output which is

attributable to FDI.

      Taking the estimate of α in equation (4), this would be ∆ Y 1 = Y 1 •  α 1 + α
                                                                                         
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
                                                                                          


      where α corresponds to the location of investment. This output effect is to be

added to the substitution effect to come up with the net effect of overseas production

on domestic labor demand; thus, the total effect of FDI on domestic labor Li is:


                                                  19

                                           ∂Y 1        ∂Y 2

    where the first term reflects the output effect and the second term reflects the

substitution effect.

    Inserting the relevant parameter estimates into Equation (5), using the relations

established in Equation (4), we obtain the estimates for total employment effect

arising from FDI. These are shown in Table 9.
Table 9   Overall effect of FDI on domestic employment

                                   Managerial workers     Technical workers   Blue-collar workers
   Investing in China only              0.0402                 0.0717               0.0277
   Investing in China and others        0.1185                 0.1933               0.0755
   Investing outside of China           0.0833                 0.1415              -0.0237



    It can be seen from Table 9 that the total employment effects on FDI are positive

for all kinds of labor and for all investment locations, with the exception of those

investments undertaken outside of China. For the sub-group investing only outside of

China, domestic employment of blue-collar workers is adversely affected by FDI (a

decline of 2.37 per cent). The table also shows that technical workers are the biggest

winners from FDI; regardless of the investment locations, the greatest increase is in the

domestic employment of technical workers. We interpret this outcome as reflecting the

fact that domestic production in recent years has been restructured towards more

technology-intensive methods. Managerial workers also gain substantially from FDI,

but not as much as their technical counterparts. Blue-collar workers gain the least and

they may occasionally even lose. Capital outflow favoring technical workers was also

found in Feenstra (1996), whilst Blomstrom, et. al. (1997) found that it favored

managerial staff. In short, FDI may well affect different labor groups in different ways,

but the overall effect is more likely to be positive than negative. The group which is

most likely to feel any negative effects is the blue-collar group of workers.

    It is noticeable that firms simultaneously investing in China and other regions

                                                 20
create the greatest proportion of new jobs at home. We take this subgroup of firms to

be truly in pursuit of globalization, since globalization leads to an expansion of

domestic production. This also manifests itself in the largest parameter estimate for

DFI2 amongst all DFIs. Those investing only in China do not create as much demand

for technical and managerial workers at home because production in China is

characterized by a low technology requirement and simple production arrangements.

    Going back to Table 3 in which domestic employment is shown to decline for

firms investing only in China, we may conclude that FDI, per se, is not to blame for

the plight of labor; it is instead the fact that these investors belong to low-growth (or

even declining) industries, as well as being small in size, that account for their

inability to maintain their employment levels at home. In addition to the industry

effect, the fact that the ‘China-only’ group did not generate as much output expansion

effect as the other investment groups also contributes to their below-par performance.

Although China production enhances the competitiveness of domestic production, just

like other overseas production, it also takes market opportunities away from Taiwan

because Chinese and Taiwanese suppliers are often viewed by foreign buyers

(particularly in the Western markets) as close substitutes.


CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we study the effects of FDI on domestic employment by examining the data

of Taiwan’s manufacturing industry. In terms of growth in their number of employees,

those firms investing abroad have outperformed those firms that have not undertaken

such investment. Moreover, firms that have invested abroad have a higher probability of

survival than the ‘have-nots’; survival relies upon maintaining jobs at home.

    Treating domestic production and overseas production as two distinctive but

interrelated outputs from a joint production function, we may estimate the effects of

                                            21
overseas production on domestic production, and thereafter, the consequences for

domestic employment. Our study of Taiwanese manufacturing data indicates that

overseas production reduces the demand for labor in domestic operations at any given

domestic output. This implies that through ‘joint production’, overseas production

reduces the input requirements at home to yield a given domestic output. In other words,

overseas production substitutes for primary inputs in the domestic production process.

    From a presumption of cost-minimization, this implies that overseas production

complements domestic production to reduce the overall costs of cross-border

operations, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of a company; this is to be

achieved through a division of labor between the headquarters and the affiliates. Such

enhanced competitiveness, in turn, helps firms to expand their domestic output, which

leads to an increase in the demand for labor. Therefore, the total effect of FDI on

domestic employment is a combination of output expansion effect and input

substitution effect. Our estimates show that, in most cases, the output expansion effect

more than offsets the input substitution effect to yield a net positive effect on domestic

employment; however, the magnitude of employment effect arising from FDI differs

across different labor groups.

    In the case of Taiwan, technical workers tend to benefit most from FDI, followed

by managerial workers, with blue-collar workers benefiting the least; indeed they may

even be adversely affected. This implies that after overseas investment has taken place,

a reconfiguration of the division of labor within a firm will tend to shift domestic

production toward technology- and management-intensive operations.

    Different investment locations exert slightly different impacts on domestic

employment mainly because of the differences in output expansion effect. Those firms

that invest only in China contribute the least to the expansion of domestic output,

followed by firms that invest only outside of China, whilst FDI covering both China

                                           22
and other regions is most conducive to domestic output expansion.
