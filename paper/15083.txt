A recent literature emphasizes the political economy underpinnings of economic underdevelopment. It

notes that powerful constituencies, which arise for example from the pattern of land holdings in a country,

can drive the development of economic institutions, and growth more generally (see, for example,

Engermann and Sokoloff (2002)). Banks are clearly important economic institutions. While historians

have argued that political forces have shaped banking systems (see, for example, Haber (2005a)), there

has been little systematic examination of the evidence. In this paper we examine more systematically

whether the constituencies or interest groups that emerge in a country as a result of the distribution of land

holdings – often the earliest and most important form of wealth -- can shape the development of the
                  1
banking system.

        The precise channel through which constituencies or interest groups operate is also a matter of

some debate. Some (see, for example, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005)) argue that the

mediating channel is political institutions, as elite interest groups create coercive political institutions that

give them the power to hold back the development of economic institutions, and hence economic growth.

Others (see, for example, Engerman and Sokoloff (2003), Rajan and Zingales (2003a, chapter 6) or Rajan

(2009)) argue that a divided society may be sufficient to hold back the development of economic

institutions, even if political institutions are broadly egalitarian.

        One way to make progress on both questions (whether landed interest groups affect financial

development and whether this can happen even in broadly democratic societies) is to examine patterns

within broad political units such as countries or states, where political institutions are held relatively

constant. To this end, we explore how the structure of banking across counties in the United States in the

early part of the 20th century was driven by the distribution of land within the county. We focus on banks

because they were, and in many areas still are, the most important source of local finance, and thus are

important economic institutions. Likewise, we focus on the distribution of land because it represents the

distribution of agricultural wealth and interests at a time when agriculture was still a key sector in the U.S.

economy.




                                                                                                                2
Why Did Landlords Restrict Credit?

        Clearly, large landowners may have had the money and power to influence county politics even

in a flourishing democracy. But why would they want to restrict access to credit for others, especially

small farmers and tenants, by limiting the spread of banks? The contemporary literature suggests a

number of reasons. First, large landowners generated loanable surpluses. Formal credit institutions could

be competition for their business of lending to tenants and small farmers.

        Second, tenants and small farmers needed credit to buy supplies from the local store. By limiting

credit from alternative sources – for instance, by keeping banks out -- the local merchant could lock the

farmer in and charge exorbitant prices. Indeed, such lock-in was formalized in a “crop-lien” loan,

whereby the merchant required that in return for an advance of goods, the contracting farmer would

        sign over, as a guarantee that the account would be paid, his “entire crop of cotton,
        cotton-seed, fodder, peas, and potatoes”. His personal property, chattels, and real estate,
        if he had any, might also be included in the mortgage, and in case he should find it
        impossible to pay his entire indebtedness out of the proceeds of the season’s crop, he was
        legally obligated to continue trading with the merchant who held the lien until the
        account should be settled in full….The farmer … must pay whatever prices the merchant
        chose to ask. He must market his crop through the merchant he owed until the debt was
        satisfied, and only then had he any right to determine the time and method of its
        disposal… 2


Initially, there was a conflict of interest between large landlords and the local merchant because they both

had an interest in tenant farmers. But, “as time went on, the two classes tended more and more to become

one.” Landlords were drawn into the store business by “the desirability of supplying their tenants,” while

“storekeepers frequently became landowners by taking over the farms of those who were indebted to

them or by direct purchase at the prevailing low price.” 3

        Among landlords, large landowners had an incentive to “accommodate” their own tenants, as

doing so gave them greater control over tenants. By contrast, small and medium farmers did not have

surpluses to lend out, and one detailed study of Texas concludes that “on the whole, they [owners of small

and medium farms] would rather the tenant would get his money in his own way.” 4




                                                                                                            3
        For the rich landlord, there were other benefits to limiting access to credit than simply extracting

rents from the less-well-off when they purchased goods. The landlord could also enjoy a competitive

advantage, for instance, by being able to buy land cheaply when small farmers were hit by adversity or by

having privileged access to loans in the midst of a prolonged drought. He could further prevent unskilled

workers from obtaining the funds needed to educate themselves and expand their own employment

opportunities, thus ensuring a reserve army of workers for field work (see Galor, Moav, and Vollrath

(2009)). He might also prevent the emergence of alternative centers of economic power and status by

limiting their access to finance (Chapman (1934)).

        Along these lines, Calomiris and Ramirez (2004) argue that unit banking laws (that is, laws

preventing in-state banks from opening multiple branches, and out-of-state banks from entering the state)

provided large farmers with insurance during periods of agricultural distress. Specifically, national banks

or state banks with branches could foreclose more easily on loans, and transfer capital to less distressed

areas. By preventing such reallocation, unit banking laws provided borrowers insurance. Of course,

wealthier farmers would benefit more from keeping capital locally, and Calomiris and Ramirez indeed

find more restrictions in states with greater farm wealth.

How Did Landlords Maintain Their Hold?

        If indeed there were profit opportunities to be made in lending to small and tenant farmers, why

did banks and other formal credit institutions not enter this business? Some argue that the supply of

formal bank credit was artificially constrained through state-level legislation. For instance, legislation like

North Carolina’s Landlord Lien Law, which gave landlords an automatic crop lien [a first claim against

the crop] against any advances extended to tenants working their land, strongly reinforced the system of

‘debt peonage’ [the system whereby tenants were trapped in a cycle of debt to their landlords]. 5

Intuitively, if landlords had a senior claim against the tenant’s crop regardless of when their claim was

contracted, no one else would be willing to lend to the tenant fearing their claim would be diluted by

existing or prospective landlord claims.




                                                                                                               4
        Landlords could also assert power independently of state level legislation. The merging of the

roles of landlord and merchant provided these individuals with considerable local power, and historical

narratives observe that these individuals often used their control of the local judiciary and political

system, as well as their monopoly over local commerce to deter bank entry and other threats to the status

quo (Goodwyn (1978), Van Woodward (1951), Weiner (1975)). For example, to the extent the sheriff

enforced some claims more willingly than others, and to the extent that large landowners used their power

to direct business to some banks and not others, local powers could alter the structure of banking.

        Finally, there is some evidence that when the small farmers did secure political power, they tried

to create alternative sources of credit, suggesting they chafed under credit constraints and the associated

limitation on the channels through which they could purchase and sell products. In North Dakota, for

example, after winning the 1916 gubernatorial race with the help of small farmers, the Populist Party

created the United States’ first state-owned bank, the Bank of North Dakota. The bank’s charter (Bank of

North Dakota (1920) begins:

Nor is it strange that under these conditions private interests sometimes take advantage of the needs of the
people to keep down the prices of farm products, and exorbitantly to advance the prices of the things the
farmers had to buy and the rates of interest for farm loans…the only permanent remedy lay in state
ownership and control of market and credit facilities.


Alternative Motives and Views

        It is not obvious landlords only had incentives to suppress formal credit. First, instead of focusing

on preserving his share of a small local pie by limiting bank competition and credit access, and thus

squeezing the small farmer and tenants, the large landowner might have been better off increasing the size

of the local pie, even if his share were diminished. For instance, greater access to formal finance would

draw more potential buyers into the land market, allowing the value of his own land to appreciate.

Whether stronger landlord interests lead to a more constrained financial sector and less financial access is

an empirical question, which we attempt to answer. Second, a concentrated distribution of wealth can, in

some theoretical models such as Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990), result in greater intermediation – the

wealthy can pay the fixed costs of starting up banks. Third, a finding of a correlation between measures of


                                                                                                              5
the strength of landlord interests and limitations on access to formal finance need not imply the former

caused the latter. We therefore have to pay attention to issues of causation.

Findings

        We find that in the early 20th century, counties in which the agricultural elite had

disproportionately large land holdings had significantly fewer banks per capita, even correcting for state

level effects. Moreover, credit appears to have been costlier, and access to it more limited, in these

counties. The evidence thus suggests that elites may restrict financial development in order to limit access

to finance, and they may be able to do so even in countries with well developed political institutions.

        While our focus is on financial development, the paper has broader implications. A recent trend

in the literature on the underdevelopment of nations has been to attribute such outcomes to the historically

weak political institutions (see, for example, the literature emanating from North (1990) and North and

Weingast (1989)). While U.S. political institutions in the 1920s were far from perfect, they were also far

from the coercive political structures that are typically held responsible for persistent underdevelopment.

Yet even in the U.S., we find large variations in the development of growth-facilitating economic

institutions such as banks, across areas with different constituencies but under the same meta-political

structures. The significant, and potentially adverse, influence of powerful constituencies intent on

preserving their privileged position, even in such environments suggests that fixing political institutions

alone cannot be a panacea for the problem of underdevelopment.

        We are, of course, not the first to address these issues of access to finance and monopoly power in

the United States. Indeed, for a while, there was a heated debate amongst economists over whether

differentials in interest rates across regions in the United States around the turn of the 19th century were

evidence of monopoly power based on legal restrictions on entry (see, for example, Davis (1965) and the

responses in Binder and Brown (1991), Eichengreen (1984), James (1976), and Sylla (1975)), or whether

the variation in interest rates was due to differences in risk. We believe that these questions deserve to be

revisited, not only because they shed light on the process of financial and economic development (which

is of contemporary interest to many developing countries), but also because we have access to richer and


                                                                                                               6
more detailed data than did these past studies (we have data at the county level rather than at the region or

state level).

         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we lay out the basic test. In Section II,

we derive more detailed predictions on whether large land owners exerted influence to suppress access to

credit, while in Section III, we examine actual access to credit in counties with concentrated land

holdings. We conclude in Section IV.

           I. LANDED INTERESTS AND COUNTY-LEVEL BANK STRUCTURE: THE BASIC TEST

         What could be a proxy for the strength of landed interests and their desire to limit access to

finance? In any argument where there is a group of larger farmers who “exploit”, there has to be another

group of small farmers or tenants who are explicitly “exploited” (as in the debt peonage hypothesis) or are

implicitly “exploited” (for instance, if they contribute savings to the local pool but do not get loans in a

downturn because their access to finance is deliberately left underdeveloped, as in Calomiris and Ramirez

(2004)). One measure of the relative strength of these two constituencies is the Gini coefficient of land

farmed, which measures the degree of inequality of land holdings. If land holdings are very unequal, large

landowners could have both the ability and the incentive to limit access to finance, while if land holdings

are relatively equal (whether uniformly large or small), no one group is likely to have the power or the

interest to alter others’ access. 6

         Our measure of the concentration of land holdings is based on the distribution of farm sizes, as in

Ramcharan (2009a). The data were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau at the county level for each of

the decennial census years 1890 to 1930. A farm is defined as “all the land which is farmed by one

person, either by his own labor alone or with the assistance of members of his household or hired hands.”

Note that a tenant is also a farmer by this definition. We have information on the number of farms falling

within particular acreage categories or bins, ranging from below three acres up to 1,000 acres. Assuming

the midpoint of each bin is the average size of farms in that bin, we construct the Gini coefficient to

summarize the farm acreage data (see the Appendix for a precise formula and definitions). The Gini

coefficient is a measure of concentration that lies between zero and one, with higher values indicating that


                                                                                                                  7
farms at both ends of the size distribution account for a greater proportion of total agricultural land—that

is, the holding of agricultural land is unequally distributed.

        ---------------- Table I approximately here -----------------------------

        In the 1920s, the average Gini coefficient of a county is 0.43, the 99th percentile county is 0.69,

the 1st percentile county is 0.2, and the standard deviation is 0.10 (see Table I for summary statistics). The

correlation between the Gini coefficent for a county and the share of agricultural land in small farms

(below 20 acres) is positive, as is the correlation with the share of large farms (above 175 acres). The

correlation between the Gini coefficent and the share of medium sized farms (between 20 acres and 175

acres) is negative. Thus, as we would expect, counties with high Gini coefficients tend to have more land

in both small as well as large farms. Interestingly, as a result of the greater weight in small farms, counties

with Gini coefficients above the median have smaller farms on average than counties with Gini

coefficients below median.

        We now examine county-level data on land inequality from 1890 to 1930 to help assess the

impact of the concentration of agricultural land on the various indicators of banking structure. Our

hypothesis is that, correcting for state effects, the greater the power of local landed interests, as proxied

for by the degree of land concentration in a county, the greater their ability to shape the structure of

banking in the county.

A. Banking Density and Concentration

        One measure of bank structure is to simply count the number of banks in a county, normalized by

the number of people in or by the area of the county. Bank density at the county level is an informative

measure of access to finance as well as of bank market structure during this period (Evanoff (1988)).

Distance was an important factor in economic activity at this time, as Federal involvement in road

construction had not yet begun, road transport networks were relatively primitive, and automobile use was

still limited (Baum-Snow(2007), Ramcharan (2009b)). Moreover, during this period, policy debates on

the availability of credit often revolved around the geographic proximity of banks, as access to financial




                                                                                                                8
services was more restricted in counties with limited banking density (Cartinhour and Westerfield

(1980)). 7

         ---------------------------- Figure 1 here ----------------------------------

         The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides county-level data on the number of

state- and nationally-chartered banks in the county, as of 1920. We begin by examining the relationship

between the density of banks in a county and the concentration of land holdings. Figure 1 suggests a

negative relationship between bank density and land concentration both in the full sample of counties in

the data—about 3,000—and when restricting the sample to counties located in either the northern or

southern regions of the United States.

         This negative relationship between banks per capita in 1920 and land concentration can be

formally established through an OLS regression controlling for aggregate state-level factors using state

indicators. We can also control for county-level geographic characteristics including the log of county

area and its distance from various waterways. Waterways were centers of economic activity as well as

transportation (and if freshwater, of irrigation). For instance, waterways such as the Great Lakes in the

upper Midwest and the Atlantic Ocean along the east coast helped spur industrialization and demand for

financial services in those regions (Pred (1966)). Including these variables helps control for other

determinants of a county’s prosperity and the kind of economic activity it might undertake.

         The coefficient estimate of land concentration in the OLS regression (see the Internet Appendix,

available online at http://www.afajof.org/supplement.asp) is negative and strongly statistically significant

(at the 1% level). A one-standard deviation increase in land inequality is associated with a decline in the

per capita number of banks circa 1920 of 0.31of its standard deviation. The precision and magnitude of

the correlation in the 1930 cross-section is similar. When we pool both cross-sections and include county

fixed effects, which helps absorb the effects of geography, soil types, location, and any other potentially

relevant unobserved time-invariant county characteristics that might be linearly correlated with land

concentration, we get estimates about 30% larger than the 1920 OLS results.




                                                                                                              9
        Before making too much of this, we should recognize that there are potential biases in the

estimated coefficient. Well-known theoretical arguments predict that economic inequality can itself be

shaped by credit availability and other forms of asset market incompleteness (Aghion and Bolton (1997),

Banerjee and Newman (1991), Galor and Zeira (1993)), making reverse causality a likely feature of the

data. More banks, for example, might mean more credit availability, allowing more people to buy farms

and reducing concentration. However, the biases could go in either direction. More competition amongst

banks may mean weaker relationships between banks and farmers, which could lead to greater

foreclosures of marginal farmers in times of distress, and hence greater land concentration (see Calomiris

and Ramirez (2004) or Petersen and Rajan (1995)). If this effect is present, our OLS estimate would

understate the true effect of concentration on banks per capita. The larger coefficient estimate for land

concentration in the county fixed effects estimation suggests that this direction is plausible. To better

correct for such reverse causality, we turn to instrumental variables.

B. Land Concentration Again

        Clearly, a large number of factors have historically determined how land in a particular county is

distributed (see Gates (1973) or Hicks (1931)). These include the historical settlement patterns (Western

frontier or Eastern seaboard), the nature of settlers (immigrants from overseas or settlers from previously

settled areas in the country), the role of the government (including land grants to railroads and

universities), and the role of past events like the Civil War, financial crises, and droughts.

        A large literature in agricultural economics suggests that land concentration in the United States

is also related to weather patterns (Ackerman and Harris (1946), Gardner (2002), Heady (1952), Tomich,

Kilby and Johnston (1995)). The underlying logic rests on the idea that given the technologies of the

period, crops suited for plantation agriculture such as sugar cane, tobacco, fruit, and nuts thrived in

warmer counties with regular and heavy rainfall. Some of these crops—such as sugarcane—required

processing soon after harvesting. The need for significant capital investments in the mill, as well as the

possibility of hold-up of farmers by the mill owner meant that joint ownership of the land and the mill




                                                                                                             10
was more efficient, with economies of scale stemming from the mill carrying over to the land and

warranting a large plantation. 8

        Furthermore, because of the seasonality of work on plantations, it would be reasonable for

workers to rent small plots where they could grow other crops such as vegetables. Thus, large farms that

focused on plantation-style agriculture would also often be surrounded by smaller, tenant farms, naturally

leading to a high Gini coefficient. By contrast, grain—wheat and barley—which are better suited to more

temperate climates, exhibited fewer economies of scale, and were associated with more moderate-sized

and equitable land holdings.

        The key aspect of weather driving crop choice is rainfall. Flue cured or Virginia tobacco, for

example, requires rainfall between 23 to 31 inches per annum, while Nebraska wheat usually thrives in

regions that receive between 14 to 21 inches of rain per annum (Seitz (1948), Myers (1940)). Even within

states, more arid counties—the Piedmont region of central Virginia for example—may have had a more

equitable distribution of farm sizes because of their suitability for grain production. 9 Engerman and

Sokoloff (2002) employ a similar argument to explain the role of geographic endowments in shaping

historic cross-country differences in land inequality across North and South America. And using U.S.

Census data as early as 1860, Vollrath (2006) provides evidence consistent with the role of geographic

endowments in shaping land inequality across a sample of U.S. counties.

        In sum, our instrument for land concentration is average rainfall (though later in the paper we use

other instruments such as the variance of rainfall in robustness checks), and the mediating channel is the

kind of crops that the prevailing pattern of rainfall facilitates. In Table II we present correlations between

our measure of land concentration and the fraction of area covered by different crops in the county,

average annual rainfall, as well as other indicators of climatic conditions (pooling data from 1920 and

1930). As Table II shows, there is a significant positive correlation of 0.35 between average rainfall and

land concentration. The higher the average rainfall, the less the share of basic cereals, other grains and

seeds, and hay and forage like sorghum in the crops grown in a county. Indeed, these were typically crops

grown in the Midwest and other areas with relatively little rainfall.


                                                                                                             11
        ----------Table II here---------

        By contrast, fruit and nuts, which were typically grown in both plantations and small tenant plots

in Florida, parts of Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, as well as California and the upper Midwest,

are found more in counties with higher rainfall, as are vegetables. Consistent with the discussion above,

the share of county production in basic cereals, other grains and seeds, and hay and forage land is

significantly negatively correlated with land concentration, while the share in fruit and nuts, as well as

vegetables, is positively correlated with land concentration. 10

        The detailed acreage data in the Agricultural Census of 1910 provides additional corroboration.

For instance, the share of farm acreage devoted to sugar cane—a capital intensive plantation crop—is

positively correlated with both land concentration in 1910 and historic rainfall patterns. 11

        Of course, to be a reasonable instrument, rainfall should not directly drive the demand for (or,

less likely, the supply of) banking services, other than through land concentration. If rainier areas are

more productive, for example, then it is likely that farmers would be richer, and demand more banking

services. This would imply that rainier areas have more banks (given the supply curve), and thus attenuate

any negative effect we would expect to see between instrumented land concentration and banking (thus

biasing the tests against the hypothesis).

        As the first row of Table III suggests, agricultural land in counties with above-median rainfall

were somewhat more productive, producing $15.95 per acre in 1920 versus $15.11 per acre for counties

with below-median rainfall. The difference in productivity widens in 1930 ($9.61 per acre versus $ 7.35

per acre), after a period of falling agricultural prices. By contrast, we find that counties with higher-than-

median rainfall had smaller average farm size. Given that these counties also had higher Gini coefficients

(0.46 vs 0.37), this would suggest they had a few really large farms and many small farms, as argued

earlier. Finally, note that the percentage of crops that failed in any of the counties in 1930 was below 1%,

suggesting that higher average historical rainfall was not necessarily correlated with significantly lower

crop failures – the crops planted seemed to vary appropriately with rainfall patterns. 12




                                                                                                             12
        ------------------------- Table III approximately here ---------------------

        So, taken together, do these data suggest that counties with higher rainfall were composed of

borrowers that would have less need for credit or less creditworthiness to obtain it, or do they suggest the

opposite? On the one hand, the land was somewhat more productive, and crop failures in 1930, though

low across the board, were slightly lower in rainier counties. This does not suggest significantly lower

need or lower creditworthiness. On the other hand, farm sizes were generally lower. However, the

evidence from studies on farm loan defaults in the 1930s does not suggest that defaults were correlated

with size (see, for example, Jones and Durand (1954) and the studies cited therein). The rationale for this

somewhat surprising finding is that those who held small pieces of land typically supplemented their

income through other work – for instance, on plantations or in towns (Jones and Durand (1954, p175)).

So it is not a priori obvious that counties with greater rainfall had borrowers who had lower need for

banking services, especially credit, or were less creditworthy.

        If we look at two other proxies for economic activity in Table III, it is again not obvious that

counties with higher rainfall were less creditworthy. First, the share of value added by manufacturing in

the county turns out to be somewhat higher in counties with above-median rainfall in 1920 (37% versus

25%), though the difference narrows in 1930 (50% versus 43%). This would make farms in counties with

higher-than-median rainfall more creditworthy because of access to non-farm work. By contrast, the share

of owner-occupied housing is lower in counties with higher-than median-rainfall in 1920 (50% versus

58%), with the difference narrowing again in 1930 (49% versus 55%). While this is consistent with less

creditworthy households in counties with greater rainfall, it is also consistent with lower access to credit

in these counties. Indeed, despite having higher productivity of land in counties with above-median

rainfall, the median value of an acre of land is significantly lower in such counties (see Table III) – a

difference that could be driven by the differential availability of credit. Finally, when we examine banks

per capita, the difference is quite extraordinary. There are twice as many banks per capita in counties with

below-median rainfall than in counties with above-median rainfall, both in 1920 and 1930. Interestingly,

the average size of banks, as measured by bank deposits per bank, does not differ much (if anything,


                                                                                                            13
banks are slightly smaller in counties with above-median rainfall), suggesting that the lower number of

banks in counties with higher-than-median rainfall is not because they are larger banks.

        In sum, rainfall appears to drive land concentration by affecting the distribution of farm sizes, but

does not obviously affect the demand for credit, other than through its effect on concentration and perhaps

credit. It is a plausible instrument, certainly exogenous, but also likely to satisfy the exclusion criterion.

However, it would be useful in our tests to correct for some of the obvious explanatory variables

identified above to ensure that they do not drive any of our results (though we also have to be careful that

by including “endogenous” explanatory variables like owner occupancy, we do not absorb some of the

explanatory power of land concentration for access to credit).

        At the same time, no natural instrument can completely satisfy the exclusion criterion. Rather

than abandoning any attempt at examining important historical data, we offer a battery of tests that help

build an overall pattern of results rather than rely on one single test that would depend excessively on the

plausibility of the instrument.

C. Instrumental Variables Estimates

        In the first column of Table IV, we present estimates for a first stage where the dependent

variable is land concentration in 1920 and the explanatory variables are the mean rainfall in the county

computed using data from weather monitoring stations over the period 1900 to 2000, state indicators, and

the geographical variables. The coefficient estimate on mean rainfall is positive and statistically

significant at the 1% level, consistent with the literature. 13 Using these geophysical controls, the

corresponding second-stage IV estimates are reported in Table IV, Column 3. The coefficient on

instrumented concentration is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. As with the fixed

effects results, the IV coefficient is larger in magnitude than in the OLS regression, suggesting the OLS

estimate is biased towards zero. In this case, a one-standard deviation increase in land concentration

reduces the number of banks per capita by about 1.2 standard deviations. To put these estimates in

perspective, for a county of average population in the sample, about 31,000 people, a one-standard




                                                                                                                 14
deviation increase in land concentration translates into approximately fifteen fewer banks, or a 1.5

standard deviation decrease in the number of banks.

        --------------------------- Table IV approximately here -----------------------



D. Addressing Possible Violations of the Exclusion Restriction Assumption

         There is the concern, of course, that land concentration might proxy for some omitted variable

that is also correlated with the number of banks per capita. In particular, a poor, low skilled population, as

well as the very young, might not have the ability to farm land independently and might also be an

unattractive target market for banks. We should also account for the possibility of discrimination, both in

terms of blacks not having access to education and in terms of their being denied access to financial

services (see Ransom and Sutch (1972)). Therefore, we include as additional controls the fraction of the

county population that is illiterate, the fraction that is young, and the fraction that is black. Moreover,

because banking density might be directly affected by the size and spatial distribution of the population,

we include the log population, as well as the fraction of the population that is urban (reflecting the degree

to which population is unevenly distributed across the county). For instance, the more urban the

population, the more the population is concentrated in a few areas and hence the fewer the bank offices

needed to service them.

        Of course, these demographic controls are arguably less exogenous than the geographic controls

we included earlier. Nevertheless, it is heartening that in Column 4 of Table IV the coefficient estimate on

concentration in the IV regression is negative, strongly statistically significant, and indeed a little larger in

magnitude with these additional controls than the coefficient estimated in Column 3. The first-stage

estimates in Column 2 are also little changed (the full regression estimates are in the Internet

Appendix). 14 This suggests that concentration does not proxy for these controls. This will be our baseline

regression. In what follows, we conduct some additional robustness checks.

        In Table IV Column 5, the dependent variable is banks per capita in 1930, and we estimate the IV

regression with the full panoply of geographic and demographic controls. The coefficient estimate on land


                                                                                                              15
concentration is again negative and strongly statistically significant. In Table IV Column 6, the dependent

variable is a different measure of bank density, banks per square kilometer in 1920. Again, however, we

find the coefficient on instrumented land concentration is negative and strongly statistically significant.15

Alternative Instruments

        Much of the increase in the number of banks occurred after 1890, as federal and state authorities

competed to weaken chartering requirements, capital requirements, reserve requirements, and portfolio

restrictions in order to attract more banks into their system (White (1982)). The number of state banks

grew from 2,534 in 1890 to 14,512 in 1914 while the number of national banks grew from 3,484 to 7,518.

Land inequality in 1890 thus pre-dates much of the structural change in banking, and could also be a

plausible instrument for land concentration in 1920. We find that when we replace average rainfall as the

instrument in the basic specification in Table IV Column 4 with land inequality in 1890, the coefficient

estimate on instrumented land inequality in 1920 (see Table IV Column 7) is negative and significant.

Pre-determination does not, however, imply the instrument satisfies the exclusion restriction.

        An alternative instrument frequently suggested to us is the standard deviation of rainfall, as

spatially covariant weather risk might also shape the distribution of farm sizes (Ramcharan (2009a)).

However, the variation in weather-related agricultural risk can impact local banking structures through a

number of different channels, suggesting a potential violation of the exclusion criterion. Nonetheless, to

gauge the sensitivity of our results, we add this variable to our instrument set in Column 8. The estimated

impact of land concentration on bank density is similar to the previous results, and standard

overidentification tests do not detect a violation of the exclusion criterion—the Hansen J-statistic is 1.16

(p-value=0.28). As an alternative to using the standard deviation of rainfall as an instrument, we can

include it and other measures of weather risk and local climatic conditions (see Internet Appendix) as

control variables in an OLS regression. We also separately add crop and livestock average productivity

and variability over the period 1860 to 1910 as additional controls. The OLS estimates are robust and

similar across the two specifications, but continue to be smaller than their IV counterparts (the

coefficients of the IV estimates are not reported). 16


                                                                                                           16
        Yet another possible instrument is the variability of land elevation within a county (with higher

elevations having different crops and different optimal land sizes). When elevation is used as an

instrument for concentration in our baseline estimation instead of average rainfall (see The Internet

Appendix) the coefficient on concentration is negative and statistically significant. But when included

with average rainfall, standard overidentification tests suggest a violation of the exclusion restriction

assumption.

        Given that these additional instruments do not add to the analysis, and arguably could violate the

exclusion criterion (for example, elevation could be correlated with the cost of transport), in what follows

we will use average annual rainfall as the instrument in our baseline, as this variable is more likely to

satisfy conditionally the exclusion criterion.

E. Rainfall as a Proxy for Demand Side Factors

        Given that the negative correlation between land concentration and banks per capita or per area

seems fairly robust to time period and choice of instrument, let us turn to a different issue – could the

instrument, rainfall, proxy for factors that reflect the demand for finance? One way to address this is to

include explanatory variables that proxy for demand and see whether these diminish the coefficient

estimate on land concentration.

        The problem, of course, is that proxies for demand could also reflect the supply of finance, which

is the channel we are interested in. For instance, we would think that counties with more owner-occupied

housing are likely to be richer and have greater effective demand for financial services (it is well

established in the literature that the rich have more serviceable demand for financial services than the

poor). However, the availability of credit is also likely to make it easier for households to buy rather than

rent. Thus, the fraction of owner-occupied housing is also likely to be a proxy for credit supply. Similarly,

one could criticize almost any economic proxy for demand.

        Nevertheless, we are on stronger ground if we find that the inclusion of reasonable proxies for

demand does not alter the estimated coefficient on instrumented land concentration significantly. We

identify a number of economic variables in Table III that vary substantially between counties with high


                                                                                                             17
rainfall and counties with low rainfall. Perhaps smaller farms are not credit worthy or perhaps if there are

a few large farms, only a few bank outlets are needed to service them. We include both the log average

size of farms and the log number of farms in the county in the baseline regression. The coefficient on land

concentration is qualitatively similar. Our results are robust to including the share of owner-occupied

housing, land productivity, and the value of land per acre in turn – see Internet Appendix.

F. Land Concentration Working Through Other Channels

        It may be the case that it is not land concentration, but rather the presence of farms of a certain

size that drives the availability of banking services. Therefore, we include in the baseline regression the

share of land area under operation by farms in each size bin. These land shares have the potential to

mechanically absorb much of the explanatory power of the Gini coefficient for land concentration.

Indeed, the coefficient on concentration declines in magnitude by about 45%, but remains significant at

the 1% level (see Internet Appendix). So the distribution, rather than only the share of land in each size

bin, matters.

        It could be argued that different kinds of crops imply different demands for financing. We include

in the baseline regression the value of each type of crop grown in the county, expressed as a share of total

crop values in the county. The coefficient on land concentration is qualitatively the same (see Internet

Appendix).

        The significant coefficient on concentration could be driven by the peculiar political and

agricultural legacy of the Southern states compared to the upper Midwestern agricultural states. When we

estimate a coefficient on concentration separately for the Southern and upper Midwestern agricultural

states (states in the U.S. Census East North Central and West North Central region) in our baseline

regression, they are both negative and statistically significant (see Internet Appendix).

        In addition to finance, the landed elite may have sought control over other local policies,

including the suppression of public goods such as education (Galor, Moav and Vollrath (2008), and

Ramcharan (2009a)). And rather than reflecting the direct influence of land concentration on local

banking structures, these results might indirectly reflect the success of these groups in limiting human


                                                                                                              18
capital investment, and thus, the demand for finance. The baseline specification already controls for

illiteracy, but we also include the per capita education expenditures in the county. This variable is

available only for 1930, and we run our baseline specification using banks per capita in 1930 as the

dependent variable. The coefficient on land concentration remains qualitatively similar to the baseline

(see Internet Appendix).

        The set of possible alternative explanations one could advance for the negative correlation

between land concentration and banks per capita is well nigh unlimited. Therefore, having addressed

some important concerns, we now turn to check in other ways whether this correlation might represent the

influence of landed interests on access to finance. To the extent that these other checks bear out, any

alternative explanation has to pass a stiffer test – it has to explain not just the correlation between land

concentration and banks per capita but also these other correlations.

                               II. THE INFLUENCE OF LANDED INTERESTS

        In this section, we turn to more direct evidence on whether landed interests were influential in

determining banking structure. Specifically, were landed interests more inclined to assert their influence

when the ostensible incentive to do so was higher? What if the channel through which they could control

finance was suppressed? Were landed interests more favorable to the financiers they could control than to

those they could not control? And were landed interests more assertive when their overall ability to exert

influence was higher?

A. Tenancy

        Many of the arguments about the incentives of large land owners to limit access to finance

revolve around tenancy. Land owners could negotiate lucrative share cropping contracts with cash-

strapped tenants or sell goods at a high price where access to credit was limited. Also, because large

farmers were usually owners while small farmers were tenants, in counties with high levels of tenancy a

higher concentration in land holdings would likely reflect a more skewed distribution of economic and

political power than in counties with low levels of tenancy. Thus landed interests would have both a

greater interest and ability to limit finance in counties with greater tenancy.


                                                                                                               19
        To test this conjecture, in Column 1 of Table V we include the interaction between the fraction of

farms in the county operated by tenants and land concentration in the baseline regression, controlling

directly for the impact of tenancy using both linear and quadratic terms. The interaction between land

concentration and the share of tenant farms in the county is negative and significant at the 1% level. For a

county at the 25th percentile level of tenancy in the sample, a one-standard deviation increase in inequality

is associated with about a 1.1 standard deviation decline in banking density. But for a county at the 50th

percentile of tenancy, the impact is roughly 26% larger. Interestingly, the direct correlation of tenancy is

positive and significant. Evaluated around the median levels of concentration and tenancy, a standard

deviation increase in tenancy is associated with a 0.05 standard deviation increase in the number of banks

per capita. This is consistent with the view that tenants had a greater demand for finance and, absent the

influence of landed interests, would have attracted more banks per capita.

------------------------------------ Table V approximately here -------------------------------

Share Cropping and Cash Tenants

        It is useful to distinguish between sharecroppers and cash tenants. Sharecroppers had so little

ready cash that they contracted to pay a share of their output as rent. By contrast, cash tenants could pay

rent up front, and therefore had less need for credit.

        There is suggestive evidence that landlords squeezed sharecroppers because the latter needed

credit. The implicit interest rates on sharecropping contracts were often as high as 150%, with nearly half

of share tenants borrowing approximately 100% of their expected income from their share of the crop

(Brogan (2001)). Thus, because the profitability to the landlord of sharecropping depended on the

underdevelopment of the financial system, landed interests would have been more likely to oppose wider

credit access in counties where sharecropping was more common.

        Unlike sharecroppers, cash tenants owned their harvest, paying landlords a fixed cash rent up

front. These tenants were typically better off since they were either able to self finance the rent for land as

well as the cost of farming, or had pre-arranged sources of financing.




                                                                                                             20
        In Column 2, we include the interaction between the fraction of farms operated by sharecroppers

and land concentration, as well as the fraction of sharecroppers and the fraction of sharecroppers squared.

In Column 3, we do the same for the fraction of cash tenants. In Column 2, for a county at the 25th

percentile level of sharecropping in the sample, a one-standard deviation increase in inequality is

associated with about a 0.89 standard deviation decline in banking density, whereas for a county at the

50th percentile of sharecropping, the impact is about 15% larger. Interestingly, the direct effect of

sharecropping measured at its mean is positive, suggesting that counties with greater sharecropping have,

ceteris paribus, more demand for finance and more banks per capita, but the effect of land concentration

is to reduce the presence of banks, especially in counties with more sharecroppers.

        In contrast to sharecroppers, the interaction term between concentration and the fraction of farms

operated by cash tenants is positive, small and not statistically different from zero. For a county at the 25th

percentile level of cash tenancy in the sample, a one standard deviation increase in land inequality is

associated with about a 1.20 standard deviation decline in banking density. For a county at the 50th

percentile of cash tenancy, the magnitude of the effect is about 3% smaller.

        In sum, the negative relationship between land concentration and banks per capita seems most

pronounced in counties where there was likely to be the greatest demand for credit, and hence the greatest

incentive for landed interests to control it.

B. Crop Lien Legislation

        We have seen that crop lien laws were one of the principal tools that the landed elite allegedly

used to restrict credit from banks and limit their business (Ransom and Sutch (2001), Van Woodward

(1951)). These laws made the landlords’ claims on tenants superior to other creditors, effectively

preventing others from lending to tenant farmers. Although such laws were deeply unpopular among

small farmers, the landed elite used their political influence with legislatures throughout the South to

enact them.

        For a period, Texas was an important exception. In part, because of different electoral rules that

briefly allowed small farmers to elect a Populist governor, Texas was the only Southern state that actually


                                                                                                            21
passed legislation restricting the maximum liens that landlords could claim. 17 The legislation, passed in

1915, also limited the shares that landlords could negotiate in a share cropping contract--1/3 of the cotton

crop and ¼ th of the grain (Graves (1940)). The Texas Supreme Court—appointed mainly by the landlord

dominated legislature--eventually declared the law unconstitutional in 1929. Nevertheless, for a time,

Texas’ crop lien legislation imposed a less onerous barrier to bank entry in rural areas, implying that the

impact of land concentration on banking density in Texan counties would have been weaker compared to

counties in other Southern states during our sample period.

        In Column 4 of Table V, we restrict the baseline specification in 1920 to Southern counties, but

allow the impact of land concentration on banking density to differ for Texan counties. The estimates are

generally imprecise, and in 1920, five years after the law, the impact of land concentration on per capita

banks, if anything, is more negative in Texan counties. However, 15 years after the initial passage of the

Texan legislation, the impact of concentration on per capita banks is significantly more muted in Texan

counties compared to other Southern counties in the 1930 cross-section (Column 5). Indeed, the

coefficient estimate on land concentration in Texas is essentially zero. We should note however that while

the point estimates are consistent with historical narratives, this evidence should be interpreted with

cautioun, as the standard errors remain large.

C. Relative Power of Landed Interests

        Landed interests are likely to have had more influence on the structure of banking if they were a

dominant economic power in the county. But this was a period when the manufacturing sector, an

important consumer of financial services, was growing. It is reasonable to think that in counties where the

economic power of the agricultural sector was offset by the power of the manufacturing sector, the effect

of land concentration on bank structure would be weaker.

        One measure of relative economic power is the ratio of the value of manufacturing output to the

value of manufacturing and agriculture output. In Table V Column 6, we include the interaction between

manufacturing share and land concentration in our baseline regression, taking care to include

manufacturing share and its square directly.


                                                                                                             22
        The estimates suggest that as the strength of manufacturing interests in a county increase, the

adverse impact of land concentration on the per capita number of banks falls. The point estimates in

Column 6 suggest that for a county at the 25th percentile level of manufacturing share in the sample, a one

standard deviation increase in land inequality is associated with about a 1.40 standard deviation decline in

banking density. For a county at the 50th percentile of manufacturing share, the impact is about 14%

smaller. Note that it is hard to argue that this reflects a greater demand for banking services in counties

with more manufacturing share, because we control for the direct effects of manufacturing (through both

linear and squared terms). Indeed, the direct effect is negative, consistent with the fact that agriculture

was undergoing a boom until the early 1920s, and may have been a greater source of demand for banking

services than manufacturing.

D. Distance from State Capital

        During this period state governors appointed state bank commissioners, and politics often shaped

chartering and regulatory decisions (Mitchener (2005)). 18 To the extent that state power was important,

one might expect that at this time –when physical distance mattered greatly --that powerful landowners in

counties that were physically closer to the state capital might have had greater influence on bank structure

than landowners who were further away. When we include the interaction between land concentration and

the distance of the county from the state capital, we find a positive and significant coefficient estimate.

So, concentration mattered more if the county was near the state capital. In contrast, the Comptroller of

Currency in Washington DC chartered and regulated national banks using a system of national bank

examiners. Perhaps as a result, distance from the state capital does not alter the influence of land

concentration on national bank density (see Internet Appendix).

         Of course, one might wonder why the national banks did not occupy the space vacated by state

banks. The landed elite in a county would have been much more viscerally opposed to national banks

(over whose policies they had little control) than over state banks. Although land concentration is

negatively correlated with both types of banks, the impact is especially large on national banks (see see

Internet Appendix). So while the landed elite in a county could not use their influence over state


                                                                                                              23
chartering to deter national banks, they could use their local influence – such as their control over law

enforcement or over local business – to make activity difficult for national banks.

                           III. LAND CONCENTRATION AND ACCESS TO CREDIT

        Having provided some evidence that political economy may have been responsible for differences

in bank structure across counties, let us examine another aspect of the allegations at that time -- that there

were few banks per capita in counties with concentrated land holdings because landed interests wanted to

suppress access to formal sources of credit. A natural question is whether formal credit was actually

scarce in such counties.

A. Access to Credit

        To address this question, we hand-collect several county-level indicators of local land mortgage

loans from the 1930 U.S. Census archives. We have the average interest on farm mortgages held by

banks, a proxy for the cost of credit. We also have data on the fraction of indebted farms, and the debt to

value ratio for farms. Finally, we have the amount of bank mortgage credit, which when scaled by local

state bank deposits, gives us a credit to deposit ratio, a standard measure of local credit activity. 19

        Around 50% of farms were indebted in 1930, the average mortgage debt to value ratio was

around 37%, and the average interest rate in 1930 was 6.48%. The average ratio of mortgage debt to bank

deposits across counties was 56%.

        -------------------------------- Table VI approximately here ------------------------------------------

        Of course, it is possible to argue against each of these variables taken alone as a measure of the

supply of credit – they could be a measure of effective demand, as determined both by the need for credit

as well as the creditworthiness of the borrower. However, assuming the underlying distribution of

creditworthiness is the same across counties, the simultaneous prevalence of lower interest rates and

higher credit volumes is more consistent with higher supply than higher demand. And the simple

correlations in Table VI suggest that counties with lower interest rates also had a greater fraction of

indebted farms and higher loan to value ratios.




                                                                                                                  24
        To focus further on this aspect, we extract the principal component from our four proxies for

access to credit. The first component explains about 41% of the variance in the data, nearly twice as much

as the second component. Moreover, it correlates negatively with interest rates and positively with the

proxies for credit volume (the share of indebted farms, the debt to value ratio, and the mortgage credit to

deposit ratio); see Table VI. Therefore, we use the first component as a summary measure of local credit

supply conditions.

        Thus far, we have argued that rainfall determines land concentration, which in turn determines

banks per capita. We now take this one step further by saying that banks per capita determines access to

credit, that is, the interest rate charged and the volume lent. The system of equations below summarizes

our empirical strategy:

         Measure of accessi = α 0 + α1Banki + X i β1 + ε1i                                              (1)
         Banki = α 2 + α 3 Land Concentrationi + X i β2 + ε 2i                                          (2)
         Land Concentrationi = α 3 + α 4 Rain i + X i β3 + ε 3i .                                       (3)

We estimate the impact of local bank structures on the various measures of access in equation (1). These

local bank structures are determined by local land concentration (equation (2)), which depends on the

mean rainfall in the county (equation (3)). The system is exactly identified, and equation (1) can be

estimated using instrumental variables. We include our usual geographic, demographic, and state fixed

effects controls in each equation. 20

        The IV estimates in Table VII Panel A Column 1 suggest an economically large relationship. A

one-standard deviation increase in bank density in 1920 is associated with a 0.38 percentage point or

about 0.66 standard deviation decrease in the average mortgage interest rate. The coefficient estimates for

the effect of bank density on the fraction of indebted farms in Column 2, the mortgage debt to value ratio

in Column 3, and the mortgage credit to deposit ratio in Column 4 are positive, economically large, and

with the exception of Column 3, statistically significant. Finally, the principal component extracted from

these series is also positively and significantly related to bank density (Column 5). So, counties with more




                                                                                                              25
banks per capita appear to have greater credit availability: lower interest rates, a higher fraction of

indebted farms, greater debt to value ratios, and a higher mortgage credit to deposit ratio.

---------------------------------- Table VII A&B here -----------------------------------

         In the estimates in Table VII Panel A, we instrument banks per capita directly with average

rainfall (because the system is exactly identified, this is equivalent to the three-stage least squares

estimate). Alternatively, we could include the Gini coefficient instrumented with rainfall. The estimates

for the Gini coefficient are reported in Table VII Panel B, take the expected sign and, again with the

exception of column 3, are statistically significant. In sum, access to credit appears lower in areas with

concentrated land holdings.

B. Default Experience

         We have argued that borrowers paid high oligopolistic interest rates and obtained less credit in

concentrated counties precisely because bank competition was more limited. But this also suggests that if

banks were prevented in various ways from expanding access to credit, we should find that the pool of

actual borrowers from banks was less risky in concentrated counties. The obvious alternative explanation

of our findings is that in concentrated counties, potential borrowers were riskier and less creditworthy, so

banks, although competitive, held back from lending. This would suggest that even the loans that banks

actually made in concentrated counties should be riskier (as evidenced by the higher competitive interest

rate paid by borrowers).

         Two pieces of evidence already weigh against this explanation. First, the mortgage credit to

deposit ratio was lower in more concentrated counties, suggesting that local deposits seemed plentiful

relative to the credit that was given – consistent with the notion that credit was constrained by supply

rather than constrained by the low quality of potential borrowers. Second, the historical percentage of

crop failures in more concentrated counties was somewhat lower, suggesting that if anything, farming was

less risky.

         Nevertheless, one way to distinguish the explanation that potential borrowers were deliberately

rationed from the explanation that potential borrowers in concentrated counties were of lower quality is to


                                                                                                             26
look at the default experience. If borrowers were deliberately rationed, with the lower quality tenants

being most frozen out of the market for formal credit in counties with high land concentration, we should

find fewer loan defaults there relative to counties with low concentration. By contrast, if borrowers could

not borrow as cheaply or as much because they were riskier, we should find that the default experience is,

if anything, worse because the underlying quality of the borrower group is lower in counties with high

concentration.

        Unfortunately, we do not have data on county-by-county loan default experience. However, we

do have data on state bank failures from the FDIC, including the value of deposits in suspended state

banks. We can therefore compute the ratio of deposits in suspended state banks in the period 1931 to 1936

(which covers the bulk of bank failures during the Depression – few banks failed after 1934) to the level

of deposits in 1930. The failure rate is a noisy proxy for defaults on mortgage loans, for banks could have

failed for reasons other than loan losses, such as speculation on securities. Moreover, losses on loans

might not translate into bank failures in a continuous way – a bank in one county may have serious losses

but may just avoid failure, while a similar bank in another county may lose just a little more and fail.

Unfortunately, it is the only data that we have, and because it is noisy, we will have to take extra care to

weed out outliers and influential observations.

        Even though our proxy for loan losses is crude, several different estimators suggest that loans in

counties with more concentrated land holdings were, if anything, less risky – the ratio of deposits of failed

state banks to total deposits was lower in such counties (see Internet Appendix). This supports the view

that credit from the formal sector in such counties was restricted to those with better underlying

creditworthiness. The finding that interest rates were higher in such counties, while access to credit was

lower, is thus more consistent with a supply side constraint – access to credit was limited – than a demand

side explanation – potential borrowers were less creditworthy.

                                   IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

        The evidence in this paper suggests that the nature of local constituencies had substantial

influence over the course of banking development in the U.S., even as recently as the early twentieth


                                                                                                           27
century when the United States was well on its way to becoming the foremost industrial economy in the

world.

         Not only do we find fewer banks per capita in counties with a more concentrated distribution of

farm land, we also find that interest rates were higher for land mortgage loans, while measures of the

availability of credit were lower. Finally, we also find that proxies for loan losses were lower in counties

that had more concentrated land holdings, suggesting that the greater riskiness of the underlying pool of

borrowers cannot explain our results.

         While the political economy at the county level can plausibly explain the differential access to

credit, we do not have sufficient evidence to suggest that large landowners actively suppressed access to

credit. It is possible that in the counties with concentrated land holdings, large landowners had no

incentive to press for financial development, while the absence of a powerful group of mid-sized farmers

pushing for financial access, and the political weakness of small and tenant farmers, might have ensured

that banking remained underdeveloped. Benign neglect rather than malign intent could explain many, but

not all, of our findings. The lessons that one takes away for economic development depend, however, not

on intent but on outcomes -- intent does not change the fact that constituencies or interest groups shape

economic growth.

         Note that throughout our analysis, we focus on the U.S., and correct for state fixed effects. It is

interesting then that we find large effects, even though institutions that are commonly thought of as

important for economic growth, such as broad political and legal institutions, are held relatively constant.

This is not to suggest that institutions are unimportant (we have nothing to say on that), but rather that

large variation in developmental outcomes may stem simply from differences in the distribution of

economic wealth and power in a society (see Banerjee and Iyer (2005), Ramcharan (2009a) or Rajan

(2009), for recent studies). Examining the relative importance of constitutions and constituencies or,

equivalently, institutions and interests, is a task for future research.

    This presupposes, of course, that those without land either do not have the basic minimum

surplus to be worth squeezing (such as field hands) or live in towns, far from the clutches of the

activity) does diminish the effect of land concentration on financial development and access.

    Like the United States during the sample period, bank density remains an important measure of

access to financial services in many developing countries today because of their limited transport

networks. In these countries, density significantly predicts credit usage by firms and households

(Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Martinez-Peria (2007)).
8
    In some countries, of course, cooperatives in sugar farming and production have led to joint

ownership of land and mill without large amounts of land being held by a single owner. Why co-

operatives have more limited presence in the United States is a question that is beyond this

paper.

    Interestingly, cotton was not one of the crops that required plantation-style agriculture – even

though substantial labor was needed to harvest the crop quickly soon after the bolls opened to

avoid cotton spoiling from dust or rain, once the crop was harvested, it could be processed in due

course. Thus, labor rather than capital was essential to cotton production, and following the

emancipation of the slaves, small farms became more dominant in cotton.
10
     Note also that warmer areas were less likely to specialize in cereals, and had higher levels of

land concentration. There is also a positive correlation between the standard deviation of rainfall

and land concentration, and we subsequently use some of these correlations to gauge the

robustness of our identification strategy.
11
     For the farm acreage devoted to cane sugar, the correlation coefficients are 0.098 and 0.066 for

land concentration and rainfall, respectively. These correlations are significant at the 5% level,

and are robust to the inclusion of the state dummies.




                                                                                                       31

     This is not to say that drought and crop failures were not a cause for farm distress in the inter-

war period, but rather that data from the farm experience in 1930 does not suggest that areas with

higher rainfall were more prone to distress.
13
     Because of the likely spatial correlation between geographically proximate counties, the

correlation in the error term between county i and county j may be proportional to the distance

between the two counties. We follow Conley (1998) and Rappaport (1999) and assume a spatial

structure to the error covariance matrix. Specifically, for county pairs further than 150 kilometers

apart—measured as the distance between the counties’ geographic center-- we assume

independence. Meanwhile, for county pairs less than 150 km apart, we use quadratic weighting:

                   distanceij  
                                  2

E (ε iε j ) = 1 −               ρij ,
                                                      =ee
                                                where ρ ij i j
              
                      150        
                                    

Since geographic characteristics extend across political boundaries, this weighting applies even

for adjacent counties in different states. Simple clustering within states generally yields standard

errors between 20% to 30 % higher than the distance weighting procedure—and the estimates

remain statistically significant at conventional levels.
14
     Using a semi-parametric estimator, Figure 1 of the Internet appendix also suggests that the

linearity assumption might be appropriate (Yatchew (2003)).

     One concern may be that a county with uniformly large farms will have a low Gini coefficient.

While this is not inconsistent with the hypothesis being tested (there is no need to repress finance

if there are no small farmers/tenants to exploit), it is important to check that this does not drive

our results. Therefore, we recalculate the Gini coefficient using only those counties with farm

sizes in all bin categories—we are left with about 55 % of the sample of counties. The coefficient




                                                                                                       32
estimates for the Gini coefficient are qualitatively similar, however, and are available upon

request.

     In addition to the core distance from waterways measures, the full range of weather and

geophysical controls include the annual average number of frost days—days when the

temperature dips below freezing—and growing degree days in the county, as well as the historic

standard deviation of these variables; we also include both the mean elevation in the county, and

the topographic variability of the terrain. Please see Table 2 for definitions and sources.

     The Populist Movement in the United States is often thought to have begun in Texas with the

founding of the Grand State Farmers’ Alliance in the 1890s. By 1905, the state passed the Terrell

Act which created a direct primary system, allowing voters rather than party elites to select the

gubernatorial nominee in a direct election. This created a wave of populism and reforms, of

which the 1915 law is an example. However, the legislature was still dominated by the landed

elite, and they eventually impeached the Governor three years after the passage of the 1915

legislation (Newton and Gambrell (1935)).
18
     Using previously secret government documents, Vickers (1994) notes for example that land

developers often overcame chartering obstacles by bringing powerful politicians into banking

deals. Land developers then used bank deposits for unsecured personal loans for themselves,

politicians, and bank regulators. These loans were rarely repaid.
19
     Until the relaxation of the 1864 National Bank Act in 1913, national banks were barred from

mortgage loans – that is, loans against land (Sylla (1969)). There is disagreement about the

effectiveness of this restriction (Keehn and Smiley (1977)). Nevertheless, rather than mixing

state banks and national banks in what follows, we focus only on state banks.




                                                                                                    33
20
     In equations (2) and (3), we could use banks per capita in 1930. However, some of the

measures of access we have (for example, mortgage credit to deposits) reflect the cumulative

consequences of lending over time. In that case, it might be more appropriate to use banks per

capita in 1920. Fortunately, the results do not depend qualitatively on which measure is used, so

we use the latter, though results are available for the former from the authors.

This table presents the relationship between land concentration and various measures of bank density using instrumental variables. All standard errors are adjusted for spatial correlation. ***,**,*
denotes significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. All specifications include state dummy variables. All coefficients multiplied by 100,000. Columns 1 and 3 include only geophysical controls: land
area and distances from Atlantic, Pacific, Mississippi and Great Lakes (in logs). Columns 2 and 4-8 include both geophysical and demographic controls: illiterate, urban, African-American and young
(ages 7-20) population shares, as well as log of total population. Average rainfall is the instrument in Columns 3-6. Land concentration in 1890 is the instrument in column 7. Column 8 uses both
average rainfall and its standard deviation as instruments. Land concentration is the Gini coefficient of farm sizes within the county.

  This table presents results on the factors that shape the relationship between land concentration and bank
  structures. All standard errors are adjusted for spatial correlation. ***,**,* denotes significance at the 1%, 5%
  and 10% levels. All specifications include a county’s distance from the Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans; the Great
  Lakes; the Mississippi River (in logs); county area; population; illiterate, urban, African-American and young
  (ages 7-20) population shares; as well as state dummies. Columns 4 and 5 use only counties in Southern and
  Border states. Manufacturing share (Column 6) is the fraction of manufacturing value added relative to value
  added in manufacturing and agriculture. All coefficients multiplied by 100,000. Land concentration is the Gini
  coefficient of farm sizes within the county. Tenants share is the fraction of farms within a county operated by
  tenant farmers. Sharecroppers and Cash tenants are the fraction of farms operated by tenants using a
  sharecropping and cash contract respectively. Definitions and sources can be found in the Appendix.

                            Panel A. Credit Access and Banks Per Capita
Panel A presents results on the relationship between state banks per capita and various measures of credit
access. Panel B presents results on the relationship between land concentration and various measures of credit
access. All standard errors are adjusted for spatial correlation. ***,**,* denotes significance at the 1%, 5% and
10% levels. All specifications include a county’s distance from the Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans; the Great
Lakes; the Mississippi River (in logs); county area; population; illiterate, urban, African-American and young
(ages 7-20) population shares; as well as state dummies. The “Principal Component” is the common first
component extracted from the 4 measures of credit access. All coefficients are multiplied by 100,000. Land
concentration is the Gini coefficient of farm sizes within the county.
