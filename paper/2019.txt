                      Can Union Labor Ever Cost Less?




                                  ABSTRACT




  This paper examines the effect of unions on efficiency by estimating cost

function systems over three different sets of construction projects. The

results show that union contractors have greater economies of scale. This gives

them a cost advantage in large commercial office buildings, but in school and

hospital construction, nonunion contractors have lower costs at all output

levels. Despite the cost differences, profits for nonunion contractors in

school and hospital construction are no higher than those for union contractors

because the burden of higher union costs is shifted to buyers.

                                I. INTRODUCTION

  Although a number of studies have found productivity to be higher in

unionized establishments and industries, the net effect of unions on efficiency

depends on the interaction of the effects of unions on wages and productivityJ

This paper examines how unions affect three widely accepted measures of

efficiency- -cost, profit, and price- -over three different samples of

construction projects.2 The cost results are obtained with translog cost

function systems, an econometric technique which has been applied frequently to

labor demand questions but not, surprisingly, to the question of how unions

affect efficiency.

  The cost function results provide new insights into how union and nonunion

firms can compete in the same market. Despite recent declines in percent

unionized in construction, the largest projects still tend to be built by union

contractors, a phenomenon frequently attributed to threats of violent behavior

or political favoritism. In both data sets where economies of scale are

present, I find that these economies of scale are more prevalent in the union

sample. In a sample of commercial office buildings, higher wages price union

contractors out of the market for smaller projects, but greater scale economies

enable them to produce larger projects more efficiently than nonunion

contractors. However, in a sample of elementary and secondary schools, costs

are much higher under unionism at all output levels despite the difference in

economies of scale.

   Unions do not seem to reduce profits in construction. This happens even

in the cases where costs per square foot are higher because these costs are

passed on to project owners in the form of higher prices. Geographic market

segmentation, which probably results from prevailing wage legislation, keeps
                                       2


 union and nonunion profit rates equal despite the price differences in these

 cases.




                           II. METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS

    The relative efficiency of union and nonunion contractors can be estimated

with either cost or profit functions. If the demand for structures by owners

 is exogenous and contractors are cost minimizing price-takers in factor

markets, the cost function approach holding factor prices and output constant,

 is most appropriate. In this framework unions have two types of effects on

efficiency: cost function parameters can vary by union status and, for a

given set of cost function parameters, higher union wages increase costs at all
levels of output.

   Alternatively, output could be endogenous either in terms of the number of

projects demanded by owners or the magnitude of a given project. In either case

a profit function can be used to simultaneously model profits, input demand,

and output supply. In this context, unions can influence prices in the product

market as well as the production possibilities set and wages. Clark [1984] has

argued that the net effect of unions on efficiency is much more difficult to

predict in this context, even if unions raise labor productivity and wages by

equal amounts. The net effect depends on whether contractors are on or off the

labor demand curve and whether labor or management has more bargaining power.

   What are the methodological advantages of estimating the dual cost or profit

functions rather than the production function? In practice most production

function studies have used functional forms which impose restrictions on

technology, such as homogeneity, homotheticity, and identical (frequently

unitary) elasticities of substitution for all pairs of inputs. These

restrictions need not hold and, if production function
                                                         parameters vary by
                                      3


union status, this could lead to biased estimates of the effect of unions on

technical efficiency. By using flexible functional forms for the cost and

profit functions, these restrictions can be tested and the sensitivity of the

union coefficients to these restrictions can be established.

   Of course, such tests could also be done with flexible functional forms

for production functions (although only Clark [1980] and Allen [1984] report

doing such tests), but this raises a more fundamental question. An OLS

production function is appropriate only when input quantities are uncorrelated

with omitted variables. When managers choose the quantity of capital, labor

and other inputs, this choice must be sensitive to the presence of unions as

well as unobserved variables, many of which are likely to be correlated with

union status. This classic identification problem vanishes when estimating

cost or profit functions in construction. Collective bargaining agreements are

usually signed between a local union representing a certain trade or group of

trades and an employer association. The agreement sets the price of labor to

be hired by any union contractor, but contractors are generally free to hire as

much or as little labor as they want on any project.

   A convenient aspect of cost and profit functions is that they produce a

direct estimate of the net effect of unions on efficiency. If output is not

homogeneous with respect to input, this estimate can be allowed to vary with

output. In contrast, the effect of unions on efficiency can be estimated only

indirectly in the production function approach by comparing union coefficients

from production and wage equations. Such comparisons are difficult to make in

a statistical sense because these equations always contain different control

variables and are usually estimated at different levels of aggregation.

Conceptually, such comparisons are difficult to interpret in light of the
                                           4

complexities about efficient contracts and bargaining power noted by Clark

[1984]

   Despite these attractive features, an important problem remains --

measurement error. The exogenous variables in cost and profit functions are

output (in cost functions only), fixed inputs, and factor prices. In cross

section data, prices of nonlabor inputs are not generally reported, resulting

in an errors in variables problem. Because of the restrictions required to

assure homogeneity of degree one of cost with respect to factor prices and

symmetry in cross partial effects of factor prices on costs, the direction and

magnitude of the bias resulting from this measurement error cannot be

predicted. Such bias is also present in production function estimates,

especially for capital input, labor quality, and in many cases, the union

coefficient but cross- or within-equation restrictions are not involved.

   The cost and profit functions also do not provide any guidelines for

distinguishing between what Freeman and Medoff [1981] call the price theoretic

and the institutional effects of unions. Any union-nonunion difference in

parameter estimates will reflect both of these factors. Unless there are

perfect controls for capital intensity and labor quality, this will also be

true for union coefficients in production functions.



                                   III. SPECIFICATION

  The translog functional form was selected for the cost equation because it

imposes relatively few restrictions on the parameters of interest.3 In the

single output case, the function is written

 lnC        + ay mY + .5i3yy(lnY)2 + E/3Yi mY 1nP + aFlnF +



         + flYF mY lnF +   /3Fi   lnF lnP + Ecr lnP1 + .5E           lnP1 1nP   (1)
                           i                I            ii
                                                             E/31j
                                                     5

where C =    variable   cost, Y =     output,       F        fixed inputs and P price of

variable input i. A three factor specification is used in the results reported

below--labor (L), materials (M), and capital (K). Two sets of restrictions

from production theory are imposed in all cases: (1) symmetry, which requires

that ,8jj   = i9jj   and (2) homogeneity of degree one with respect to prices, which

requires that


        = 1; EPYi = 0;     E/3Fi =   0; Sjj =                  = EEi9ij =   0
   i           i           i              i              j        ii
   Shephard's      lemma states that 8C/3P =                 X.    In logarithmic terms, this

becomes

                                      =
            8lnC/ 8lnP =       PX/C       Si,
where S is the share of factor i in total cost. If the cost function is (1),

the share equation for each factor is

   Si =       +         mY +    I3Fi lnF +      j3jj lnP1.                                      (2)
                                                J


To take advantage of the additional information about the parameters appearing

in the share equations, (1) and (2) are jointly estimated below using iterated

seemingly unrelated regressions. One share equation must be omitted to prevent

the variance-covariance matrix of the error terms in (1) and (2) from being

singular. Iterated seemingly unrelated regression produces maximum likelihood

estimates which are invariant to the choice of which share equation is dropped.

   Unions influence construction costs by raising the price of labor and,

potentially, changing the cost function parameters. If union work rules or

craft jurisdictions make union labor less productive, the entire cost function

shifts upward for any given level of                         The building trades unions also have

beneficial effects on productivity, mainly through their effects on training

(via apprenticeships), search and screening costs (via hiring halls), and
                                               6

 management (via shock effects).4           All of these factors would shift the cost

 function downward for any given level of P.

    Christensen and Greene define economies of scale (EOS) as

         EOS = 1   -
                       alnC/ amy.
 In (1) this gives us

         EOS = 1                ,8yy mY -
                   -        -
                       ay                   I3YF lnF -   ZI9Yi lflP.
                                                         1

Union-nonunion differences in EOS can be calculated by estimating ay, /3yy, /3YF

and /3j separately for union and nonunion projects.

   Why might one expect such differences? The most important factor is that

unionism can lower the cost of large projects through organizing what would

otherwise be a casual labor market. Union hiring halls provide large supplies

of skilled labor on relatively short notice, something a single contractor may

be unable to find on his own. The union also screens prospective workers,

reducing qualitative uncertainty in a market where short term employer-employee

relationships predominate. This lowers costs by reducing the amount of

managerial and clerical labor needed to recruit and screen workers, it also

reduces the cost of turnover and absenteeism, since replacements can be

quickly found. If union contractors' recruiting and screening costs increase

less rapidly with project size than those of nonunion contractors, this can

result in a union cost advantage in larger projects.

   In addition union hiring halls reduce uncertainty about the quantity of

available labor, which can also result in economies of scale. Without such

uncertainty management can plan large projects on a more ambitious, tighter

schedule. This reduces the cost of maintaining materials inventories and

renting capital equipment. If the project is expected to be completed more

rapidly, the anticipated cost of borrowing to meet expenses over the course

of the project is also reduced. Since such uncertainty will be present only in
                                         7

large projects, this will result in a further union cost advantage for such

projects.

   Interview evidence indicates that these economies give union contractors a

significant edge over their nonunion competitors. In a survey of nonunion

residential contractors in Erie County, N. Y. ,   Foster   [1973] found, "In most

cases, the inability to recruit sufficient help required some change in the

firm's normal operations, such as working overtime and weekends, refusing jobs

or running them longer than originally planned, or having the employer do the

work himself" [p. 1074]. Bourdon and Levitt [1980] reached even stronger

conclusions in their interviews with union and nonunion contractors in eight

large SMSAs. They concluded that the major disadvantage to the open-shop

sector was "the lack of access to an external labor pool of workers with

predictable wages and skills which would enable more firms to bid on

larger-scale work" [p. 54].

   Another factor which may give union contractors an advantage over nonunion

competition in large projects is experience. Until recently the open shop was

concentrated in residential and small commercial projects. Managers whose

experience was previously confined to projects which could be completed in

three months are unlikely to be able to move into projects lasting one or two

years and be equally efficient. Such a union cost advantage would only be

temporary, but it may very well have been present in the period from which the

data come, the early and middle l970s.

   Union work rules are a final factor contributing to union-nonunion

differences in economies of scale in construction. Bourdon and Levitt [1980,

pp.64-65] have argued that the constraints imposed by union work rules on

efficient factor allocation are less likely to be binding on large projects.

For instance, ironworkers' contracts usually specify minimum crew sizes. If
                                          8

the contract is enforced on a small job, the result will be overstaffing. On

a large project, the provision will be irrelevant. Any union cost disadvantage

associated with restrictive work rules should diminish with increasing project

size. Of course, this factor alone would not make union costs lower than

nonunion costs at any output level.

   To test for union-nonunion differences in the cost function parameters the

translog system is estimated both over the pooled sample and over the union and

nonunion samples separately. The hypothesis that the union and nonunion

coefficients are equal is tested by examining the likelihood ratio

A =
      (/5Yn1/'2,    where      determinant of the disturbance covariance matrix

for the pooled specification, g = determinant of the covariance matrix

obtained from the specification with separate union and nonunion coefficients,

and n =   the number of buildings in the sample. Test statistics are derived
from -2lnA, which is distributed as chi-squared with degrees of freedom equal

to the number of restrictions being tested. Results for a specification where

only a0 varies by union status are also reported below.

   Three other sets of restrictions were examined. The production function

corresponding to the cost system is almost homothetic (isoquants for variable

inputs have the same slope along a ray from the origin) if /9Yi =   0.   An almost

homothetic production function is homogeneous (constant elasticity of cost with

respect to output) if f3yy =   0.   The homogeneity hypothesis is nested within the

homotheticity hypothesis, but both are unrelated to the unitary elasticity of

substitution hypothesis.

  The translog variable profit function is written

              mit   = a0 + Ea lnP + .5 E/3jj lnP1                              (3)
                                                  lnP
                           i            ij
             + aF lnF + â€¢5FF (lnF)2 + E/3Fi   lnF lnP,
                                         9


where ir =   profits   and P prices of variable inputs and output (i   L, M, K,

Y).6 Once again symmetry and homogeneity restrictions are imposed.7

   Hotelling's lemma states that the partial derivatives of the profit function

with respect to input prices are input demand functions. Formally,

a/8P1 = -Xi.      In logarithmic terms, this becomes


     81nr/0lnP =                ai   +   lnF   +
                                                   >/9jj   lnPj.
                                                                              (4)
                                                   J




Also, the partial derivative of (4) with respect to the price of output is the

output supply function. Either the supply equation or one of the three input

share equations must be deleted from the system because the dependent variables

sum to 1. Maximum likelihood estimates which are invariant to whether the

output supply or one of the input demand equations is dropped are obtained by

estimating (3) and (4) jointly using iterated seemingly unrelated

regressions. The impact of unions on efficiency can be determined by comparing

all the parameters in (3) and (4) at different ranges of P1 or by allowing a0

to vary by union status.

   A key assumption behind the profit function approach is that output prices

are determined competitively. As I will explain more fully below, the results

for cost, profit, and price for the school and hospital samples do not seem to

be consistent with this assumption, making the results uninterpretable in terms

of technical efficiency. Application of the profit function approach to the

question of how unions affect technical efficiency must await the arrival of a

more appropriate data set.

                                   IV.    DATA

   Three samples of buildings are examined: 83 commercial office buildings

(64 union, 19 nonunion), 68 elementary and secondary school buildings (57

union. 11 nonunion), and 44 hospitals and nursing homes (36 union, 8 nonunion).

The characteristics of these data sets are discussed in Allen [1986a, b].

   Different information on capital expenditures was provided in the surveys.

In the school survey, each contractor for each project was asked to provide the

rental cost, the allowance by the contractor for owned equipment, or the

equivalent of rental cost for each type of equipment. In addition, the

number of hours operated is also reported for each. The sum of all capital

equipment expenditures for all contractors on a particular project is used here

as the capital cost measure for schools. The price of capital is obtained by

dividing this figure by capital hours. In the office building and hospital

surveys each contractor provided equipment expenditure information

(depreciation or rental cost), as well as the interest expenses. The sum of

these expenses for all contractors for a particular office building is the

capital cost measure for this sample. Offsite capital (e.g. ,   structures,
office furniture and equipment) is not reported for either sample.

   Since capital hours are not reported for the office building sample, a

capital price variable had to be constructed from other data sources. The

variable used below is the rate of return estimated from the 1972 Census of

Construction Industries for the Census division in which each project was

located. Values of this variable for smaller geographic units could not be

constructed because individual states or SNSAs are not identified in the data

to protect the confidentiality of contractors and subcontractors. This

introduces some measurement error bias into the analysis, the magnitude of

which will be assessed below.
                                     11

   Earnings and hours are reported for all onsite work. Almost all of this

represents production labor. The only nonproduction categories reported are

clerical workers (e.g., timekeepers), professional and technical workers (e.g.,

draftsmen, engineers), and foremen. Issues concerning the separability of

labor into smaller aggregates are ignored here.

   Fringe benefit costs are not reported. Since these costs are much larger

in the union sector, labor costs are underreported by a much greater extent for

union than nonunion contractors.8 To correct for this, I add estimated fringe

benefits to labor costs for union contractors only. This increases the

likelihood that the results will show higher costs in the union sector. Fringe

benefits are paid on an hourly basis in union construction. I assume that

fringe benefits equal 14.6 percent of earnings, a figure derived from 1972

national averages of wages and benefit costs in union contracts for all

occupations in 68 cities.9 The price of labor equals earnings plus estimated

fringes divided by hours.

   The price of materials variable is derived from the 1973 Dodge Manual for

Building Construction Pricing and Scheduling. The Dodge Manual reports a

materials price index for 80 cities. These were aggregated into nine indices

for each of the Census divisions, using 1972 construction employment in each

city as weights. Since this index varies much more across rather than within

regions, this aggregation is unlikely to seriously contaminate the results.

   Square footage is used as the output measure in both samples. Differences

in building characteristics such as type of frame or height are ignored. In

previous work examining production functions over these samples in Allen

{l986a, b], these variables had relatively little effect on estimates of the

union-nonunion productivity difference. Other output measures are available
                                      12

for the school sample (student capacity and classrooms) and for the hospital

sample (beds), but these are highly correlated with square footage.1-Â°

   Fixed inputs are not reported in any of the three surveys. Assuming that

offsite labor and capital vary directly with the size of the general

contractor, this variable seems to be-a reasonable proxy. In the office

building sample the 1974 dollar volume of business in private office building

construction for the general contractor is reported along with the share of

private office building construction in his 1974 total dollar volume. The

ratio of these two variables equals 1972 total dollar volume and is used in the

cost function model as a proxy for fixed inputs for that sample.1-1- The school

sample reports classrooms built by the general contractor in 1972 and the share

of 1972 dollar volume in school construction in 1972 total dollar volume. The

number of classrooms [s used in the cost function model as a proxy for fixed

offsite inputs in the school sample. No similar proxies for fixed inputs are

available for the hospital and nursing homes sample. The effects of omitting

this variable will be assessed on the other two data sets.



                           V. COST FUNCTION RESULTS

   The mean cost per square foot by union status and building size for office

building, school, and hospital construction is reported in Table 1.    The size

categories are defined so that each sample of buildings is divided into three

groups which have almost the same number of observations. Nonunion

observations are concentrated in the smallest group in each sample.

  Across buildings of all size categories, cost per square foot is 4 percent

lower in office building construction when union labor is used. Union-nonunion

differences in cost per square foot vary with building size. Cost per square

foot [s 4 percent higher [n the union sector for buildings in the smallest size
                                     13

category. In both sectors cost per square foot is lower in the middle size

category, but the decrease in average costs is much greater for the nonunion

sector. As a result, union labor is considerably more costly (44 percent) in

buildings in the middle size category. When building size increases above

75,000 square feet, average cost rises for both union and nonunion labor. The

cost increase is much greater for nonunion labor, resulting in a cost advantage

for the union sector. Average costs are 23 percent lower for the union

buildings in this size category.

   Costs in the nonunion sector are cheaper than costs in the union sector in

each of the size categories of school and hospital construction. Overall,

costs are 48 percent higher for schools and 36 percent higher for hospitals

built with union crews. In the school sample, the difference is widest (52

percent) in the small and middle size categories and is smallest (37 percent)

for schools in the largest size category. A similar pattern is present in the

hospital sample, as the difference narrows from 63 percent in the smallest size

category to 27 and 19 percent in the middle and largest size categories. Even

though union costs are always greater, the narrowing of union-nonunion cost

differences with increasing building size is consistent with the pattern

observed for office buildings.

   Two cost function specifications were examined, one where the intercept of

the cost function varies by union status and the other where all coefficients

vary by union status. In the hospital sample, homotheticity and homogeneity

with respect to output could not be rejected, so these restrictions were

imposed. No restrictions are imposed on the other two samples. The union

coefficients (S.E.) are reported below:

             Commercial Office Buildings           .200
                                                  (.105)
             Elementary and Secondary Schools      .161
                                                  (.079)
                                         14

              Hospitals and Nursing Homes              .113
                                                      (.146)


These coefficients show costs are lower for union contractors in office

building construction, but in school and hospital construction union

contractors have higher costs, holding input prices and output constant. The

hypothesis that the union intercept is identical to the nonunion intercept is

rejected at the 95 percent confidence level for the school sample and the 94

percent confidence level for the office building sample.

   To implement the second approach, the hypothesis that the union and nonunion

coefficients in (1) and (2) are equal must be tested. Because there are only

8 nonunion observations in the hospital sample, this approach is not applied to

that data set as there are only 10 degrees of freedom in the least restrictive

specification. The results for nonunion schools in the least restrictive

specifications should also be viewed with caution, as there are as few as 18

degrees of freedom for that sample.

   Table 2 reports the results of likelihood ratio tests of the hypothesis of

equal union and nonunion coefficients for both samples under a variety of

restrictions, along with tests of the homotheticity, homogeneity, and unitary

elasticity of substitution restrictions within the union and nonunion

samples. Complete results for the least restrictive specification are reported

in the appendix. In the school sample, the hypothesis of equal union and

nonunion coefficients can be rejected at the 95 or 99 percent confidence level

in all specifications. Union-nonunion differences in the parameter estimates

are less pronounced in the office building sample, except when the restriction

/3j = 0 is imposed. The main reason for this is the relatively minor union-

nonunion difference in the /3jj   estimates.   The hypothesis that /3j = 0 in the

union equation cannot be rejected. Once this restriction is imposed, the union
                                      15

and nonunion coefficients become much more distinct from each other. However,

when the homogeneity restriction is reimposed, the distinction comes close to

vanishing again. Thus, the key difference between the union and nonunion

coefficients in the office building sample is the relationship of cost to
          12
output.

   Assumptions have to be made about factor prices, output levels, and fixed

inputs before making any comparisons of economies of scale or costs. As

there was no correlation between factor prices and building size in any of the

samples, the mean factor prices for union projects are inserted in the union

equations and the mean factor prices for nonunion projects in the nonunion

equations. Different sets of means are used for office buildings and schools.

This assumption places the union projects at an immediate cost disadvantage

because of higher union wages.

   Focusing on a single output level in each sample is potentially misleading,

given the wide range of building sizes in all of the samples. Because

homogeneity of degree one of the cost function with respect to output is easily

rejected for all samples except nonunion schools, it is quite possible that

union labor may be cost effective in some output ranges but not in others.

Rather than focusing on a single summary statistic, cost functions and

economies of scale functions are reported in Table 3 and Figures 1 and 2. The

ranges of output levels where the cost of union (nonunion) projects is less

than that of nonunion (union) projects, and where economies of scale prevail

are also reported. The mean value of fixed inputs for union buildings in each

sample is used in both the union and nonunion equations for that sample.

Because of the possibility of errors in measuring fixed inputs, two sets of

estimates are reported: one where the fixed input variable is included in the

model and another where all fixed input coefficients are restricted to zero.
                                      16

A. Economies of Scale.    The most noticeable difference in the parameter

estimates between the union and nonunion buildings is the rate at which costs

change at different output levels. In nonunion construction diseconomies of

scale first appear at lower output levels and increase more rapidly with output

than in the union sector. Diseconomies of scale first appear in nonunion

office buildings at 26 to 28 thousand square feet of space. They disappear in

nonunion schools at 41,606 square feet in the model including fixed inputs and

at 80,178 square feet in the model without fixed inputs. Economies of scale

are present in union office building construction over a much larger range of

output levels than in nonunion office building construction- -through 67 to 69

thousand square feet. More importantly, the rate at which costs rise with

output is much lower in the union sector. The second derivatives (in logs) of

cost with respect to output are about four times larger for nonunion office

buildings than union office buildings. The pattern of economies of scale over

various output levels in union school construction is the reverse of that in

the other three samples. Diseconomies of scale are present until school size

reaches 78 to 86 thousand square feet in the union sector. Economies of scale

are present at all higher output levels.

   The evidence that costs increase much more rapidly with building size in

the nonunion sector is consistent with the theory and anecdotal evidence cited

in Section III regarding the disadvantages nonunion contractors face in large

projects. The exact source of these economies cannot be isolated, but evidence

on the ratio of overtime to total hours suggests union hiring halls are a

contributing factor. Working overtime is the usual managerial response in the

short run to situations where labor supply is inadequate. If hiring halls

contribute to economies of scale, there would be less overtime in union

projects, with the difference widening with project size. To examine this
                                      17

possibility each sample is split into groups of buildings above and below

50,000 square feet in size. Union buildings in the office building sample

which are larger than the largest nonunion building (225,000 sq. ft.) are

reported separately. The percentages (S.D.) of overtime hours are:


                                   Commercial            Elementary and
                               office buildings         secondary schools
                             Union      Nonunion      Union        Nonunion

Less than 50,000 sq. ft.      .40          .36         .37            .54
                             (.92)       (.83)        (.68)          (.59)
More than 50,000 sq. ft.      .56        2.61         1.09           1.90
                             (.68)      (1.96)       (1.72)        (2.64)
More than 225,000 sq. ft.    1.84                       -

                            (1.43)


In both samples there is little difference in overtime ratios between union and

nonunion contractors for smaller buildings. Overtime ratios increase sub-

stantially among the larger buildings, especially for nonunion contractors.

They used 75 percent more overtime in larger schools and 366 percent more over-

time in larger office buildings. There is also much greater variance in over-

time among the nonunion subcontractors in the larger buildings. Although

these overtime differences in larger buildings can account for no more than a 1

percent cost difference in these samples, these results are consistent with

the effectiveness of hiring halls.



B. Cost Comparisons. In office building construction, costs are lower when

union labor is used in buildings with more than 72 to 74 thousand square feet

of space. The gap in costs widens considerably with increasing building size

because of the greater economies of scale under unionism. The cost function

coefficients also imply that union contractors have a comparative advantage in
                                       18

producing projects with less than 6,000 square feet, but the magnitude of

these estimated differences is quite small.

    Are these results attributable to unionism or to the greater average size

of buildings in the union sample? The largest nonunion office building in the

sample has 225,000 square feet of space. There are 16 union buildings in the

sample with more square footage. If the cost function for the smaller union

buildings is quite different from that for the largest ones, it is possible

that these union-nonunion cost comparisons are misleading. To test this the

cost system was re-estimated over all union buildings with 200,000 square feet

or less of space. The key results were basically unchanged. Construction

costs are lower under unionism in this restricted sample in all buildings with

more than 77,964 square feet of space.

    Although these cost differences are economically significant, the small

size of the sample raises the question of their statistical significance. Let

C represent costs for union (i=u) and nonunion (i=n) projects. The standard

error of 1nC - lnCn can be estimated under the assumption that cov(lnCu,lnCn)

=   0 and used to construct a 95 percent confidence interval of the range of

output where lnC = lnCn.    In the specification where fixed inputs were

included, the hypothesis of no cost difference could be rejected for all office

buildings with more than 167,042 square feet. In the specification where fixed

inputs are excluded, it could be rejected for all office buildings with more

than 153,430 square feet. While this range is considerably smaller than that

reported in Table 2, the key result of greater union efficiency in larger

buildings still holds. It should also be noted that the range where lnCu >

lnC   at the 95 percent confidence level is more limited as well: below 31,382

square feet when fixed inputs are included and below 35,490 when fixed inputs

are excluded.
                                       19

   School construction costs are much higher in the union sector. In the

specification where fixed inputs are included, union contractors are less

efficient except for schools with more than 197,008 square feet. When the fixed

input coefficients are restricted to zero, union costs are greater than

nonunion costs in buildings with up to 293,021 square feet, which is larger

than the largest building in the nonunion sample. Further, once standard

errors of lnC -   lnC   are estimated, the hypothesis that lnC <   lnC   can be

rejected throughout the range of the nonunion sample whether fixed inputs are

included in the model or not.

   All but one of the 11 nonunion schools in the sample were built in the

South, which could make the above comparisons misleading. The above results

could actually reflect North-South differences in construction costs rather

than union-nonunion differences. To test this possibility, the translog cost

system was re-estimated for the union and nonunion samples over Southern

schools only. The results showed union costs to be above nonunion costs in

Southern schools at all output levels)-3

   To assess the bias resulting from measurement error in the capital price

variable in the office building sample, the ratio of equipment costs to

equipment hours was replaced in the cost function model for the school sample

by the rate of return variable used as the capital price proxy for office

buildings. This had no effect on the main cost function results--school

construction costs remained higher at all levels of output for union

contractors. Thus it does not seem likely that the results for office

buildings have been seriously biased by measurement error in the capital price

variable.

                                    VI. PROFITS AND PRICES

      The greater costs of union contractors in the school and hospital samples

must be absorbed by the contractors in the form of lower profits, passed on to

the buyer in the form of higher prices, or both. This section analyzes

evidence on profits and prices to determine who pays for the higher cost of

union labor in these two samples.

   Profit in each sample is defined as the difference between the value of

thr      -r1   rt-ni-rt-'1- frr i-H r-,t-i r h114 1 d--no- ,-r,d f+,c 11m   rf   tkc rc,i-c   1




materials,     and capital. The ratio of profit to the value of the contract is a

useful summary measure for making comparisons across union and nonunion

buildings within a sample and across different types of construction. Although

the rate of return on equity is a more desirable measure, this must be

calculated over a given period of time encompassing a number of projects; it

cannot be calculated from data pertaining to a single project. These ratios

are reported below by union status for each of three samples:

                                                 Union mean                        Nonunion mean
   Commercial office buildings                        21.6                             21.8
   Elementary and secondary schools                   20.2                             20.3
   Hospitals and nursing homes                        24.8                             23.4



   In all three samples, the mean ratio of profits to the value of the contract

is almost identical for union and nonunion contractors. This is a very

striking piece of evidence, especially in light of the fact that estimated

fringe benefits are not included in the labor costs of nonunion contractors.

This assumption biases the profits of nonunion contractors upward. When

estimated fringe benefits are omitted from the labor costs of union

contractors, the union profit rate increases by four percentage points. Under

this assumption a t-test of the means finds them significantly different from

each other at the 11 percent confidence level for office buildings and
                                      21

hospitals and at the 4 percent confidence level for schools. This suggests

the ratio of profits to contract amount for union contractors is slightly

higher than that for nonunion contractors.

   How can profits for union contractors in school and hospital construction

be greater than or equal to those of nonunion contractors in light of the

higher costs per square foot? The answer is fairly obvious- -the price per

square foot is higher in the projects built by union contractors in those two

samples. The following union coefficients were obtained from hedonic price

equations estimated over each of the three samples:'4

         Sample                            Union coefficient (SE.)
Commercial office buildings                         .004
                                                   (.099)
Elementary and secondary schools                    .178
                                                   (.081)
Hospitals and nursing homes                         .078
                                                   (.112)



Holding square footage and other building characteristics constant, the

contract amount is 19 percent higher in schools and 8 percent higher in

hospitals built by union contractors. Although the coefficient for hospitals

is not estimated very precisely, it certainly reconciles the difference between

the effects of unions on costs and on mean profit rates for that sample.

   This naturally leads to another question--how can union contractors receive

a higher price for the same school or hospital project than nonunion

contractors? The answer seems to be geographic market segmentation created by

prevailing wage laws. The union contractors in the school and hospital samples

seem to face no nonunion competition; the nonunion contractors, no union

competition. All of the nonunion schools and hospitals are built in the South

Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, and West North Central

divisions where percent union tends to be very low. Even though union projects
                                      22

were present in all nine divisions in both samples, of the six states in which

nonunion schools are located, only one state contained any union schools. None

of the nonunion hospitals were located in states which had any union hospitals

in the sample.

   No such market segmentation is present in the office building sample.

Nonunion office buildings are located in six of the nine Census divisions, the

exceptions being the West North Central, East South Central, and the Pacific

divisions. Union projects were observed in all nine divisions. Out of the

11 states in which nonunion office buildings were observed, seven also

contained union office buildings.

   A plausible explanation for the presence of market segmentation in the

school and hospital samples and its absence in the office building sample

is prevailing wage legislation. Minimum wages for most of the school sample

and all of the hospital sample are determined by the Davis-Bacon Act or state

prevailing wage laws. As a general rule these minimum wages are well above the

federal minimum wage and in many cases equal (but never exceed) the union

wage.1-5 This constraint binds nonunion contractors only and thereby reduces

their ability to compete for projects in the public sector. Since these laws

have no direct effect on private sector work, there is no reason to expect such

segmentation in the office building sample.



                               VII. CONCLUSION

   The results of this paper support a "competitive union" model of trade

union behavior in the office building sample and a "monopoly union" model in

the school and hospital samples. Since the same unions appear in all three

samples, the remaining issue is to account for this pattern of union behavior.

This boils down to two questions: why do union contractors in school and
                                        23

hospital construction have greater costs and how is entry by nonunion

contractors prevented in these cases?

   A plausible explanation for the greater costs of union contractors in school

and public hospital construction is that government officials have little

incentive to produce buildings at lower than budgeted cost. The frequent use

of one shot sealed bid auctions to let contracts exacerbates matters by

facilitating collusive arrangements.16 Private hospital owners may also lack

such incentives since they receive most of their revenue from governments and

insurance companies rather than the individuals who use their services. In

contrast commercial office building owners can threaten to delay, cancel, or

relocate a project. They can also negotiate with individual bidders for cost

reductions since they are not forced to award contracts to the lowest bidder in

a one shot sealed bid auction. The net result is that contractors and unions

stand to collect rents in school and hospital construction, but not in

commercial office building construction.

   Nonunion contractors should appropriate any rents for themselves by

producing at minimum cost. Unions may instead choose to distribute rents in

the form of increased on-the-job leisure or job opportunities. Although this

is not the most efficient method of rent sharing, other approaches (higher

wages, side payments) would signal the presence of rents to outsiders and thus

may not be a stable solution. Political factors within the union may also

dictate such a solution, since the least skilled union members may already be

priced out of private sector work. This explanation can account for the

greater cost of union contractors in school and hospital construction. Profits

are equalized by competition within the union and nonunion sectors and by the

threat of entry into either sector.
                                         24

   Why   don't   nonunion contractors go after this business? Even at union wage

rates they might be able to produce these projects at lower cost if union

contractors are hiring excess amounts of labor. One possible answer is that

unions take this threat into account when deciding how much excess labor should

be hired. If (1) the prevailing wage laws constrain nonunion contractors from

producing at minimum cost and (2) they are less efficient when forced to pay

union wages than union contractors would have been if they produced at minimum

cost, unions have a wedge which can be used to pad the payrolls while

simultaneously preventing the entry of nonunion competition. As long as

markets remain segmented, union contractors can maintain profit rates by

passing the higher costs to project owners in the form of higher prices.

Another possibility is that nonunion contractors are reluctant for personnel

reasons to bid on projects where they would have to overpay their workers.

Worker morale could deteriorate if employees receive different wage rates for

identical types of work, resulting in a decline in overall profitability.

   This paper has two major implications. First, in the case of large commer-

cial office buildings, union contractors can compete effectively with nonunion

contractors because of greater economies of scale. Second, reduced efficiency

results when the building trades unions operate in an environment where

managers lack incentives to minimize costs. Although further work is clearly

necessary, these findings point to a more general model where the behavior of

unions fits the framework of the "competitive union" model when product markets

are competitive while the "monopoly union" model best describes union behavior

in other settings.

                                     NOTES

1. Studies examining the effect of unions on productivity are summarized
   in Freeman and Medoff (1984) which reports complete references.

2. The only previous study to examine the effect of unions on cost is Salkever
   (1982), who found operating expenses per inpatient day were 6 percent
   higher in unionized hospitals. The effect of unions on profits has been
   examined in Freeman (1983), Ruback and Zimmerman (1984), Clark (1984), and
   Salinger (1984). All of these studies find unionism to be associated with
   lower profits.

3. The discussion below follows closely that in Christensen and Greene (1976).

4. These arguments and supporting references are found in Allen (1984 and
   1986b)

5. The possibility of strikes means that unions can also increase uncertainty
   about the quantity of available labor. Strikes arise in the building
   trades not only as a result of failure to agree to a new contract, but also
   as a consequence of jurisdictional disputes among different unions. This
   type of uncertainty is present in all projects, regardless of size, so it
   should shift only the intercept of the cost function and have no effect on
   the relationship between cost and output.

6. The properties of the profit function are more fully discussed in Diewert
   (1974) and Lau (1978). For empirical applications see Yotopoulos and
   Lau (1973), Trosper (1978), Sidhu and Baanante (1981), and Antle (1984).

7. If the actual magnitude of fixed inputs equals the desired magnitude,
   the regularity conditions for a variable profit function require profits to
   be homogeneous of degree one with respect to fixed inputs, implying aF = 1
  and FF = 0.

8. Evidence showing that the effect of unions on fringe benefit expenditures is
   larger (in percentage terms) than the effect of unions on wages is reported
   in Freeman (1981).

9. This figure was obtained from U. S. Department of Labor (1974).

1O.Simple correlation coefficients for each pair of these output measures
   in the school sample are:

        Square footage-student capacity        .874
        Square footage-total classrooms        .887
        Student capacity-total classrooms      .937

  In the hospital sample the correlation coefficient between beds and square
  footage is .691. All correlation coefficients are significant at the .0001
  level.

ll.The general contractor did not report 1974 dollar volume of office building
   construction in five cases. Imputed values in these cases were obtained
   from regressions estimated over the other 78 projects in the sample.
   Details are available upon request.

12.To test whether ay and /3yy differed significantly from each other by
   union status, union interaction terms for these two parameters were
   estimated along with a union intercept term. No restrictions were imposed
   on homogeneity, homotheticity, or demand elasticities. The coefficients
   (S.E.) of the parameters which were allowed to vary by union status are as
   follows:

             18.446         ay          -2.090                    .405
  a0                                                /3yy
                 (5.857)                (1.180)                  (.120)
  Union      -11.873        ay *Union 2.429         y-y *Union    .250
                 (6.179)                (1.217)                  (.119)

  Each of the union interaction coefficients is significantly different from
  zero at a 6 percent or lower confidence level.

13.The cost functions at the respective sample means obtained over observations
   in the South in a specification with the fixed input coefficients restricted
   to zero but without any restrictions on homogeneity, homotheticity, or
   demand elasticities are as follows:

        Sample                                 Cost Function
        Union              lnC =   .251(lnY)2 -4.677  lnY + 34.755
        Nonunion           lnC =   .096(lnY)2 -1.202  lnY + 15.110

  Union costs were greater than nonunion costs at all output levels.

l4.The hedonic price equation specifications are reported in more detail in
   Allen (1985).

l5.Allen (1983) discusses how the Labor Department sets prevailing wages under
   the Davis-Bacon Act and estimates how they affect federal construction
   costs. The paper shows that there is no longer an automatic tendency in the
   Labor Department to set prevailing wages at union scale, except in
   nonresidential building construction. Since both schools and hospitals fall
   into this category, however, it seems reasonable to conclude that Davis-
   Bacon has contributed to the geographic market segmentation observed in
   these two samples without contradicting the main result of this other
   paper.

16.Stigler (1983, Ch. 5) has argued that this approach increases the chances
   that a price-fixing arrangement will be successful because parties cannot
   secretly underbid their co-conspirators. The recent spate of bid-rigging
   convictions in highway construction suggests this model has some explanatory
   power.

Note: All estimates were obtained by jointly estimating a cost equation, a
       materials share equation, and a capital share equation by iterated
       seemingly unrelated regressions, using the SAS SYSNLIN procedure.
       Standard errors are reported in parentheses.
