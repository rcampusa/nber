                                           ABSTRACT

Although the 1996 welfare reform legislation limited the eligibility of immigrant households to

receive assistance, many states chose to protect their immigrant populations by offering state-funded

aid to these groups. I exploit these changes in eligibility rules to examine the link between the

welfare cutbacks and health insurance coverage in the immigrant population. The data reveal that

the cutbacks in the Medicaid program did not reduce health insurance coverage rates among targeted

immigrants. The immigrants responded by increasing their labor supply, thereby raising the

probability of being covered by employer-sponsored health insurance.

I. Introduction

        The number of immigrants entering the United States grew rapidly in recent decades.

During the 1950s, only 250,000 legal immigrants entered the country annually. By the 1990s,

nearly 1 million persons entered the country legally each year and another 300,000 entered—and

stayed in—the country illegally.1 An increasing number of the new immigrants fall in the lower

range of the skill and income distributions. In 1960, the typical immigrant earned 4 percent more

than the average native worker. By 1998, the typical immigrant earned 23 percent less (Borjas,

1999, p. 21).

        The trends in the size and skill composition of the immigrant population sparked a

contentious debate over the economic and demographic impact of immigration.2 For instance,

there has been a great deal of concern over the possibility that immigrants do not “pay their way”

in the welfare state (Smith and Edmonston, 1998, Chapters 6 and 7). And, in fact, the evidence

suggests that immigrant households are now much more likely to receive public assistance than

in the past.3

       Concurrent with the resurgence of large-scale immigration, there has been an increase in

the number of persons who lack health insurance coverage.4 Recent research suggests there may

be an important link between these two trends. Despite the relatively high participation rate of

immigrants in the Medicaid program, Camarota and Edwards (2000) report that immigrants are

also disproportionately more likely to be in the population of uninsured persons: although

persons in immigrant households make up only 13 percent of the population, they make up 26

percent of the uninsured. Camarota and Edwards conclude that “immigrants who arrived

between 1994 and 1998 accounted for 59 percent of the growth in the size of the uninsured

population” during that period (p. 5).

       The 1994-1998 period coincided with the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and

Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). The 1996 welfare reform legislation

specified a new set of rules for determining the eligibility of foreign-born persons to receive

practically all types of federal aid. In rough terms, PRWORA denies most means-tested

assistance to non-citizens who arrived after the legislation was signed in 1996, and limited the

eligibility of many non-citizens already living in the United States. The available evidence

indicates that the rate of welfare participation in immigrant households declined sharply—

relative to the decline in native households—in the aftermath of PRWORA (Borjas, 2001, Fix

and Passel, 1999).

       This paper uses data drawn from the 1995-2001 Current Population Surveys to examine

the impact of PRWORA on health insurance coverage among immigrants. Because PRWORA

reduced immigrant participation in welfare programs (including Medicaid), it seems reasonable

to suspect that the welfare cutbacks should have increased the size of the foreign-born uninsured




       4   See Fronstin (1998) and Lewis, Ellwood, and Czajka (1998).
                                                         4

population. Remarkably, this expected increase did not occur. In fact, the fraction of immigrants

who were not covered by health insurance remained roughly stable (or fell) during the period.

        The immigrant provisions in PRWORA could potentially affect only a subset of the

immigrant population, depending on the immigrant’s state of residence, on the type of visa used

to enter the United States, and on the immigrant’s naturalization status. This variation in

eligibility rules can be exploited to examine how immigrants responded to the cutbacks in public

assistance. It turns out that the immigrants most adversely affected by PRWORA significantly

increased their labor supply, thereby raising the probability that they were covered by employer-

sponsored health insurance. In fact, the evidence indicates that the increase in the number of

immigrants covered by employer-sponsored health insurance was large enough to completely

offset the impact of the Medicaid cutbacks. The study, therefore, provides evidence of a strong

crowdout effect of publicly provided health insurance among immigrants.5

        It is important to note, however, that my results differ in an important way from the

evidence typically reported in the crowdout literature. The welfare reform legislation affected

immigrant participation in a vast array of public assistance programs, not just Medicaid. For

example, PRWORA also restricted immigrant receipt of cash benefits and food stamps. The

crowdout effects documented in this paper, therefore, measure the total immigrant response to a

generalized cutback in public assistance, rather than the immigrant response to eligibility

changes in the Medicaid program.




        5  Cutler and Gruber (1996) present the first empirical evidence of how publicly provided health insurance
can crowd out private insurance. Although some studies in the subsequent literature confirm the Cutler-Gruber
findings, there is also a lot of dissenting evidence. Currie (2000), Rask and Rask (2000), and Shore-Sheppard (1999)
document large crowdout effects, while Blumberg et al (2000), Dubay and Kenney (1997), Ham and Shore-
Sheppard (2001), and Yazici and Kaestner (1998) find much smaller effects. It is worth noting that the existing
evidence is drawn entirely from the behavioral response to expansions in the Medicaid program. Gruber (in press)
surveys the literature.

II. Welfare Reform and Health Insurance: Aggregate Trends

       The welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996 made fundamental changes in the federal

system of public assistance. The overriding objective of the legislation was to move welfare

recipients into work. In addition to granting state governments a great deal of authority to set

their own eligibility rules and benefit levels, the legislation mandates that most welfare recipients

go to work after two years and imposes a five-year lifetime limit for receiving assistance. In

addition to these universal changes in coverage and eligibility, PRWORA includes a number of

provisions that specifically limit the extent to which immigrant households can receive public

assistance. As signed by President Clinton, PRWORA contained three key provisions applying to

legal immigrants who did not enter the country as refugees:

       1. Most non-citizens who arrived in the country before August 22, 1996, the “pre-

           enactment” immigrants, were to be kicked off from the SSI, food stamp, and

           Medicaid rolls within a year. This provision of the legislation, however, was never

           fully enforced.

       2. Non-citizens who entered the United States after August 22, 1996, the “post-

           enactment” immigrants, are prohibited from receiving most types of public assistance,

           including Medicaid, during the first five years after arrival.

       3. Post-enactment immigrants are subject to stricter “deeming” regulations: The income

           and assets of the immigrant’s sponsor will be deemed to be part of the immigrant’s

           application for most types of public assistance for up to ten years.6

In contrast to these restrictions on the (legal) non-refugee, non-citizen population, the legislation

did not restrict refugee participation in the various public assistance programs. In addition, the

legislation continued to prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving most types of aid.
                                                         6

        As noted above, the restrictions on welfare use by pre-enactment immigrants were never

fully enforced. In particular, the balanced budget agreement reached in 1997 between President

Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress (combined with state actions discussed below)

effectively repealed some of the most draconian aspects of the legislation.7 As a result, few of the

pre-enactment immigrants were actually kicked off the welfare rolls. Moreover, only a relatively

small fraction of the immigrant population in the United States arrived after 1996, so that few

immigrants are actually barred from receiving assistance. It would seem, therefore, that

PRWORA could not have had a large impact on welfare participation rates in the immigrant

population—after all, relatively few immigrants could have been directly affected by the

legislation.

        A number of studies, however, report that the welfare reform legislation seems to have

had an important influence on immigrant participation in welfare programs (Fix and Passel,

1999; Borjas, 2001). In particular, welfare participation rates declined after 1996 for both

immigrant and native households, but the decline was much steeper among immigrants. This

finding led an Urban Institute study to conclude that “because comparatively few legal

immigrants were ineligible for public benefits as of December 1997, it appears that the steeper

declines in non-citizens’ than citizens’ use of welfare…owe more to the ‘chilling effect’ of

welfare reform and other policy changes than they do to actual eligibility changes” (Fix and

Passel, 1999, p. 8; emphasis added).

        It is instructive to illustrate the nature of these trends. The Annual Demographic Files of

the Current Population Surveys (CPS) provide detailed information on participation in various



        6   Primus (1996) presents a more detailed discussion of the immigrant provisions in PROWRA.

        7  See U.S. General Accounting Office (1998) for a discussion of the various policy changes that occurred
after the enactment of PRWORA at both the federal and state levels.

social assistance programs and on health insurance coverage during the calendar year prior to the

survey. I use the 1995-2001 March Supplements, which provide program participation data for

the 1994-2000 calendar years, in the empirical analysis reported below.8 Throughout the paper,

the person is the unit of analysis. I restrict the study to persons who do not reside in group

quarters and who are under 65 years of age.

         The first step in the analysis is to define the sample of foreign-born persons. A simple

(though obviously incorrect) solution in the current context would be to classify the person based

solely on his or her birthplace. This approach has the serious problem that children born in the

United States to foreign-born parents would be classified as native-born, even though their

immigrant parents are making the employment and welfare participation decisions that inevitably

determine their health insurance coverage. To simplify the presentation of the evidence, I

classify all persons in the household as foreign-born or native-born based solely on the birthplace

of the household head. Similarly, all foreign-born persons in the household will be classified as

citizen or non-citizen based on the naturalization status of the household head.9 Throughout the

paper, I will use this algorithm to assign all persons into one of three mutually exclusive groups:

native-born, naturalized citizen, and non-citizen.

         Table 1 summarizes some of the key trends in health insurance coverage for the 1994-

2000 period. As shown in earlier research, the decline in welfare use during this period was

steeper among immigrants. For example, the fraction of natives enrolled in the Medicaid

program fell from 11.8 to 9.9 percent between 1994 and 2000. In contrast, the fraction of


         8 There seem to be some data problems with the foreign-born sample in the 1995 survey. In particular, the
“official” person weights provided in this survey do not yield an accurate enumeration of the immigrant population
in the United States. Passel (1996) gives a detailed discussion of this problem, and uses a complex algorithm to
calculate revised weights for each person in the survey. I use the “Passel weights” in all calculations that involve the
1995 survey.
                                                          8

immigrants enrolled in Medicaid declined by 3.6 percentage points over the same period (from

17.0 to 13.4 percent). Moreover, the decline was limited to non-citizens—precisely the group of

foreign-born persons targeted by welfare reform. Their participation rate fell by 5.5 percentage

points (from 21.3 to 15.8 percent). The evidence, therefore, suggests that welfare reform—at

least at the national level—may have had a sizable chilling effect on immigrant participation in

the Medicaid program.10

         Remarkably, this relative decline in Medicaid use in the immigrant population was not

accompanied by a concurrent decline in the fraction of immigrants who have some type of health

insurance coverage. In fact, the proportion of immigrants who have some type of coverage rose

slightly over the period, from 67.0 percent in 1994 to 68.8 percent in 2000. This trend is almost

identical to the 1.9 percentage point increase in the health insurance coverage rate of natives,

where the coverage rate rose from 85.1 to 87.0 percent. Finally, although the trends are noisier,

the coverage rate was essentially stable for naturalized citizens, and rose slightly for non-

citizens.

         The concurrent decline in Medicaid coverage and the relative stability of health insurance

coverage in the immigrant population suggests that immigrants must have switched to other

sources of coverage. The bottom panel of Table 1 reveals the source of the alternative coverage:

employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). The fraction of natives with ESI rose by 4.3 percentage

points, from 66.9 to 71.2 percent over the period. In contrast, the fraction of immigrants with ESI



         9 The results of the study would be very similar if the definition of immigration status used information on
the birthplace and citizenship of both the household head and his or her spouse.

         10  It is worth noting that some of the decline occurred prior to the enactment of the welfare reform
legislation. In particular, there was a substantial drop in Medicaid coverage among immigrants between 1995 and
1996. Because the welfare reform provisions regarding immigrants went into effect on August 22, 1996, the change
between the 1995 and 1996 calendar years confounds both the impact of welfare reform and the impact of
improving economic conditions. The regression analysis presented in the next section controls for these cyclical
effects.
                                                 9

rose by 5.8 percentage points, from 45.8 to 51.6 percent. Finally, the fraction of non-citizens

with ESI rose by 6.3 percentage points, from 37.3 to 43.6 percent. In short, the aggregate time

series suggests that immigrant displacement from the Medicaid rolls seems to have been

completely offset by a corresponding increase in the number of immigrants who received health

insurance coverage through their employer.

       These aggregate trends, though suggestive, do not conclusively prove that Medicaid

crowds out privately provided health insurance coverage in the immigrant population. After all,

the economy was booming between 1994 and 2000, and the health insurance coverage trends

may be capturing this macroeconomic effect rather than any behavioral response on the part of

immigrants. I will show below, however, that these nationwide trends confound systematic

differences within the immigrant population, mainly because they ignore the fact that different

states responded differently to the federal restrictions on immigrant welfare use. The various

state responses help to identify the extent to which Medicaid crowds out employer-sponsored

insurance.




III. State Responses to Welfare Reform

       A key provision of PRWORA allows states to enact state-funded assistance programs

specifically targeted to their immigrant populations if they wished to attenuate the presumed

adverse impact of welfare reform on the foreign-born. Zimmermann and Tumlin (1999) and

Tumlin, Zimmermann and Ost (1999) summarize the various programs that states extended to

immigrants in the wake of welfare reform. Although there are many ways of describing the

states’ choices, one simple approach indicates if the states offered TANF, Medicaid, food

assistance, and SSI to pre-enactment and post-enactment immigrants during the initial five-year

bar. It turns out that almost every jurisdiction (50 out of 51) offered TANF and Medicaid to pre-
                                                          10

enactment immigrants. A few states went beyond this “minimal” level of generosity and offered

other programs to their pre-enactment immigrant populations and to post-enactment immigrants

during the five-year bar. The first two columns of Table 2 summarize these “beyond-the-

minimum” state actions. It is worth noting that many of the states with large concentrations of

immigrants exceeded the minimal level of generosity.

         To show how the “chilling effect” of welfare reform on Medicaid participation and health

insurance coverage depended on the decisions made by individual states, I pool the 1994-95

calendar years of the March CPS to provide a snapshot of the immigrant and native population

prior to welfare reform, and the 1998-2000 calendar years to provide the respective snapshot

after welfare reform.11 To easily summarize the evidence, I group states into two categories that

signal their degree of generosity towards immigrants. I initially use a definition of the state’s

generosity based on the data summarized in the first two columns of Table 2. A state is classified

as “more generous” if it offered at least one of the programs listed in these two columns;

otherwise, the state is classified as “less generous”. By this definition, 29 states are classified as

more generous. Finally, I calculate health insurance coverage rates in three mutually exclusive

groups: natives, citizens, and non-citizens.12

         The first four columns of Table 3 summarize the evidence. The table clearly shows that

the decisions made by some states to offer a state-funded safety net to their immigrant

populations did not greatly alter the trend of Medicaid participation for native households. For

example, the probability that natives are enrolled in Medicaid declined by about 2 to 3



         11  Note that I do not use data from the 1996 and 1997 calendar years in the calculations. This helps to
isolate the break in the time series that can presumably be attributed to PRWORA.

          12 The sample sizes for the four groups are as follows. In the 1994-1995 pooled sample, there are 210,994
natives, 11,088 citizens, and 24,107 non-citizens. In the 1998-2000 pooled sample, there are 290,579 natives, 21,411
citizens, and 35,599 non-citizens.
                                                     11

percentage points during the period, regardless of whether the state was generous to its

immigrant population. In contrast, the state decisions had a greater impact on Medicaid

enrollment rates among immigrants, both for naturalized citizens and non-citizens. For example,

the fraction of citizens enrolled in Medicaid declined by 1.5 percentage points in the less-

generous states, but rose in the more generous states. Similarly, the fraction of non-citizens

enrolled in Medicaid declined by 7.0 percentage points (from 18.1 to 11.1 percent) in the less

generous states, but by 4.9 percentage points in the more generous states (from 21.0 to 16.1

percent). It is clear that non-citizen households in the less generous states experienced a much

larger relative decline in Medicaid participation than native households.

        The differential trends for non-citizen households between the less generous and more

generous states are even sharper when the sample is restricted to the non-refugee population.

Although the CPS data do not report the type of visa used by a particular immigrant to enter the

country, one can approximate the refugee sample by using information on the national origin of

the foreign-born households. In particular, most refugees tend to originate in a small set of

countries.13 I classified all persons residing in households where the household head originated in

the main refugee-sending countries as refugees, while all other persons were classified as non-

refugees. The non-citizen, non-refugees residing in the less generous states experienced a 7.0

percentage point decline in their Medicaid participation rate, as compared to the 3.1 percentage

point decline for the non-citizen, non-refugees residing in the more generous states.

        The second panel of Table 3 replicates the analysis for health insurance coverage. The

probability that natives are covered by health insurance rose slightly in both the more and less

generous states. Moreover, the probability that immigrants are covered by health insurance is



        13The main refugee-sending countries over the 1970-95 period were: Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Cambodia,
Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Hungary, Laos, Poland, Romania, Thailand, the former U.S.S.R., and Vietnam.
                                                        12

also relatively stable over time: the probability fell by 0.3 percentage points in the more generous

states and by 1.1 percentage points in the less generous states. Most strikingly, the health

insurance coverage rate for non-citizens dropped by 1.7 percentage points in the more generous

states, but rose by 2.1 percentage points in the less generous states. In short, the descriptive data

reported in Table 3 do not reveal that the Medicaid cutbacks experienced by non-citizens in the

less generous states adversely affected their overall rate of health insurance coverage.

       The differential trends in non-citizen Medicaid participation and health insurance

coverage can be explained by a substantial increase in the probability that these immigrants were

covered by ESI. The bottom panel of Table 3 reports the trends in the rate of employer-provided

insurance for the various groups. The generosity of the state’s welfare program towards

immigrants does not affect the likelihood that natives are covered by ESI. The rate of employer-

sponsored insurance among natives rose by 2.6 percentage points in the more generous states,

and by 3.0 percentage points in the less generous states. In contrast, the rate of ESI coverage for

non-citizens rose by 2.7 percentage points in the more generous states, and by an astounding 11.4

percentage points in the less generous states. The descriptive evidence reported in Table 3,

therefore, suggests a causal relationship between the Medicaid cutbacks and the use of ESI

coverage in the targeted population.

       The last four columns of the table report the trends in health insurance coverage in a

population that is of particular concern in the current context, namely children under the age of

15.14 The differences in the trends among the various types of health insurance coverage tend to

be much sharper among children than in the general population. For example, the fraction of

non-citizen children covered by Medicaid fell by 4.5 percentage points in the more generous




       14   The children sample also includes persons aged 15-17 who reside with their parents.
                                                         13

states (from 35.4 to 30.9 percent), but it dropped by almost 9 percentage points in the less

generous states (from 31.1 to 22.2 percent).

       Interestingly, the substantial decline in government-sponsored health insurance among

non-citizen children living in the less generous states did not materially affect the fraction of

those children who had some type of health insurance coverage. In particular, the rate of health

insurance coverage for non-citizen children in the more generous states fell by 1.3 percentage

points (from 70.1 to 68.8 percent), but rose by 2.4 percentage points (from 63.3 to 65.7 percent)

in the less generous states. The underlying reason for this differential trend was again a sizable

increase in the number of non-citizen children covered by employer-sponsored insurance. The

rate of ESI coverage for non-citizen children living in the more generous states rose from 35.5 to

37.1 percent during the period, as contrasted with a rise from 32.6 percent to 44.9 percent for the

children living in the less generous states. In short, the labor supply responses by the parents of

non-citizen children helped to completely offset the impact of the government cutbacks in

Medicaid assistance.

       It is instructive to use a simple regression model to formalize and extend these descriptive

results. By controlling for various socioeconomic characteristics, the regression approach helps

us determine if the differential trends in health insurance coverage observed between the more

and less generous states arise because different types of immigrants tend to live in different

states, or if the variation can be attributed to state-specific trends in economic activity or social

conditions. To illustrate the basic methodology, pool the CPS data available for the calendar

years 1994, 1995, 1998, 1999, and 2000 and consider the triple-difference linear probability

specification:



(1)              yij = Xij β + α0 tij + α1 Iij + α2 Gj
                                                         14


                     + γ0 (Iij × tij) + γ1 (Iij × Gj) + γ2 (Gj × tij) + θ (Iij × Gj × tij) + εij ,



where yij is a dummy variable indicating a particular type of health insurance outcome for person

i in state j (such as enrollment in Medicaid); Xij is a vector of socioeconomic characteristics

defined below; tij is a dummy variable set to unity if the observation refers to the post-PRWORA

period (i.e., calendar years 1998 through 2000); Iij is a vector of two dummy variables indicating

if the person is a naturalized citizen or a non-citizen (the left-out variable indicates if the person

is native-born); and Gj is the dummy variable indicating the state’s generosity towards

immigrants, set to unity if the state did not go beyond the minimum level of assistance offered to

pre-enactment or post-enactment immigrants during the five-year bar. Specifically, Gj is set to

unity if the state did not offer any of the programs listed in the first two columns of Table 2.

Finally, the standard errors are clustered by state-immigration cells to adjust for possible serial

correlation in insurance outcomes at the state level for each of the three immigration status

groups.

          For simplicity, the regression specification in (1) uses a three-way classification of the

immigration status of the population (i.e., natives, naturalized citizens, and non-citizens). I

account for the immigrant’s refugee status as well as year of entry into the United States by

including these characteristics as regressors in the vector X. The other socioeconomic

characteristics in this vector include: the person’s age, gender, race, and educational attainment,

the number of persons in the household, and the number of children, elderly persons, and

disabled persons in the household.15 The regression also includes the state’s unemployment rate


          15Throughout the analysis, the variable indicating the person’s age is defined as a vector of dummy
variables indicating if the person is 0-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, or 55-64 years old. Similarly, the variable
measuring educational attainment is a vector of dummy variables indicating if the person is a high school dropout
(less than 12 years), a high school graduate (12 years), has some college (13-15 years), or is a college graduate (at
least 16 years). The educational attainment variable takes on the value of the education of the head of the household
                                                          15

at time t, as well as the unemployment rate interacted with the dummy variables in the

immigration vector I. These interactions control for the possibility that immigrant outcomes are

more sensitive to the business cycle than those of natives (as well as net out any potential

correlation between the generosity variable, G, and the state unemployment rate).16 Because the

generosity dummy variable is set to one for states that did not replace the lost federal benefits,

the coefficient vector θ in equation (1) measures the impact of the federal cutbacks on the

relative trend in immigrant health coverage. In particular, it measures the extent to which the

pre- and post-PRWORA change in coverage differs between states that were less generous and

states that were more generous.

         Table 4 reports the triple-difference coefficient vector θ estimated from a number of

alternative specifications of the model. The specification reported in the first column of the table

includes only the variables in the vector X, while the specification reported in the second column

adds a vector of state fixed effects, and these fixed effects are interacted with both the time

dummy variable (ti), as well as with the immigrant status vector (I). The state-time interactions

capture not only state-specific differences in the level of health insurance, but also state-specific

changes in health insurance coverage rates (induced perhaps by varying economic and political

conditions). Similarly, the state-immigration status interactions net out the possibility that there

may be state differences in health insurance coverage (and in the trends) across the various

immigration status groups. Finally, the last two columns of Table 4 replicate the regression

analysis in the sample of children.



for all persons who are less than 15 years old. The year of arrival dummy variables indicate if the household arrived
after 1995, 1990-94, 1985-89, 1980-84, 1975-79, 1970-74, 1965-69, 1960-64, 1950-59, or before 1950.

         16 I also include all the possible interactions between the state’s unemployment rate, the period fixed effect,
and the variables in the immigration vector I. These interactions allow for the impact of aggregate economic during
the economic boom of the late 1990s to differ over time and across the various immigrant groups.
                                                   16

        The top panel of the table estimates the impact of the state policies on the relative change

in Medicaid enrollment. In the full-interaction specification, the triple-difference coefficient for

non-citizens is -.049 (with a standard error of .025) in the sample of all persons, and -.105 (.048)

in the children’s sample. The state policies, therefore, had a significant impact on Medicaid

participation in the non-citizen population. In other words, non-citizens residing in states that did

not offer state-funded assistance programs to their immigrant populations experienced a

significant decline in their Medicaid participation rates, and the decline was particularly steep for

non-citizen children. In contrast, these programs did not affect the relative Medicaid participation

rate of citizens or of the children of citizens.

        The middle panel of the table estimates the regression using a different dependent

variable, namely an indicator of whether the person has any type of health insurance coverage.

To the extent that the Medicaid cutbacks generate a larger pool of uninsured non-citizens, one

would expect the relevant coefficient in the vector θ to be negative and significant. However, this

coefficient is positive. In particular, it takes on a value of .024 (.021) in the sample of all persons,

and .022 (.031) in the sample of children. In other words, there is no evidence that the welfare

cutbacks significantly reduced the aggregate health insurance coverage rate in the targeted group

of non-citizens. In contrast, the health insurance coverage rate actually increased in the states

that were the least generous and did not attempt to attenuate the presumed adverse impacts of

PRWORA.

        Finally, the bottom panel helps to resolve the puzzle of declining Medicaid participation

and stable (or increasing) health insurance coverage by showing how the state-funded assistance

programs influenced the probability that immigrants were covered by employer-sponsored

insurance. The coefficient for non-citizens in this regression is .101 (.026) in the sample of all
                                                          17

persons, and .147 (.049) in the sample of children.17 In other words, immigrants who lived in

states that did not provide generous assistance programs to their immigrant populations after

1996 became substantially more likely to be covered by employer-sponsored insurance. This

increase in ESI helped to greatly attenuate the potential adverse impact of the welfare cutbacks

on the number of non-citizens who lack health insurance. In contrast, the probability that citizens

are covered by ESI does not strongly depend on the provision of state-funded assistance (the

coefficient is negative, but insignificant).18



    Sensitivity Tests

         An important step in the construction of the empirical framework is the classification of a

state into the “more” and “less” generous categories. As noted above, states made many different

decisions regarding their offers of state-funded assistance to immigrants in the post-welfare

reform period. I have chosen a very simple classification to summarize all of these activities: did

the state provide any “beyond-the-minimum” state-funded assistance to either its pre-enrollment

or the post-enrollment immigrants during the five-year bar?

         It is important to examine if the results are sensitive to the definition of the variable

describing the state’s generosity. Zimmermann and Tumlin (1999) construct an index of

generosity for each state that uses much of the available information on the various state


         17 For simplicity, I use the linear probability model to estimate equation (1). A probit specification yields
similar results. For example, the marginal impact (at the mean) implied by the probit triple-difference coefficient for
non-citizens is -.024 (.010) in the Medicaid regression; .016 (.013) in the health insurance coverage regression; and
.099 (.022) in the ESI regression. The respective coefficients in the children’s sample are -.079 (.027), .012 (.018),
and .150 (.042).

         18  More detailed estimates of the regression model (not shown) suggest that the various impacts of welfare
reform (and state actions) capture a chilling effect rather than programmatic changes. In particular, I estimated the
full-interaction regression model on the pooled sample of natives and immigrants who arrived before 1996. Since
relatively few pre-enactment immigrants were affected by the cutbacks, any resulting effects are likely due to
chilling effects. The coefficient is -.049 (.032) in the Medicaid regression; .030 (.018) in the health insurance
                                                         18

programs, including restrictions for various types of immigrants, immigrant eligibility for

General Assistance programs, and the extent of deeming requirements. They classified states into

four categories, ranking state-funded assistance from “most available” to “least available”. The

third column of Table 2 reports the Zimmermann-Tumlin ranking. I construct an alternative

dummy variable indicating the state’s generosity by setting the variable Gj to unity if the state

was not generous in the Zimmermann-Tumlin sense; specifically, the state’s assistance was

either “less available” or “least available.” By this definition, 32 states are classified as less

generous.19

         The first two columns of Table 5 report the triple-difference coefficients from this

specification of the model. As before, the evidence clearly indicates that non-citizens living in

states that were not generous experienced a significant decline in Medicaid participation rates

(the coefficient in the full-interaction model is -.043, with a standard error of .013), with the

decline being particularly steep for children in non-citizen households. At the same time, neither

the immigrants nor the children living in the less generous states experienced much of a drop in

their health insurance coverage rate. The conflict between these two facts is resolved by the fact

that non-citizens living in the less generous states experienced a substantial rise in the rate of ESI

coverage.

         To further assess the sensitivity of the results to definitions of the state’s generosity, I

also constructed an index based solely on the state’s provision of health insurance to immigrants,

since this type of public assistance should presumably have the most direct impact on aggregate

health insurance coverage rates. As noted earlier, practically all states (50 out of 51) extended


coverage regression; and .113 (.034) in the ESI regression. These coefficients are almost identical to those reported
in Table 4.
                                                        19

Medicaid coverage to pre-enactment immigrants. Tumlin, Zimmermann and Ost (1999) report

two particular types of programs that only some states made available to their immigrant

populations. In particular, some states offered state-funded Medicaid to post-enactment

immigrants during the five-year bar or to other “unqualified” immigrants.20 The last column of

Table 2 reports whether the state provided either of these programs. I define a new generosity

index by creating a dummy variable set to unity if the state did not offer Medicaid either to its

post-enactment immigrants during the five-year bar or to other unqualified immigrants. By this

definition, 13 states are classified as less generous.21

        The right panel of Table 5 summarizes the evidence. As before, non-citizens who live in

the less generous states experienced a decline in Medicaid participation, with the decline being

particularly steep for children. Despite the decline in Medicaid coverage, however, the non-

citizens most affected by these cutbacks did not experience a sizable drop in health insurance

coverage, partly because of an increase in their rate of ESI coverage. The thrust of the evidence

on health insurance coverage rates, therefore, is not sensitive to the definition of the generosity

index. As a result, the remainder of the analysis will use my initial definition of the generosity

index, which is based on the programmatic information summarized in the first two columns of

Table 2.

        Regardless of the definition of the state’s generosity index, any comparison between

naturalized citizens and non-citizens may be contaminated by the potential endogeneity of the

naturalization decision. After all, the non-citizens most affected by welfare reform could


        19 The weighted correlation coefficient between the generosity index derived from the Zimmermann-
Tumlin classification and the generosity index used in Table 4 is .67, where the weights are the number of
observations in the state.

        20   “Unqualified immigrants” include illegal immigrants, asylum applicants, and temporary immigrants.
                                                         20

neutralize many of the restrictions in the legislation by becoming naturalized.22 In fact, there was

a rapid rise in the number of naturalization applications during the period (Wasem, 1998). This

increase in the number of naturalization applications generated a huge backlog at the INS, further

delaying the time it takes to become a naturalized citizen.

         One solution to the endogeneity problem would be to compare persons who differ in

terms of how long they have resided in the United States, rather than in terms of their citizenship

status. Immigrants have to live in the United States for five years before they can apply for

naturalization, but the lags in the application process imply that it may take 8 years or more

before an immigrant can become a naturalized citizen. I estimated the triple-difference regression

model using an immigrant vector defined in terms of whether the person was native-born, was an

immigrant who had been in the United States for fewer than 10 years, or was an immigrant who

had been in the United States for more than 10 years. These regressions (not shown) indicated

that although the most recent immigrants suffered the greatest declines in Medicaid participation

rates, their health insurance coverage rates remained relatively constant because of a concurrent

increase in the rate of ESI coverage. Alternatively, the endogeneity of the naturalization decision

can be avoided by simply comparing the immigrant and native populations, so that the vector I in

equation (1) would contain a single variable indicating if the household is headed by a foreign-

born person. The evidence (not shown) suggested that Medicaid participation fell for immigrants,

while health insurance coverage rates remained constant because of a corresponding increase in

the probability of being covered by employer-sponsored insurance.



         21The weighted correlation coefficient between this generosity index and the index used in Table 4 is .33,
where the weights are the number of observations in the state.

         22 If the non-citizens most likely to be adversely affected by the Medicaid cutbacks choose to naturalize,
the non-citizen coefficients reported in Tables 4 and 5 would tend to understate the impact of the federal welfare
cutbacks on Medicaid coverage rates.
                                                 21

       In sum, the results presented in this section strongly suggest that the state-funded

assistance programs helped to attenuate the decline in Medicaid participation in the immigrant

population. At the same time, however, these state-funded programs (or their absence) had

important “unintended” consequences. Non-citizens who did not have access to the state-funded

programs found ways of replacing the cutbacks in publicly provided health insurance by

increasing their probability of coverage with employer-sponsored insurance. In the end, the state-

funded programs did not seem to substantially alter the probability that the immigrants had some

type of health insurance coverage.

       The evidence, therefore, implies the existence of a strong crowdout effect of publicly

provided health insurance. The results effectively offer a “mirror-image” perspective to the

crowdout findings first reported in Cutler and Gruber’s (1996) influential study. Cutler and

Gruber document that an expansion of Medicaid eligibility substantially reduced the number of

persons covered by private health insurance. My study reveals that a cutback in public assistance

induces many immigrants to replace the lost benefits with employer-sponsored insurance.

       As noted earlier, however, the evidence presented in this paper differs in an important

way from the results in the crowdout literature. The welfare reform legislation affected

immigrant eligibility and participation in all public assistance programs. As a result, the

crowdout effects estimated in this section capture the behavioral response to the changing value

of the entire package of public benefits, rather than the behavioral response to a shift in the

parameters of the Medicaid program.




IV. Welfare Reform and Labor Supply

       One key implication of the findings reported in the previous section is that the welfare

reform legislation must have influenced the labor supply decisions of the targeted immigrants. I
                                                       22

now examine if such a labor supply effect can indeed be documented in the immigrant

population.

        I restrict my study of the labor supply decision to the sample of persons aged 18-64. I

focus on three alternative measures of labor supply. The first indicates if the person is in the

labor force during the survey week. The second gives the log of annual hours worked in the past

calendar year (calculated only in the sample of workers). The third indicates if a person is

working full-time, which is defined as working at least 35 hours per week (again, this variable is

only calculated in the sample of workers). It is well known that relatively few part-time workers

have access to ESI and other employee benefits.23 The study of full-time status can then provide

an understanding of how workers respond to policy changes on a labor supply margin that has

important implications for health insurance coverage. Finally, the analysis will be carried out

separately for men and women.

        The top panel of Table 6 summarizes some of the key trends in labor supply before and

after PRWORA, again classified according to the generosity of the state’s welfare offer to

immigrants. Consider initially the trends in labor supply experienced by native men. The labor

force participation rate of native men was stable over the 1994-2000 period in both the less and

more generous states. In contrast, the labor force participation rate of immigrants increased

slightly from 84.2 to 85.8 percent in the more generous states, but increased much faster (from

83.1 to 86.9 percent) in the less generous states. Put differently, the labor supply of immigrant

men seemed to be extremely responsive to the welfare cutbacks; immigrants living in states that

did not provide state-funded assistance to replace the federal cutbacks were the ones who

experienced the largest increase in labor force participation rates. Moreover, this increase in



        23 In 2000, 65.3 percent of full-time workers were covered by ESI, as compared to only 19.1 percent of
part-time workers.
                                                  23

labor supply occurred almost entirely among non-citizens. The labor force participation rate of

naturalized citizens, for example, rose slightly from 83.7 to 84.3 percent in the more generous

states, and was stable at 84.0 percent in the less generous states. In contrast, the labor force

participation rate of non-citizens rose from 84.4 to 86.9 percent in the more generous states, but

increased by 6 percentage points (from 82.5 to 88.5 percent) in the less generous states. The

descriptive evidence, therefore, clearly indicates that the immigrant men who could have been

most adversely affected by welfare reform substantially increased their labor supply.

       The other measures of male labor supply reported in Table 6 reinforce this pattern. For

example, the annual hours of work of working native men changed by only 3 or 4 percent,

regardless of where they lived. In contrast, the annual hours of work of non-citizen men rose by

about 9 percent if they lived in the more generous states and by 13 percent if they lived in the

less generous states. Interestingly, the behavioral labor supply response in the affected immigrant

population included a sizable increase in the fraction of immigrant men who worked full-time.

The fraction of native men who worked in full-time jobs was relatively stable over the period,

increasing by only about 1 percentage point in both the more and less generous states. In

contrast, the fraction of non-citizens who worked full-time jobs rose by 3.5 percentage points

(from 88.0 to 91.5 percent) in the more generous states, but by 6.2 percentage points (from 84.8

to 91.0 percent) in the less generous states.

       The trends in female labor supply are not as striking as those documented in the male

sample. The data generally suggest that female immigrants living in the less generous states

increased their labor supply relatively more, but the results are not very consistent. For example,

the labor force participation rate of non-citizen women rose by about 3 percentage points

regardless of the state where they lived. In contrast, annual hours of work of non-citizen women

rose by 10 percent if they lived in the more generous states and by 14 percent if they lived in the
                                                        24

less generous states. The discrepancy between the labor supply trends of immigrant men and

women may indicate the existence of spillover labor supply effects within families (since

typically only one family member needs to be covered by ESI), as well as suggest the possibility

that female labor force participation plays a different role in native and immigrant families, a

proposition that has not been sufficiently analyzed in the existing literature.24

        To investigate the extent to which these labor supply trends can be explained by

differences in socioeconomic characteristics among the groups or by state-specific trends in

economic or social conditions, consider again the triple-difference regression model:



(2)             hij = Xij β + α0 tij + α1 Iij + α2 Gj

                   + γ0 (Iij × tij) + γ1 (Iij × Gj) + γ2 (Gj × tij) + θ (Iij × Gj × tij) + εij ,



where hij is a variable measuring some aspect of labor supply for person i in state j. Note that the

regression specification in (2) is identical to the one used in the previous section to quantify the

impact of welfare reform on health insurance coverage rates. The coefficient θ, however, now

measures the impact of the welfare cutbacks on the relative trend in immigrant labor supply.

        Table 7 reports the relevant regression coefficients from various specifications of the

model in equation (2). The estimated coefficients consistently show that the labor supply of non-

citizen men declined substantially in those states that were most generous with their immigrant

populations in the aftermath of PRWORA, even after controlling for differences in a vast array

of socioeconomic characteristics and state-specific factors. For example, the triple-difference

coefficient measuring the impact of the welfare cutbacks on non-citizen male labor force


        24 Baker and Benjamin (1997) and Duleep and Sanders (1993) provide some empirical evidence on the
determinants of the labor supply decisions of immigrant women.
                                                 25

participation is .060 (with a standard error of .016); the coefficient measuring the impact on log

annual hours worked is .041 (.058); and the coefficient measuring the impact on the probability

that the worker works a full-time week is .040 (.022). In contrast, the triple-difference coefficient

measuring the relative impact of the state programs on the labor supply of citizen men is

numerically closer to zero and statistically insignificant. Finally, although the labor supply

effects are (statistically) weaker for women, the estimated coefficients suggest that hours of work

for non-citizen women increased more if they lived in states that were not generous to their

immigrant populations in the aftermath of PRWORA.

       In sum, the reduced-form results reported in Table 8 strongly imply that the state-funded

assistance programs that were designed to attenuate the impact of welfare reform on immigrants

played an important influence in the labor supply decisions of immigrants.




V. The Crowdout Effect

       The descriptive evidence summarized in the previous sections presents a strong

circumstantial case supporting the hypothesis that public assistance alters the terms of trade

between private health insurance and publicly provided health insurance. More precisely, I have

shown that health insurance coverage rates did not decline among immigrants who potentially

suffered the largest welfare cutbacks in the post-1996 period (i.e., non-citizens living in less

generous states). Instead, this group experienced an offsetting increase in employer-sponsored

insurance. I now examine the nature of this tradeoff. Consider the regression model:



(3)            pij = Wij β + δ mij + ωij,
                                                 26

where pij is the probability that person i living in state j is covered by employer-sponsored

insurance; Wij is a vector of socioeconomic characteristics defined below; and mij gives the

probability that the person is covered by Medicaid.

       Two related obstacles prevent a straightforward estimation of the structural model in

equation (3). The first is that we do not observe the probability that a particular person receives

Medicaid or is covered by ESI. Instead, we simply observe the outcome of these probability

processes for a particular person. For example, the person is either covered by Medicaid or is

not. This measurement problem can be easily addressed by changing the unit of analysis from a

particular person to a particular group, defined as persons who share a particular immigration

status, live in the same state, and are observed at the same point in time. I can then calculate the

probability of receiving Medicaid and of being covered by employer-sponsored insurance for the

“representative person” in each group, as well as calculate the mean of the various

socioeconomic characteristics.

       Of course, the OLS estimate of the parameter δ would be biased even if the regression

were estimated in these aggregate data. There is, after all, a spurious correlation between the

receipt of Medicaid and ESI coverage. Medicaid eligibility depends on many characteristics,

some of which are unobserved. Persons with favorable values of these characteristics (such as

higher assets) will not qualify and participate in the Medicaid program. Many of these factors,

however, are correlated with the probability that the person works and is covered by ESI. An

observed negative correlation between p and m, therefore, does not capture the behavioral

tradeoff between publicly and privately provided insurance, but is instead contaminated by the

correlation between the probability of receiving Medicaid and the error term in equation (3).

       The structural parameter δ can be correctly estimated by using instrumental variables,

where the instruments are provided by the exogenous variation in eligibility rules introduced by
                                                   27

the immigrant provisions in the welfare reform legislation, as well as by the responses of

individual states to the changes in the federal safety net. In particular, consider a first-stage

regression model given by:



(4)             mk = Xk β + λ Zk + vk ,



where the subscript k denotes a particular cell defined by year of observation (i.e., before or after

1996), state of residence, immigration status (i.e., native, citizen, refugee and non-citizen, and

non-refugee and non-citizen), and gender; and the vector Zk = (t, I, G, I × t, G × t, I × G, I × G ×

t). Note that Zk contains the same set of variables used in the reduced-form triple difference

regression models estimated in the previous sections.

        The aggregate version of the second stage regression is obtained by aggregating equation

(3) within each cell k. It can be written as:



(3′)            pk = Wk β + δ mk + ωk,



                                                                                    ~          ~
The vector Wk in the second stage regression in equation (3′) is given by Wk = [Xk, Zk], where Zk

= (t, I, G, I × t, G × t, I × G). The identification of the structural coefficient δ depends entirely on

the exclusion of the triple-difference interaction terms from the second-stage regression. The

vector X contains the within-cell mean of the set of socioeconomic characteristics used in the

regressions in the previous sections. In addition, the regression includes a vector of state fixed

effects, and interacts this vector with both the immigration status variables and with the dummy

variable indicating if the observation refers to the post-1996 period. Finally, the standard errors

are clustered by state-immigration status cells to adjust for possible serial correlation.
                                                   28

        The first column of Table 8 reports the estimated structural coefficient when the

dependent variable in the second-stage equation is the probability that the typical person in cell k

is covered by employer-sponsored insurance. As the first row shows, there is a sizable negative

correlation between the probability of receiving Medicaid and the probability of being covered

by ESI. The coefficient is numerically large and marginally significant from zero (-1.79, with a

standard error of .94). Moreover, this coefficient is not significantly different from one. The IV

estimate of δ, therefore, confirms the key insight from the descriptive statistics presented in the

previous sections: the availability of Medicaid seems to completely crowd out the presence of

employer-sponsored insurance in the sample of disadvantaged immigrants most affected by

welfare reform.

        The second column of the table estimates the second-stage regression using an alternative

dependent variable, the probability that the typical person in cell k has some type of health

insurance coverage. This coefficient is numerically close to zero and statistically insignificant

(the coefficient is -.25, with a standard error of .60). The results, therefore, indicate that a

cutback in the probability of receiving Medicaid generates a completely offsetting increase in the

probability that a person is covered by employer-sponsored insurance, thereby leaving

unchanged the probability that the person has some type of health insurance coverage.

        The remaining rows of Table 8 re-estimate the regression models using alternative

definitions for the vector I. As noted earlier, the citizenship status of a person may be partly

endogenous, as many immigrants become naturalized citizens to escape the impact of the

PRWORA cutbacks. One simple solution to this problem is to use the immigrant’s year of arrival

in the United State to define the various groups. In the second row, the dummy variables in the

vector I indicate if a person is native, has lived in the United States for more than 10 years, has

lived in the United States for fewer than 10 years, or is a refugee. The coefficient δ reported in
                                                          29

the first column is -1.01 (.87). Moreover, note that the coefficient is .28 (.74) in the second

column, where the dependent variable is the probability of being covered by some type of health

insurance. Therefore, there seems to be a negative structural relation between the probability of

receiving Medicaid and the probability of having some type of health insurance coverage, again

suggesting a strong crowdout effect.

         Finally, row 3 of Table 8 estimates the regression model using only the information on

whether a person is native-born, refugee, or non-refugee to define the variables in the vector I.

Although the coefficients now have larger standard errors, the point estimates are consistent with

the overall story. The impact of the probability of receiving Medicaid on the probability of being

covered by employer-sponsored insurance is -1.35 (1.33), while the impact of Medicaid on the

probability of being covered by some type of health insurance coverage is .11 (.87).

         The bottom panel of the table reports the IV coefficients from the regressions estimated

in the sample of children.25 These coefficients tend to be quite similar to those reported in the

sample of all persons. For example, the two coefficients in the specification presented in row 1,

where the vector I uses information on the citizenship status of the head of the household to

classify the children in the household, are -.98 (.98) in the ESI coverage regression and .12 (.73)

in the health insurance coverage regression. The evidence, therefore, suggests a crowdout effect

of Medicaid on privately provided insurance among the children of the targeted immigrants.

         Before concluding, it is worth emphasizing that there is an important conceptual

difference between the estimates of the crowdout effect reported in this paper and those reported

in the existing literature. The welfare reform legislation changed the eligibility rules for



          25 To avoid having many cells in the children sample that have a small number of observations, the
construction of the cells does not differentiate between the two gender groups. A cell is then defined by immigration
status, state of residence, and time period. I control for gender by including a variable indicating the fraction of the
observations in the cell that are boys as a regressor in the first- and second-stage models.

immigrants in many public assistance programs. As a result, this study addresses a question that

is related to, but different from, the question usually addressed in the crowdout literature. In

particular, existing studies attempt to determine if increased availability of publicly provided

health insurance encourages persons to leave the private insurance system and enroll in

Medicaid. In contrast, my analysis examines if generalized cutbacks in public assistance

encourage individuals to alter their behavior along many margins, particularly labor supply. My

evidence indicates that the net outcome of all of these responses is a substantial increase in the

probability that individuals are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance. It should not

then be surprising that my estimates of the crowdout effect are larger than the estimates found in

the existing literature.

        Although it would be of great interest to isolate the contribution of the cutbacks in the

various public assistance programs to the estimated crowdout effect, such an analysis is

empirically difficult because there is a great deal of “jointness” in program participation: 94.0

percent of persons who receive cash benefits and 67.1 percent of those who receive food stamps

are also enrolled in Medicaid. As a result, it is unlikely that the immigrant restrictions in

PRWORA can help identify the separate effects.




VI. Summary

        The 1996 welfare reform legislation contained a number of provisions that greatly limited

the eligibility of many immigrants (particularly non-citizens and non-refugees) to receive many

types of public assistance. In response to the federal legislation, many states chose to protect

their immigrant populations from the presumed adverse impact of PRWORA by offering state-

funded assistance to these groups.
                                                  31

        I use data drawn from the 1995-2001 Annual Demographic Supplements of the Current

Population Surveys to examine the relation between the immigrant-related provisions in

PRWORA—as modified by the subsequent state responses—and health insurance coverage in

the immigrant population. In the absence of any behavioral response, one would have expected

that health insurance coverage rates would have been sharply curtailed in the population most

adversely affected by the restrictions, the non-citizens living in states that did not offer state-

funded assistance to their immigrant populations. In other words, as the Medicaid cutbacks took

effect, the proportion of those immigrants covered by some type of health insurance should have

declined.

        The empirical analysis indeed indicates that the targeted immigrant population

experienced a decline in Medicaid coverage as the PRWORA provisions took effect. However,

the analysis also reveals that the expected decline in health insurance coverage rates did not

materialize. If anything, health insurance coverage rates actually rose slightly in this group.

        The resolution to this conflicting evidence lies in the fact that the affected immigrants

responded to the welfare cutbacks. The immigrants most likely to be adversely affected by the

new restrictions significantly increased their labor supply, thereby raising their probability of

being covered by employer-sponsored insurance. In fact, this increase in the probability of

coverage through employer-sponsored insurance was large enough to completely offset the

Medicaid cutbacks. The empirical analysis, therefore, provides strong evidence of a sizable

crowdout effect of publicly provided health insurance among immigrants. In an important sense,

the state programs were unnecessary. In the absence of these programs, the targeted immigrants

themselves would have taken actions to reduce the probability that they would be left without

health insurance coverage.

Notes: Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are clustered by state-immigration status groups. The “All
persons” sample has 593,763 observations; the “children” sample has 194,422 observations. All regressions control
for the age, race, gender, and educational attainment of the household head; the total number of persons, children,
elderly persons, and disabled persons in the household; a vector of dummy variables indicating the household’s year
of arrival in the United States (if immigrant); a dummy variable indicating if the household head is a refugee; the
state’s unemployment rate in the particular survey year; and all interactions between the unemployment rate, the
period fixed effect, and the vector of dummy variables indicating the person’s immigration status (i.e., native,
citizen, or non-citizen). The “state fixed effects, with interactions” include a vector of state fixed effects interacted
with the dummy variable indicating if the observation was drawn from the post-1996 period. The state fixed effects
are also interacted with the dummy variables that indicate the person’s immigration status.

Notes: Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are clustered by state-immigration status groups. There are
196,859 observations in the male regressions estimated in the top two panels; and 174,431 observations in the male
regressions estimated in the bottom two panels. There are 210,684 observations in the female regressions estimated
in the top two panels; and 159,163 observations in the female regressions estimated in the bottom two panels. All
regressions control for the age, race, gender, and educational attainment of the household head; the total number of
persons, children, elderly persons, and disabled persons in the household; a vector of dummy variables indicating the
household’s year of arrival in the United States (if immigrant); a dummy variable indicating if the household head is
a refugee; the state’s unemployment rate in the particular survey year; and all interactions between the
unemployment rate, the period fixed effect, and the vector of dummy variables indicating the person’s immigration
status (i.e., native, citizen, or non-citizen). The “state fixed effects, with interactions” include a vector of state fixed
effects interacted with the dummy variable indicating if the observation was drawn from the post-1996 period. The
state fixed effects are also interacted with the dummy variables that indicate the person’s immigration status.

Notes: Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are clustered by state-immigration status groups. In the “all
persons” sample, the regressions reported in rows 1 and 2 have 784 observations, while the regressions reported in
row 3 have 600 observations. In the children sample, the regressions reported in rows 1 and 2 have 377
observations, while the regressions reported in row 3 have 289 observations. All regressions control for the age,
race, gender, and educational attainment of the household head; the total number of persons, children, elderly
persons, and disabled persons in the household; a vector of dummy variables indicating the household’s year of
arrival in the United States (if immigrant); a dummy variable indicating if the household head is a refugee; the
state’s unemployment rate in the particular survey year; and all interactions between the unemployment rate, the
period fixed effect, and the vector of dummy variables indicating the person’s immigration status (i.e., native,
citizen, or non-citizen). The regressions also include a vector of state fixed effects interacted with the dummy
variable indicating if the observation was drawn from the post-1996 period. The state fixed effects are also
interacted with the dummy variables that indicate the person’s immigration status classification. All regressions are
weighted by the sample size of the cell.
